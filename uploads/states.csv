Since 2020, Alabama has paid settlements in at least 124 lawsuits filed against correctional officers in the state’s overcrowded and violent prison system.
But the legal bills for defending the officers have far outpaced what incarcerated people and their families have received in settlements.
A review of data obtained from the state Department of Finance on yearly transactions from the General Liability Trust Fund between 2020 and 2024 found legal expenses associated with defending Alabama Department of Corrections (ADOC) officers accused of excessive force and failure to protect prisoners from harm or death amounted to $12.9 million.

May 19: The Alabama Department of Corrections has settled over 90 lawsuits alleging corrections officers used excessive force, costing the state millions of dollars.
May 20: Even as the prison population has declined, use of force incidents in Alabama’s prisons have soared, and some corrections officers named in lawsuits alleging excessive force have not only held onto jobs, but been promoted.
May 21: The anatomy of one inmate’s allegations against a corrections officer, and the aftermath.
May 22: Who’s paying for these settlements? You are. Who’s getting the most money from this litigation? Attorneys defending corrections officers.


Settlement payments totaled $4.4 million in the same time period. ADOC’s total use of the trust fund since 2020 was over $17 million, by far the most of any state agency.
“The General Liability Trust Fund certainly expends more resources for ADOC than any other agency,” Daryl Masters, an assistant attorney general with the Department of Finance, wrote in an email, adding that Alabama’s Department of Human Resources, the Alabama Law Enforcement Agency and the Alabama Department of Public Health follow ADOC in terms of costs.
Between these individual complaints, plus defending ADOC in several class-action cases and the U.S. Department of Justice’s lawsuit over prison conditions, ADOC has spent over $57 million on legal expenses since 2020. State records on Alabama Checkbook report that the majority of the money comes out of the General Fund.
The Attorney General’s office represents ADOC, and directs the defense of state employees who are sued on the job. In 2023, Alabama Attorney General Steve Marshall stripped ADOC’s legal staff of its ability to represent ADOC employees in legal matters.
The Attorney General’s Office did not respond to multiple requests for comment.

When ADOC employees are sued, they are now represented either by attorneys from the AG’s Office, or increasingly, by private lawyers hired by the AG’s Office through contracts that do not require a formal competitive bidding process.
The AG’s Office must inform the Joint Legislative Contract Review Committee, which meets once a month, about the contracts. The committee can place a 45-day hold on a contract but cannot permanently block or prevent a legal services contract from going through.
Some members of the committee have expressed concern over ADOC’s increasing use of outside attorneys and the mounting costs of litigation.
“It’s fair to ask, how long is this supposed to go on?” said Rep. Chris England, D-Tuscaloosa. “Are we ever going to get out from underneath this stuff? What kind of statement does it make about our prison system that all these cases are filed and we never hear about results?”
Attorneys who represent plaintiffs suing officers with the Department of Corrections cannot directly bill the liability trust fund for their legal services. Some represent clients at no charge as pro bono work, or others establish an agreement with the client to collect payment through a percentage of any settlement.
Several attorneys who have represented prisoners said the process has become increasingly adversarial as more outside lawyers represent correctional staff and drag litigation out.
“Using outside law firms billing by the hour can make the GLTF (liability trust fund) more of a pot of gold for law firms than a fund to compensate victims,” said Hank Sherrod, who has represented incarcerated people and their families in civil litigation against officers. “These outside attorneys have every incentive to bill the shit out of the fund and sometimes do, getting paid hundreds of thousands of dollars and depleting the fund.”

Wrongful deaths and failure to protect

The vast majority of lawsuits in this time frame involved claims of excessive force, but cases connected to sexual assaults and deaths from violence have proven much costlier to the department, both in legal expenses and settlement amounts.
Some of the wrongful death and failure to protect complaints contain details of horrific assaults.

2019 sexual assault at Bullock Correctional Facility. According to the complaint, the plaintiff was placed in a dorm with a man who had threatened him. The plaintiff said that he informed the warden that he was in danger, and the warden laughed at him. Another officer allegedly told the plaintiff, “maybe they will kill your retarded cracker ass.” The plaintiff was later dragged to his bunk and raped by the man who had threatened him. He reported the assault and was taken to an outside facility for treatment where the rape was confirmed. ADOC then brought him back to Bullock and placed him in the same dorm with the same assailant, who raped the victim a second time. According to a lawsuit, the victim “suffers from post traumatic stress disorder, chronic depression, rips and tears in rectum, scars from stabbing, scarred pupil from assault, hearing loss from being kicked in his right ear, chronic pain, flashbacks, embarrassment, blood clots, passing blood clots, nightmares, has been required to undergo surgery and mental health treatment. He continues to fear for his life.” A settlement payment for $10,621.70 in this case was issued in March 2024.
2017 killing of Joseph Wood at St. Clair Correctional Facility two months after he arrived at the prison. The complaint was originally filed by Wood’s mother, who wrote that other prisoners were extorting her son inside the prison, and he was afraid officers were involved. “No one has ever told me who was responsible for killing my son,” she wrote. “I learned the most about his death after ADOC released the body to me for burial. I saw that he had been beaten, stabbed and strangled. The Department of Corrections failed to protect my son… I would like them to be held accountable for my loss and how they’ve treated my family.” After five years of litigation, a settlement payment was issued in 2024 for $125,000. Attorneys representing ADOC officers and staff named in the lawsuit collected over $400,000 for their legal work defending the officers.

The largest settlement amount from the last five years came from a wrongful death lawsuit filed by the mother of 28-year-old Travis Sessions, who died from bronchopneumonia, or inflammation of the lungs, while incarcerated at Red Eagle Community Work Center in 2018.
The complaint stated Sessions was sick for days with worsening symptoms, experiencing shortness of breath and coughing up blood, but at least three officers ignored his requests for help for days, until he was dying.
“He basically drowned in his own blood when Red Eagle personnel refused to get (him) the medical help he needed,” the complaint stated.
Attorneys representing the three officers in the lawsuit authorized a $600,000 settlement payment to a lawyer representing the man’s family, effectively ending the lawsuit. The family received half of the settlement, and the attorney received the other half.
The Sessions litigation lasted over 22 months, with lawyers from the Attorney General’s Office representing the named officers. But other complaints that attributed deaths or assaults to prison understaffing led to more protracted litigation and higher legal expenses.










He basically drowned in his own blood when Red Eagle personnel refused to get (him) the medical help he needed.


– Lawsuit over death of Travis Sessions


One such case was filed by the mother of 29-year-old Terry Pettiway, who was stabbed to death by another prisoner at St. Clair Correctional Facility in 2018. Attorneys from two firms, Sidley Austin LLP in New York, and White Arnold & Dowd P.C. in Birmingham, agreed to represent the mother at no charge, and filed the complaint in 2020.
According to the complaint, Pettiway was repeatedly stabbed in the back and neck after trying to break up a fight, and “left to bleed out while the housing block and the common areas around it were effectively left completely unattended by prison staff.” Fellow prisoners attempted CPR but were unsuccessful, according to the complaint.
The complaint accused 13 prison officers, supervisors and ADOC commissioners of enabling Pettiway’s killing “by their reckless or intentional failures to take actions to reasonably protect from violence.” The complaint also alleged that on the day of Pettiway’s death, a single prison guard was responsible for supervising a general population yard, in use by prisoners from eight separate cell blocks. The guard was unaware of the fight that Pettiway tried to break up, and when Pettiway was stabbed 14 to 17 times, “the guards were nowhere to be found.”
The Attorney General’s Office hired private attorneys to defend the ADOC employees in the lawsuit over Pettiway’s death. After more than two years of litigation, ADOC settled the case in 2023 for $250,000.
But according to Alabama Department of Finance data, the state spent $502,930 on legal bills from two law firms hired to represent the ADOC defendants, Maynard Nexsen PC in Huntsville and Capell & Howard PC in Montgomery.
Masters said the state’s Division of Risk Management encourages parties to settle a case as early as they can, but that’s not always possible. Masters acknowledged that ADOC’s use of the trust fund has gone up in recent years, but did not provide details about any actions Risk Management has taken to prevent future complaints in ADOC, saying those discussions would be considered privileged.
“The agencies themselves are the ones who are responsible for dealing with any particular type of claim,” he continued. “It would be up to them to make some change or do what they could, within the confines of their own responsibilities, to make corrections or changes to cause those numbers to go down.”
When asked what, if any, corrective actions have been taken inside the prisons to prevent future complaints, ADOC spokesperson Kelly Betts provided few details.
“It varies depending on the incident,” Betts wrote. “ADOC follows the corrective action policies listed in the Administrative Regulations.”

Transparency and accountability

Alabama’s General Liability Trust Fund is a public resource, funded with taxpayer dollars, although not under the same level of scrutiny as the state’s General Fund budget. The Alabama Attorney General’s Office and the Division of Risk Management make the decisions about how to use the fund, on behalf of the public.
Beginning in 2022, ADOC has been required by law to publish active litigation in its quarterly statistical reports. The reports indicate the number of complaints filed against ADOC continues to increase — 199 new lawsuits were filed in 2024, the highest annual number since the agency began publishing the information in 2022. Previous quarterly statistical reports showed 149 new complaints filed in 2023, and 128 in 2022.
But the information published in these quarterly reports — name of lawsuit, date filed, case number — tells a limited story. The reports do not include the allegations, the nature of the lawsuits, the names of officers or the extent of the alleged injuries.
Another deficient aspect is ADOC’s own accounting of legal expenses in these reports. The prison transparency law requires ADOC to include the amount paid to defend litigation against the department, but a review of all available ADOC quarterly statistical reports found no such figures on legal spending.
Under costs, the reports include the same entry for every lawsuit— “$0 – all monies paid to defend are paid by the Department of Finance, Division of Risk Management, via the coverage provided to State employees through the General Liability Trust Fund.”
What the reports don’t say is that ADOC’s premiums to participate in the trust fund have tripled in the last decade, from $1.1 million in 2015 to $4.4 million in 2024, according to data provided by the Department of Finance. ADOC’s rate increase has occurred while the agency’s overall staff has shrunk by 20%.

All state agencies pay an annual fee to the trust fund, and this participation rate is determined by the Department of Finance, which bases it on the number of covered employees, and also an evaluation of each agency’s use of the fund and number of claims year to year, Masters said. ADOC’s rate increase has occurred despite the decrease in staffing in Alabama prisons.
The decisions on how to use money from the liability trust fund include whether to settle lawsuits against ADOC officers, for how much, and also the choice to defend officers accused of excessive force, sometimes through years of litigation.
Richard Rice, an attorney based in Birmingham who has represented incarcerated people in excessive force lawsuits, questioned the ethics of such decisions when the allegations in the 124 complaints the state has settled are so widespread and damning.
“Are you complicit in perpetuating this type of behavior when it’s such an ongoing pattern, and you’re defending them at all costs?” he asked. “Our common values tell us this type of behavior is reprehensible. How do we not have those same common values for prisoners?”

(Photo Illustration by Spencer Platt/Getty Images)Tens of thousands of Nevadans could pay less each month for insulin if lawmakers approve a proposed out-of-pocket cap on commercial insurance plans, according to the state Division of Insurance.
Assembly Bill 555, sponsored by Speaker Steve Yeager, would prohibit private insurance companies from charging people more than $35 for a 30-day supply of a prescription insulin drug. The Senate and Assembly committees on commerce and labor in a joint meeting heard the bill Wednesday and immediately advanced it.
Currently, no such cap on out-of-pocket insulin costs exists for private insurance companies, resulting in “outrageous and unpredictable” prices for many Nevadans, according to Yeager. The Las Vegas Democrat told the committee he has heard of people paying up to $500 per month for insulin.
Adam Plain from the Nevada Division of Insurance estimated there could be 70,000 Nevadans who have diabetes and are on private insurance plans regulated by the state. Private insurance makes up 18.6% of health care plans in the state, he said. Just under 11% of the adult population in the state has diagnosed diabetes, according to the American Diabetes Association.
More broadly, the association estimated that nearly 270,000 people in Nevada have been diagnosed diabetic and an additional 70,000 have it but haven’t been diagnosed.
Twenty-six states, as well as the District of Columbia, have capped out-of-pocket insulin costs for commercial insurance plans, according to the association. Caps range from $25 in Connecticut to $100 bucks in Alabama and Delaware for a 30-day supply.
With AB 555, Nevada policy would align with President Joe Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act, which established a $35 out-of-pocket insulin cost cap for people on Medicare.
Yeager referenced research finding that the number of fulfilled insulin prescriptions rose after the cap provision went into effect, suggesting that fewer people are skipping or rationing their medications because of their high costs.
Yeager called his legislation a “partial answer” and acknowledged it would not help uninsured cash payers. The legislation also does not affect health care plans offered by public employers.
During the hearing, Republican state Sen. John Ellison of Elko commented that President Donald Trump recently said he would lower the cost of all prescriptions.
“I thought that was so amazing,” Ellison added.
Trump signed an executive order on May 12 aimed at lowering drug prices by pressuring pharmaceutical companies to align their U.S. pricing models with those in similarly wealthy countries. It has been panned by Democrats as unserious.
Yeager did not comment on the executive order but said he generally “would be all for” any federal action that goes beyond what he is proposing at the state level. At the same time, “there is no reason” Nevada shouldn’t do what it can while it can, he argued.
AB 555 will provide financial relief to Nevadans feeling the effects of “disastrous economic policies at the national level,” he’d said at an earlier point in the hearing, an obvious dig at Trump. “It is incumbent on us at the state level to find solutions for them.”
Groups supporting AB 555 include the Nevada State Medical Association, Nevada Women’s Lobby, Retail Association of Nevada, and Battle Born Progress.
The bill’s only public opposition came from Americans for Prosperity, which believes the bill would interfere with “the natural price mechanisms of the market” and comes with the risk of “creating a cascade of unintended consequences.”
The Nevada Association of Health Plans has taken a neutral position on the bill, but lobbyist Shelly Capurro said some of its 11 members had concerns about unintended consequences.
After the hearing, during the meeting’s general public comment period, Plain, the insurance regulation liaison for the state, addressed lawmakers  as a private individual with diabetes. He thanked them for taking on the subject.
He said that with the “pretty good insurance” he gets as a state employee he pays $320 for a 90-day supply of insulin and three other medications, pen needles, and glucose monitoring.
“The list price for those four meds is $4,000 for a 90-day supply,” he added.
Another Nevadan, Lisa Lynn Chapman, testified that when she first started taking insulin for her Type-2 diabetes, her needles and insulin were free. Then, her employer changed insurance and “suddenly, my two different insulins cost $60 each, and my needles were $35 a month.”
The cost, she added, was difficult to absorb.
High costs are not what the three men who discovered and secured the patent rights for insulin wanted, Yeager told the joint committee in his closing. One of them, Frederick Banting, is famously quoted as saying, “Insulin does not belong to me. It belongs to the world.”
They sold their patents for $1 each to the University of Toronto in 1923. 
“Somehow we are here in the year 2025 and people are paying $500 a month for something that was assigned patent rights for a dollar over a hundred years ago,” said Yeager. “To me that is not and never will be acceptable.”",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/GettyImages-1470812515-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-22 08:04:19.549961

Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo is one of only a few Republican governors who didn’t sign a letter sent to Donald Trump offering heaping praise and “united” support of Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill.”
House Republicans early Thursday passed their version the massive budget reconciliation bill that would slash Medicaid, food assistance and other programs while extending 2017 tax cuts and increasing spending on immigration enforcement. 
The Republican Governors Association announced 20 governors around the country signed onto a letter May 20 offering “strong support” for the bill.
Lombardo didn’t respond to requests for comment on why he didn’t sign the letter.
Republican governors from Florida, New Hampshire, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Dakota and Vermont also didn’t sign the letter.
In the letter, governors assured Trump the “landmark piece of legislation embodies your powerful vision to bring about the next great American revival.” 
“It truly delivers on the bold promises all Republicans made to the American people to restore the security, prosperity, and fiscal sanity for our nation,” they wrote.
The governors praised the proposed significant increase in spending on deportation and $150 billion in new money for defense and national security. 
The governors declined to mention the significant cuts being proposed in the bill, including reducing food aid by $267 billion over 10 years and Medicaid spending $700 billion Nor did they note that the Congressional Budget Office projects Trump’s tax cuts will add $3.8 trillion to the national debt over a decade.
Trump’s budget request also proposed $33 billion from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, which social services providers and local officials warn would devastate Nevada.

Maj. Josh Heinen, from the Kansas City Police Department fiscal division, responded that the $3.5 million the department budgeted for legal settlements was “a reasonable amount”[...]","A Kansas City police van sits outside a patrol station on Linwood Boulevard (Allison Kite/Missouri Independent).At the end of February, during a public budget hearing, Kansas City Mayor Quinton Lucas asked the police department whether it had requested enough money to manage lawsuit expenses.
Maj. Josh Heinen, from the Kansas City Police Department fiscal division, responded that the $3.5 million the department budgeted for legal settlements was “a reasonable amount” for this year.
So the Kansas City Council voted to approve the department’s $343 million budget, which set aside $3.5 million for settlements.
The council didn’t know then that two months later, KCPD would announce two lawsuit settlements that were five times the amount the department budgeted for — totaling $18.1 million.
Lucas believes that KCPD leaders knew during the budget process that expenses of that size were possible but chose not to disclose them.
When councilmembers and city staff read about the settlements in the news, they were worried that KCPD would be back to ask for more money to cover that unexpected expense.
But Capt. Jacob Becchina, a spokesman for KCPD, told The Beacon in an email that the department plans to pay the settlements out of its own general fund. It won’t affect personnel, he said, but it could cut contracts and equipment for the next fiscal year.
Members of the City Council — including Lucas — are not happy that the $18.1 million expense was never disclosed when the city was laying out the $343 million police budget for this year.
“It makes anyone who’s sitting here in government-land say, ‘What the hell are we doing here?’” Lucas told The Beacon.
 How KCPD pays for lawsuit settlements

Unlike nearly every other major city in the United States, Kansas City does not have control over its own police department. Instead, the police are governed by a five-member Board of Police Commissioners, which includes the mayor of Kansas City and four people appointed by the governor.
The City Council is required to give KCPD a quarter of its annual budget, which the department has near-exclusive authority to spend as it pleases. Lucas, who sits on the police board, and other top city leaders have unanswered questions about how that money gets spent.
KCPD maintains a “Self-Retention General Subsidiary Fund” that it uses to pay legal settlements when they come up. Money in that fund comes from a few sources. In this year’s budget, $2.5 million was allocated to that fund by the City Council. Another $1 million came from the state of Missouri.
Lucas has called on the state to contribute more for lawsuit settlements given the governor’s oversight of the police board. He called the current $1 million yearly contribution “woefully inadequate.”
The finer details of that lawsuit fund are tough to find. When The Beacon submitted a records request in 2022 to understand why that fund had $5.6 million in accounting inaccuracies over the previous 10 years, KCPD asked for $1,700 in research fees.
On April 22, the department agreed to pay $4.1 million to the family of Cameron Lamb, a Black man shot to death in 2019 by a KCPD detective. One week later, the department announced that it would pay another $14 million to settle a lawsuit filed by Ricky Kidd, a man who was incarcerated for 23 years for a murder he did not commit.
This year’s $18.1 million in lawsuit settlements are far more than the $3.5 million in that fund. If the City Council had known the expenses were coming, Lucas argues, it could have helped KCPD plan around them.
But instead, the police board voted to approve a budget that would need to be revised.
That money will not be paid out all at once. The $14 million settlement with Kidd will be paid out over the next four years. If Kidd’s settlement is divided evenly, that puts this year’s bill at $3.5 million, plus another $4.1 million to the family of Lamb, totaling $7.6 million.
 KCPD will not ask the City Council for more money — this time

When legal settlements exceed the money in its self-retention fund, KCPD has a couple options to make the payments.
One option is for KCPD to ask the City Council to take money out of the city’s budget to help pay for the settlements. That’s what KCPD has done in the past.
“If they did that,” said Assistant City Manager Melissa Kozakiewicz, “then they’re coming before the council to say, ‘Can you pay this amount?’ And the council then can say ‘yes’ or ‘no.’”
By way of comparison, this year’s estimated cost for the police’s recent legal settlements approaches the $8.5 million that Kansas City spent to distribute 162,000 trash carts last year.
The other option is for KCPD to pay the settlement entirely out of its own budget. That’s the route that department is taking in this case.
That means transferring money from other parts of the police budget, such as equipment, consulting fees or building repairs.
 Council was never told that an $18.1 million expense could be coming

Many city officials expected KCPD to ask the City Council to cover most, if not all, of the $18.1 million legal bill stemming from the Lamb and Kidd settlements. It came as a surprise when they learned from The Beacon that wouldn’t be the case.
City officials including Lucas and Councilman Johnathan Duncan have grown frustrated that KCPD does not treat the council or city staff as partners in navigating substantial budget decisions like recent lawsuit settlements.
KCPD plans to pull that money from the general fund, which totals $299 million for this fiscal year. Excluding personnel costs, which Becchina said will not be used for the settlements, there is only $23 million available in the general fund.
Lucas said he was frustrated that KCPD leadership chose not to be forthcoming with city officials when they outlined their budget two months before the settlements were announced.
A lawyer himself, Lucas has taught courses on this subject at the University of Kansas Law School.
“Hell, I’ll go on the record as your lawyer expert on this,” Lucas said. “You don’t settle a $14 million case in one day.”
When cases like this are filed — in this case, several years ago — there’s often a settlement demand from the start, he said. The defendant (in this case, KCPD) was probably told years ago that if they paid that sum, the plaintiff was willing to settle out of court.
“If Disney is facing a $1 billion dollar suit from the Trump administration,” he said. “No matter how valid it is or not, you put that in your list of things that could have some material impact on what’s going on.”
As the court date got closer, Lucas said, the lawyers — and leadership at the police department itself — would have been fully aware by February that a lawsuit settlement of this size was not only possible, but likely.
“You don’t have to speculate,” he said, “to at least know that there was someone in leadership, and perhaps many someones … knew that there was high potential that this would have an impact in this fiscal year.”
Becchina, from KCPD, declined to make Chief Stacey Graves available to comment on this story.
Duncan, who represents the 6th District in southwestern Kansas City on the City Council, said he learned about the police settlements the same way everyone else did — by reading it in the news.
The same goes for Kozakiewicz and other staff at City Hall, including the people in charge of the budget.
 Who’s actually being held accountable?

Over the past several years, Lucas has encouraged the other members of the police board to look into a liability insurance policy for the department.
That insurance, he said, would make the cost of litigation less burdensome for KCPD and City Hall.
The board has researched policies, but Lucas said that the department has cited a $5 million deductible as a reason not to obtain liability insurance. But in the past several years, Lucas said, police settlements have become more and more expensive, and the department has exceeded that amount.
This year’s $14 million settlement with Ricky Kidd was $1 million away from breaking the city’s record for its most expensive lawsuit settlement ever.
If the police department had liability insurance, even with a $5 million deductible, it would have already saved Kansas City taxpayers millions of dollars this year.
In a statement, the Board of Police Commissioners wrote that the $14 million settlement with Ricky Kidd was a rational decision.
“The Board of Police Commissioners of Kansas City, Missouri and Ricky Kidd have amicably resolved the ongoing litigation between Mr. Kidd and the Board for $14 million, payable over the next four fiscal years,” the board said in the statement. “The board resolved this litigation out of a desire to avoid the expense, uncertainty and risk of litigation, and the resolution of the matter is not an admission of liability or wrongdoing by anyone.”
The statement went on to say that the board “takes seriously its obligation to manage litigation in a way that serves not only the interests of the Kansas City Police Department, but, most importantly, those of the community it serves. This resolution is no different. Mr. Kidd’s lawsuit involved former personnel and events of nearly 30 years ago. The Department will take the benefit of the lessons learned throughout the course of this litigation and embed those lessons in its ongoing and continuous efforts to ensure Kansas Citians receive the highest level of police service. The board appreciates Mr. Kidd’s reasoned and sincere efforts in arriving at this resolution and wishes him and his family well.”
 Concerns with transparency

Duncan said the latest lawsuit settlement saga is emblematic of his long-standing frustrations with the police department.
“The fact that we do not manage KCPD leaves us in an untenable position,” he said, “where we are liable for any mistakes they make or any lawsuits that arise due to their conduct or misconduct. And we have absolutely zero authority to actively look to correct their practices and procedures.”
And the lack of transparency when these issues arise makes it even more difficult to find a path forward, he said.
“I often feel like the city is held hostage by KCPD,” he said, “in terms of the fact that we are … not made an active partner — not for lack of trying — in how to curb future litigation.”
Lucas said that the system of state control, where all of the police policies and procedures are set by an unelected board appointed by the governor, means the city is unable to hold KCPD accountable for the money that lawsuit settlements cost the taxpayers every year.
The biggest challenge with the police, he said, is a lack of accountability — not just to the taxpayers of Kansas City, but “really their lack of accountability to anyone.”
“We settled the case with Cameron Lamb, right?” he said. “What’s changed? What is the new step that people take? Is there any new discussion? Is there any new thing about how you de-escalate? Is there anything on it at all? Regrettably, at least in terms of what becomes publicly known, there is not.”

Puskar)In submitting her updated budget proposal in March, Arizona Gov. Katie Hobbs lamented the rising costs of the state’s school vouchers program that directs public dollars to pay private school tuition.
Characterizing vouchers as an “entitlement program,” Hobbs said the state could spend more than $1 billion subsidizing private education in the upcoming fiscal year. The Democratic governor said those expenses could crowd out other budget priorities, including disability programs and pay raises for firefighters and state troopers.
It’s a dilemma that some budget experts fear will become more common nationwide as the costs of school choice measures mount across the states, reaching billions of dollars each year.
“School vouchers are increasingly eating up state budgets in a way that I don’t think is sustainable long term,” said Whitney Tucker, director of state fiscal policy research at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a think tank that advocates for left-leaning tax policies.
Vouchers and scholarship programs, which use taxpayer money to cover private school tuition, are part of the wider school choice movement that also includes charter schools and other alternatives to public schools.
Opponents have long warned about vouchers draining resources from public education as students move from public schools to private ones. But research into several programs has shown many voucher recipients already were enrolled in private schools. That means universal vouchers could drive up costs by creating two parallel education systems — both funded by taxpayers.
North Dakota House kills final Education Savings Account bill of session

In Arizona, state officials reported most private school students receiving vouchers in the first two years of the expanded program were not previously enrolled in public schools. In fiscal year 2024, more than half the state’s 75,000 voucher recipients were previously enrolled in private schools or were being homeschooled.
“Vouchers don’t shift costs — they add costs,” Joshua Cowen, a professor of education policy at Michigan State University who studies the issue, recently told Stateline. “Most voucher recipients were already in private schools, meaning states are paying for education they previously didn’t have to fund.”
Voucher proponents, though, say those figures can be misleading. Arizona, like other states with recent expansions, previously had more modest voucher programs. So some kids who were already enrolled in private schools could have already been receiving state subsidies.
In addition to increasing competition, supporters say the programs can actually save taxpayer dollars by delivering education at a lower overall cost than traditional public schools.
One thing is certain: With a record number of students receiving subsidies to attend private schools, vouchers are quickly creating budget concerns for some state leaders.
The rising costs of school choice measures come after years of deep cuts to income taxes in many states, leaving them with less money to spend. An end of pandemic-era aid and potential looming cuts to federal support also have created widespread uncertainty about state budgets.
“We’re seeing a number of things that are creating a sort of perfect storm from a fiscal perspective in the states,” said Tucker, of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.
Last year, Arizona leaders waded through an estimated $1.3 billion budget shortfall. Budget experts said the voucher program was responsible for hundreds of millions of that deficit.
A new universal voucher program in Texas is expected to cost $1 billion over its next two-year budget cycle — a figure that could balloon to nearly $5 billion by 2030, according to a legislative fiscal note.
Earlier this year, Wyoming Republican Gov. Mark Gordon signed a bill expanding the state’s voucher program. But last week, he acknowledged his own “substantial concerns” about the state’s ability to fund vouchers and its public education obligations under the constitution.
“I think the legislature’s got a very tall task to understand how they’re going to be able to fund all of these things,” he said in an interview with WyoFile.
Voucher proponents, who have been active at the state level for years, are gaining new momentum with support from President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans.
In January, Trump ordered federal agencies to allow states, tribes and military families to access federal money for private K-12 education through education savings accounts, voucher programs or tax credits.
Last week, Republicans on the House Ways and Means Committee voted in favor of making $20 billion available over the next four years for a federal school voucher program. Part of broader work on a bill to extend Trump’s 2017 tax cuts, the measure would need a simple majority in the House and the Senate to pass.
Armstrong vetoes North Dakota private school voucher bill, but signals support for competing bill

Martin Lueken, the director of the Fiscal Research and Education Center at EdChoice, a nonprofit that advocates for school choice measures, argues school choice measures can actually deliver savings to taxpayers.
Lueken said vouchers are not to blame for state budget woes. He said public school systems for years have increased spending faster than inflation. And he noted that school choice measures make up a small share of overall state spending — nationally about 0.3% of total state expenditures in states with school choice, he said.
“Public schooling remains one of the largest line items in state budgets,” he said in an interview. “They are still the dominant provider of K-12 education, and certainly looking at the education pie, they still receive the lion’s share.
“It’s not a choice problem. I would say that it’s a problem with the status quo and the public school system,” he said.
Washington, D.C., and 35 states offer some school choice programs, according to EdChoice. That includes 18 states with voucher programs so expansive that virtually all students can participate regardless of income.
But Lueken said framing vouchers as a new entitlement program is misleading. That’s because all students, even the wealthiest, have always been entitled to a public education — whether they’ve chosen to attend free public schools or private ones that charge tuition.
“At the end of the day, the thing that matters most above dollars are students and families,” he said. “Research is clear that competition works. Public schools have responded in very positive ways when they are faced with increased competitive pressure from choice programs.”
Public school advocates say funding both private and public schools is untenable.
In Wisconsin, Republican lawmakers are considering a major voucher expansion that would alter the funding structure for vouchers, potentially putting more strain on the state’s general fund.
The state spent about $629 million on its four voucher programs during the 2024-2025 school year, according to the Wisconsin Association of School Business Officials, which represents employees in school district finance, human resources and leadership.
The association warns proposed legislation could exacerbate problems with the “unaffordable parallel school systems” in place now by shifting more private schooling costs from parents of those students to state taxpayers at large.
Such expansion “could create the conditions for even greater funding challenges for Wisconsin’s traditional public schools and the state budget as a whole,” the association’s research director wrote in a paper on the issue.
U.S. House Republican plan would force states to pay for a portion of SNAP benefits

In Arizona, Hobbs originally sought to eliminate the universal voucher program — a nonstarter in the Republican-controlled legislature. She has since proposed shrinking the program by placing income limits that would disqualify the state’s wealthiest families.
That idea also faced Republican opposition.
Legislators are now pushing to enshrine access to vouchers in the state constitution.
Marisol Garcia, president of the Arizona Education Association, the state’s 20,000-member teachers union, noted that vouchers and public education funds are both sourced from the general fund.
“So it almost immediately started to impact public services,” she said of the universal voucher program.
While the union says vouchers have led to cutbacks of important resources such as counselors in public schools, Garcia said the sweeping program also affects the state’s ability to fund other services like housing, transportation and health care.
“Every budget cycle becomes where can we cut in order to essentially feed this out-of-control program?” she said.

(Dana DiFilippo | New Jersey Monitor)Riven by years of municipal departures, soaring premiums, and surging prescription drug use, the local government part of the State Health Benefits Program is on a path to complete collapse, and New Jersey’s gubernatorial hopefuls differ on how to fix it.
The plan, which in January provided health coverage to 56.2% of the state’s local government employers and has repeatedly seen double-digit premium hikes in recent years, faces even sharper increases and will collapse absent wholesale changes to benefits, entry and exit rules, and governance, the Treasury warned in a report released Tuesday.
Plans that provide coverage to local government face cumulative premium increases set to exceed 60% over the next four years and will likely collapse as more towns, authorities, and counties flee, the Treasury said. That collapse could leave towns with small or sickly workforces facing high rates in the private market.
Because premiums under the local part of the State Health Benefits Program are paid largely by local revenue like property taxes — whether through withholdings from local government workers’ salaries or directly from public coffers — spiking premiums stand to raise tax burdens at the local level.
There are 11 candidates running in the June 10 gubernatorial primaries (Gov. Phil Murphy, a Democrat, can’t run for a third term this fall). They presented disparate paths on how to control escalating costs under the state’s public health plans, with some favoring increased competition, new drug pricing rules, or thinner plan requirements.
“We need more competition,” said former radio host Bill Spadea and former Assemblyman Jack Ciattarelli, both Republicans.
On top of boosting competition, Republican candidates want to lower the number of public plans’ coverage requirements as a method of controlling costs.

Murphy in late 2023 signed a law to allow the state’s public health plans to have more than one third-party administrator.
Aetna has since joined Horizon Blue Cross Blue Shield of New Jersey in administering the state’s self-funded public health benefits, but its entry was not expected to generate savings in the current fiscal year, with benefits unclear for out years, according to budget documents.
It’s not clear any other New Jersey insurers have the capacity to administer health benefits across the breadth of state. Aetna and Horizon were the only two bidders for contracts to administer the public health plans, a Treasury spokesperson said.
Spadea and Sen. Jon Bramnick (R-Union) suggested reducing plan coverage requirements, allowing the state to offer cheaper, less fulsome coverage in a bid to lower premiums.
“Right now, we have insurance policies that mandate a whole bunch of different services. I want to bring in companies that have options where you can choose policies that have less mandated requirements than we require in New Jersey,” Bramnick said.
In its report, the Treasury listed high-cost health care services among the primary driver of cost increases, alongside surging use of expensive medications, especially new weight loss drugs.
It’s not clear what services candidates would seek to limit or whether their plans would include a winnowing of existing health care plans. Treasury’s report notes that most local government workers remain on older plans with generous benefits and high costs.
Most candidates provided answers on how to control escalating costs in public worker health plans before the release of the Tuesday report that warned the plan had entered a death spiral. Newark Mayor Ras Baraka, Rep. Josh Gottheimer, and teachers union chief Sean Spiller — all Democrats — provided responses after its publication.

Democrats’ proposed solutions were more varied than their Republican counterparts. Some, like Jersey City Mayor Steve Fulop, backed increased competition, though Fulop also wants limits on hospital mergers.
“You have an increase in costs for New Jersey because you have this hospital monopoly as well, which has put a stranglehold on doctors,” Fulop said. “I think that Trenton needs to be more aggressive in not allowing that consolidation within hospitals or them acquiring medical practices downstream.”
Others favored boosting oversight of plan spending, targeting certain insurance middlemen, or broader changes like those the school workers’ public health plan saw in 2020.
Gottheimer and Rep. Mikie Sherrill (D-11) both suggested increased plan oversight, her through audits of the State Health Benefits Program and him through compliance reviews. The two also said they want greater regulation of pharmacy benefit managers, third-party firms that negotiate prescription prices on behalf of insurance providers and have been blamed for rising prescription drug prices.
“They’ve driven up pharmaceutical costs up to 10 times,” Sherrill said.
Baraka backed reference-based pricing, which would tie prices for some services or drugs to those charged by Medicare. He also supports shifting some regulatory authority over the public plans to the Department of Banking and Insurance.
“We need reference-based pricing to bring costs down and increase transparency in this state and we need to lay the foundation for a true public option — one that prioritizes people, not profit,” the mayor said.
Treasury’s report partly blames the structure of plan design committees for rising costs within the State Health Benefits Program, saying those bodies, whose membership is split evenly between management and labor, had entrenched the status quo of expensive benefits. Ceding some authority to Treasury could lower costs, the report says.
At present, only the committees or the Legislature can change plan designs by, for example, changing copay levels, shifting reimbursement rates, or eliminating specific insurance plans within the program. The State Health Benefits Commission and its schools counterpart set premium levels.
Spiller and former state Sen. Steve Sweeney highlighted past reforms to state plans, including the 2020 changes that moved most school workers enrolled in the School Employee Health Benefits Program to cheaper public plans. They also suggested reverse auction rules that see pharmacy benefit managers bid each other down for state contracts.
“When I did the reverse auction on pharmaceuticals, it saved half a billion dollars a year, so that’s one of the lower-hanging fruits,” Sweeney said. “The other one is sitting down with the unions to see where we can negotiate and reduce healthcare costs like we did with the (New Jersey Education Association).”
The 2020 changes, which came when Spiller was the teachers union’s vice president, succeeded in providing some relief to public school plans, but Treasury’s report warns the dynamics that sent the local part of the State Health Benefits Program into a death spiral could do the same for the school workers’ plan.
Multiple Democrats, including Gottheimer and Baraka, said they want more transparency over hospital pricing, while Spiller blamed hospitals’ political heft for public plans’ present distress.
“We’ve seen it where we can make changes to some of the plan’s structures. They refuse to do it. Over and over, they refuse,” he said. “And let me tell you, I am sure it is because the biggest donors in New Jersey politics are the hospitals, the insurance companies, their brokers, all the other folks. We never get the change we need.”

Do we really need these costly insurance companies to do what we could easily do ourselves if we possessed the moral courage and the political will to do it?
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Walter Carpenter: Health insurance déjà vu.","Dear Editor,The recent VTDigger article about the financial struggles of Blue Cross Blue Shield of Vermont was déjà vu. It reminded me of another time in the past when we were at this point where Blue Cross Blue Shield was petitioning the Green Mountain Care Board for huge rate increases to prevent their potential insolvency.  It was in 2019, the last year before Covid-19 changed our lives, when the GMCB granted  a 12.4% and a 10.1% rate increase for BCBSVT and MVP, respectively. After that decision, the board’s chair, Kevin Mullin, said, “We acknowledge they are not affordable. But at the same time we can’t put a company out of business.” This year, Senator Ginny Lyons (D-Chittenden Southeast), chair of the Senate Health and Welfare Committee, said, “We can’t let Blue Cross and Blue Shield go under.”READ MORE
Well, why not? Do we really need these costly insurance companies to do what we could easily do ourselves if we possessed the moral courage and the political will to do it? As the former vice president of corporate communications at Cigna, Wendell Potter — now an advocate for universal health care — said of his former industry: “Health insurers have been successful at two things: Making money and getting the American public to believe they’re essential.” They are absolutely not essential and we know it.  This is the broader question that we must ask ourselves yet again as we contemplate even heftier rate increase requests from BCBSVT to keep it afloat: How much longer will it be before we have nothing left to give to it? How many more of these déjà vus will BCBSVT have in the upcoming years while our wages stay flat?  Once again, it’s time to think about it.  Walter Carpenter MontpelierRead the story on VTDigger here:  Walter Carpenter: Health insurance déjà vu.",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Letters-to-the-editor_featured-image-25.png,,,2025-05-22 07:03:32.601857

We can handle it, and we will find the right solutions together.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Rep. Peter Conlon: Gov. Scott needs to speak frankly on education and health care.","This commentary is by Rep. Peter Conlon, D-Cornwall. He is chair of the House Education Committee.When it comes to two of the biggest issues facing Vermonters, Gov. Phil Scott has gone silent. I am sure he is out there, checking his enormous political capital, then deciding not to spend a penny of it leveling with Vermonters that making the changes our state needs in education and health care — to name the two I will focus on — is going to require a new reality.Vermont’s decades-long demographic change — found in many other places in the U.S. and the world — has come home to roost. We are growing old; our birth rate is low; young people are back to their pre-Covid-19 ways of choosing to live in diverse, walkable cities with more economic opportunity; and our housing crisis continues.This is changing the face of Vermont, particularly rural Vermont. We have far fewer students in our schools, and our aging demographic means higher demand on our health care system with fewer young, healthy Vermonters paying into the system.Gov. Scott says nothing about Vermont’s health care system, which is on the brink of collapse, and very little about education since he floated the concept of sweeping changes, but has never been clear with Vermonters that we must have fewer schools, especially middle and high schools, to keep our system affordable.Health care may be the most immediate and important crisis, and it doesn’t even make Gov. Scott’s list of top issues. The state’s main — really only — insurer, Blue Cross Blue Shield of Vermont, is on the verge of insolvency unless it gets a 20% rate increase or a helluva bailout.READ MORE
Most of our 14 hospitals are in a similar situation. Our insurance premiums are anywhere from twice to four times as expensive as our border states. A 20% will drive small businesses and individuals who buy on the exchange out of Vermont far faster than taxes.Gov. Scott has a road map to bending the cost curve sitting on his desk gathering dust. It is a commissioned study of Vermont’s system with clear recommendations to stabilize it and control costs. But it requires leveling with Vermonters, because we can no longer afford to maintain 14 hospitals all providing the same services. We can’t, and he needs to make that clear.It is the same with public education. With fewer students, we can no longer afford to maintain all of the schools we operate today. We can’t, and Gov. Scott needs to make that clear.No one else in Vermont has his megaphone, no one else has his clout, no one else has his political capital. It is time for Gov. Scott to give the volunteers who govern our education and health systems an assist. He needs to speak honestly, clearly and directly with Vermonters that our state has changed, and we need to adjust to those changes now, or watch our state slowly decline.Of course there are other big issues. Solving homelessness and our housing crisis is going to take more than his solution of just relaxing Act 250 regulations. It is going to take a sustained level of support from the government. He would never say that.We are ready to listen, Governor. Are you ready to speak frankly about what we really need to do? We can handle it, and we will find the right solutions together.Read the story on VTDigger here:  Rep. Peter Conlon: Gov.

(Photo via FWC.)Dear Gov. DeSantis,
Congratulations! You’ve achieved something rare in our deeply divided country. You’ve once again united a lot of people from disparate backgrounds and beliefs. 
Of course, you’ve united them against you and one of your agencies — but that’s a price you’re apparently willing to pay, over and over, and I salute you for it.
Last year, you brought people together to stop your plan to put golf courses, 300-room hotels, and pickleball courts in state parks. 
Then they united to protest your proposal to swap some state forest land with a golf course developer.
Because of the public outcry, the golf course developer withdrew its request for the state forest land. Meanwhile, the Legislature unanimously passed a bill to prevent you or any other governor from ever again trying to ruin state parks with golf courses, a bill you’ve promised to sign into law.
With these two crises mostly resolved, this would be the point at which public enthusiasm for protecting our state lands would begin to wane. People would stop protesting and go back to more mundane pursuits, such as binging episodes of “Poker Face.” (I hear there’s one set in Florida!)
Fortunately, Gov. D, that didn’t happen — thanks to your new scheme to keep people engaged. Good job! 
Last week, word got out that the state was considering a land swap with a mysterious private company that wanted 600 acres of the Guana River Wildlife Management Area. In exchange, the company, identified only as The Uplands LLC, offered to hand over 3,000 acres of less desirable land scattered around St. Johns, Lafayette, Osceola, and Volusia counties.
  Eric Draper. when he was Florida State Parks director, via Eric Draper
“It’s just a way to swap jewels for junk,” former Florida State Parks director Eric Draper told me.
Suddenly, boom! People were out protesting again, waving signs that said things like “We’re not Guana take this!” which I thought was a nice shout-out to Twisted Sister.
Your land swap was so unifying, it was roundly condemned by everyone from 1000 Friends of Florida to the White House. Even legislators from your own party began clamoring for answers. 
It was a brilliant move, sir, like something you’d see in 3-D chess. 
But then Uplands LLC chickened out. 
In the face of such widespread public outrage, the company’s attorney announced Monday that his client would withdraw its proposal. The vote on the land swap, scheduled for Wednesday, was canceled.
It’s a shame, really. Everyone sure was spoiling for another big showdown.
It’s also too bad that one of Florida’s best state employees lost her job over your scheme.
Wile E. Coyote goes boom
For seven years, you’ve made it clear that you’re no fan of Florida’s outstanding Government in the Sunshine Law. But in this case, Mr. D, you apparently used the Sunshine Law the way you’d use your favorite putter to drill one straight into the hole.
Nobody knew about this Guana land swap until it suddenly popped up on the agenda of a somewhat obscure government group last week. That means the owners of that Guana River property, namely the Florida taxpayers, had no more than seven days’ advance notice about what you were up to. 
Oh, sir, I applaud the way you played that one! It made people even MORE suspicious that this was some sleazy payback for a campaign contributor.
The legal requirement that this little-known group review the land swap in an open meeting appeared to be the only thing that flushed this secret deal out into the open. The best comment about this happening is one I heard from Albert Gregory, former chief of Florida’s park planning division.
“It’s like Wile E. Coyote is getting the public comment tool out of the Acme box,” he told me, “and it blows up in his face.”
Here’s how it worked out: On May 14, your Florida Department of Environmental Pro — er, what are we calling it now, sir, Providing Cover for Developers? Professing One Thing While Pursuing Another? Proving They Put Politics First? 
Anyway, your DEP posted a notice that there would be a meeting of the Acquisition and Restoration Council, or ARC for short, in exactly one week. As I’m sure you recall, that’s a group of 10 people you appointed.  Some ARC members are from state agencies, some from scientific institutions such as Tall Timbers Research Station, and some are from private concerns such as ranches and timber operations.
  Julie Wraithmell via Audubon Florida
According to Julie Wraithmell, executive director of Audubon Florida, that ARC meeting notice waved a big red flag. ARC doesn’t meet that often, and this meeting was not one of their regularly scheduled ones. Why hold a special session? 
The Audubon folks requested DEP send them the agenda, she said, but no one did. Finally, a link to the agenda showed up on the DEP website sometime after 6 p.m. the day the notice was posted, she said. That’s when Audubon learned about the land swap proposal and sounded an alarm for all the state’s environmental groups. 
But that’s about all they learned. The agenda item was “really light on details,” Wraithmell told me. “It’s not clear who the applicant is.” 
Also unclear: What the applicant intended to do with the state’s property. All the other items on the ARC agenda concerned adding to state lands. This was the only one that would take some away.
Finding the land mines
Once everyone began studying this bare-bones agenda item, they discovered other fatal flaws. Oh, sir, you were so clever the way you planted all those land mines!
For starters, the report for the ARC said the Guana River property had no historically significant sites. But Wraithmell pointed out that Guana River’s official state management plan names more than seven historic sites covered by the property.
The land is managed by a different state agency, the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission. The DEP report on the proposed land swap says the FWC concurred with the agency’s recommendation to approve handing over the taxpayers’ property to a private entity.
But that’s not the way the FWC report reads to me. It simply says it “acknowledges the authority” of ARC and the governor and Cabinet to do what they want with the land. That sure sounds like that agency is far from sold on the idea.
Perhaps the biggest land mine of all is what the law says about how the state can’t get rid of any preserve property until it does one thing.
  Clay Henderson, provided by subject
For finding this one, I have to credit Clay Henderson, a longtime environmental activist who’s literally written the book on Florida land preservation programs (“Forces of Nature” — you should read it, sir). The law, he pointed out, says the state must first establish that the land is no longer needed for conservation purposes.
Henderson, in a letter to the ARC members, pointed out that Guana River contains everything from coastal strands to maritime hammocks to pine flatwoods to estuarine wetlands. There are rookeries for wood storks and ancient shell middens. 
All of that is important to preserve in our fast-growing state.
Henderson remarked that one of the state’s top land managers called the Guana River property one of the “crown jewels of American conservation.” In other words, not one you’d want to give away to somebody.
So Gov. D, if you were looking for one park parcel to dangle over a dangerous chasm to make a point, I think it’s clear you picked the perfect one.
This Gate is closed
The other big mystery was who wanted the Guana River land so badly. 
Good job keeping everyone guessing, governor! The lack of any information made it even more infuriating. It also ensured people would get mad at you and the DEP, not some private entity that might in fact be one of your campaign contributors.
When some nosy Tampa Bay Times reporter asked you point blank to identify your co-conspirator in this effort, you pretended you didn’t understand the question, then dodged any follow-up. You sidestepped as deftly as Charles Durning in “The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas.”  Pretty fancy footwork for a guy who sometimes wears white go-go boots.
The newspaper noted that “the Upland LLC’s business filings with the state don’t list anyone other than a general business services firm as its leader, making the true identity of the entity unclear.” Maybe a better name for the company would have been “Obfuscation Inc.”
There was some speculation that Upland LLC was somehow connected with Gate Petroleum, the company that owns the Ponte Vedra Inn & Club. I contacted Gate and received the quickest “no!” I’ve heard since my long-ago dating days.

A spokeswoman told me the company’s founder and chairman, Herbert Hill Peyton, is the person who first sold the land to the state in 1984. She said he opposes any effort to undo that preservation effort. 
The Guana River “is the finest land in Northeast Florida and no portion should be sold, swapped or developed,” Peyton said in a written statement. “This land belongs to the people of Florida and should be preserved forever.” So I guess this Gate is closed.

The only clue we have to the identity of company is the attorney who called off the vote. His name is Gary Hunter, and he’s also a Tallahassee lobbyist whose clients include major developers such as Neal Communities and Alico, not to mention the powerful Association of Florida Community Developers. 
Hunter, in his letter, claimed his client had no plans to “develop the acquired land for commercial or community development purposes” and blamed “misinformation” for stirring up all the public anger. He didn’t explain what he meant by “misinformation,” nor did he exclude such development amenities as golf courses.
I tried contacting Hunter to ask about that, but he didn’t respond. 
I’m assuming that including Hutner was all part of your plan to keep people conscious of how fragile our state parks, forests, and wildlife management areas are.
Callie DeHaven knew that fact already.
Principles over politics
Callie DeHaven worked her way up to become the director of the DEP’s Division of State Lands in 2017. The division has done some wonderful things, such as adding to the size of the award-winning state park system. That’s why lots of people liked her and liked the job she did.
“Callie was one of the few people left at the agency who had scruples,” Gregory told me.

“I’ve known Callie for many years and she’s one of the good guys,” said Dana Bryan, who spent 30 years in the Florida Park Service, most of it as chief biologist.
On May 6, though, DeHaven submitted a single-page, handwritten letter to her bosses. “To whom it may concern,” it said. “I hereby resign my position.”
The letter doesn’t explain what happened. Draper, who has fond memories of working with DeHaven, told me she’s not the kind of person to fly off the handle at the slightest provocation. She must have been pushed pretty hard to quit so abruptly.
“There is no doubt she objected to the Guana land swap and resigned rather than give in to developers,” Draper said.
So Gov. DeSantis, if you were trying to find which DEP employees would put principles over politics, I guess your plan worked a little TOO well. 
You need to find Ms. DeHaven and bring her back into the DEP. Maybe even promote her to a position of even greater authority.

Calls to Mom
To show you how well your scheme worked, Gov. D, let me tell you about a woman I met this past weekend in St. Cloud.
  Rep. Paula Stark via Florida House
I gave a talk about Florida, and afterward several people came up to me and told me THEIR Florida stories. One of them was state Rep. Paula Stark, who represents the St. Cloud area. She became interested in politics long before she was first elected in 2022. Not her kids, though.
“They are not political at all,” she told me.
What her two adult sons care about is Florida’s environment. They have backyard cameras and love watching wildlife cross from one fenceline to the other, she told me.
But then they found out about the Guana River land swap. Suddenly they were keenly interested in talking to her about politics. They were calling her up and asking, “Mom, why are they doing this?”
And they were ready to do whatever they could to stop it.
The point of this story, Gov. D, is to show you how passionate people are about our wonderful state lands. Even people who don’t care about politics care about saving our dwindling natural resources. 
An estimated 50,000 folks signed petitions to oppose the land swap before Uplands gave up. Meanwhile, state Rep. Kim Kendall has vowed to sponsor a bill to make sure this never happens again.
Anyway, congrats on pulling off such an elaborate and clever scheme to make sure Floridians remain vigilant about threats to our state lands. 
You better hurry up and find another one, though. Otherwise, they’re liable to start talking about your Hope Florida scandal again.

The Columbia River Fish Mitigation program attempts to balance out significant harm inflicted by the Columbia River hydropower dam system on endangered salmon and steelhead runs.
The 46 percent cut to the program’s yearly budget comes amid tens of billions of dollars in cuts to the federal government that have hit scientific and regulatory agencies in Southwest Washington hard. It also follows months of speculation about what President Donald Trump’s Columbia Basin fish policy would be.
“It is outrageous that President Trump is ripping away critical funding to protect our fish populations in the Columbia River, which are so important to our economy, culture and tribes in Washington state,” U.S. Sen. Patty Murray wrote in a statement emailed to The Columbian.
The Corps did not directly respond to The Columbian’s request for comment on the cuts. In a brief statement, a spokesman instead highlighted the importance of the salmon recovery program moving into the future.
“Columbia River Fish Mitigation funding is an important source for many projects in the basin,” said Tom Conning, spokesman for the Corps’ Northwestern Division. “As is typical during the federal budget process, we will work with our partners in the region to prioritize projects depending on how much funding we actually receive from Congress.”
Six Columbia Basin salmon recovery policy experts and biologists who work with the program said the cuts stand to unravel the program’s work in coming years — harming salmon recovery across the basin at a make-or-break time.
“With these cuts to salmon recovery programs, (Corps officials) are going to have to halt many important actions in their track,” said Tom Iverson, regional coordinator for Yakama Nation Fisheries.
Iverson also said the cuts are “inconsistent with the U.S. government’s commitments” to restore salmon populations under the binding Resilient Columbia Basin Agreement.
Salmon advocates made compromises in that agreement to get the government to agree to spend more on Columbia River hydropower system infrastructure and fish passage — not less.
Murky origins of a cut

	
Two Trump administration actions have affected Corps funding.
The first is a nearly $1.5 billion reduction in funding for the Corps’ civil works between fiscal year 2024 and the current federal fiscal year ending Sept. 30.
The second is a move by the administration to shift hundreds of millions of previously committed dollars from civil works projects in Democratic-controlled states to Republican-controlled states, according to an analysis by Murray’s office that was shared with The Columbian.
“Trump is stealing funding from blue states for no other reason than political retribution, and he’s playing politics with critical water infrastructure — it’s absolutely despicable,” Murray said. “This is not how things should ever work in America.”
In fiscal year 2024 — which ran from Oct. 1, 2023, to Sept. 30, 2024 — the salmon-restoration program was allocated $66,670,000.
But newly released Corps itemized funding documents show the Corps received only $35,983,605 for this fiscal year.
That’s despite Congress’ March continuing resolution funding the Corps at the same level for fiscal year 2025 as the previous year, according to a report from the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service.
The cuts are even more drastic when the new $36 million funding level is compared with the $75.2 million the Corps was slated to get for Columbia River fish mitigation efforts for 2025 in the draft budget that the Biden administration submitted to Congress in March 2024 based on the Corps’ funding request.
The program’s funding has significantly varied over the past 15 years, according to The Columbian’s analysis of publicly available Corps funding levels.
The program routinely received more than $100 million in the early 2010s. But that was cut by about two-thirds during Trump’s first term, dipped lower still during the first half of former President Joe Biden’s term and finally rose to the past fiscal year’s recent high during the latter half of Biden’s presidency.
Legal requirement

	
The program evaluates how different parts of the hydropower system impact salmon stocks in the Columbia Basin and then addresses those problems through construction, habitat restoration and other means.
The Corps’ 2025 budget says the program’s work is “required” to minimize “lethal take” (killing) of Endangered Species Act-listed salmon and steelhead by the federal hydropower dam system.
Government reports released during the Biden administration acknowledged the hydropower system’s harm to salmon stocks and Native nations, as well as the ways removing four lower Snake River dams would benefit them.
Columbia Basin salmon and steelhead returns were between 10 million and 18 million fish before the dams. Recently, they’ve numbered about 2.3 million.
Wild fish in particular have suffered. A 2022 assessment by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration found the number of “raw natural spawner(s)” in Columbia River tributaries declined substantially for nearly every run in nearly every river measured between 1990 and 2019.
Overfishing, climate change, habitat degradation and a rise in predators have also harmed runs.
All that has pushed 13 Columbia Basin salmon runs to the brink of extinction, placing them under Endangered Species Act protections.
Impacts

	
The Columbia River Fish Mitigation program will be partly protected from the immediate impacts of the cut, according to an email obtained by The Columbian that was sent by Columbia River Fish Mitigation program manager Ida Royer to about three dozen Columbia Basin salmon-restoration policy experts and biologists.
The email states that because of leftover money from the 2024 fiscal year, the program will end up with only a few million dollars less than last fiscal year.
But six Columbia Basin salmon recovery policy experts and biologists who work with the program said the cuts will create uncertainty that snowballs into future years, disrupting the program’s continuing operations.
That stands to further delay the long and ever-growing list of deferred maintenance biologists say the Corps must do — not just to support fish passage but for navigation and flood-risk management.
And even the limited cuts appear to be impacting the required program’s operations already, because they came so late in the fiscal year.
“There will need to be more discussion about the work remaining for the year, refined costs and program priorities,” Royer wrote. “More to come.”

It ensures access to basic healthcare for low-income individuals and families who would otherwise go without. But Medicaid does more than support individuals; it is a vital public health tool that strengthens entire communities.
In Missouri, Medicaid plays a particularly critical role for women and children. Over 40% of women who give birth in the state are covered by Medicaid during pregnancy, and consequently, about 40% of children are utilizing this program. It also provides healthcare to more than 500,000 children.
And yet, despite this extensive coverage, Missouri ranks 44th in the nation for maternal mortality rates.
During my time working on a maternal-fetal medicine ward, I witnessed firsthand how fragile and inconsistent healthcare access can be for pregnant patients. Many women came in with undiagnosed, unmanaged conditions like high blood pressure—problems that could have been treated early with regular care. But for many, pregnancy is the only time they qualify for Medicaid and thus the only time they see a doctor.
When Medicaid coverage ends postpartum, so does their access to care. These untreated conditions worsen over time, making subsequent pregnancies more dangerous. Missouri’s extension to cover Medicaid postpartum for 12 months is an incredible step towards creating healthier mothers, healthier pregnancies, and ultimately healthier children.
This issue extends beyond pregnancy. Preventable conditions like diabetes and hypertension often go undiagnosed and untreated due to lack of access to routine care. As a result, emergency rooms are flooded with patients seeking non-emergency care — like prescription refills — that should be handled by primary care providers. This misuse of emergency care drives up healthcare costs, increases ER wait times, burns out physicians, and frustrates patients.
Medicaid is not just important—it’s essential. Without it, millions would lose access to the care they need, leading to worse health outcomes and skyrocketing costs across the system. And yet, Missouri ranks dead last in state health spending, contributing just $7 per person in state funds and $92 per person when including federal support. Now, with federal Medicaid funding facing potential cuts, Missouri stands at a crossroads.
Will our lawmakers act to protect and expand Medicaid access, or will they allow more than a million Missourians to fall through the cracks? The health and future of our state depend on their funding.",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/stethoscope-chart-1024x666.jpeg,,,2025-05-22 07:03:32.601857

Indiana has recently experienced record-setting rains, causing disastrous flooding in some areas of the state. Our state also has historically relied on coal as an energy source.
You might be asking: What does coal have to do with all that rain falling from the skies into our water supply? It turns out quite a bit. As we burn coal, we generate coal ash, which has serious implications for our water. It needs to be part of Indiana’s current discussion of water resources.
Coal ash contains toxic heavy metals, like arsenic, which contaminate water whenever the ash gets wet. Most of Indiana’s coal ash sites have contaminated the underlying groundwater, making it unusable for drinking water.
Indiana’s coal ash is also a spill risk because most of it is currently stored in the floodplains of the Ohio, Wabash and White rivers and Lake Michigan. When flooding happens, it could damage the disposal sites causing release of the ash. The recent high-water events are a stark reminder that the floodplain is one of the worst locations for coal ash disposal.
The current groundwater contamination and spill risk are from the many millions of tons of coal ash left over from past decades of burning coal. Unfortunately, Indiana still has coal-burning power plants that continue to produce about five million tons of coal ash each year, putting more of our water at risk.
New EPA rules will force fossil fuel power plants to cut pollution

Our state needs less toxic coal ash, not more. Coal generation itself and the byproduct of coal ash it produces pollutes our air and water. Spills and leaks in other states have validated the dangers of coal ash.
In 2014, a drainage pipe burst at a retired Duke Energy facility in North Carolina, releasing approximately 39,000 tons of coal ash and 27 million gallons of contaminated water into a nearby river.
This spill, one of the largest in U.S. history, contaminated about 70 miles of the river with toxic substances including arsenic, selenium and lead, posing significant risks to aquatic ecosystems and communities relying on the river for drinking water and recreation. The incident exposed regulatory failures and led to federal investigations into Duke Energy’s practices and its relationship with state regulators.
In 2022, the Hoosier Environmental Council estimated that Duke Energy Indiana was burning enough coal to generate more than 1.4 million tons of coal ash per year, adding to the millions of tons already being stored across the state.
The good news is that lawmakers and Gov. Mike Braun have prioritized water planning in the coming years, both via recently passed legislation and a new executive order.
The bad news is that those same policymakers seem infatuated with keeping coal as an energy source for decades to come despite overwhelming economic and health reasons to move away from coal toward cleaner, more efficient energy sources.
Burning coal is bad for our state. Storing coal ash in floodplains that could overflow in a heavy rain creates yet another unfair burden and health threat to local communities. To protect our water resources, we need to stop burning coal and adopt a responsible approach to coal ash disposal as soon as possible.

Photo by Max Nesterak/Minnesota Reformer. It was just a matter of time before the prospect of President Donald Trump pardoning Minneapolis Police Department Officer Derek Chauvin for violating George Floyd’s civil rights became a reality.
When White House reporters asked him in March about pardoning Chauvin, President Trump replied, “No, I have not heard about that.” 
That’s hard to believe, since right around that time Ben Shapiro led a conservative chorus of commentators and politicians raising a hue and cry on that very thing, egged on by Trump henchman Elon Musk. 
As investigative reporter Radley Balko pointed out for MSNBC, Shapiro once said Chauvin should be prosecuted “to the fullest extent of the law” and should “go to jail” and that “everyone should be on the same side of this.” 
But that was then. 
Despite a trial in which nearly all the defense’s theories were heard and rejected by a jury of Chauvin’s peers, and despite Chauvin pleading guilty to his federal crimes, Shapiro and his ilk have changed their tune. 
Chauvin’s conviction, Shapiro writes, “represents the defining achievement of the Woke movement in American politics. The country cannot turn the page on that dark, divisive and racist era without righting this terrible wrong.” 
Terrible wrong? We all saw Chauvin impassively kneeling on Floyd’s neck while Floyd pleaded, “I can’t breathe.” 
Now we can be sure Trump has heard about it, and we’re all waiting, bracing for some middle-of-the-night bathroom tweet. U.S.  Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene is now in on it: “I strongly support Derek Chauvin being pardoned and released from prison, George Floyd died of a drug overdose.”  
Yes, Floyd was on drugs. But let’s recall the words of Dr. Martin Tobin at trial. He is one of the world’s foremost pulmonologists, the man who literally wrote the book on the subject and testified in a criminal trial for the first time, refusing his usual expert witness fee. Then-Reformer reporter Deena covered his testimony:  
“Basically on the left side of his lung, it was… almost to the effect as if a surgeon had gone in and removed the lung — not quite, but along those lines — so there was virtually very little opportunity for him to be able to get any air to move into the left side of his chest,” Tobin said. 
“So he was going to be totally dependent on what he’d be able to do with the right side.”
But Floyd’s ability to expand his chest was also impaired on the right side, Tobin said. Floyd’s respiration rate had been 22 breaths per minute, a normal rate, which Tobin said was “extremely significant” because if fentanyl caused his respiration to go down, you’d expect it to drop to about 10.
Tobin said he could mark the moment the life went out of Floyd: 8:25:16 p.m. The officers continued to hold him down on the street for another three minutes.
In short, what killed Floyd was Chauvin’s disregard for human life.
Chauvin’s lawyers argued their client was denied a fair trial in 2021 due to pretrial publicity and concerns about violence in the event of an acquittal.  True, there was plenty publicity.  And there were quite reasonable concerns about violence ensuing if Chauvin walked.  
None of that altered the medical examiner’s findings. He testified during the trial that his cause of death finding hadn’t changed since he filled out Floyd’s death certificate in June 2020: He blamed “cardiopulmonary arrest complicating law enforcement subdual restraint and neck compression.” 
“I would still classify it as a homicide today,” he testified.
Not that the facts faze Greene or the rest of the MAGA mob presently riding to Chauvin’s rescue in the media.  
You can bet they have Trump’s ear. 
But think of the irony: Just about the first thing he did after taking his hand off the Bible on Inauguration Day was grant clemency to rioters for storming the U.S. Capitol on January 6, 2021, handing a literal get-out-jail-free card to upwards of 1,500 charged, including 15 ring leaders and members of the Proud Boys and Oath Keepers.  This despite that roughly 140 police officers were injured during the attack, more than a dozen hospitalized. 
Trump held forth: “This proclamation ends a grave national injustice that has been perpetrated upon the American people over the last four years and begins a process of national reconciliation.”  
Falling from the south end of a northbound bull, what the proclamation did was sign off on wanton, wholesale criminal activity. You want to know from injustice perpetrated? Ask the families, relatives and friends of those cops who were cut down doing their duty to uphold the law. For that matter, ask the injured cops about all those law breakers being let off the hook.
And in Trump’s make-believe world, the fact that Chauvin pled guilty in the federal case won’t matter. 
A reminder: By pleading guilty, Chauvin agreed in open court that he “willfully depriv(ed) Mr. Floyd of his constitutional right to be free from the use of unreasonable force by a police officer, resulting in Mr. Floyd’s bodily injury and death … and acted willfully and in callous and wanton disregard of the consequences to Mr. Floyd’s life,” as the Department of Justice press release said at the time. And, Chauvin also pleaded guilty to “willfully depriving a then-14-year-old child of his constitutional right to be free from the use of unreasonable force by a police officer, resulting in the child’s bodily injury” related to a separate 2017 incident. 
Federal conviction overturned, Chauvin would thankfully still be incarcerated, transferred to the Minnesota Department of Corrections to serve out the remainder of his sentence on state charges. 
But let’s not forget the Minnesota Board of Pardons, which no longer requires a unanimous vote among the three members: the governor, attorney general and chief justice of the Minnesota Supreme Court. 
If Republicans get their act together, they could conceivably win the governor and attorney general races. And then they would face intense pressure to commute Chauvin’s sentence. 
Walz, Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, Community Safety Commissioner Toddrick Barnette and other political and law enforcement figures are said to be bracing for the Trump pardon. This is, to say the least, prudent.  
In response to Floyd’s murder, May 2020 saw days of protest — but also hell-raising — that damaged more than 1,300 buildings in Minneapolis and St. Paul and cost hundreds of millions of dollars in property destruction. Plus, payouts to victims of police brutality. And a pile of police disability claims. 
A pardon would mean all the bracing in the world won’t keep all hell from breaking loose all over again.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/P1057121-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-22 07:03:32.601857

(Getty Images)Questions remain about Benjamin Ritchie’s early Tuesday execution after his attorneys reported seeing sudden, unexpected movement during the lethal injection process.
But no members of the media were permitted to witness the execution, meaning there was no independent observation or account of what happened.
Defense attorney Steve Schutte, who viewed the execution, told the Indiana Capital Chronicle immediately after that he saw Ritchie lift his head and shoulders “violently” from the gurney shortly after the process began. Two others in Ritchie’s witness room gave similar descriptions.

Dr. Jonathan Groner, an emeritus clinical professor of surgery at the Ohio State University College of Medicine who has written extensively on the death penalty, said “that’s not what is supposed to happen” when the execution drug, pentobarbital, is used to induce death.
“Clearly, this was botched,” Groner told the Capital Chronicle, based on the limited accounts provided by Ritchie’s counsel. “It should be really, really effective — really fast. No one should move … It’s just lights out, go to sleep, no reaction, no coughing, no nothing. They just don’t move.”
Indiana’s Department of Correction (DOC) released few details about the execution. 
When asked whether the pentobarbital used in Ritchie’s case worked properly, DOC spokesperson Annie Goeller told the Capital Chronicle that what Ritchie’s lawyers described “is not an accurate description of the circumstances,” and she maintained that “the execution was completed according to protocol.”
Capital Chronicle Senior Reporter Casey Smith attended Joseph Corcoran’s execution in December and did not observe any sudden movements by the inmate while blinds for a one-way window into the execution chamber were open. 
Corcoran, strapped to a gurney, initially appeared awake with his eyes blinking. After a brief movement of his left hand and fingers several minutes later, he did not move again.
There is no standard definition of what constitutes a “botched” execution.
The Death Penalty Information Center (DPIC), a nonprofit based in Washington, D.C. that tracks state and federal executions, points to a 2014 book published by Amherst College professor Austin Sarat, which classifies botched executions as those in which “there is a break­down in, or depar­ture from,” the ​pro­to­col for a par­tic­u­lar method of exe­cu­tion.










It should be really, really effective — really fast. No one should move … It’s just lights out, go to sleep, no reaction, no coughing, no nothing. They just don’t move.


– Dr. Jonathan Groner, an emeritus clinical professor of surgery at the Ohio State University College of Medicine


Sarat adds that botched executions are “those involving unanticipated problems or delays that caused, at least arguably, unnecessary agony for the prisoner or that reflect gross incompetence of the executioner.”
The absence of news media, however, means the public must depend on the conflicting reports from Ritchie’s lawyers and state officials to determine what, if anything, went wrong during the execution. No other witnesses have spoken publicly about what they saw.
“Killing people is horrific, and it is the most extreme form of state power,” said Gerry Lanosga, professor of journalism at Indiana University and board member for the Indiana Coalition for Open Government. “But the only way we would know whether something goes wrong would be to have independent witnesses there who observe and can ensure that the process is carried out appropriately.” 
A ‘botched’ execution?
Tuesday morning’s death sentence was carried out nearly 25 years after Ritchie shot and killed Beech Grove law enforcement officer William Toney. The condemned man had been on death row since his conviction in 2002.
Capital punishments were put on hold for 15 years in Indiana until state officials announced last year that they’d acquired pentobarbital to resume executions. The one-drug method is a departure from the state’s protocol used since 1995, involving a series of three chemicals.
Ritchie was Indiana’s second execution in six months.
Capital Chronicle reporting revealed the state paid $900,000 for execution drugs, but officials won’t say how much was purchased or if any remains after the two executions.  Officials also have refused to provide information on expiration dates, storage or other details. 
Lethal injection requires execution workers to administer drugs intravenously to the prisoner to stop their heart. It has become the most commonly used execution method across the country — but it’s also the method with the most recorded “botches,” or mistakes.
Robin Maher, executive director of the Death Penalty Information Center, previously told the Capital Chronicle that many of the documented botched executions in recent years have occurred because the drugs being used had expired, were contaminated, or they were administered “incorrectly.” 



The Death Penalty Information Center describes at least two botched executions that have occurred in Indiana.
In October 1985, it took 17 minutes to execute William Vandiver. Still breathing after the first application of 2,300 volts, four more bursts of electricity were fired into him before he was pronounced dead, according to media reports from that time. The Indiana Department of Correction admitted the execution “did not go according to plan.”
Tommie Smith, who died by lethal injection in July 1996, also had a prolonged execution, according to the DPIC. Because of unusually small veins, it took more than an hour after the execution team began sticking needles into his body for Smith to be pronounced dead. After multiple attempts, the lethal drugs were finally injected into Smith 49 minutes after the process began. It took another 20 minutes before he was pronounced dead.



Experts and researchers generally review official documents and witness reports to confirm execution details, like whether there was evidence that a prisoner made visible or audible expressions of pain; if the inmate was still conscious after a drug was administered; or whether execution workers struggled to find a prisoner’s veins.
Schutte said Ritchie’s sudden, “violent” body movement occurred a few minutes after the witness room blinds opened. He could not hear Ritchie when it happened, nor could he see if Ritchie’s eyes were opened or closed. Schutte also was unable to see the reactions, if any, of anyone present in the execution chamber with Ritchie.
Indiana State Prison Warden Ron Neal said during court proceedings last week that DOC’s extensive planning and training requires DOC staff to practice the process at least once each week ahead of a scheduled execution. 
An intravenous line is inserted “into a live (volunteer) every time” a training is held, Neal said, and the condemned inmate undergoes a medical evaluation and weekly assessments of their veins for IV access.
Witnesses did not have visibility into the execution chamber when Ritchie’s IVs were placed. DOC officials did not indicate if any issues arose during insertion.
Groner described pentobarbital as a “potent” drug that, when properly administered, should quickly render a person unconscious “without any movement.”
Pentobarbital is a fast-acting barbiturate approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for specific medical uses in humans and animals. It’s commonly used as a short-term sedative to treat insomnia, as a pre-anesthetic before surgery, and as an emergency treatment for severe seizure conditions. The FDA has also approved the drug for use in animal euthanasia.

It is not approved for use in executions or for causing death in humans; such use is considered “off-label.”
Groner highlighted two potential issues that could have occurred during Ritchie’s execution: the quality of the drugs, and the placement of intravenous lines.
The doctor raised concerns about the unknown age and storage conditions of the pentobarbital obtained by DOC. It’s also unclear how many doses of the drug were administered.
He additionally noted that improperly placed IVs could cause pain and delay the drug’s effectiveness.
“If the drug gets under the skin instead of in the vein, it can definitely burn,” Groner said.
He stressed that a “thorough” autopsy could provide crucial insights into what, if anything, went wrong during the execution.
Indiana does not require an autopsy to be performed after an execution, though. Lawyers said they were unsure if Ritchie’s family would pay to have one done.
The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) recently withdrew its own one-drug execution protocol because of what former Attorney General Merrick Garland called “sig­nif­i­cant uncer­tain­ty” about whether exe­cu­tions using pen­to­bar­bi­tal caused unnec­es­sary pain and suf­fer­ing.
Garland’s decision followed a multi-year review and report by the DOJ into the federal execution protocol. The report details some of the ways that using pentobarbital in an execution can cause unnecessary pain and suffering, including the risk of flash pulmonary edema — a condition in which fluid floods the lungs — and extreme pain at the injection site.
No guaranteed public access
The Capital Chronicle confirmed Ritchie had four witnesses present at the execution, which included two of his attorneys, Schutte and Mark Koselke, as well as a litigation specialist. The fourth individual, a woman, was not identified. The fifth witness spot was left unfilled.
The Capital Chronicle made numerous requests to be placed on Ritchie’s personal witness list but was denied.
A federal judge on Friday rejected a request by the Capital Chronicle and four other news outlets to pause a state law and DOC policy barring independent media witnesses.

News reporters are granted access to a designated area outside of the Indiana State Prison but are not permitted to directly witness the state’s actions — unless invited by the condemned to fill one of the five spots.
Lanosga stressed that media presence at executions is “critical” for public accountability and warned against relying solely on accounts from officials or those who side with either the victim or the condemned.
“I want a proxy there to tell me what happened,” he said. “Those official accounts are a poor substitute. I don’t want the regime telling me what happened. I don’t think we want, as citizens, a private system of justice. We want justice to be publicly carried out, and this is important for citizens, on behalf of citizens, to have witnesses there.”
He said there are “innumerable” instances in both contemporary and historic times in which official accounts about government acts small and large were later determined to be either vague, missing information, exaggerated, somehow distorted.
Lanosga maintained, too, that limited media access to executions “is part of a larger, troubling trend” of decreased public access to government actions. 
“Citizens are being asked to just accept things that are being done with little access to witnessing how those things are being done,” he said.
Although executions “are gruesome” and many people might prefer “not to know details,” Lanosga said the public interest should supersede individual discomfort. Journalists, he emphasized, “ought to be present on behalf of the public.”
“It’s really important that journalists are present to bear witness to this exercise of power,” he continued. “I think the state wants us to look away from the idea of the death penalty. And maybe to a certain extent, people want to look away and not witness the death penalty being enacted, but I think it’s incumbent upon citizens, if they endorse this action — perhaps especially if they endorse this action by a state government — to acknowledge that it takes place, and to look at it.”

Ilhan Omar gave a succint response to a question posed to her by a reporter from the right-wing Daily Caller a few weeks ago: “F*ck off.”
Not long ago, a politician uttering the phrase may have shocked the Minnesota electorate’s civil sensibilities. But Omar was evidently satisfied with the interaction — she later tweeted it out  — and in a matter of days, if not hours, even conservative posters had moved on.
It took awhile to reach the Upper Midwest, but Democrats here have joined a national trend, employing the kind of crass language that Donald Trump ushered into the political discourse almost a decade ago.
Back in October, less than a month before he and Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris would lose the general election, Gov. Tim Walz revved up a friendly audience in Madison.
“Elon’s on that stage, jumping around, skipping like a dipshit on these things,” Walz said, pausing for the audience’s laughter. He added: “You know it!” 
The moment went viral, and Walz has since repeated the bit, sparking comparisons to Trump’s affinity for name-calling (though “Trump’s remarks were typically directed toward elected officials of color, not white billionaires,” The New York Times noted, helpfully). 
Minnesota Democratic politicians are usually relatively mild in their cussing, but one thing seems clear: They’re cursing more freely, and often with gusto. 
Since the start of Walz’s vice presidential run, he could frequently be heard bemoaning this or that “damn” thing — “Mind your own damn business” — like a dad suffering over his lawnmower engine, or a frustrated high school football coach. 
In a recent town hall in Texas, he said: “How about we just be proud of our policies, take it everywhere, and we will win the damn election on that.”
But he’ll occasionally rip off a more weighty curse word. In a recently published interview with The Atlantic’s Mark Leibovich, Walz said he regretted that neither he nor Harris went on the Joe Rogan podcast during the campaign.
“I’m like, ‘f*ck it,’” Walz said. “Just go.”
Nearly 10 years ago, Trump transformed the way politicians talk, and especially the way they curse: openly and without apology. He won the 2016 election immediately after the publication of a tape in which he infamously described grabbing women’s genitals and has freely used curse words and vulgar language ever since.
Prior to Trump, cursing was scandalous for politicians. Former President Barack Obama once referred to his opponent Mitt Romney as a “bullshitter,” grabbing headlines and sparking Republican outrage. 
So why are Minnesota Democrats suddenly cursing so much?
Politicians swear in part to seem — irony alert — more authentic, said Melissa Mohr, swearing expert and author of “Holy Sh*t: A Brief History of Swearing.”
“A lot of what politicians do in their speeches is quite scripted, and swearing is a way to use language to make it feel like you’re saying things from your heart,” Mohr said.
For Democrats facing the deluge of Trump’s executive actions in the first months of his second term — funding cuts to agencies, mass layoffs, the transfer of immigrants to an El Salvador prison, his defiance of the courts and more — cursing is also a way to emphasize the seriousness of the moment. 
“Usually when we swear, that’s because we’ve got some deep emotion about something, whether it’s pain or frustration or joy,” Mohr said.
But cursing can also backfire when it’s not convincing, Mohr said. 
If voters pick up on a slight hesitation before a bad word, a strange emphasis, or the unusual construction of a phrase, it could signal that the cursing is more of a strategic choice by speechwriters than a genuine burst of emotion from the speaker.
“When it’s not authentic, it comes off as extra not-authentic, and I think that that definitely turns people away,” said Republican lobbyist and local stand-up comedian Brian McDaniel.
As the parties have become more polarized and less inclined to appeal to centrist voters, Republicans — with the notable exception of the commander in chief — have kept their speeches clean so as not to offend the religious base of the party, McDaniel said, whereas Democrats’ cursing can be taken as a way to “stick it to the man.”
Democrats here may have taken a bit longer to jump on the cussing trend because they’re entrenched in the culture of “Minnesota nice.”
Minnesotans and their politicians seem to have a more reserved approach to swearing than people from other regions, though it’s difficult to accurately measure how frequently a population curses. A 2015 map of swear-word frequency compiled by a linguist and based on tweets, seems to indicate that Minnesotans generally swear less, at least in the online public sphere, than people from other areas.
Although lately with the Dems, it’s hard to tell.
On X, DFL Sen. Tina Smith captioned a post by Elon Musk, who was instructing federal employees to send a summary of their accomplishments for the week: “This is the ultimate d*ck boss move from Musk — except he isn’t even the boss, he’s just a d*ck,” Smith wrote. 
And when Smith announced she wouldn’t be seeking re-election, state Senate Majority Leader Erin Murphy’s official statement began with a two-word sentence: “Well shit.” (Murphy later showed more restraint: “My mouth is full of cuss words right now,” she said regarding recent negotiations with Republicans on the final day of the legislative session.)
It’s not just a Minnesota thing: U.S. Sen. Elise Slotkin got fiery and profane recently while urging Democrats to “f*cking retake the flag” and to adopt “the goddamn Alpha energy.”
In the case of both Slotkin and Walz, the cussing shows emotion and seeks to shape Democratic identity, melding it to the working class party of old.  
In this populist moment, Mohr said, swearing codes populist. 
“When you break that mold and you swear,” Mohr said, “it kind of brings you to that ‘ordinary’ person’s level.”",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/WalzCurse-2-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-05-22 07:03:32.601857
,DC,2025-05-22 10:59:54+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,U.S. House Republicans push through massive tax and spending bill slashing Medicaid,"Jennifer Shutt, Ashley Murray",,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-house-republicans-push-through-massive-tax-and-spending-bill-slashing-medicaid,,"WASHINGTON — The U.S. House early Thursday approved the “big, beautiful bill” that Republican leaders spent months negotiating with centrists and far-right members of the party — two distinct factions that hold vastly different policy goals — over intense opposition from Democrats.The 215-214 vote ships the package to the Senate, where GOP lawmakers are expected to rewrite much of it, before sending it back across the Capitol for final approval, a process likely to stretch through the summer.President Donald Trump, who said he backed the House version, would then need to sign the legislation, which under the complicated process being used by Republicans can pass with just a majority vote in the GOP-controlled Senate.Speaker Mike Johnson said minutes before the vote that he expects lawmakers to give the measure final approval before the Fourth of July.“Now, look, we're accomplishing a big thing here today, but we know this isn't the end of the road just yet,” Johnson, R-La., said. “We've been working closely with leader (John) Thune and our Senate colleagues, the Senate Republicans, to get this done and delivered to the President's desk by our Independence Day. That's July 4. Today proves that we can do that, and we will do that.”Two Republicans voted against passing the bill, which members debated throughout the night prior to the vote just after daylight in the nation’s capital. All Democrats, who dubbed it “one big ugly bill,” were opposed. One GOP lawmaker voted “present.”The 1,116-page package combines 11 bills that GOP lawmakers debated and reported out of committee during the last several weeks. The legislation would:Extend the 2017 tax law, including tax cuts for businesses and individuals;Bolster spending on border security and defense by hundreds of billions of dollars;Rework energy permitting;Restructure higher education aid such as student loans and Pell Grants;Shift some of the cost of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program food aid program for low income Americans to state governments; andOverhaul Medicaid, the nation’s program for health care for low income people and some people with disabilities.The bill would make deep cuts to Medicaid spending, reducing the program by $625 billion over 10 years under the latest estimate by the Congressional Budget Office.The budget measure would also raise the debt limit by $4 trillion.A new Congressional Budget Office analysis released late Tuesday showed the package tilted toward the wealthy, projecting it would decrease resources for low-income families over the next decade while increasing resources for top earners.Republicans hold especially thin majorities in the House and Senate, meaning that nearly every GOP lawmaker — ranging from centrists who barely won their general elections to far-right members who are more at risk of losing a primary challenge — needed to support the bill.Balancing the demands of hundreds of lawmakers led to nearly constant talks during the last few days as Johnson struggled to secure the votes to pass the bill before his Memorial Day deadline.Any deal Johnson made with far-right members of the party risked alienating centrist GOP lawmakers and vice versa.An agreement finally came together Wednesday evening when GOP leaders released a 42-page amendment that made changes to various sections of the package, including the state and local tax deduction, or SALT, and Medicaid work requirements and nixed the potential sale of some public lands. This is a developing story that will be updated.",,,,2025-05-22 07:03:32.601857

At residential placements, children under the care of the Department for Children and Families were subjected to hundreds of incidents of restraint and seclusion in 2023 and 2024, data shows. 
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Youth in Vermont custody have been physically restrained hundreds of times in recent years.","Nate Farnham at home in Waterville on Monday, March 17. Photo by Glenn Russell/VTDiggerIn May 2006, when he was 6 years old, Nate Farnham was removed from his mother’s custody by Vermont’s Department for Children and Families. His mother, with whom he no longer speaks, had a substance use disorder, he said. From his home in Cambridge, Farnham was taken to the Brattleboro Retreat, a residential mental health facility, where he spent most of the next year and a half. There, he clashed frequently with others in the program — “I was extremely violent,” Farnham said — and staff routinely used physical force to subdue him.“Take a kid that’s, you know, almost 7 years old, about 100 pounds soaking wet, and lay two people that are (together) upwards of 400-plus pounds on him,” Farnham said. Nearly 20 years later, he said, those incidents of physical restraint have had a profound and lasting impact on him: Physically and psychologically, it was “devastational,” he said.Farnham is among an untold number of Vermont youth who have been subjected to physical force while in state custody over the years. Now, two years of data — the first figures to be released by the state — shows that such incidents have happened hundreds of times just in the recent past.Vermont youth in residential facilities in the custody of the Department for Children and Families were restrained or secluded, meaning forcibly immobilized or isolated in a room, hundreds of times in 2023 and 2024, the new data shows. As recently as last year, according to the data, children as young as 8 were physically restrained, and children as young as 5 were secluded, sometimes for half an hour or longer.Advocates believe those figures are incomplete, recording only a fraction of the incidents that actually occurred. Even so, the data offers a window into the residential facilities where Vermont sends children and teens — and the sometimes-traumatic events that take place there. Administrators at residential facilities contacted by VTDigger said they are constantly trying to reduce the use of restraints and seclusions, but the practices are sometimes necessary for safety reasons. But restraints and seclusion can be dangerous and psychologically damaging. For youth experiencing them, they can represent a traumatic loss of physical autonomy, Matthew Bernstein, Vermont’s Child, Youth, and Family Advocate, said in an interview. “And for a lot of these kids, their bodily autonomy is essentially the last thing they have left,” he said.What are restraint and seclusion?The term “restraint” refers to a practice in which a person is physically held to prevent them from moving. It’s defined by the U.S. Department of Education as “a personal restriction that immobilizes or reduces the ability of a student to move his or her torso, arms, legs, or head freely.”Seclusions, meanwhile, are instances where a youth is isolated in a room to prevent them from causing harm to themselves or others. The tactics are supposed to be used only as a last resort, and only as a safety measure.“The function of restraint is really to provide for a safety environment,” Tyler Allen, who oversees residential facilities for the state Department for Children and Families, said in an interview earlier this year. “Restraint is really grounded in safety practice, and if the environment is safe, then there is more opportunity for therapy.”Both state officials and advocates for youth in state custody agree restraints and seclusions may be unavoidable in some cases. But the tactics can cause injuries and, in some cases, death.In 2021, for example, the parents of a then-15-year-old girl who stayed at the Vermont Permanency Initiative, a Bennington nonprofit that operates the Vermont School for Girls and the New England School for Girls, filed a federal lawsuit alleging that staff there had broken their daughter’s femur during a 2015 restraint. The case was settled under undisclosed terms the next year. A spokesperson for the nonprofit declined to comment on the suit. Through a lawyer, the parents of the child also declined to comment. The tactics can also cause lasting trauma to youths who may already be traumatized. “From a psychological standpoint, it’s never good,” said Farnham, the former resident, who has advocated for stronger oversight of residential youth facilities.Being restrained repeatedly while in state custody, he said, has had a long-lasting impact on his behavior. When in rooms with large crowds, he said, he immediately notes the exits and avoids going to corners — where, as a child in Vermont residential facilities, staff sometimes caught him before a restraint. “If you were to hang out with me for, like, a week,” he said, “you would see all the little things that I do that most people probably would not.”Newly compiled dataUnder a Vermont law that went into effect in 2023, the Department for Children and Families is required to report all instances of restraint and seclusion of youth in state custody — even those housed out of state — to the Office of the Child, Youth, and Family Advocate. VTDigger obtained the first data compiled by the department showing restraints and seclusions in residential facilities in 2023 and 2024.Over that two-year period, youths were physically restrained or isolated over 500 times in roughly a dozen facilities, according to the data. Advocates, state officials and program leaders say a small number of children account for a disproportionate share of the incidents. Fifty-eight individual youths in state custody accounted for the entirety of the incidents for the second half of 2023 and all of 2024, according to the department.It’s difficult to determine what percentage of youth in residential institutions that number represents, but Allen, of the Department for Children and Families, said that it represents just a “fraction” of the total number of youths who spent time in facilities in that time period. “I don’t think this data shows something unusual or something changing or something aberrant,” he said. “But I think we can also acknowledge that restraint and seclusion incidents are not, in and of themself, a therapeutic intervention.”The department believes that its numbers for the second half of 2023 and 2024 are largely accurate: “Our belief is that it is unlikely that there are many (if any) unaccounted individuals in our numbers,” Allen wrote in an email. But the Office of the Child, Youth, and Family Advocate estimates that the real number of incidents is likely in the thousands. The office sometimes hears from youth and family members about incidents of restraint or seclusion that were not counted in the data, the office’s deputy advocate, Lauren Higbee, said in an interview.What’s more, the statute requires the state to report all instances of restraint or seclusion involving youth in the department’s custody, not just those in residential facilities. But Higbee said her office has received no reports of restraints that took place in other settings. “There are still schools to consider, there’s still hospitals to consider, there’s still inpatient psychiatric facilities to consider,” she said. “And we have no reports from them.”The majority of incidents reported in both 2023 and 2024 come from Seall, a residential treatment facility in Bennington. Descriptions of some of the 2023 incidents, written by staffers, provide a sobering picture of life at the facility, recounting episodes where children attempted to harm others or themselves, break objects or escape.In January 2023, a teenager was trying to get into an office room where staff were storing a confiscated vape, according to the description of the incident. When staff told the teen that she could not enter the office, the girl began to act out: She “was laughing and stating she would fight staff and break the door,” the description reads. “(She) did this multiple times, then kicked the staff office door breaking the frame, again trying to get into the office. She was placed in a restraint.”A March 2023 incident involved a teen who “had been struggling with self-harm,” according to a description of the event. “Staff were informed that she may have something in her room to self-harm with. She was searched with a metal detector. When staff left, she was seen grabbing something from under her mattress. Staff attempted to get (her) to hand it over but she wouldn’t. She was put in a hold to get the item from her.”In one July 2023 episode, a child at Seall “was acting out at bedtime and was told he’d be given a consequence if he didn’t stop which upset him,” a description reads. “He began threatening staff. He then kicked staff and was placed in a hold for safety.”‘Individuals with complex needs’Leaders at Vermont’s residential youth facilities said they are actively working to reduce the number of restraints and seclusions they use.Jim Henry, the executive director of Seall, said in an emailed statement that the 2020 closure of Vermont’s only youth detention center, Woodside, had “introduced a unique group of individuals with complex needs” into Seall’s population. That coincided with a “dramatic increase in the use of restraints,” he wrote. The facility has increased staff, shortened employee workweeks and sought to make the space more therapeutic for youths, Henry said, including hosting weekly visits from a therapy dog and adding off-site activities. “We remain deeply aware of the emotional impact that a physical intervention can have on both youth and staff,” Henry said. Vermont Permanency Initiative, the Bennington nonprofit that operates residential facilities there, reported 36 restraints of Vermont youth in 2024. In three of those incidents, 15-year-old youths were restrained for over 15 minutes.Administrators there said in an interview that they meet weekly to discuss the restraints that took place over the past week and trends in the data they collect. A spike in restraints can often be traced to one particular youth struggling with their emotions after just entering the program or with a traumatic incident at home, they said.  Jeff Caron, the president of the Vermont Permanency Initiative, said in an interview that the data does not capture much of the reality on the ground: Youth enter the facility with mental health issues, family trauma, sometimes aggression or tendencies to self-harm. “The numbers have to have context, you know?” he said. “I mean, it’s not that staff are coming in (saying) ‘I can’t wait to put my hands on that kid!’ It’s dealing with the behaviors that we have. And glass cuts people — if they smash a window, you’re gonna hold them.”Jeff Caron, the president of the Vermont Permanency Initiative. Photo by Peter D’Auria/VTDiggerThe Brattleboro Retreat’s Abigail Rockwell Children’s Center, a youth residential treatment program, reported 17 restraints in 2024. One of those incidents, a “supine floor hold” of a 10-year-old child, lasted for 57 minutes, according to the records. Karl Jeffries, the Brattleboro Retreat’s chief medical officer, said in an interview that the program is “always working, absolutely all the time, to do everything we can to not restrain.”Staff there restrain a patient only when there is no other way to ensure their safety or the safety of others, Jeffries said. And “every time one of them happens, we have an organization-wide meeting the next morning to talk about them, review them, and see if there are things that we can do, any ways to decrease the risk of this happening again.”Asked about the nearly hourlong restraint of the 10-year-old, Jeffries said restraints at the organization are usually brief. But one of the cruel ironies of restraints is that a tactic intended to de-escalate a situation can in fact end up prolonging it.“The challenge is that the act of physically holding somebody can really be a provocative event,” Jeffries said.The 2024 data includes incidents from other programs as well. Community House, a Brattleboro nonprofit, reported 46 incidents of restraint, seclusion or “transport” — meaning, physically moving a youth to a safer space — involving children ages 5 to 10. Twenty-nine of those incidents involved seclusion, per the data. A representative of Community House did not respond to phone calls or emails. The facility operates a short-term “stabilization and assessment program,” according to its website.Brookhaven Treatment and Learning Center, in Chelsea, reported two 2024 incidents to the state, both involving a 12-year-old. Both incidents involved a seclusion — one of which lasted for a total of 42 minutes. Rocky Spino, Brookhaven’s executive director, declined to answer questions about the facility’s use of restraints and seclusions.“I would offer that the topic of ‘restraints and seclusions of youth’ is much too comprehensive and nuanced to accurately capture with a quick series of quotes and in the confines of a print media article,” Spino said in an email.A handful of out-of-state facilities, in New Hampshire, Massachusetts and Florida, also reported roughly two dozen restraints and seclusions of Vermont youth in 2024, per the data.‘A system of accountability’Vermont lawmakers are discussing a bill related to restraints and seclusions of youth in state custody, although the legislation is still in its early stages and will not advance until at least next year.The bill, H.30, aims to improve the data being collected and proposes to require “professional development on alternatives to restraint and seclusion” for staff of residential programs.“This is a very simple bill,” Rep. Tiff Bluemle, D-Burlington, the bill’s lead sponsor, said in an interview earlier this year. “It really is focused on building a system of accountability.”The Office of the Child, Youth, and Family Advocate is asking lawmakers to strengthen the bill further by banning particularly dangerous prone restraints outright, and by standardizing and hastening the response times for reporting incidents. “Basically, the concern is that a child will be very seriously injured or killed because there is insufficient oversight of this,” Bernstein, the state’s child advocate, said. Read the story on VTDigger here:  Youth in Vermont custody have been physically restrained hundreds of times in recent years.",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/nate-farnham-2-20250317-1024x681.jpg,,,2025-05-22 07:03:32.601857

(Courtesy of state of Indiana)An Indiana woman who wants to sue the doctor who allegedly used his own sperm to inseminate her mother won an appellate ruling last week.
The Indiana Court of Appeals on May 15 granted the woman’s wishes to allow the case to move forward at the local level. The court ruled that the issue of whether the woman – referred to as “anonymous child”  – filed her claim within the two-year statute of limitations period is an issue to be resolved by a jury. 
“We find that a genuine issue of material fact exists as to when Child learned of facts that would have led a person of reasonable diligence to have discovered the malpractice,” Judge Elaine Brown wrote. 
Opposing counsel contended during oral arguments that the woman was aware of the physician’s role as her parents’ fertility doctor prior to the birth of her own daughter in 2019. They said the statute of limitations for the woman’s claims should have commenced no later than the end of 2021. 
But the woman argued she didn’t know the doctor used his semen in cases where semen was already provided — as her mother and father had. 
When that news hit the media, she ordered a DNA testing kit in 2022 and filed suit shortly thereafter. 
The woman was born in 1985. She learned of her biological father, referred to as the “anonymous physician”, following her viewing of the trailer for the 2022 Netflix documentary “Our Father”. 
The Netflix documentary revealed the medical malpractice case of Dr. Donald Cline, former Indianapolis fertility specialist, who admitted in 2017 to using his own sperm to inseminate patients without their knowledge during the 1970s and 1980s. Although Cline is referred to as “anonymous physician” in the legal proceedings, attorneys discussed the documentary in arguments. 
The woman preferred to keep her identity hidden “because her father – does not know that he is not her father.” 
In July 2022, shortly after receiving her DNA test, the woman filed an anonymous complaint for damages against Cline and an anonymous health care group.
The case will now proceed before the local trial court, and could ultimately be decided by a jury.",https://indianacapitalchronicle.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/5e42f46b68c4c.jpg,,,2025-05-22 07:03:32.601857

Seawright is a social worker in Southeast Wisconsin. She’s also the mother of a 9-year-old boy with complex medical needs resulting from a genetic condition.
She and her husband — a college professor — have medical coverage through work, but with her son’s condition, which includes cerebral palsy, their health plans could never cover the degree of care he requires.
Medicaid has made the difference, Seawright said Wednesday. It’s helped through the Katie Beckett  program, which enables children with disabilities to have Medicaid coverage while living at home instead of being in an institution; the Medicaid children’s long-term support coverage; and Medicaid support that public schools receive to cover certain services that students with disabilities require.
Her son has been able to thrive living with her and her husband, Seawright said — but worry clouds the future.
“We look toward his adulthood, knowing that disability and aging programs that would support him staying in the community — where we, our family and our community, know he belongs — are being dismantled and defunded,” Seawright said. “Forcing us and others like us into medical bankruptcy is not a solution.”
Seawright was one of two parents who said Wednesday that their lives and their children’s lives could be profoundly upended by the Medicaid reductions that are included in the budget reconciliation proposal.
They spoke during a webinar conducted by Sen. Tammy Baldwin (D-Wisconsin), who has been an outspoken critic of the budget bill’s Medicaid cuts.
“Our neighbors, our friends and our colleagues at work who rely on Medicaid and are scared, really scared,” Baldwin said. She cited estimates produced by Democrats on the Joint Economic Committee that with cuts to Medicaid as well as to the Affordable Care Act, the legislation could reduce health care for nearly  14 million Americans, including almost 230,000 Wisconsin residents.
The money saved, she added, would be used to extend and expand tax cuts enacted in 2017, during the first Trump administration. The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities has said the tax cuts primarily favor the wealthy and corporations.
“It’s giveaways for their wealthy friends at the cost of Americans’ health and lives,” Baldwin said. “That’s the deal.”
Baldwin said the choice that U.S. House Republicans made to advance the bill in committee in the early hours of Wednesday morning was a sign that “Republicans know what they’re doing is deeply unpopular.”
She dismissed claims that the objective of the bill’s authors was to address waste, fraud or abuse in Medicaid and other safety net programs.
“I would be happy to come to the table to write a bill that truly gets at fraud and abuse,” Baldwin said. “We want that out of Medicaid. We want that out of Medicare. But that is not what this bill does. This bill terminates health care for Wisconsin families.”
Besides being a mother of a child who has been helped by Medicaid’s programs, Seawright has experienced Medicaid through two other lenses.
When she and her sister were growing up, their mother was relying on Medicaid for the family’s health care. That helped give the family stability so that her mom could go to community college, become a medical assistant and get full-time work in health care with insurance through her employer, Seawright said.
In her own job as a social worker, she added, some of the clients she works with have Medicaid.
Both her childhood experience and her role as a mental health provider have made her critical of proposals to cut Medicaid, Seawright said — especially one to add work requirements as a condition for adults considered “able-bodied” to enroll in Medicaid.  
“Creating more barriers for people to access the care they need … individuals losing their primary care providers and their specialists, from my perspective, is just a cruel response that is steeped in distrust of those of us who are doing the work day to day,” Seawright said.
Also on the webinar was Brooke Wampole, who lives in northern Wisconsin. She and her husband have a 4-year-old son who was found to have long delays in his development.
About two years ago he was screened and qualified for services and therapies covered by Medicaid programs for children with disabilities, and over time, his clinicians helped him first to “exist, to self-regulate, to see the world around him and not find it to be a threat,” Wampole said.
The family’s regular health insurance “could never cover the cost” those treatments required. “ Medicaid programs “have been absolutely instrumental in our lives.”
In the last year, her son has begun speaking one-syllable words. “My favorites or Mommy and Dada,” Wampole said, then added with a smile, “however, he is pretty partial to talking about trapezoids. And raisins.”
The thought of losing Medicaid coverage “is terrifying,” Wampole said — both because of the loss of services for her son, but also because of its impact on other families.
“I worry what our world looks like without Medicaid,” Wampole said. “Other families, they could be way worse off … and cutting Medicaid could hurt them even more than my family. I don’t want to be part of a system that contributes to that.”

(Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)All four Idaho Republican congressmen want the U.S. Small Business Administration, or SBA, to move its Pacific Northwest regional office from Seattle to Idaho.
In March, SBA Administrator Kelly Loeffler announced plans to relocate six of the agency’s regional offices based in cities “that do not comply with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.” The SBA’s Region 10 Office, based in Seattle, covers four states: Idaho, Washington, Oregon and Alaska. 
In a joint letter, U.S. Sens. Jim Risch and Mike Crapo, and U.S. Reps. Mike Simpson and Russ Fulcher wrote, “unlike other states served by the Seattle Office, Idaho has demonstrated a strong commitment to putting American citizens first. Our state has enacted a statewide ban on sanctuary cities, and the Idaho Congressional Delegation has repeatedly worked to prevent illegal immigrants and sanctuary cities from abusing federal funding.”
The SBA is a federal government agency that helps small businesses get loans.
“By relocating the regional office to Idaho, the SBA would ensure its services align with President Trump’s priorities, directly benefitting law-abiding business owners,” the Idaho congressmen continued. 
The SBA has district offices across the U.S. Idaho’s counties are split between being managed by the Boise District and the Seattle District.

The forecasting area covers two busy interstates that frequently see extreme weather. 
The post Staffing shortage, DOGE-led cuts halt Cheyenne’s around-the-clock weather monitoring appeared first on WyoFile .","The National Weather Service ended 24/7 operations at its Cheyenne forecasting office due to a staffing shortage and cuts by the Trump administration’s Department of Government Efficiency. 
The office, which forecasts weather conditions for the southeast corner of Wyoming, does not have enough meteorologists to staff the overnight shift. As with other DOGE-related cuts to services, federal officials aren’t providing many details. 
In response to several written questions — including what the reduced services will mean for forecasting for two interstates that move freight for many industries in the Cheyenne office’s coverage area, or if Wyoming’s only other national forecasting office will absorb the overnight duties — the National Weather Service’s parent agency provided a statement. 
“The National Weather Service continues to meet its core mission of providing life-saving forecasts, warning, and decision support services to the public, our partners and stakeholders,” Kim Doster with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration wrote in the statement. 
“In the near term, NWS has updated the service level standards for its weather forecast offices to manage impacts due to shifting personnel resources. These revised standards reflect the transformation and prioritization of mission-essential operations, while supporting the balance of the operational workload for its workforce. NWS continues to ensure a continuity of service for mission-critical functions.”
The Cheyenne office’s coverage area includes Wyoming’s Albany, Carbon, Converse, Goshen, Laramie, Niobrara and Platte counties, as well as the western Nebraska panhandle. 
‘Rarely quiet’
The area produces “an extremely diverse and rarely quiet set of forecast challenges,” which range from blizzards and snow squalls to very low humidity and high, erratic winds ideal for wildfire combustion, according to a NWS Cheyenne website.  
The area where Colorado, Nebraska and Wyoming meet is also a hotspot for hail — some have even dubbed it “Hail Alley.”
“Storms can produce anything from giant destructive hail to plowable amounts of small to medium sized hail,” the NWS website states.

This time of year, between May and June, the area sees a short river flood season thanks to spring runoff. Flash flooding from thunderstorms and burn scars are responsible for most hydrological challenges in the area. Following the 2020 Mullen Fire, which burned over 175,000 acres west of Laramie, “there are ongoing issues with flash flooding and mudslides in the sensitive ecology left behind,” according to the website. 
“Constant situational awareness and quick thinking are essential to successful hydrological forecasts and warnings here!” 
While the Cheyenne office’s coverage area includes a sparse population compared to its geographical footprint, it also includes two high-traffic corridors — Interstate 80 and Interstate 25. 
The Wyoming Department of Transportation “relies on quick, accurate and localized weather forecasting, and the National Weather Service is one of our partners in providing that information to your employees and the general public,” the agency wrote in a statement to WyoFile. 
“We are working with our partners, including our contracted meteorologist team at Day Weather, to determine the potential impacts of an overnight closure to the Cheyenne NWS office.” 
Help from neighbors
As for weather advisories, will people in the Cheyenne office’s area still receive notice in the event of hazardous or extreme weather?
“The answer is yes,” Tom Fahy, legislative director for the National Weather Service Employees Organization, told WyoFile. 
“Because while there’ll be no staff working overnight in Cheyenne, the [NWS] offices adjacent and around you will be monitoring the conditions,” he said. 
That includes offices in Riverton — the only other NWS forecasting station in Wyoming — as well as Rapid City, North Platte and Boulder.

Staffing challenges
About 600 employees left the National Weather Service between 2010 and 2025, Fahy said. Roughly 600 more have left the agency in the first 90 days of the Trump administration. 
About 100 probationary NWS employees were fired just after inauguration, Fahy said, which includes meteorologists, hydrologists and technical specialists. Two hundred more lost their jobs on Valentine’s Day, alongside an uncounted throng of other federal employees. Another 300 cashed out on early retirement. 
Altogether, that’s meant several other NWS offices across the country do not have enough meteorologists to staff an overnight shift, as the Washington Post reported last week. 
There is an upside, Fahy said, to having surrounding NWS offices monitoring the Cheyenne area during the overnight shift — it amounts to more eyes. But ultimately, the better solution, Fahy said, is for Congress to fully fund the National Weather Service and for the Trump administration to make an exception to the federal hiring freeze. 
“For the price of a cup of coffee, and times that by the population of the United States. That’s the budget for the entire National Weather Service for one year,” Fahy said, which comes out to approximately $1.25 billion. 
“If we all pass the hat and get $3.50 a piece, you’ve got solid weather operations for weather service,” he said. 
Wyoming’s delegation has largely backed the Trump administration’s undertaking to shrink the federal government. Meanwhile, some of their Republican neighbors in Congress have successfully pushed back on DOGE cuts to NWS operations. 
After Nebraska’s all-GOP delegation pressed the White House to restore the agency’s ability to deploy weather balloons in their home state, the Trump administration decided to fund more staff, according to the Nebraska Examiner. 
Neither Sens. John Barrasso and Cynthia Lummis nor Rep. Harriet Hageman responded to WyoFile’s request for comment.

(Photo courtesy of the Idaho National Laboratory)IDAHO FALLS – Members of the Idaho Legislature’s budget committee toured Idaho National Laboratory research facilities Wednesday as the lab is in the process of building its first new nuclear reactors in 50 years. 
Some of INL’s top officials told the Idaho Legislature’s Joint Finance-Appropriations Committee they expected the next four years to usher in a new nuclear renaissance that INL will be at the center of.
“It’s really intended to get INL back into the role of building and operating new reactors on site and supply chains that need to be exercised, getting us back into design and then ultimately building them and operating them,” INL Deputy Director Todd Combs said.
The Joint Finance-Appropriations Committee, or JFAC for short, is a powerful legislative committee that sets all of the budgets for every state agency and department. 
JFAC’s tour included stops at Idaho National Laboratory’s Research and Education Campus located in Idaho Falls as well as the Hot Fuel Examination Facility and the Sample Preparation Laboratory located at the Materials and Fuels Complex.

The Materials and Fuels Complex is part of a vast 890 square-mile research complex located in the desert west of Idaho Falls that is often referred to simply as “the site.”
INL currently operates four nuclear reactors and is considered the country’s leading nuclear energy research and development national laboratory.
  Idaho National Laboratory more than nuclear energy, fuels research hub 

But Combs told JFAC members INL does a lot more than nuclear energy and fuels research. 
INL researchers and staff also focus on cyber security, electric vehicle infrastructure, artificial intelligence, or AI, homeland security and defense. 
INL has built armor for the Abrams tanks and conducted research into vulnerabilities in the electric grid and how to combat those vulnerabilities. 
INL teams have conducted research on electric vehicle infrastructure like charging stations and built the system that powered the Mars Perseverance rover. 
“One might ask, how does this align currently with what the Trump administration is trying to accomplish?” Combs said. “And if you look at executive orders like Unleashing American Energy, and if you look at Secretary of Energy (Chris Wright), his initial memo, and everything he’s been talking about since he took over as secretary of energy, we fall right in line with what they’re trying to accomplish.”
INL celebrated its 75th anniversary last year, and Combs told legislators the lab is growing and ramping up research and operations. Since 2017, INL has grown from about 3,750 employees to 6,500 employees today. 
Since what is now known as INL was founded in 1949, 52 reactors have been built and demonstrated on the site, Combs said.
INL currently operates four nuclear reactors, but the lab is in the process of building its first new reactors in 50 years.
“We’ve got a number of projects right now over the next decade that are coming online as well that are going to be reactors, 53 and 54 and beyond,” Combs said. 
INL made headlines last month when state officials and Department of Energy officials announced a waiver to a 1995 nuclear waste settlement agreement that allows for the shipment of spent nuclear fuel into Idaho for research at INL. A waiver was necessary because the 1995 settlement agreement called for limiting new shipments of spent nuclear fuel into Idaho and removing certain types of spent nuclear fuel in order to prevent the state from becoming a dumping ground for the nation’s spent nuclear fuel.
 Tour allows legislators to get closer look at research facilities located in eastern Idaho 

Although the Idaho Legislature adjourned the 2025 legislative session on April 4 and is not in session now, JFAC regularly conducts interim meetings to keep an eye on the state budget and learn about how different agencies and organizations spend the money that JFAC approves in the budget every year.
“I’ve never been out there (to INL’s site),” Sen. Scott Grow, R-Eagle, said. “Born and raised in Idaho. You would think I would have (visited before), but no. I loved it, and it was fascinating. The thing that really grabbed me was they did so much more than just the nuclear energy. I had no idea about the tanks and all that kind of stuff they’re doing, and the AI. It’s just cutting-edge scientific stuff going on out there.”

“It’s good, I think, for the whole JFAC bench to get a chance to see that and to see we’ve been involved in buying buildings (that INL uses),” Grow added. “The state is involved in this, even though we tend to think that it’s a federal (facility).”
A clear highlight for several JFAC members was entering a hot room at the Sample Preparation Laboratory that is under construction at the site. There isn’t yet any nuclear material in the hot room because it is under construction. But once nuclear materials enter the facility, the public won’t be able to enter the hot room that JFAC members entered Wednesday. 
Legislators did not vote on any bills or budgets during the three-day interim meeting tour. 
The tour kicked off Monday at College of Eastern Idaho, where two health care officials told legislators that Idaho’s near total abortion ban has caused OB-GYNs and other medical professionals to leave the state. 

JFAC members may conduct a fall interim tour this year as well, although a legislative staffer told the Idaho Capital Sun on Wednesday that plans are not finalized.
The next regular session of the Idaho Legislature is scheduled to begin in January.
Rep. Wendy Horman, an Idaho Falls Republican who serves as a JFAC co-chair with Grow, said the entire three-day spring tour was valuable.
Horman said the tour gave legislators who normally work out of the Idaho State Capitol in Boise a rare opportunity to get a closer look at important facilities and programs located in eastern Idaho that they might not have otherwise seen.  
“I was so proud to see the way our community here welcomes legislators from across the state, and wanted to share with us the great things they’re doing to help the citizens of Idaho,” Horman said.  
An Idaho Capita Sun reporter participated in the entirety of Wednesday’s tour of INL facilities, and the reporter agreed not to take any photos, in accordance with INL’s photo policy. Instead, an INL photographer documented the JFAC tour.

One of the greatest planetary migrations in the world is happening just overhead. Guest columnist Dave Throgmorton advises it's good for us to pause and take it in.
The post Feeling down? Look up! appeared first on WyoFile .","There is much to love about spring in Wyoming, and I would like to suggest one more way to appreciate the natural beauty of our state. 

Opinion

On May 9 some 440,000 birds migrated across Carbon County. They traveled northeast at a speed of about 30 mph. We didn’t notice them because they were flying mainly between 9 p.m. and 3 a.m. but also because they were flying at about 3,000 feet.
Even though I can’t see them, knowing an epic journey is unfolding above me instills a sense of wonder and awe I find comforting, given the tumult in the world right now. 
Among the birds migrating north across Carbon County were Bullock’s orioles (just appeared last week!), yellow warblers, black headed grosbeaks and blue-winged teals. The American avocets showed up on May 2 when we had an epic 1,264,200 fly over. Mostly, we are seeing waterfowl, but the ruby-crowned kinglets and their cousins will show up any day now.
I know this because I follow a site called Birdcast. Designed by Cornell Labs, it tracks bird migrations across every county in the contiguous United States every spring and fall. Their website — birdcast.info — tells a great story about how they came to be able to make such predictions following the development of more and more sophisticated radar equipment and satellites.
At the end of the day, the system relies on normal people observing the lives of the birds around them and reporting what they see. Sometimes we don’t see birds so much as we hear them. I know the grosbeaks are in Carbon County because I heard one on the grounds of the Wyoming Frontier Prison, though I never spotted it. I can’t identify anything other than the common birds in the neighborhood by sound, but another Cornell Labs program can. 
The Merlin Bird ID app can be downloaded for free on your phone and has a recording function that can identify birds by their songs, chirps, cackles or other noises. I’ve used it across the U.S. and in Honduras. Yesterday, it picked the brown-headed catbird out of a cacophony of starlings, grackles and red-winged blackbirds (the latter of which seems to have an unusual presence in Rawlins this spring). 
It has been well substantiated that birds are the direct descendants of dinosaurs. Scientific American has a short summary about how we know this, but it is increasingly likely that birds evolved from theropods: velociraptors, T. rexes and the like. So it turns out The Flintstones was a documentary! We still walk the planet while millions of dinosaurs fly overhead.
Somehow, that seems to put the absurdity of the moment, of any moment, into a new frame. And a new frame is always helpful.
So while you are enjoying spring as it splashes color across our landscape, look up and enjoy how your county plays a part in the flight of the dinosaurs, one of the greatest planetary migrations in the world. Just keep your mouth closed.

(Photo: Lucas Dufalla, Arkansas Democrat-Gazette)CAVE CITY, Ark. — When a severe tornado tore through Cave City, Arkansas in March, retiree Debra Lindsey was in her trailer home with her husband.
“I didn’t even know there was a tornado on the ground until the sirens went off, and then in 45 seconds it was here,” Lindsey said. “It was very scary. If it would’ve been 100 to 150 feet closer to here, it would’ve taken the front of our trailer off.”
Even without a direct hit, she estimated that the damage to their home and property was between $30,000 and $40,000. Their storage buildings were destroyed, along with their two vehicles. And the insurance company won’t cover everything. 
Across the street, Robert and Kymberlie Watson sat out the tornadoes with their seven children in the nearest storm shelter. When they returned, they found roughly $60,000 worth of damage to their property. 
About one month after the tornadoes, the Trump Administration denied Arkansas’ request for a major disaster declaration. The declaration would have brought federal funds into the state to help with recovery. Both families thought they’d have to pay out-of-pocket for repairs.
The power to grant a disaster declaration and access to the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s assistance programs lies solely in the hands of the president, and President Donald Trump’s administration is looking to significantly scale back FEMA and pass disaster recovery costs onto states.
Lindsey, a disabled retired nurse, feared that the lack of federal assistance for their home repairs would force her back into the workforce.

Another round of severe weather walloped the Lower Mississippi River Basin in early April, causing extensive flooding and more tornado damage in parts of Arkansas, Tennessee, Kentucky and Mississippi.
Then, some good news: the Trump Administration reversed course on May 13 after an appeal and a personal plea from Arkansas Governor Sarah Huckabee Sanders. The president granted a major disaster declaration, allowing individuals like Lindsey and the Watsons to apply for aid.
“If we get some help out of it, that’s absolutely amazing. We could really use it,” Kymberlie Watson said. “We’re surprised, a little bit … because the government actually stepped up and helped its citizens.”
Cave City may not be so lucky. Trump has yet to approve recovery assistance to public entities which may leave local governments — including the town of less than 2,000 residents — with big bills. On May 3, Sanders submitted another disaster declaration application asking for extensive public assistance. Requests for FEMA aid from Mississippi, Missouri and Tennessee also remain outstanding, though the Trump Administration did grant Kentucky’s request.
“President Trump and his administration will continue working to further empower state and local governments to build their own resilience before disaster strikes and to execute rapid, smart response when supplemental federal assistance is required to truly protect citizens and aid a return to normalcy,” a White House official wrote the Desk by email.
Cave City pushes forward
Cave City Mayor Jonas Anderson was at a ribbon-cutting event for the city’s ambulance service when he learned of the initial rejection from the Trump Administration. His first thought?
“You have got to be kidding me,” he said.
  Cave City, Ark. Mayor Jonas Anderson motions toward a storm-damaged home. Cave City could be on the hook for roughly $300,000 in damages. (Photo: Lucas Dufalla, Arkansas Democrat-Gazette)
Anderson estimated that some 50 Cave City homes were damaged in the March tornado, and 25 of those were completely destroyed. He said underinsurance was likely a huge issue in the community, and the costs for the city to remove all the debris might run over $300,000 for a municipality that only has an annual budget of around $1.4 million. Cave City also lost its only grocery store, forcing residents to drive 20 to 30 minutes to nearby towns for necessities.
A disaster declaration opens up potential programs for state and local governments to recoup some money spent on removing debris and repairing infrastructure. It can also unlock assistance programs for individuals, including post-disaster support services and financial aid for people who are uninsured or underinsured. Not all programs are offered for every disaster.
After a disaster, government personnel assess the cost of damage. Sanders’ requests for federal disaster aid for dozens of counties mostly in the Arkansas Delta estimated public damages at over $21 million from both the March and April storms, including more than $3 million in Sharp County, home to part of Cave City. 

        !function(){“use strict”;window.addEventListener(“message”,(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[“datawrapper-height”]){var e=document.querySelectorAll(“iframe”);for(var t in a.data[“datawrapper-height”])for(var r,i=0;r=e[i];i++)if(r.contentWindow===a.source){var d=a.data[“datawrapper-height”][t]+”px”;r.style.height=d}}}))}();

FEMA uses cost per capita to gauge whether local and state governments can handle recovery themselves, or if they’ll need federal help. Those thresholds currently stand at $4.72 per capita for counties and $1.89 per capita for states. Per capita damages for Sharp County, where Cave City is located, are estimated at $179.
But meeting those thresholds does not guarantee that the president will approve a disaster declaration. A president is not required to justify their decision, and documentation of the reasons for denial is considered privileged — not public record.
Sanders released a statement thanking the Trump administration for finally delivering individual assistance, but did not mention her second, outstanding request for public assistance and additional funds. She also expressed support for Trump’s efforts to reform FEMA.
“Our entire state is grateful for President Trump’s leadership and assistance as we recover from the devastating storms that struck Arkansas earlier this spring,” Sanders said. “I had a productive conversation with the President in which he expressed his support for our state and I offered my full endorsement of his plans to reform FEMA to save money and provide greater direct assistance to disaster victims.” 
Fema Politics
Over the past two years, the Biden Administration provided more than $101 million in public disaster recovery funding to Arkansas, according to FEMA data. And before that, the first Trump Administration gave Arkansas more than $101 million in federal disaster recovery assistance between 2017 and 2020. 
States in the Lower Mississippi River Basin have received more than $31.3 billion in federal public recovery assistance following natural disasters since 1998, according to FEMA data. Hurricane response has consistently required the most federal assistance. 
In recent years, there have been more requests for disaster declarations and more of them have been approved than denied. Between 1953 and 1999, Lower Mississippi River Basin states saw two approvals for every one denial. Within the last 25 years, the approval ratio rose to 5-1.
John Gasper, an associate professor of economics at Carnegie Mellon University’s Tepper School of Business, found in a 2015 analysis of county-level FEMA data from 1992 through 2005 that the chance of a denial is lower when the president and governor belong to the same political party. In “non-election years or non-opportune times,” denials typically follow FEMA’s unofficial guidelines, he said in a May interview.
There are two reasons for FEMA aid’s president-centric policy design, Gasper said: the federal government wants the ability to grant aid in “marginal cases that don’t make the threshold but still are clear disasters,” and politicians realize the benefits of giving aid to constituents.
“In an election year, it’s a great opportunity for a campaigning official to come in, do photo ops, roll up their sleeves, etcetera,” he said. “In non-election years, they have less concern there, so the probability of denial goes up substantially.”
The denial of Arkansas’ initial request for help was “shocking,” said Anderson. Sanders, who worked as press secretary for President Trump for part of his first term, credited her access to the president for her appeal’s eventual success.  
Changes at FEMA have further muddied the process of requesting and obtaining disaster assistance. Since January, the Trump administration has dismissed hundreds of FEMA employees and scrapped an agency program funding disaster prevention efforts in states and municipalities. The Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities program had made $5 billion in grant money available since 2020, awarding over $12 million to Arkansas, Mississippi and Tennessee through 2023.
Federal officials have also discussed making it harder to secure funds after a disaster. In an internal memo obtained by CNN, former acting FEMA administrator Cameron Hamilton proposed various reforms to curb the agency’s disaster spending, including quadrupling the financial burden states must sustain to qualify for public aid. Hamilton was fired weeks later, and state officials say they have received no word regarding changes to FEMA’s public assistance threshold. 
While the higher benchmark proposed by Hamilton has not been adopted publicly, the low number of disaster declarations approved so far this year suggests the White House is following new standards for public aid eligibility, one emergency management expert explained.
“We don’t have to wait for an official guidance on this. We know that the bar has shifted,” said Bryan Koon, who led Florida’s Division of Emergency Management from 2011 to 2017 and is CEO of IEM, a disaster management consulting firm. “What got you a declaration in 2024 and earlier is not going to get you a disaster declaration in 2025.”
Hamilton’s replacement at FEMA, David Richardson, reportedly held a meeting with staff where he said a large part of the response and recovery would be put on states under his leadership, according to Drop Site News.
Bipartisan support for disaster aid reform does exist, but Trump’s FEMA overhaul has sparked concern among state emergency management officials, who say they aren’t prepared to take over disaster funding responsibilities from the agency.
Such a transition would require extensive guidance from the administration and planning from state and local governments, said Lynn Budd, president of the National Emergency Management Association and director of Wyoming’s Office of Homeland Security. Reducing FEMA assistance with little clarity or advance notice risks leaving communities unprepared for disasters moving forward, she added.
Even with clearer messaging from the administration, scaling back FEMA support would require states to make tough choices on how to cover disaster costs and budget for future emergencies, Koon explained. Reallocating funds toward disaster management would mean cuts to other services, and states would have to lean heavily on volunteer organizations to fill financial and staffing gaps.
“States are going to have to adapt,” Koon said. “It’s going to be a lot more of a patchwork of support to make up for what would have come from the federal government.”
Koon emphasized that shifting disaster expenses to states would also mean higher costs for residents. Households will have to purchase broader insurance coverage in the absence of FEMA assistance, he explained, and families will have to pay for damage previously covered by the agency.
In Mississippi, where residents are still recovering from the same storms and tornadoes that struck Arkansas in mid-March, emergency management officials said they will continue looking to FEMA for disaster assistance until they are instructed otherwise. The state is awaiting a decision from the White House on its own disaster declaration request, and officials said they won’t adjust operations or request additional funding from the legislature without more guidance from the administration.
“We have received no indication from FEMA about any proposed changes to formulas that determine federal disaster assistance,” said Scott Simmons, director of external affairs at the Mississippi Emergency Management Agency. “Until the rules of the game change, we’re going to continue playing by the rules.”
Others are looking ahead at how states could respond if FEMA steps back.
States already play active roles in recovery but they “need to become a little bit more proficient and get help in coordinating and answering disasters together,” Colin Wellenkamp, executive director of the Mississippi River Cities and Towns Initiative, a coalition of more than 100 mayors of river basin cities, said in early April following severe flooding along the river.

Flooding on the Mississippi River typically impacts all of its 10 bordering states, he said, so if states do take on more responsibility, they would need to work “in tandem” to coordinate recovery efforts.
“That isn’t necessarily something that happens through the FEMA process,” Wellenkamp said. 
A new round of storms and tornadoes swept through the basin in mid-May, leaving major damage in St. Louis, Mo. And hurricane season begins June 1. Researchers are predicting above average activity this year.
With the Trump administration’s new approach to FEMA aid, Anderson worries that recovery for small places like Cave City may become even harder.
“There’s just things the Federal government has been or should be doing…they’re just a lot more equipped to handle that than a city or a state,”Anderson said. It’s an imperfect process and he added that “numbers on a spreadsheet don’t always tell the human story.”

(Photo: Jennifer Shutt/States Newsroom)Proposed cuts in federal healthcare spending on Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act could force more than 250,000 Tennesseans to join the ranks of the uninsured, an analysis by the Kaiser Family Foundation found. 
Healthcare advocates are closely following House debate over a legislative package that would make significant changes to Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act (ACA) marketplaces. 
The reconciliation bill would cut Medicaid spending nationwide by at least $716 billion, representing the single largest cut in the program’s history, a separate analysis by the Congressional Budget Office found. 
The bill would achieve those cuts in a variety of ways, including by introducing stricter enrollment and work requirements for the low-income and disabled Tennesseans who rely on TennCare, Tennessee’s Medicaid program.
The bill would also eliminate so-called premium tax credits that have helped individuals purchase their own health insurance on the Affordable Care Act marketplace. 
Together, the two provisions could cost between 190,000 – 310,000 Tennesseans access to TennCare or private insurance through the healthcare marketplace, according to Kaiser Family Foundation.
Much, however, remains in flux about the final language of the omnibus federal spending bill as it heads to a vote on the House floor. The bill includes a significant increase in spending on immigration enforcement and an extension of tax cuts created during President Donald Trump’s first administration.

(Photo courtesy of Carol Chapin)This week, the U.S. House of Representatives and Wisconsin’s Republican members — U.S. Reps. Bryan Steil, Derrick Van Orden, Glenn Grothman, Scott Fitzgerald, Tony Wied and Tom Tiffany — are supporting a budget that would slash federal Medicaid funding by $790 billion, according to the latest Congressional Budget Office estimate. 
For my family, this isn’t just a number on a budget sheet somewhere in Washington. For us, it is deeply personal. These cuts have the potential to devastate our lives.
My son Liam lives with a developmental disability. Thanks to Medicaid — and more specifically, a category known as Home and Community-Based Services (HCBS) — he’s able to live independently in his own apartment. He receives support each day to help him manage meals, take his medications, and safely get to his two part-time jobs using paratransit.
He volunteers at a local food pantry. He makes art. He participates in community programs for people with disabilities. He takes community college courses and continuing education classes, and his goal is an associate’s degree in architectural technology. He’s proud to call Madison’s Eastmoreland neighborhood home.
All of this is possible because of Medicaid. But the Home and Community-Based Services that make his life possible are considered “optional” under federal Medicaid law. They’re on the chopping block if Congress moves forward with the proposed cuts.
If the federal government cuts its share of Medicaid funding, our state will face a painful decision. We will either use more state dollars to fill the gap, or make cuts — fewer people covered, fewer services, lower provider pay. For Liam and others, that means less support, fewer community programs and a greater risk of institutionalization. 
Even with Medicaid, it took our family years to find a supportive care agency with an opening. These services are already stretched to the limit. Some Republican members of Congress are advocating for hard caps on Medicaid costs which would further degrade these essential programs.
Medicaid is not just an insurance program. It is the infrastructure that makes independent living possible for people with disabilities. And it is already under strain. Here in Wisconsin, some disability advocacy organizations have gone months without federal funding due to administrative budget cuts. The signs are all around us: The safety net is fraying. 
If Congress ultimately cuts federal Medicaid spending, we will witness the unraveling of vital support systems: most critically, Home and Community-Based Services. For thousands of people like Liam, this would mean being forced from their homes, with many facing the possibility of institutionalization.
Keeping people in their homes has been a bipartisan issue for decades. Home and Community-Based Services are both significantly cheaper and more empowering for our community-members with disabilities. 
I urge our elected officials — especially those who have said they want to protect “the vulnerable” — to stop these irresponsible cuts to Medicaid. Liam’s life, and the lives of so many others in Wisconsin, depend on it.

(Michael Loccisano | Getty Images)As another school year ends, superintendents across the United States are staring down an autumn staffing crisis, with 1 in 8 teaching positions either vacant or filled by an underqualified educator.
States that are struggling with post-pandemic teacher shortages have spent millions to lure replacements and retain veterans with hiring bonuses and bumps in salaries. But hiring gaps remain, so some states also are trying another tactic: changing their standards.
The changes in teacher training and licensing come amid widespread turmoil in public schools: Tax revenue is being siphoned toward private school vouchers in many states; some classrooms are being scrutinized for banned books, displays or teaching lessons that trip into diversity, equity and inclusion territory; and students who went through pandemic-era shutdowns are struggling both with sitting still and with learning the material.
Some surveys show that fewer than a fifth of teachers are happy in their jobs.
“Teaching is not seen as an attractive profession right now,” said Drew Gitomer, an expert on teaching assessment at Rutgers Graduate School of Education.
“COVID exacerbated things, and teachers are caught in the middle of political battles — over curriculum, book bans, even personal attacks,” he said. “It’s not a healthy work environment, and that drives people away.”










Teaching is not seen as an attractive profession right now.


– Drew Gitomer, an expert on teaching assessment at Rutgers Graduate School of Education


Last year, Illinois enacted a law allowing teacher candidates to begin student teaching before passing content-area exams. It was an effort to reduce barriers for underrepresented groups, the measure’s sponsor said.
A bill under consideration this year would give more districts discretion over whether to factor pupils’ test scores into teacher evaluations, a break from a 15-year-old mandate.
In New Jersey, a new law formally removes the Praxis Core exam — traditionally used as an entry-level screening tool for aspiring teachers — from certification requirements.
And in Nevada — one of the states hit hardest by teacher shortages — a bill would streamline licensure for incoming educators. The bill would allow teachers credentialed in other states to begin working in Nevada classrooms while awaiting formal approval.
It also would remove extra steps for teachers switching grade levels and would waive application fees for recent substitute teachers.
Linda Darling-Hammond, founding president and chief knowledge officer of the Learning Policy Institute, a nonpartisan think tank, said teacher shortages hit hardest in schools serving low-income students and students of color, where instability often leads to larger class sizes, canceled courses or a revolving door of substitute teachers.
“When you walk into a school facing shortages, you see instability,” she said. “Students may be taught by people who don’t know what to do, who leave quickly, and who often rely more on discipline than engagement.”
The root cause? Teacher attrition.
“Nine out of 10 vacancies every year are because of attrition — and two-thirds of that is not retirement,” Darling-Hammond said. “Support in the beginning matters. Teachers who come in and get a mentor stay longer. If you’re just thrown in to sink or swim, the odds of leaving are much greater.”

States have long struggled to attract teachers, and credentialing changes aren’t unusual. But some education advocates fear long-term repercussions.
Melissa Tooley, director of K-12 educator quality at the left-leaning think tank New America, said most states now offer alternative and fast-track teacher certification pathways, many of which allow candidates to start teaching with little or no pedagogical training in how to teach.
“We’re churning through people who might have potential, but we’re not setting them up for success,” she said. “A lot of what states are doing is short term. It’s about filling seats, not necessarily building a sustainable or high-quality workforce.”
More than 40 states require aspiring teachers to take the costly Praxis Subject test for the subject they want to teach, which some experts argue excludes strong candidates and duplicates other assessments.
“You were excluding people who might be good teachers but didn’t do well on that specific test,” said Rutgers’ Gitomer, who has researched the test’s effects on recruitment.
However, he added, dropping tests doesn’t necessarily help.
Several states — Georgia, New Jersey, New York, Washington and Wisconsin — have dropped a licensure requirement known as edTPA since 2022, but there’s little evidence the move has helped ease teacher shortages, Gitomer said. (The acronym stands for Educative Teacher Performance Assessment and involves a portfolio that includes testing and videos of classroom performance.)
“The state eliminated edTPA but didn’t replace it with a specific alternative,” he said.
“Instead, it gave full discretion back to individual institutions to develop or adopt their own performance assessments,” he said. “When we talked to institutions, it became pretty clear they didn’t think removing edTPA would be a major driver in addressing the shortage — and they haven’t seen evidence that it has been.”
How best to credential
Tooley said state credentialing systems must navigate a delicate balance: ensuring there are enough teachers, maintaining instructional quality and increasing workforce diversity.
“There’s this triangle — three pieces that need to be in place — and I think there are real tensions when it comes to how states are designing their certification policies,” she said.
And Gitomer described a fragmented national landscape, where some states are tightening teacher entry standards while others are dramatically loosening them — even allowing non-degreed individuals to teach.
“Some states are trying to raise standards; others are relaxing them to the point where you may not even need a college degree,” he said.
Indiana now requires all pre-K through grade 6 and special education teachers to complete 80 hours of training on the “science of reading,” a method that includes phonics, and pass an exam by 2027. State Sen. Jean Leising, a Republican, has proposed cutting the requirement in half, calling it “an excessive burden with little actual benefit” in a news release.
In Texas, a bill aims to reduce the use of uncertified teachers by the 2029-30 school year. The legislation would set a gradual cap on the percentage of uncertified teachers districts can employ in core curriculum classes — starting at 20% in 2026-27 and decreasing to 5% in 2029-30.
According to the Texas Education Agency, 31% of new hires in 2024-25 lacked a state teaching certificate or permit.
Yet some states stand out for how they’re changing their requirements, Tooley said.
She pointed to Washington, which has designed a recruitment strategy encouraging paraprofessionals, often known as teacher’s aides, to become classroom teachers. Also known as paraeducators, they’re a group with classroom experience, community ties and higher retention likelihood.
There, school districts are required to offer foundational training — ranging from 14 to 28 hours — directly to paraeducators.
In West Virginia, a new law now allows districts to count full-time behavior interventionists working in one or two classrooms toward meeting the required number of aides or paraprofessionals in K-3 classrooms.
Tooley noted that Pennsylvania and Alabama are experimenting with “menu-style” licensing flexibility — allowing candidates to demonstrate qualification through various combinations of GPA and test scores, rather than rigid cutoffs.
“These are people already in schools, often from the same cultural or linguistic backgrounds as students,” Tooley said. “They’re more likely to succeed and to stay.”
Low pay
A 2024 national survey by the EdWeek Research Center found that public school teachers are increasingly reporting declines in mental health, job satisfaction and classroom stability. Seventy percent of teachers recommended student mental health interventions, and nearly half said schools lack enough counselors, psychologists and social workers.
As mental well-being has worsened, the share of public school teachers who are very satisfied with their jobs has also declined by 2 percentage points from the previous year, to 18%, according to the survey, which was conducted by the EdWeek Research Center on behalf of Merrimack College.
While teacher wellness supports remain limited, educators say improvements in pay and student discipline are the most needed changes.
To entice passionate but burned out educators from leaving the workforce, several states have raised minimum teacher pay. Arkansas boosted salaries to $50,000 statewide, and South Carolina raised starting pay to $47,000 this year, giving it a boost to $48,500 next school year. South Dakota enacted a $45,000 minimum with yearly increases, and penalties for districts that fail to comply by 2026. Connecticut advanced a bill setting a $63,450 salary floor, while Indiana and others are eyeing further increases.
At the federal level, the proposed American Teacher Act seeks to establish a national $60,000 minimum salary for teachers at a qualifying school to boost recruitment and retention across the country. The bill, sponsored by U.S. Rep. Frederica Wilson, a Florida Democrat, remains in committee.

Angela Rigas, chair of the Michigan House Oversight Subcommittee on the Weaponization of Government, released a scathing statement Wednesday evening blasting Attorney General Dana Nessel over continued delays in producing requested documents related to the Flint water criminal prosecutions.
Nessel’s office delivered numerous documents to Rigas’s office on Wednesday, but the representative said it was not at all what she requested.
“Dana Nessel’s office sent us an incomplete, incoherent mess of documents on a password-protected flash drive like they were bringing us the Holy Grail,” Rigas said. 
Rigas had requested documents related to the legal battles that ensued during Nessel’s term and in the aftermath of Flint’s water supply being contaminated in 2014. The contamination occurred due to a switch of the water supply without proper lead contamination prevention.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOXFormer Attorney General Bill Schuette began an investigation and prosecution, the latter of which began in 2016. Schuette charged a city of Flint employee and two employees with what was then known as the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality [now known as the Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy].
Nessel became attorney general in 2018 and scuttled Schuette’s investigation and prosecution to begin anew in 2021. She formed a Flint water prosecution team led by Wayne County Prosecutor Kym Worthy and former Michigan Solicitor General Fadwa Hammoud while Nessel spearheaded the civil litigation side, which resulted in a mammoth settlement.
The criminal cases resulted in charges against former Governor Rick Snyder and several members of his administration, but those charges were later dismissed after the Michigan Supreme Court ruled that the prosecutorial team had used a one-man grand jury process to indict them without at first holding a preliminary examination that would have given the defendants a chance to poke holes in the attorney general’s presentation of probable cause.
Justices of the high court ruled the process as unconstitutional, and the charges were dismissed shortly thereafter.
Rigas (R-Caledonia) as the chair of the House Oversight subcommittee, requested records from Nessel on March 12 with a deadline of March 25 to give the subcommittee various documents. The request included a comprehensive itemized list of all billable hours, legal fees and associated costs incurred during Nessel’s tenure as attorney general, including personnel time, outside counsel and expert witnesses; a breakdown of all state funds allocated and expended on these cases; copies of contracts and invoices or memorandums of understanding with third parties retained by her office; and a summary of reimbursements, settlements or cost recoveries tied to the cases.
Nessel requested an eight-week extension, which Rigas granted, with a deadline of Tuesday.
Rigas in a news release issued Wednesday evening said the attorney general’s staff brought a password protected flash drive to Rigas’ office, which was also shared with some members of the Lansing Capitol press corps. Nessel’s office also shared a copy of a letter sent to Rigas’ office on Tuesday indicating that the document haul was just one half of those requested by Rigas and that the other portion would be delivered to the representative on or before June 17.
Rigas said that the flash drive contained “a mass array of unrelated documents that were never requested, mostly from [former Attorney General] Bill Schuette’s tenure.” The documents delivered to Rigas mostly contained contracts with attorneys and appointed special counsel Todd Flood and various invoices from Flood’s office.
Needless to say, Rigas was unhappy with what was turned over to her office.
“[Nessel] and her office have consistently failed to meet deadline after deadline, and it’s unacceptable,” Rigas said. “She has failed to follow simple directions and comply with what has so clearly been requested. There will be no more extensions. No more games. This ends now.”

(Getty Images)An Open Letter to Idaho’s Congressional Delegation:
Beginning Feb. 28 and concluding May 3, we held 11 in-person town hall meetings throughout Idaho — Pocatello, Idaho Falls, Nampa (2), Boise (2), McCall, Lewiston, Moscow, Post Falls, Boise, Twin Falls — to listen to all Idahoans concerned about the chaotic and centralized agenda of President Donald Trump and Elon Musk.

At their core, our statewide meetings amounted to a democracy tour that centered on the foundation of the U.S. Constitution and the duty of elected officials to honor their sacred oaths of office. Deep concerns over the rule of law and due process were repeatedly expressed. We heard distinct fear over exploding executive authority and waning influence from Congress. In fact, concerns over possible implementation of martial law were shared as President Trump expands power in defiance of the courts and Congress.
Attendees repeatedly asked whether the use of the Alien Enemies Act was lawful. Town hall participants queried us about the growing number of constitutional questions before the courts. We were repeatedly asked whether America was in a constitutional crisis. We both affirmed a looming crisis.  
Your avoidance of Idahoans has resulted in your further isolation from the common sense and pragmatism of Idahoans.
During our town halls, Elon Musk shared news cycles with President Trump grotesquely demonstrating how $290 million in 2024 campaign contributions can corrupt our elections and buy a seat adjacent to the Resolute Desk. Idahoans expressed shock at how an unelected billionaire took a chainsaw rather than a scalpel to our government.  
You would have received an earful on the Musk team’s hacking of our most personal data. Idahoans believe they must rely solely on the judiciary to protect citizens’ rights under the Constitution while Congress stands complicit. Our neighbors clearly know the proper bounds of executive power and the constitutional role of checks and balances by Congress in preventing authoritarians from hijacking our democracy. What is unclear are your views on these important subjects.
If you had accompanied us, you would have heard a great deal of anger and frustration over the shock and awe emanating daily from the White House. They voiced serious disdain for the performative executive orders, rambling press statements, revenge-based ad hominem attacks on opponents, sycophantic fawning from cabinet members and daily violations of due process. We heard all of this from your constituents.
Idahoans are not fooled by the White House gaslighting strategy of quickly diverting Americans’ attention from one shiny object to another. It seems like ancient history when you remained silent as 1,600 January 6 insurrectionists were pardoned after rioters disrupted the peaceful transfer of power by violating our Capitol and your offices. You meekly stand by as President Trump upends our 80-year-old international alliances through bullying and belittling.   Idahoans don’t understand why ALL CAPS intemperance has replaced diplomacy.
Town hall attendees expressed concern that MAGA ideologues and tech-capitalists are gunning for our public lands, thereby restricting our ability to hunt, recreate, graze, hike and cherish our magnificent resources. Current and retired public land managers spoke passionately about their love of country and pride in their special knowledge so important to protecting our natural resources.
Concern by rural Idahoans were shared with us. Cuts to Medicaid could cause closures of rural hospitals despite an ballot initiative approved by 61% of Idahoans to expand Medicaid.
The lack of clarity on tariff policies is causing chaos among farmers who rely on exports. Similarly, Idaho small businesses appear to be collateral damage on the mis-handled tariff rollouts. 
The dairy industry is waiting for the next shoe to drop on immigration. Rural school districts are threatened by vouchers prioritizing urban private schools. An end run on clear water standards can threaten anadromous fish runs. Sources of objective news for rural Idaho through the Public Broadcasting System are headed to the chopping block, creating larger news deserts.
Idahoans stated concerns about dark money in the political system. They equate your silence with dollar-fueled intimidation and raised the Citizens United decision on many occasions. Billionaire cabinet members have been confirmed who appear to be ideologically selected and driven primarily by personal loyalty rather than to the Constitution. Idaho has a strong record on human rights that could be displaced with DEI conspiracy theories and anti-woke messaging.  Misinformation is rampant.  
Clearly, town hall participants were upset with Democrats and Republicans alike for allowing President Trump to shatter norms, challenge constitutional safeguards, defy court decisions, govern by executive orders, upend decades-old alliances, prioritize loyalty as a primary qualification for public service, attack institutions based on revenge, lie and dissemble daily, and put our economy and retirement security at risk through chaotic tariff gambles.   
Overall, our town halls were centered on protecting our democracy, rule of law and constitution. We listened. We learned. We were inspired by the patriotism and civic concern of our fellow Idahoans who approached the microphones to speak on issues big and small. In each town hall there was a deep commitment to find common purpose to protect our precious democracy now under attack.

Patrick Morrisey hikes the newest Mountaineer Mile Trail at Summersville Lake State Park in Summersville, W.Va. on May 9, 2025. (West Virginia Office of Gov. Patrick Morrisey video screenshot)

Among the new construction and second-growth forest above the rock cliffs of Summersville Lake, Gov. Patrick Morrisey cut a ribbon, did some media and walked the third Mountaineer Mile hiking tract. Steps from where the local edition of his gubernatorial predecessor’s Almost Heaven Swing offers a selfie-ready sit, the governor walked the loop of the newly designated trail. The obligatory press availability of such festivities involved the governor extolling the virtues of setting an example of “if I can do it, with all the challenges in place, certainly everyone in West Virginia, if you have the chance, get out and walk a mile.” 
While Summersville Lake State Park is the first new officially designated one in over 30 years, West Virginia’s State Parks have long been a source of not only recreational opportunity but local pride. As gateways to some of West Virginia’s best scenery, natural wonders, and preserved environments, the state park system has been the public facing portal for the wild and wonderful for generations. Country roads might take you home, but designated camping and outdoor recreation areas are vital to attracting West Virginia tourism as well as being go-to places for locals. Plus, along with West Virginias, walking is always free in addition to being good for the body as well as the soul.  
The Mountaineer Mile initiative is planned to expand to 32 West Virginia State Parks. The benefits of such a marriage are obvious: Take a new initiative, marry it to one of West Virginia’s most successful state-run programs, let the press and social media streams cross on something that is common sense and everyone across the political spectrum can agree is a good thing. 
But politics, like hiking the hills, isn’t about how you start, it is how you finish. Which is a good thing for Morrisey. The Mountaineer Mile is part of a larger push for healthy legislation, regulation and policy proposals. During a “Make America Healthy Again” joint event in March with Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., Morrisey found himself on the receiving end of what many took to be weight jokes from RFK. The reaction ranged from laughing it off, which is what Morrisey did, to fat shaming accusations in national outlets, to others finding it a cringy and inappropriate break in the West Virginia ethos of “we can poke fun of us and ours, but you can’t” regarding outsiders. 
The viral moment with the highly controversial Kennedy highlights the problem of walking the line between prudent policy and performative politics. Morrisey — to his credit — has the self-awareness to realize that in the highly-visual world of modern politics talking about government-enforced health in others has a prerequisite of taking action and personal accountability himself. That is just common sense, a little media/political savvy, and also good basic leadership. 
Trickier is balancing his current battle to remove soda from SNAP benefits while the southern coalfields of West Virginia are struggling under a water crisis. Or being in lock-step with the still very popular in West Virginia Trump administration’s ongoing efforts to cut federal funding to a state like West Virginia which receives 27% of its annual revenue from Washington, D.C. Or the escalating vaccination fight that has combined health care debates, education issues, and personal freedom with legal questions, contradictory policy and plenty of raw emotions. 
Then there is still the looming need for a legislative special session to potentially deal with a PEIA can that is annually kicked down the road by delegates and state senators who are under the umbrella of a supermajority but have been shown to have plenty of divisions beneath it. 
Medical science tells us exercise in general, and walking specifically, is great not only for physical health but also mental health and stress relief. Trekking out and back from the newly-designated Hughes Ferry Day Use Area at West Virginia’s newest state park on a glorious May day was surely a respite for Morrisey and the many claims on his time and attention. The Mountaineer Mile is one of those initiatives where good policy and good politics meet at a place of agreement. A rare place these days, agreement … one that doesn’t have much demand for a sanctioned hiking trail to get there, nor will have a well-worn trail there and back again. Shame, that. 
Performative politics that has good policy behind it is just good politics and good policy in a good public package. A good politician dreams of such things. A great politician makes such things a reality. But that is a fine line to try and walk for anyone — Morrisey included — for any stretch, let alone a mile. That’s a long way to lug a health initiative that is light on the science and heavy on the internet feels and populist politics. A distance that is still early days in  a four-year term leading the Mountain State into the future. For Morrisey, the start has had missteps in putting in his miles when the performative politics outweighed the prudent policy. We will see how he finishes.

This is the third in a series about homelessness in Western Kentucky.
CENTRAL CITY — Pastor Jennifer Banks and other leaders of Abundant Life Church were not sure what to expect when the mayor of this Western Kentucky town called a meeting to talk about their plans for helping people who are experiencing homelessness.
They had briefed the mayor and a few city officials once before. This time they were surprised to see downtown business owners and other city officials also gathered in the room.
They soon heard that the church’s plan — they had dubbed it the “Beacon of Hope” —  was setting off alarms.

They were warned that their outreach to locals in need would attract — was already attracting — people from other places, raising fears that the community’s already short supply of housing and services would be strained even further. The specter was raised of Austin, Texas, where voters banned panhandling and camping in public places in response to burgeoning encampments.
“What will happen to a city that takes in all of this stuff — it’s destroyed,” said Central City Mayor Tony Armour. “We’re short on homes for people that live here, but the more we reach out for people to come in here, the shorter we’re going to be for homes.”
Zachary Banks provided the Lantern with an audio recording of the meeting.
Mayor Armour did not respond to requests seeking an interview about the December gathering. The Lantern sent emails requesting an interview, left messages by phone and in person at city hall.
During the meeting, Armour said constituents were complaining about seeing homeless people around the church and about water running off from its mobile  shower. “We’ve got major people upset here in the city about the church.” 
Abundant Life had gained a reputation as a place people could come for a meal and other resources. The church had allowed people to sleep in its parking lot when they had nowhere else to go. The Felix Martin Foundation, a local nonprofit, provided a grant to install a mobile shower outside the church.

At one point during the meeting, the mayor said to Jennifer Banks, “You’re not seeing the big picture. You’re seeing the kindness of your heart, and I appreciate that. I love you for that. But you know what? We’re not willing to destroy our community.”
“We’re not either, sir,” Banks responded. “The church was supposed to take care of widows. The church was supposed to take care of orphans. We’re supposed to feed. We’re supposed to clothe, and at the end of the day, Abundant Life Church-Central City is just trying to be that.” 
The meeting ended with tentative plans to meet again and Armour saying there were different visions on “how to move forward and what to do.” 
The mayor and Abundant Life Church leaders haven’t had any meetings since, and the “Beacon of Hope” plan to buy a local motel and transform it into something more is still in the talking stages.

The motel is already a place where people without shelter stay, sometimes paid for by a local church or members of a loose coalition of community members trying to help people experiencing homelessness or unstable housing. 
The “Beacon of Hope” idea for the motel: Turn the rooms into efficiency apartments, where tenants could pay rent to build up a financial record, eventually moving on to other housing. 
Local agencies could come in and provide pop-up services — dental clinics, mental health care — and the church would offer  Bible studies. When asked if the idea would be a form of transitional housing, Jennifer Banks said “what is in our heart fits in no category that already exists.
“If services are offered in one location, even if it’s once a month, even if it’s once every six months — if it’s accessible to you zero times a year, but now it is twice a year, that can change the whole dynamic of everything,” she said.
Jennifer Banks said the church is still in conversations with the owner of the Central Inn about a possible purchase. 
Meanwhile, disagreements over how to help have frayed the informal coalition seeking solutions. Some arguments are over how to help people who are using drugs.  The debates also center on numbers: How many people are experiencing homelessness in Muhlenberg County? Does that number justify something like an emergency shelter?
AsheLynn Andrews, operator of a tattoo shop in Central City, worked closely with Gwen Clements and Abundant Life Church until they split over who and how to help.

In an interview in October, Andrews argued there is no need for a shelter — something she thinks would attract homeless people from other places — because there are only a handful of homeless people in Central City.
Clements, on the other hand, says she knows of dozens of people across Muhlenberg County who are homeless at least art of the time. Numbers are fluid, she said, changing depending on the time of year, weather and individual personal circumstances.
The Point in Time Count — an annual, federally-coordinated count of the number of people experiencing homelessness across the country on one day of the year — counted just one person as unsheltered in Muhlenberg County in 2024.
Advocates for the unhoused and even federal officials acknowledge the count is an underestimate because unsheltered people can be hard to find, the number of volunteers surveying can vary from community to community, the timing of the count in January when it’s cold means fewer people are outside, and the count is only a snapshot of one day. 
Another count by Kentucky school districts that seeks to capture the number of students in unsafe and unstable housing situations reported 34 students, all of them in kindergarten or first grade, in that category in Muhlenberg County during the 2023-24 school year. 
Muhlenberg County spans hundreds of square miles of rolling hills, making it hard sometimes to find people who are known to be without shelter. Finding them becomes urgent when the weather turns dangerous.

In January, the loose coalition sprang into action when bitterly cold air swept across the state, plunging temperatures into the deadly range.
Clements took to Facebook, asking her neighbors for donations to put unhoused people into motel rooms at the Central Inn and another hotel. Debra Gorham, a local food pantry director, met Clements at Wendy’s, and handed her hundreds of dollars Gorham had gathered for the effort. 
Clements knew one of the people she had to find was someone she had known years before he started living outside, a man well known for walking the streets of Central City.
“Sometimes it’s difficult if you’re looking for him, it’s difficult to find him because you don’t know where he’s at, who he’s with, where he’s staying from day to day,” Clements said.
She had to find John Paul Shanks.

(Stock photo by Inti St. Clair/Getty Photos)In Kentucky more than 753,000 residents, or 1 in 6, face hunger. They often don’t know where and when their next meal will be.
That sobering statistic is felt daily across the commonwealth — from families forced to choose between groceries and rent to schools struggling to meet students’ basic needs. 
Food banks and our partners across the state are doing all we can to provide millions of meals annually and coordinate critical emergency support — but we can’t do it alone, and we certainly can’t do it with policy that sends us backward.
But that’s just what’s happening, and hungry Kentuckians will pay the price.
The U.S. House Committee on Agriculture has proposed a plan that would quietly shift the burden and worsen the problem. If passed, the Kentucky budget would be responsible for funding over $150 million annually by 2028 just to maintain current benefit levels. With food insecurity projected to rise, that cost will likely increase even more.
We’re sure federal and state governments will jostle for who is to blame, but the bottom line is simple: Fewer Kentuckians will be able to eat. And that’s why we’re pushing back. 
The proposal under consideration would throw the entire SNAP system off, and there’s no solution being offered. SNAP (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program) works because it can scale up quickly when people are struggling, like after a natural disaster, such as recent tornadoes. States just don’t have the resources to handle that kind of surge.
Keeping SNAP federally funded is the only way to ensure it’s there when people really need it.
Charitable food assistance steps in where other support falls short, but it’s not enough. For every meal provided by the charitable food system, SNAP delivers nine. That ratio matters. Reducing access to SNAP won’t just stretch food banks thinner, it will stretch family budgets to the breaking point.
Hunger is not just about food; it’s about health, learning and opportunity. When children don’t have consistent access to meals, it impacts their development, their education and their future. In Kentucky, 1 in 5 kids faces hunger. When adults don’t have food, they can’t be expected to perform their best at their job. The consequences ripple far beyond the dinner table.
We already know what works. The community eligibility provision helps high-poverty schools serve free meals to all students. Summer EBT provides grocery assistance when school is out. SNAP helps families put food on the table every night. These aren’t luxuries — they’re lifelines. And they’re part of our shared responsibility to ensure no Kentuckian goes hungry.
Kentucky’s food banks are committed to doing our part. But systemic hunger cannot be solved through charity alone. We need policies that protect families and uphold the principle that access to food is a basic human right.
Anyone can experience hunger. A  job loss, medical emergency  or child-care crisis can leave a family facing food insecurity. These programs offer dignity, consistency and hope when it matters most. And no matter our political beliefs, we should agree on this: No legislation should determine who gets to eat and who doesn’t.
Congress can act to protect and strengthen the nutrition programs that keep families afloat and give children a fair shot. We can work together to build a future where no one in Kentucky goes hungry.

The adults are really messing up your world.
Your futures are being threatened by a Trump administration that is attacking universities, trying to get young people to forgo college for factory jobs, making it harder to get and repay student loans, unleashing unregulated artificial intelligence and enacting potentially ruinous tariffs.
It’s no wonder that members of Generation Z, people born between about 1997 and 2010, disapprove of Trump’s economic policies more widely than any other age group, according to a recent national poll.
Trump’s chaotic tariffs are about to nick Michigan’s economy and could lead to an even more serious plunge. A new University of Michigan state economic forecast predicts tariffs on autos, steel and aluminum will destroy 13,000 jobs “over the next several years.”
Michigan is expected to see virtually no job growth in the final nine months of this year before modest growth returns next year, according to the forecast.
The best prospects for new grads and other job seekers are likely to be in “noncyclical” industries, including private education and health services, leisure and hospitality, and government, according to the U-M forecast.
Ninety-five percent of Michigan’s job growth over the next three years is expected to come from noncyclical industries. But proposed deep budget cuts by Trump and the Republicans in education and health care could kill jobs in those areas, too.
Tariffs are expected to hit the manufacturing sector, particularly autos, the hardest. SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Sales of General Motors, Ford and Stellantis vehicles are expected to fall by 200,000 vehicles this year as tariffs boost the average vehicle price by 13.2%, or $6,200, according to a U-M forecast summary presented at last week’s state revenue estimating conference.
U-M economists say their forecast is “very uncertain” because of Trump’s chaotic tariff implementation and the complexity of assessing the effects of the tariffs.
But Michigan’s dependence on the auto industry could lead to hundreds of thousands of lost jobs in a national recession, based on past downturns. And that’s something economists are increasingly concerned about as companies begin to raise tariffs.
Trump is worried, too. The president blew a gasket after Wal-Mart said it will have to pass some its tariff costs to customers, demanding the retail giant “eat the tariffs.” (Funny, Trump has previously insisted that other countries, not U.S. businesses, pay the tariffs.)
Michigan’s economy, because of its heavy reliance on manufacturing and agriculture, is considered to be one of the most vulnerable to the negative effects of tariffs.
Trump and his accomplices see it all differently. They view tariffs as a cudgel to force auto companies and other manufacturers to bring back their plants from foreign countries, reshoring hundreds of thousands of high-paying jobs.
Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said last month that “the great jobs of the future” would be skilled trades positions in auto plants repairing robots and keeping the air conditioning working. These jobs pay between $70,000 and $90,000, he said.
Lutnick made the wildly inflated claim that there are 4,000 to 5,000 of these jobs in a single auto plant. The typical auto plant has fewer than 3,000 workers in total.
“This is the new model where you work in these kinds of plants for the rest of your life and your kids work here and your grandkids work here,” he said.
Really? That sounds like a 1960s employment model to me.
It’s hard to say what the new employment model will be, thanks to the rapid implementation of artificial intelligence.
There are all sorts of predictions about which jobs will be eliminated by AI and which ones will survive. Some experts believe AI could create tens of millions of new jobs involved with implementing this new technology.
The scariest forecast came from Microsoft founder Bill Gates, who recently told “The Tonight Show” host Jimmy Fallon he thinks humans will no longer be needed “for most things” within 10 years.
Democratic and Republican policymakers for years have been pushing skilled trades as an alternative to costly four-year degrees. That effort is accelerating in the belief that these jobs are the least likely to be eliminated by AI.
If would love to be welder, electrician or plumber, I say go for it. You’ll likely find a good-paying job.
But it’s a mistake to dismiss the societal and economic value of having a lot of people with four-year degrees at a time when critical thinking skills, broad knowledge and having a sense of social responsibility are more important than ever.
That’s why some experts are saying that a much-maligned liberal arts education might be just the ticket to prospering in an AI-driven world.
“My instinct is that no one really knows how jobs and careers are going to change and how fast,” Lou Glazer, president of Michigan Future Inc., an Ann Arbor think tank that promotes a more prosperous state, told me.
“So I think the most valuable career success skills are not going to be occupation-specific, but more generalist skills—liberal arts-based,” Glazer said.
I suspect Glazer’s view of the future of work will prove more accurate than Lutnick’s. I hope for the sake of young people soon to enter the workforce that it’s not Gates’.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/graduates-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-05-22 06:03:36.682364

The board also voted unanimously to decertify all three members of an unnamed county’s election commission after hearing the results of its staff’s investigation of complaints about the 2024 general election. The board doesn’t name counties when levying sanctions until the affected county and individuals have an opportunity to respond and either accept or challenge the proposed sanctions.
State law allows the board to conduct election integrity reviews in the odd-numbered years following an election. The board can choose the counties randomly or by a two-thirds vote if it has received information a substantial violation of election or voter registration laws has occurred.
The board issued a letter of reprimand earlier this month to Pulaski County Clerk Terri Hollingsworth over violations of state election law during early voting last year. A deputy clerk changed the street addresses of 132 voters in a precinct file without authorization, according to the SBEC letter. Other clerk’s office employees caught the changes two days later but not before four voters had cast the wrong ballots. The employee resigned shortly after the incident, the letter says.
Unauthorized changes to voter records are considered a felony under A.C.A. 7-1-104, and the SBEC referred the matter to the Pulaski County prosecutor and the attorney general’s Election Integrity Unit.
The SBEC also issued a letter of warning to the Pulaski County clerk for failing to prevent unauthorized changes to voter records.
The election integrity reviews approved by the state board Wednesday will seek to identify errors and any evidence of fraud in voter registration records and absentee voting documents as well as verify the accuracy and integrity of election results, according to ACA 7-4-124.
No specific mention was made about the reason Izard County will be the subject of an election integrity review, but the board voted at its December meeting to refer complaints from election monitors to SBEC staff for investigation.

 Decertification of election officials

Separate votes by the seven-member SBEC mean the chairman of the unnamed county’s election commission won’t be able to work in an official election role for 14 years and the other two commissioners for eight years.

SBEC Director Chris Madison said it would be up to the respective county political party committees to appoint new members to the election commission if the sanctions are accepted. County election commissions are composed of three members, two from the majority political party and one from the minority party.
County election officials were the subject of six complaints to the state board, including two that referred to a hostile environment created by the election commission chair and poll supervisors toward poll watchers.
The allegations included “hostility and [an] overall lack of professionalism in dealing with poll watchers” and a failure by the chair and poll supervisors to “recognize the rights and responsibilities of the poll watchers, thereby preventing the poll watchers from performing their duties,” SBEC legal counsel Waylan Cooper said.
Cooper said the investigation found evidence supporting the allegations, including an incident when the county commission chairman called sheriff’s deputies to remove a poll watcher after the poll supervisor tried to prevent the watcher from sitting in a chair that allowed a full view of the voting process. The chairman also raised his voice while telling poll watchers they were being ejected from the location, intimidating at least one potential watcher from participating further, Cooper said.
“The hostility toward poll watchers later spread” to another voting site in the same city on Election Day, Cooper said, when a disagreement between the poll supervisor and a poll watcher led to the supervisor’s husband, who was also a poll worker, verbally accosting the watcher with profanity and telling the watcher to leave.
“The backstory is that there’s two political factions in this community, and the election officials are on one side of a local issue and the poll watchers on the other,” Madison told the board.
Madison made a similar remark about Izard County during the board’s December meeting: “[Izard County] has a city that has two very engaged factions, and Hatfields and McCoys kind of comes to mind.”

“They have to be professional and adult enough to put aside that they don’t like the people who are poll watchers and allow them to do their jobs,” SBEC member Sharon Brooks said. The law requires it and their training demands it, “and they’re not doing that,” she said.
The board voted unanimously to decertify the supervisor and her husband for four years. Madison noted that the couple has since moved to another county and Clemmer’s motion applies statewide.
Regarding the allegations against the county commission chairman, SBEC member Bilenda Harris-Ritter said, “I think it’s unconscionable that the chair of the election commission is behaving like this … and encouraging other officials to behave like this.”
Harris-Ritter offered the motion to decertify the commission chair for seven two-year federal election cycles, the maximum the state board can impose.
Madison said the action was appropriate “to help solve some problems up there.” The SBEC staff will be intimately involved in the county’s election processes going forward, he said.
The board voted separately to decertify the other two members of that county’s election commission over a complaint that the commission didn’t deliver provisional ballots to the clerk and secretary of state until a week after the deadline. Unlike in many Arkansas counties, the clerk there is not the election coordinator; another member of the election commission is the coordinator.
In another case, the board voted to decertify an election commissioner in a different county for 14 years over his failure to show up on time to open a polling place at the start of early voting. Board members in support of decertification noted similar issues had happened in previous years.

(Photo by Charlotte Rene Woods / Virginia Mercury)While Abigail Spanberger’s former congressional colleagues stayed up late Tuesday night debating proposed cuts to Medicaid in a jumbo GOP bill to reduce federal spending, the Democratic gubernatorial nominee outlined her health care-focused plans if she becomes Virginia’s next governor Wednesday morning at a local independent pharmacy in Mechanicsville.
Standing in Mechanicsville Drug Store, a family-owned business that’s nearly 70 years old, Spanberger drove home her legislative priorities to lower prescription drug costs and close rural health care gaps in the state. 
“It’s essential that we be able to strengthen access to health care, improve affordability, and recognize that for so many Virginians, they’re one medical event away from really substantial ruin,” Spanberger said. “But for so many, (health care cost) is just one more worry that keeps them up at night.”
Speaking near the counter where prescriptions are filled in the back of the store, Spanberger said threats to health care coverage spurred her to run for Congress in 2018. During President Donald Trump’s first term in 2017,  members of Congress tried to repeal the Affordable Care Act. That federal legislation made it possible for states like Virginia to expand their Medicaid program to encompass more people who fall through health coverage gaps. 
With a similar sense of medical coverage uncertainty now pervading the nation’s capital, Spanberger said she wants to protect access to care here at home.
“As we see challenges coming out of Capitol Hill in Washington, DC, as governor, I will focus on what can be done here in Virginia,” Spanberger said. 
She also plans to create a statewide hospital price transparency comparison tool to help people better weigh their options for treatments and drugs, uphold consumer protection laws and direct the next attorney general to identify and crack down on scams that may fraudulently enroll people in unnecessary coverage, Spanberger said. 
Virginia’s “safety net” providers, like free clinics and community health centers, can also count on Spanberger’s support if she ascends to the governorship, she said. Virignia’s free clinics have for years requested more funding from the state legislature to stay afloat and serve the  most vulnerable populations, especially under- or uninsured people and rural patients who live further from hospitals. She also laid out her intention to work with Virginia’s hub of medical manufacturing companies to increase the production of generic drugs that more people would be able to afford. 
One thing Spanberger’s plans didn’t include is a Prescription Drug Affordability Board.  A bipartisan proposal to create an independent board of medical and health experts tasked with analyzing data to set payment limits on drug prices within state-sponsored health plans has failed multiple years in a row in Virginia’s legislature. After clearing the legislature this year, the measure was vetoed by Gov. Glenn Youngkin in late March. 
While PDABs have gained traction in several states in recent years, they have not been without skepticism — particularly as other states’ boards, like Maryland’s, have taken years to set up and have not yet fully yielded the savings they’ve promised. 
Spanberger is also cautious and said Wednesday she would keep an eye on the proposal but stopped short of endorsing it. 
“I want to make sure that whatever we might implement in the future will be a best practice based on the successes or challenges that other states have faced,” she said. 
A new law that will take effect next year also aims to boost drug affordability, and has Spanberger’s stamp of approval. 
A bipartisan coalition of lawmakers introduced the “Save Local Pharmacies Act” this year, which outgoing Gov. Glenn Youngkin approved. 
Once implemented, the law will eliminate health-run-plan pharmacy benefit managers in Medicaid and establish a single state-contracted one — a move supporters say would improve accountability, lower costs and help independent pharmacies stay afloat. The proposal drew support from both independent pharmacy owners and workers in chain pharmacies during the 2025 legislative session.
Sen. Aaron Rouse, D-Virginia Beach, who is among several Democratic candidates that will face off in a primary next month for the lieutenant governor nomination, said that he is “proud that (Spanberger) agrees this is the type of strong action we need to help Virginians.”
Rouse had been the chief patron of the PBM reform bill and worked closely with colleagues to pass it. 
A spokesperson for Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears, who is the Republican nominee for governor, did not immediately return calls Wednesday when asked for more details about Earle-Sears’ health care policy stances and thoughts on federal Medicaid debates. 
Her campaign website does not spell out concrete health care plans, but more broadly points to a goal of reducing the cost of living. 
“She will scour the government books to cut wasteful government spending and job-killing regulations because taxpayers know how to spend their money and run their businesses better than government,” Earle-Sears’ website reads.

Hanover County resident Ann, who declined to share her last name and identified herself as a Republican voter, was skeptical of what Spanberger had to say during her pharmacy visit on Wednesday. 
Ann said she doesn’t know enough about the pharmacy benefit manager proposal Spanberger is backing but another health care issue is a priority for her going into this year’s state elections: abortion. 
While she isn’t sure what week of pregnancy she would like to see abortion restricted, she thinks current law and the in-progress constitutional amendment to enshrine broader reproductive rights goes too far. 
“I don’t want it to be completely banned, but there do have to be restrictions,” she said. “When you abort and murder a live baby, that is something very sinister.”
Abortion providers challenge FDA’s remaining mifepristone restrictions in federal court

Current abortion law allows the procedure for any reason until about 26 weeks, with exceptions for the rare instance where people have later abortions — typically related to medical emergencies. Virginia Republicans and President Trump have for years incorrectly stated that Virginia Democrats support infanticide, which is illegal.
Spanberger has voiced her support for abortion access repeatedly, tweeting on the second anniversary of the Supreme Court’s dismantling of federal abortion protections that “Virginians are worried about the future of abortion access — but they are also deeply worried about extreme politicians attacking IVF and contraception. As Virginia’s next Governor, I will defend our fundamental rights.”
Earle-Sears has decried abortion, speaking against the procedure as a keynote speaker at this year’s March for Life rally and literally marking her disapproval of an in-progress constitutional amendment protecting reproductive health care access, including abortion. In her duty as lieutenant governor, Earle-Sears has to sign passed legislation, and as the reproductive rights measure cleared the legislature this year, she signed it with a note that she was “morally opposed” because she didn’t feel it protected “the child.”
Earle-Sears ‘morally opposed’ to Virginia’s reproductive rights amendment, note shows

Republicans had sought to insert an amendment into the measure that would further outline existing state and federal law concerning live births. Democrats, who control the House and Senate currently, rejected the idea because it’s already on the books. The proposed constitutional amendment must pass the legislature again next year before appearing on statewide ballots. 
Ann, the Hanover Republican, knows that partisan control of the House of Delegates and the political position of the incoming governor will be pivotal in shaping the future of Virginia’s abortion laws.  It’s why she has her eye on “all of them.”

(Photo by Mason Adams for the Virginia Mercury)Virginia awarded $983.6 million to 53 applicants in the sixth iteration of the competitive SMART SCALE process to help improve transportation across the commonwealth.
On Wednesday, the Commonwealth Transportation Board approved the transportation and infrastructure projects that were recommended for approval by staff, after weighing 270 applications and making significant changes to the program last year.
Localities and planning districts submit their project applications every two and half years in the SMART SCALE process, and the state scores them using a funding formula to identify their transportation needs compared to other applications. The state considers how projects improve safety, reduce congestion and contribute to economic development, among other factors, when weighing the proposed projects.
Some localities had already expressed opposition to the projects staff recommended for the green light including leaders in Fairfax County, who submitted three applications for projects that ranked low in priority compared to other projects and are unlikely to get state funding allocated through the SMART SCALE process.The Fairfax Board of Supervisors expressed their concern in a recent letter to Secretary of Transportation Shep Miller.
Miller said the board will continue to listen to local leaders and analyze the concerns again in the future.
“At the end of the day, we just want to get it right, and of course, there’s no right, no 100% right. It’s a judgement system,” said Secretary of Transportation Shep Miller. “We’re judging how these projects return value to the commonwealth.” 
Not all of Virginia’s districts received district funding grants, which are only open to certain localities. The districts that failed to receive any district funding grants are Culpeper, Fredericksburg, Lynchburg and Salem. Lynchburg also failed to acquire any funding from the High-Priority Projects Program, which puts projects in competition with others from across the commonwealth.
Board member Raymond Smoot, who represents part of Southwest Virginia, raised concerns about the districts which did not receive any district funding grants. While Smoot acknowledged that applications that didn’t make the cut may not have met the level of need of other districts, he questioned whether the funding formula appropriately measured the needs within the four districts.
“Now that’s all, in my view, water over the dam; but looking ahead to round seven … I think we need to keep these perspectives before us and see what, if any, changes we need to make in round seven that would perhaps reduce a different result,” Smoot said. “But I think this has gone well, and I appreciate all the work that has been done on it, and I just think we need to keep this in mind for future reference.”
In January 2024, the board made several changes to the funding process after its review of SMART SCALE, established in 2014. The tweaks included requiring public bodies applying for funds to calculate traffic congestion for seven years in the future, adjusting the weight given in calculations to safety, congestion and accessibility, and keeping existing application caps in place.
The changes concerned some localities, who said the modifications reduced state funding for smaller transportation projects for cyclists and pedestrians while favoring larger projects.
The board voted on the awards and agreed to suspend any action on Alexandria’s project application, designed to improve safety at two intersections: Duke Street and South Henry Street, and Duke Street and South Patrick Street. 
According to Alexandria leaders, the city’s funding request came after it documented over 70 crashes at the two intersections since 2014. Of those, four crashes resulted in severe injury and more than 20 resulted in non-life-threatening injuries. 
Miller stated that the agency did not inform Alexandria that its project wouldn’t be funded until after it had already been included in the staff recommendations drawn up before the board’s action Wednesday. During Tuesday’s work session, staff explained that the city’s project remains unfunded due to Alexandria’s lack of improvement in performance compared to other city projects the state has funded.
Alexandria’s project could be amended as early as January after the agency speaks with city leaders, Miller said.
“We need to ensure that we communicate better than we have in this case,” Miller said. “Whether that’s in Culpeper or whether it’s in wherever … we need to make sure we have those conversations so people aren’t surprised.”
Board member D.J. Gribbin, representing the Northern Virginia District, joined Miller during Tuesday’s work session, expressing support for holding localities accountable for completing projects after they receive SMART SCALE funding. Loudoun County proved accountability measures are necessary, Gribbin said, pointing to the county’s plan to swap out its Cascades Pkwy Bike & Pedestrian project from Church Road to Victoria Station Drive for a Route 15 roundabout project, since Loudoun’s annual performance review of administering five or more projects has not improved.
The Virginia Department of Transportation (VDOT) will administer the roundabout project.
“I think having accountability is key,” Gribbin said. “I also want to thank VDOT and the team for working with Loudoun County to help them get over the hump, so we can get one of these projects up and going. This is a really good combination of being accountable, but also being flexible (and) working with counties that are trying hard.”
In addition to Alexandria’s project, other projects that were not funded include the Little Creek Road Bicycle Improvements project in Norfolk and the Waynesboro Transit Access Project in Waynesboro.

(Photo by Eesha Pendharkar / Maine Morning Star)Maine students have been restrained and secluded more than 22,000 times a year in some years. But the real number of times educators put students in holds, move them against their will and shut them alone in small rooms is likely much higher.
Restraint and seclusion are widely condemned practices that create lasting trauma for students, their families and the educators involved. That’s why every use is supposed to be documented and reported to the state. But over the past decade, only 24 out of more than 250 private schools and public districts in Maine have consistently reported their numbers.


May 21: Restraint and seclusion are only supposed to be used on students in emergency situations. Accounts from families and educators show how districts’ interpretation of state law vary widely and how traumatic the experiences can be.
May 22: State data reveals only a fraction of Maine’s schools and districts are consistently reporting incidents of restraint and seclusion in violation of state law. Even with the underreporting, Maine schools are relying on these practices thousands of times per year.
May 23: How one district worked with researchers to change its approach to student behavior and significantly reduced the use of restraint and seclusion

Maine law mandates annual reporting to the Maine Department of Education, however the department did not say whether there was any penalty for failing to report. 
Maine law mandates annual reporting to the Maine Department of Education. However, according to Bear Shea, the department’s restraint and seclusion specialist, Maine DOE “has not been given statutory authority or mechanisms to enforce compliance.”
Rather, the department seems to operate under the assumption that a district’s lack of reporting means schools didn’t restrain or seclude any students that year. 
“It is possible that if a school district does not have any incidents of restraint and seclusion in a school year, they will not report any data,” said Chloe Teboe, the department spokesperson, when asked about the dozens of districts that aren’t reporting every year, according to publicly available state data. “The Maine DOE can only act on the data that is shared by school districts, as required by statute.”
Atlee Reilly, managing attorney for the advocacy organization Disability Rights Maine, said it’s “beyond unlikely” that districts failing to report have not used restraint or seclusion.
Overall, reporting to the DOE has fallen off in recent years, Reilly told lawmakers on May 9 during discussion of a proposed bill that aims to relax the rules on restraint and seclusion. Many of the state’s largest districts and schools that historically reported frequent use of restraint and seclusion have stopped sharing their numbers in recent years, according to statewide data. 
“I know that some schools that have historically reported high numbers of restraints haven’t reported,” Reilly said. “So does that mean that they, all of a sudden, are not restraining or secluding youth? I think probably not.”
At least one school not reporting high use to state
A closer look at the Bangor Regional Program, a school for students with disabilities, reveals how restraint and seclusion practices can go unreported for years.
Bangor Public Schools is responsible for reporting its own numbers, as well as the data for the Bangor Regional Program, which serves students from several area districts. The state database includes numbers from the regional program for one of the past 10 years, after a 2019 investigation found the school had been restraining and secluding students thousands of times each year from 2015 to 2018, more than almost any other school in the state.  
During the 2019-20 school year, the regional program used 261 restraints and 325 seclusions on 33 individual students. Internal data provided by Bangor schools to Maine Morning Star in response to a records request shows that in the following years, the program continued using these practices. In 2021-22, the school reported 419 total uses of restraint and seclusion. In 2022-23, use dropped to 187, and in 2023-24, increased to 281.
None of these incidents were reported to the state, according to publicly available state data. 
Though Bangor Public Schools reports its data every year, when asked why the regional program’s numbers were not shared with the state, spokesperson Ray Phinney said he didn’t know and couldn’t find out due to recent changes in district leadership. 
“The superintendent who oversaw the submission of this is no longer with us,” he said.
The DOE did not respond directly to questions about this school’s lack of reporting, but the spokesperson said the department “reports any data received from school districts and does not make a practice of not publishing it.”
Ben Jones, director of legal and policy initiatives for Lives in the Balance, a Maine-based nonprofit that works with schools to reduce restraint and seclusion, said it’s important for the department to explain what happens when schools like the regional program collect data but don’t report it to the state. 
“We still don’t have a true sense of the scope of using these dangerous practices, so this, to me, points the spotlight back at reporting and collecting,” he said. “So what more is DOE doing to ensure the completeness of the data, the completeness of this picture?”
Few districts regularly report data
This underreporting casts doubt on the apparent progress Maine has made in relying less on these practices in the wake of a 2021 law, which specified restraint and seclusion should only be used in emergency situations.
The law was intended to reduce the use of emergency behavioral interventions that are known to be traumatic — particularly for students with disabilities, who are disproportionately affected.
“It’s very difficult to tell if the numbers went down or up after the law change because of underreporting,” Jones said. 
In the 2022-23 school year, Maine schools reported 44% fewer incidents of restraint and seclusion in schools than it did four years earlier. But only 140 of Maine’s 300-plus school administrative units submitted their data for that school year. In 2018-19, that number was 213.










I don't want anyone to think that people in schools are just wanting to put hands on kids. Because it's traumatic, it's not good. However, there are times, when for the safety of an individual student or others around that individual, it becomes necessary to restrain or seclude.


– MSAD 6 Superintendent Clay Gleason


Only 24 districts have submitted restraint and seclusion data every year for the last decade, a Maine Morning Star analysis found.
Together, they represent fewer than one-quarter of Maine’s roughly 170,000 K-12 students. Only two of the state’s 10 largest districts, Bangor and Maine School Administrative District (MSAD) 6 in the Buxton area, are among them.
In the 2018-19 school year, MSAD 6 staff reported restraining students 150 times and placing them in rooms by themselves 256 times.
By 2022-23, MSAD 6’s use of those tactics, especially seclusions, had dropped considerably. District staff that year reported restraining students 100 times and placing them in seclusion rooms 132 times.
That district’s reliance on restraint and seclusion roughly matches the trend statewide over that period. Across Maine, use of restraint and seclusion peaked in the 2018-19 year at more than 22,000 reported uses, according to the available state data. After passage of the 2021 law restricting their use to instances when a student’s behavior poses an “imminent danger” of serious injury, overall incidents fell to just under 12,600 in the 2022-23 school year — a 44% drop. 
“I don’t want anyone to think that people in schools are just wanting to put hands on kids. Because it’s traumatic, it’s not good,” said MSAD 6 Superintendent Clay Gleason. “However, there are times, when for the safety of an individual student or others around that individual, it becomes necessary to restrain or seclude.”


Numbers still high despite underreporting
Despite inconsistent reporting, it’s clear many Maine districts still rely on these practices thousands of times a year. In 2021, data reported directly by schools to the federal government showed that Maine ranked first and second in restraining and secluding students, respectively, per capita. According to an analysis of the most recent national numbers, the state fell to third and fourth per capita.
“These are still extremely high numbers,” said Jones with Lives in the Balance. “Each one of these is a kid being grabbed or put into a closet, and then there’s probably more of it going on based on what we know.”
The number of reported restraints and seclusions vary widely from district to district, noted Alan Cobo-Lewis, director of the Center for Community Inclusion and Disability Studies and associate professor of Psychology at the University of Maine.
Some districts have reported zero incidents for many years, and others like those in the Buxton-area, report large numbers. But “whether they’re model programs, or whether they’re just not reporting their restraints, I don’t think that you can know that without actually visiting schools,” Cobo-Lewis said.
“I have advocated for a while for the department to visit the schools that had high rates and also visit the schools that had zero,” he said.
While the federal government collects this data from districts, there is no federal oversight, and every state has different laws about restraint and seclusion. Some members of Congress have proposed a federal ban on school use of restraint and seclusion, with the most recent legislation introduced in 2023.
The proposal currently before Maine lawmakers would allow districts to move students against their will without reporting it as a restraint and would allow educators more flexibility in determining when they use these practices by decreasing the level of danger posed by a student’s behavior from “serious physical injury” to just “injury.”
Both Jones and Reilly of Disability Rights Maine worry that if the bill passes, schools will no longer have to report incidents where staff move students against their will into classrooms and quiet rooms. That would mean the statewide data on the number of restraints could drop. 
“What we’re going to do is take a whole class of stuff — like the physical management of students that I think most people would look at and say, that child’s being restrained — and say it’s no longer restraint,” Reilly said.
He added, “It doesn’t mean that people are going to be putting their hands on kids less.”
From 2014 to 2023, school units reported 55 serious bodily injuries to students and 594 to staff members related to the use of a restraint or seclusion, according to publicly available data. In recent years, the number of students injured while being restrained and secluded has increased, with 22 of those 55 instances reported in the 2022-23 school year, all reported by Biddeford Schools. The southern coastal district did not respond to multiple requests for comment. 
Most years, the vast majority of districts reported zero injuries. 
MSAD 6 in Buxton is one of the only districts that has reported staff and student injuries to the department every year, but Gleason said he did not recall any serious incidents, and did not know what criteria was used by staff who filled out forms. 
“There are minor injuries that happen to both staff and students, sometimes with somebody getting a little rug burn or bumping into a desk or something,” he said, explaining the typical ways staff or students might get injured during a restraint or seclusion.
“But I don’t know if it’s a standard kind of thing across districts and how they report it, or if it’s like an internal measure,” he added.
According to state law, school units would not report injuries that do not meet the definition of serious physical injury, according to Shea, the department’s restraint and seclusion specialist. But in practice, “I have talked with many schools and there is a wide range of ways that [school administrative units] choose to report injuries with some tending to report even more minor injuries,” he said. 
While the department collects injury data, there is no statewide policy about what districts should do in response to student or staff injuries.
Majority of reports from schools for students with disabilities
When public school districts determine they can’t adequately serve a student with disabilities, some of them are referred to special purpose private schools. Although these schools still receive public funding, Jones said the programs are often insulated from scrutiny.
Having sat through dozens of those placement meetings, Jones said the student’s parents and advocates are hoping that a move would increase support for the child, but that’s not always the case. 
Pointing to the high number of reported incidents, Jones said these schools can often be “hotbeds for the inappropriate use of restraint and seclusion.”
Over the past decade, Maine’s special purpose private schools have accounted for roughly 57% of all uses of restraint and seclusion in the state each year, going up to almost 70% in 2019-20, when the state saw the most incidents in a decade.
Though the data from these schools haven’t been consistently included in the state’s annual data, students with disabilities in Maine and nationwide are much more likely to be subject to these practices.
Maine’s special purpose private schools served roughly 850 students in 2022-23 but accounted for 58% of all 7,975 restraints in the state, according to a Maine Morning Star analysis. That same year, they also accounted for about 47% of all seclusions in Maine: 2,154 of 4,618 incidents.
The Margaret Murphy Centers for Children, a special purpose private school with campuses in Auburn, Lewiston, Saco and Turner, has topped the state’s list for seclusion every year since 2014-15; it has also restrained students more than any other school every year since 2017-18, state data shows. 
The centers used these practices more than 11,000 times on just 108 students in 2019-20, according to the state data from 2023.
There is no state law restricting an educator from using these practices repeatedly on a particular child. And unless a parent complains and requests a district try a new approach, there is no statewide process for addressing the frequency of incidents.


Margaret Murphy Senior Director Michelle Hathaway attributed those numbers to the severity of the student population’s needs. The school exclusively serves children and young adults (up to age 22) with significant behavioral and developmental challenges, many of whom are referred to the school specifically because of the “intensity or dangerousness of their behaviors,” she said. 
They sometimes display aggression — including attempts to hit, choke, or rip out hair — that can pose serious safety risks to themselves or others.
Hathaway wrote in an email that restraints are only used as a “last resort” but argued the law leaves room for interpretation and that ambiguity means some schools may “over-document and over-report.” 
For example, she said a staff member holding a 3-year-old’s hand to prevent them from running into a parking lot could technically, under current law, be considered a restraint.
But repeatedly using restraint and seclusion on a small number of students should be a red flag that something is not working, Jones said.  
“Of course emergency situations will arise, but after the first few uses of restraint or seclusion, we are no longer talking about emergencies,” he said. “We are talking about predictable behavior that can be planned for, trained for.”

Brooke Rollins in April. (Ainsley Platt/Arkansas Advocate)The Arkansas Department of Human Services is providing the U.S. Department of Agriculture with data on the number of certain SNAP program applicants, following a sweeping demand from the government earlier this month. A DHS spokesperson did not confirm or whether the agency would share more sensitive data in the future.
The data-sharing was initially confirmed in emails provided to the Advocate through an Arkansas Freedom of Information Act request, and then by a DHS spokesperson, who said none of the information shared thus far was personally identifiable. 
A USDA official sent a letter to states on May 6, stating they would need to provide USDA with a trove of personally-identifiable information on Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program recipients, such as names, addresses and Social Security numbers — data not typically shared with USDA as part of the SNAP program.
USDA directed states to provide “[r]ecords sufficient to identify individuals as applicants for, or recipients of, SNAP benefits, including but not limited to personally identifiable information in the form of names, dates of birth, personal addresses used, and Social Security numbers,” along with detailed payment data to show how much a recipient has received in benefits. The request is for data dating back to Jan. 1, 2020.
Advocates for child well-being call for removal of barriers to Arkansas SNAP participation

Failure to provide the data or give permission for third-party data processors to do so could trigger “noncompliance procedures,” the letter continued.
In an email to two members of Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders’ communications team, DHS spokesperson Gavin Lesnick wrote on May 9: “One more for you — a reporter with the Washington Post reached out below about a new requirement for all states to share SNAP data with USDA. We are in the process of providing this data.”
However, in response to questions from the Advocate, Lesnick said the data provided by the department was not personally identifiable.
“The Arkansas Department of Human Services (DHS) began sharing data last week detailing the number of disqualified and sanctioned SNAP applicants so far this year,” Lesnick wrote in an emailed statement. “This dataset did not include any personal information.”
SNAP data is “stored by DHS” but is also provided to a third-party vendor to produce the program’s EBT cards, Lesnick said.
When asked to clarify whether DHS had plans to share the broader trove of personally identifiable information requested by USDA in the future, Lesnick did not directly answer the question. 
“DHS plans to provide USDA any data requested that supports efforts to ensure program integrity,” he said. “We take seriously our responsibility to safeguard sensitive data, and will ensure any information submitted to USDA is provided safely and securely. Questions about specific data types or future requests should be directed to USDA.”

The statement Lesnick provided to the Washington Post reporter earlier this month said: “The Arkansas Department of Human Services is fully committed to efforts to detect and prevent fraud, waste, and abuse in all programs, including the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). We look forward to continuing our partnership with the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food and Nutrition Service to ensure that SNAP benefits go only to eligible families.”
The May 6 letter was prompted by a March executive order from President Donald Trump called “Stopping Waste, Fraud, and Abuse by Eliminating Information Silos,” which directed officials to take all steps necessary “to the maximum extent consistent with law,” to obtain access to data necessary to root out “waste, fraud, and abuse.” 
It also directed federal agencies to take steps to gain “unfettered access to comprehensive data from all State programs that receive Federal funding, including, as appropriate, data generated by those programs but maintained in third-party databases.”
The USDA letter said that “At present, each State, district, territory, and payment processor is a SNAP information silo.” 
USDA requires “unfettered access” to the data held by states and third-party processors, the letter said, to eliminate inefficiencies and fraud in accordance with Trump’s executive order.
However, privacy advocates have raised alarms over the demand, sending letters to third-party data processors used by states urging them not to comply. 
States Newsroom has reported on efforts by the so-called Department of Government Efficiency to consolidate personally identifiable information from various government databases, potentially in violation of privacy laws. 
Some states, such as New Mexico, have refused USDA’s demand on privacy grounds. Others, like Iowa and Alaska, have complied.
As of March, 235,927 people in Arkansas received SNAP benefits, the Advocate previously reported — approximately 7.6% of the state population. As reported by NPR, the personal data of SNAP recipients normally remains under the control of states, while USDA is able to audit state programs.

(Courtesy of the Raleigh Rescue Mission)The Raleigh Rescue Mission on Tuesday broke ground on the construction of a new campus in Knightdale that will expand its capacity to serve women and children by 483%, the organization announced in a news release.
The new campus — The Garden — is being developed in partnership with the Town of Knightdale and the homebuilder Lennar. It’s backed by more than $25 million in commitments from private foundations and donors, the Rescue Mission said.
“The Garden will provide a safe and supportive environment for women and children to rebuild their lives and become contributing members of society,” said John Luckett, president and CEO of the Rescue Mission. “This is an opportunity to offer not just shelter, but stability, resources and the support needed to progress through our New Life Plan and build a new future with confidence and purpose.”
The New Life Plan is a six-step plan that begins with clients living at the Rescue Mission for 4-6 months through phases 1-4. In phase 5, clients move into non subsidized apartments for months 6-12. Phase 6 culminates in homeownership through Habitat For Humanity and similar organizations.
According to the new releases, homelessness in Wake County increases by 8% each year and 70% of people seeking services are experiencing situational homelessness, which means they have been displaced by sudden, life-altering events.
“This is an exciting partnership that reflects Knightdale’s commitment to community and compassion,” said Knightdale Mayor Jessica Day. “The project supports families and meets a growing need in our region.”
The Garden will offer long-term transitional housing for 300 to 400 people. It will also free up space to increase capacity to serve men by 150% at the Rescue Mission’s downtown facility, the organization said.
The campus is being built within a new Lennar single-family home community.
“At Lennar, we believe in building with purpose and integrity, and The Garden is a powerful example of these values in action,” said Robert Smart, Lennar Raleigh division president.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/The-Garden.jpg,,,2025-05-22 05:04:02.098270

Santiago/Getty Images) Murphy Smith says he was unemployed for four years because of medical issues before becoming a rideshare driver in Eugene, Oregon.
Driving allows him to work without triggering his severe asthma, Smith, 47, says. But without a set minimum wage, he says he works 12 to 16 hours a day to support himself.
Smith, who’s part of the rideshare drivers advocacy group Drivers Union Oregon, hopes pending legislation will help bring drivers like him a livable wage.
“There are a lot of people here in the Eugene area that don’t own a car, and once the buses or the public transportation shuts down, we’re who they call,” Smith said. “So we are an essential part of the workforce here.”
Advocates across several states say they’ve increased their activism recently because Uber and Lyft are pushing back harder than ever, as more cities and states pass laws requiring minimum pay and benefit requirements.
The rideshare industry is not as heavily regulated as independent taxi drivers or taxi companies, which are subject to rules on permitting, background checks, vehicle inspections and more, depending on the state or locality.
Rideshare drivers and labor advocates across the country are urging state and local leaders to require rideshare companies to provide benefits for drivers, including paid sick leave, minimum wages and workers’ compensation.
The companies have argued that establishing minimum wages for rideshare drivers would raise the price of rides for customers. Uber and Lyft are working to prevent some states from passing rideshare legislation through public campaigns and lobbying.
Oregon Democratic state Sen. Kayse Jama, who sponsored the bill pending in his state, said drivers told him last summer that their accounts were being deactivated without notice. Even drivers who were highly rated were locked out of their accounts, unable to earn any money, he said.
“A lot of those folks are mainly immigrants and refugees, so they don’t drive Uber as a side hustle or side gig,” Jama said. “This is their livelihood. This is how they feed their families. So, they brought the issue to my attention.”
Their stories inspired Jama to introduce legislation that would set a minimum wage for Oregon drivers, require a “just cause” for deactivation — or “lockouts” — of driver accounts, establish sick leave accrual, increase fare transparency, and create a new driver resource center. Neighboring Washington has a similar model, which was enacted in 2022.
Uber has opposed the Oregon bill, saying that the company needs more time to work with the state on drafting the measure. Uber spokesperson Zahid Arab, testifying against the bill, said the legislation would make rideshare “dramatically more expensive for Oregon riders, reduce access to affordable transportation options, and lead to fewer flexible earning opportunities for drivers.”










A lot of those folks are mainly immigrants and refugees, so they don't drive Uber as a side hustle or side gig. This is their livelihood. This is how they feed their families.


– Oregon Democratic state Sen. Kayse Jama


Jama said that he and his team have been negotiating with Uber and Lyft since the beginning of the legislative session, but there’s more work to do.
“At the end of the day, we want a bill that’s equitable to both the parties but also ensures that the drivers are getting the relief that they desperately need,” Jama said.
Lockouts are not exclusive to drivers in Oregon. Drivers in New York City first reported last summer periods of time when they could not access Uber or Lyft. The companies were limiting the number of active drivers in response to the city’s minimum wage rules.
Uber came to an agreement with New York City last July to reduce the lockouts, but drivers using Lyft were still seeing account deactivations months later.
Uber and Lyft did not respond to Stateline requests for comment.
New laws proliferate
Generally, rideshare drivers are paid a base fare for each trip, with additional money for the time and distance traveled. In some cities, drivers can also see the amount of money they’ll earn before accepting a ride. Passengers can choose to tip drivers, too.
But every location has different rates. For instance, the minimum pay rates for drivers in Washington state have increased to $1.34 per mile and $0.39 per minute, with a trip minimum of $3.45 per trip, according to the state’s labor department. In Seattle, the pay rates are even higher.
In places without set rules, drivers are subject to rates that depend on the location and availability of rides. These earnings are reduced by driver expenses, including gas, car maintenance and more.
In 2019, the nation’s first minimum wage pay rate for rideshare drivers went into effect in New York City. The minimum pay rates for time and mileage amount to drivers earning $17.22 an hour after expenses. It was a significant win for advocates in the city who had campaigned for better pay for years. New York later established minimum pay rates for drivers across the state.
Seattle in 2020 became the second city to require minimum wages for rideshare drivers.
States and cities eye stronger protections for gig economy workers

In 2023, Minneapolis city leaders were also considering an ordinance that would increase driver pay, but Uber and Lyft threatened to leave the city entirely if it were to pass.
As part of a 2024 statewide deal after a long battle between Minnesota lawmakers and the rideshare companies, the pay rates for drivers rose to $1.28 per mile and 31 cents per minute on average for time spent driving passengers. As part of the deal, cities were banned from passing their own regulations on wages.
California, Massachusetts and Washington also have passed legislation to set minimum wages and rates for rideshare drivers over the past five years.
Massachusetts reached an agreement with Uber last year that guaranteed minimum earnings of $32.50 per hour to start, a portable health insurance benefit fund established last month and multilingual chat support coming later this year.
Massachusetts, Minnesota, New York and Washington also require rideshare companies to give drivers paid sick leave, workers’ compensation, paid family and medical leave, and other benefits.
In contrast, a California appeals court ruled in 2023 that transportation network companies could treat drivers as independent contractors, meaning they are not entitled to benefits in the state. The ruling upheld a voter-approved law.
Lawmakers in Connecticut and Wisconsin introduced legislation this year that would give rideshare drivers better pay transparency, as well as accident and sickness insurance coverage.
Earlier this year, Uber also sued Colorado over a law that requires the company to provide pay disclosures for drivers, arguing that the law violates Uber’s free speech rights. The law requires transportation network companies to disclose to drivers the total amount a passenger paid for a trip, how much is given to the driver and how much the passenger tipped.
Washington state compromises
For more than eight years, Ahmed Mahamud has been driving for Uber and Lyft to support his family in Seattle.
Driving for the rideshare companies is his full-time job, he said, and business in Seattle is good.
“I love it,” said Mahamud, 51. “You’re helping people when they have a need. So, this isn’t just a job. It’s a ‘win-win’ job. You’re helping your community, and at the same time you are paying the bills.”
But he lacks the same benefits as a salaried job. So he joined Drivers Union and is pushing for better pay, benefits and protections for drivers.
“We are not yet finished fighting against these companies because there are still things missing,” he said. “So, every single day, we are still fighting.”
In the absence of state and federal regulations, rideshare companies have too much power over the drivers they employ, said Drivers Union spokesperson Anna Minard. Drivers in Washington began to organize when they realized Uber and Lyft were changing how much money drivers would earn without letting them know, she said.
“To drivers, this seemed like an avenue for a lot of exploitation,” Minard said. “So, drivers organized from the get-go and tried various ways to get some rights enshrined in the law [in Washington]. Even though it’s contract work, people felt like they should be able to join together and fight for better pay and benefits and safety.”
Oregon bill would implement protections for Uber, Lyft drivers

In 2023, a year after rideshare drivers won minimum wage and other benefits, Washington lawmakers passed legislation that made it the first state to give drivers paid family and medical leave. Uber and Lyft supported the new benefits.
“These coordinated pieces of legislation reflect a true compromise between state lawmakers, labor leaders and transportation network companies to afford drivers historic new benefits while protecting the independence and flexibility they say they want,” an Uber spokesperson said in a statement to GeekWire at the time.
And last year, after Massachusetts drivers won new benefits that are rolling out over 2025, Tony West, Uber’s chief legal officer, said in a statement, “We hope to engage other policymakers, drivers, advocates and stakeholders around the world to forge similar solutions.”
Advocates with Drivers Union helped pass a law this year in Washington that requires rideshare companies to be more transparent about which cars are eligible for special ride options, which are offered to passengers for higher fees.
In addition to the standard UberX ride, the app offers UberXL for larger groups, Uber Comfort for newer cars with extra legroom and other options that generally cost more.
The legislation, which was signed into law by Democratic Gov. Bob Ferguson earlier this month, came after hundreds of drivers saw advertisements from Uber telling them to buy more expensive cars to get more pay on rides, Mahamud said. But in a year, many of those cars would become ineligible once newer cars are introduced to the market, leaving drivers with expensive car notes without the benefit of higher rates to cover it.
“The drivers really came together and said, ‘This is just unfair,’” Mahamud said. “Yesterday we’re told to buy these cars, and then before we can pay the car off, we’re taken out of the product class which was supposed to pay for it.”
The law also requires rideshare companies to provide drivers with a record of their trip receipts.
Drivers and advocates are going to keep fighting for their rights, said Nicole Moore, the president of Rideshare Drivers United, a driver-run organization of more than 20,000 drivers in California. Moore is a part-time driver in the Los Angeles area, and she usually works Fridays and Saturdays.
“They [rideshare companies] think that to be an employee in America means you have to work full time, and it has to be a scheduled five-day workweek,” Moore said. “Now, we as Americans have all these misconceptions about what employment rights and labor rights could actually mean for everyone.”

State Rep. Andrea White, R-Kettering, told the House Ways and Means Committee said the tax credit in House Bill 167 would offer a stronger incentive for employers than the federal tax credit does, by bridging a gap in the federal funds available for businesses. The tax credit would also be another attempt to stem a problem that covers all of Ohio, from urban centers to rural regions.
“Let’s try something, let’s get something going to see how we can get our employers engaged,” White told the committee.
H.B. 167 would authorize a nonrefundable tax credit for an employer providing “certain child care benefits” to employees, allows the credit to be claimed against other taxes like income or the commercial activity tax, and creates eligibility for costs “associated with establishing or operating an employer-owned child care facility, contracting with a child care facility, or paying employees for the provision of their own child care.
Under the current language of the bill, the credit is limited to $500,000 per year, but any unused funds can be carried over for five years, White said. She said she’s open to changes to that cap or the carryover language if the committee feels the amounts are too high.
The federal credit that’s already in place covers 25% of total expenses related to child care services or benefits, and up to 10% of the resource and referral expenses, for a total credit capped at $150,000 per year.

It’s a heavy lift for businesses, White argued, since they must spend at least $600,000 to be able to get the full benefit, if they’re aware of it at all.
“People don’t know about this credit, they don’t quite understand how to utilize it,” White said. “…But the other thing is it doesn’t help if you, as a business, want to give a stipend for your employee, it doesn’t cover that as a tax credit, so this gives employers more options so that they can actually take advantage of it.”

H.B. 167 also allows non-profits to utilize the tax credit, unlike the federal credit, White said.
The measure comes amid ongoing discussions about the state of child care, and how the economy is affected by a lack of access and affordability for the services in Ohio. Child care “deserts” exist in Ohio where no services are available for children, and data from the Ohio Department of Children and Youth estimate 40,000 children in the state aren’t eligible for Publicly Funded Child Care, meaning they don’t receive state assistance to pay for the services.
On top of those problems, low pay and high turnover in the child care sector means even if child care exists, the workforce shortages reduce capacity at facilities.
White cited recent research by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce that found Ohio is losing $5.48 billion every year in economic activity because of “insufficient child care,” including $1.52 billion in tax revenue and $3.97 billion in losses related to child care employee turnover and absenteeism.
“The business community, our families, are looking for solutions, and this is a solution,” White said.
The bill sponsor also echoed comments by ODCY director Kara Wente in supporting the Child Care Choice Voucher Program, which subsidizes child care for those who fall outside the Publicly Funded Child Care eligibility of 145% of the federal poverty line.
This is certainly not the first time White has pushed for more child care supports. A bill she co-sponsored establishing child care grant programs for employers was passed last month by the House committee she chairs, the Children and Human Services Committee.
State support for child care is uncertain as it is, with the state operating budget draft being drawn up by the Ohio Senate, after the Ohio House finalized its own draft last month.
The House’s version added $50 million to the Child Care Choice Voucher Program for each of the next two fiscal years, taking from federal Temporary Assistance for Needy Families block grant funding.
Despite a proposal by Gov. Mike DeWine to increase the Publicly Funded Child Care eligibility to 160% of the federal poverty line, the House budget draft maintained the 145% level, which Wente said is the lowest eligibility level in the country.
Also included in House budget proposal is language originally included in separate legislation, which would create a cost-sharing model for child care, in which the state, employers and employees would all pay a percentage of costs. In a hearing earlier this month, the House Children and Human Services Committee passed the original bill with language they said harmonizes the bill with the budget proposal details. In House Bill 2, the state would pay 20% of the costs, and employers and employees would each pay 40%.
During the hearing, however, two Republicans on the committee put concerns on the record about H.B. 2 and White’s child care grant program bill, House Bill 41. State Rep. Sarah Fowler Arthur, R-Ashtabula, voted against both bills, saying she had “concerns about the state subsidizing child care going forward.”
State Rep. Tracy Richardson, R-Marysville, voted in favor of both bills but said the House Finance Committee may have to work on at least House Bill 2, “maybe look at perhaps some potential reduction in overall funding.”
On H.B. 41, Richardson said the finance committee “should take a closer look at the overall appropriation.”
The Senate is currently working on their own draft, on line for an end-of-June deadline for both chambers to reconcile each of their budget drafts and get a final budget to the governor for signature.

(Photo by Dana Wormald/New Hampshire Bulletin)Another effort to prevent New Hampshire’s State Council on the Arts from being eliminated during the state budgeting process has fallen short.
New Hampshire state senators have spent the last few weeks working through the state budget. After the Senate Ways and Means Committee projected that state revenues — which have been lagging in recent years — would rebound faster than House predictions, the Senate Finance Committee has been identifying cuts made by the House that the Senate can undo. The committee recommendations so far include reversing a 3% cut to Medicaid reimbursement rates and restoring funding for developmental disability services.
However, on Wednesday, the committee didn’t do the same for the State Council on the Arts, which the House eliminated in its version of the budget. The Senate Finance Committee voted, 5-3, not to restore the council during a work session Wednesday. Gov. Kelly Ayotte had included funding of roughly $1.7 million over two years for the council in her budget proposal. The council was also set to receive an additional $2 million in federal funds.
Sen. Cindy Rosenwald, a Nashua Democrat and one of the three dissenting votes on the Finance Committee, pushed for the arts council to be restored Wednesday, saying, “the arts help drive the economy.”
Sen. David Watters, a Dover Democrat, said the arts are “so deeply woven into the fabric of the state and always have been and (are) something that helps define our identity.”
“It supports traditional arts programs, it supports the thriving arts community all around the state,” Watters said. “I think we should at least restore it to the governor’s level.” 
Republicans on the committee disagreed.
“I do think the Council of the Arts is important,” Sanborton Republican Sen. Tim Lang said. “But in this tough budget cycle where we’re balancing the needs versus the wants, a $3 million add is probably not appropriate for a want.”
Lang proposed an amendment that establishes a state fund that can accept donations. The council would become a volunteer council, and the state would appropriate $1 to the fund, a procedure mechanism to create it. He noted that many other councils in the state are voluntary.
“So the council could go out and get corporate sponsors and donations,” Lang said. “They’ll be able to use those donations to get federal matching grants, and it’d allow them to at least continue in some way, shape, or form their mission and their goal.”
Watters pushed back against the amendment. He said if the state is not putting money toward it, the arts can’t complete its mission.
“If there’s no funding, there’s no arts council,” Watters said. “Let’s face it.”
The committee voted, 5-3, to approve Lang’s amendment.
The Council on the Arts could still be restored if an amendment is introduced to the budget when the full Senate votes on it in June. If the Council on the Arts isn’t restored, New Hampshire would become the only U.S. state not to have such a council, according to the National Endowment for the Arts website. New Hampshire’s State Council on the Arts receives federal support from the Endowment for the Arts. 
Hearing the news Wednesday, Ayotte told reporters she was disappointed in the Senate Finance Committee’s recommendation. Her budget proposal, which projected state revenues would be higher than both the House and Senate estimates, pared down funding for the council but did not eliminate it entirely.

Will it happen?,Jenna Carlesso,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/05/22/ct-long-term-care-insurance-reform-2025/,CT lawmakers who pledged urgent reform to bring relief to LTCI policyholders are still trying to figure out what changes may move forward.,"For more coverage of the long-term care insurance industry, please click here.
In January, just weeks into the legislative session, key lawmakers — frustrated with soaring rate increases on long-term care insurance plans — pledged urgent reform to bring relief to Connecticut’s struggling policyholders.
They followed up with 17 bills that cover a wide range of proposals, from placing caps on annual rate hikes to providing tax credits for consumers and requiring the state to hold public hearings when insurers seek price increases. Five legislative committees advanced measures with bipartisan support, some that included broad consumer protections and cost savings.
But with three weeks left in the regular session, proponents are still trying to figure out what — if any — changes may move forward this year. Some proposals, like tax credits and deductions, have been weighed down by hefty price tags. In other cases, a lack of consensus and political will have hampered efforts.
“Here we are, the insurance capital of the world, and we have long-term care insurance that’s so expensive, it’s not even worth having,” said Rep. Lucy Dathan, a Norwalk Democrat who is co-chair of the Government Oversight Committee, which passed a bill on the issue in March. “It feels like such an injustice. We need to figure this out.”
“We’ve been patient for years, and to not have something meaningful pass this session, I’m very concerned,” said Kenneth Kollmeyer, 75, whose annual insurance payments have climbed to $7,600 for his policy and his wife’s, more than double what they paid when they purchased the coverage in 2004. Their policies are set to increase again next year.
Nearly 100,000 people in Connecticut have long-term care insurance — coverage that, depending on the policy, supports skilled in-home care, rehabilitation therapy, assisted living, nursing home stays and respite care.
A Connecticut Mirror investigation found the annual cost of maintaining these policies has skyrocketed for many residents due to miscalculations by insurers on how long people would live, the price of care and how many would need it. Consumers face sizable rate increases, often exceeding 50% and, for a few dozen people, as high as 174%, according to a CT Mirror analysis.
A review of rate hikes from January 2019 to October 2024 shows more than 17,000 people with long-term care policies have gotten hit with increases of 50% or more. Some of the biggest companies in the market, including Genworth Financial, Metropolitan Life Insurance Company and Transamerica Life Insurance Company, requested hikes for five years in a row beginning in 2019.
When providers seek premium increases, thousands of consumers can be affected. In 2019, for example, Genworth Financial requested a 40% rate hike on more than 9,000 Connecticut policyholders. In 2021, Transamerica requested a 20% rate increase on 8,000 policies. The Insurance Department approved both requests with no changes.
In 2022, Genworth raised rates for more than 2,000 people by an average of 97%, with increases ranging from 79% to 173%, depending on the policy. The approved amounts were a slight reduction from the company’s original request.
New language and last-minute plans
Sen. Matthew Lesser, D-Middletown, this week introduced a revised bill that would require insurance companies’ cost-sharing responsibility to increase in relation to the cumulative rate hikes on long-term care coverage.
The state insurance commissioner would have to come up with a calculation for the new cost-sharing responsibility.
“We’re giving relief to people who have seen repeated increases from their insurance companies,” Lesser, co-chair of the Human Services Committee, said. “And we’re saying that, as you get hit more and more by your insurance company, we’re going to ask the company to eat more of the cost instead of passing it on to the policyholder.”
Sen. Jorge Cabrera, co-chair of the Insurance and Real Estate Committee, which also passed legislation in March, said he’s in the process of “grabbing different elements” of the bills that advanced to create one proposal with consensus. What that could look like is still in flux.
“I want to do something, because it’s a big issue that everyone’s dealing with, regardless of party,” he said.
Measures that would give policyholders a financial break in the form of a tax credit or tax deduction have hit a wall due to sizable costs. Estimates by the state’s Office of Fiscal Analysis put the price of one tax credit at $67.2 million and a tax deduction at $20.2 million.
Despite Connecticut being on pace to close this fiscal year with the second-largest surplus in state history, a nearly $2.4 billion windfall according to Gov. Ned Lamont’s administration, officials are wary of providing tax relief in the next budget.
Given ongoing congressional efforts to make unprecedented cuts in Medicaid, lawmakers fear Connecticut stands to lose hundreds of millions of dollars annually.
But other components of the reform bills have far smaller cost estimates or no expense. Legislators proposed 10% caps on annual rate increases, public hearings so policyholders can share their perspectives when rate hike requests are filed, consumer notifications warning of the risk of large premium increases, and a sweeping review of the state’s regulation of long-term care insurance. 
Other measures would tie annual rate hikes to the consumer price index, require insurers to certify that premium increases are necessary to prevent a material risk of insolvency, and bar carriers from entering into state contracts if they don’t comply with LTCI policy changes.
Several consumers and legislators testified in support of the bills, while insurance sector officials opposed them.
Senate President Pro Tem Martin M. Looney, D-New Haven, said impending federal budget cuts will put huge economic pressure on Connecticut’s working families, but lawmakers haven’t abandoned efforts to provide relief to long-term care policyholders.
“We don’t have huge amounts of money, but it’s a real problem for people who bought those policies,” he said, adding that “everything is tentative right now.”
Rate hike requests persist
As consumers are squeezed, grievances filed with the Connecticut Insurance Department have mounted. The office received more than 700 complaints in the last six years about long-term care insurance, mostly rising premiums.
Solutions have been elusive. Legislators introduced more than 50 bills from 2019 to 2024, with only a small number passing and offering limited relief. They blamed budget constraints and pushback from insurers, among other problems.
Shortly after the CT Mirror’s investigation published in January, the state Insurance Department rejected a proposed rate increase of 167% by Brighthouse Insurance Company covering about 5,100 people in Connecticut.
But more rate hike requests have been filed. In a recent filing, the State Life Insurance Company, which represents a small group of about 22 policyholders, is asking for an average increase of 560%, drawing outrage from legislators and advocates.
“When you see a 500% proposed increase come across — it’s crazy,” Dathan said. “I’m pretty upset about it because I’ve been trying to find a way to get [solutions] adopted.”

The authors of the plan say most of the positions are vacant anyway, but of course, that’s something that’s mostly attributable to lousy pay, benefits, and working conditions.
As Charles Owens — a health care technician at the Cherry Hospital psychiatric facility in Goldsboro – explained at a Raleigh press conference, the state’s mental health facilities are already down hundreds of essential positions.
And that reality presents a big daily safety problem for him and the other workers who remain. The same is true for guards and other employees throughout the state’s prison system.
The bottom line: North Carolina is a big and fast growing state that needs more state employees to provide essential public services – not fewer. State lawmakers need to wake up to this reality.

President Donald Trump is clashing with the courts over what detainees are legally entitled to as Immigration and Customs Enforcement rounds up people it believes are undocumented and takes them overseas. 
A federal judge in Boston on Wednesday ruled that eight migrants sent to the violence-torn country of South Sudan were not given a meaningful chance to contest the deportations on the grounds that they would be put in danger. Only one of the individuals is from South Sudan.
The administration deported Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia to El Salvador even though a court issued an order forbidding it. The U.S. Supreme Court has subsequently ruled that the administration cannot deport people without giving them due process.
Most people of all ages and partisan affiliations believe that’s the proper course.
DHS Secretary Kristi Noem stumbles over questions from Democrats on habeas corpus

A poll released Tuesday by the Bullfinch Group and the National Immigration Forum gave respondents a brief definition of due process. Then they were asked whether they supported or opposed requiring due process before deporting people.
Sixty-three percent said they supported doing so, 23% were opposed, and 14% were undecided. That’s a 40-point margin in favor of due process.
Democrats supported due process for people facing deportation by a 81-11 margin. Independents supported it by a 59-23 margin. For Republicans, it was 51-35. 
In other words, the closest margin was 16 points.
The poll surveyed 1,200 adults between May 9 and 13. 
“Due process is essential to keeping American communities safe and immigration processes orderly,” Jennie Murray, president and CEO of the National Immigration Forum, said in a written statement. “This bedrock American value protects all of us.”
Even so, not all detainees have received due process in Ohio, said Lynn Tramonte, founder of the Ohio Immigrant Alliance.
Last month, her group got an attorney for a man who’d gotten a final order of deportation. The jail where the man was held wouldn’t allow the attorney to visit the man on less than a week’s notice, Tramonte said. 
“All of a sudden, the night before the attorney visit, he’s gone,” she said. “This was weeks before his scheduled deportation, so this is a clear indication that they wanted to get him out quickly because they knew he was getting a lawyer to fight his case.” 
Tramonte added, “It’s just not fair. The government has attorneys in every immigration case — in the courtroom — every single time. The immigrant deserves to have an attorney by their side, too.”
Tramonte didn’t give the man’s name or nationality to protect his identity. 
Most Americans appear to agree that such treatment is unfair, and unwise.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
A poll also conducted by the Bullfinch Group and the National Immigration Forum in December found that Americans overwhelmingly think that deportations should focus on immigrants who commit violent crime, that the persecuted should be protected, and that families should be kept intact.
The Trump administration’s continued harsh treatment of immigrants might be costing it in the court of public opinion.
An Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll conducted in late April found that immigration remained Trump’s strongest issue. Even so, more Americans disapproved of the job he was doing in that arena than approved — 53% to 46%. 
There also appeared to be little appetite for Trump to take measures on immigration that are even more sweeping. Forty-eight percent of respondents said that Trump had gone too far on immigration, 32% said his approach had been about right and just 18% said he hadn’t gone far enough.
Murray of the National Immigration Forum said people want the Trump administration to follow the law.
“Americans do not want our immigration system to undermine the rule of law,” she said. “We look forward to working with leaders on approaches that uphold fairness and due process.”

Ohio state Reps. Dontavius Jarrells, D-Columbus, and Monica Robb Blasdel, R-Columbiana, are introducing the Lead Line Replacement Act. 
“This legislation aims to keep our community safe and healthy by implementing a comprehensive regulatory framework to plan, execute, and assist in the replacement of all lead water lines in the state of Ohio,” Robb Blasdel said. “Lead water lines are a relic of the past. However, despite the danger, we know these are still in use all across our state.”

Ohio has 745,000 lead service lines and nearly 4,000 Ohio children are tested for high levels of lead poisoning, said Jarrells, who is a survivor of lead poisoning. 
“Ohio is in a crisis,” he said. “The number (of lead poisoning) is likely higher because of the reality that not every child in this state is tested.” 
The use of lead pipes was banned by Congress in 1986. In 2021, Ohio ranked third in the nation for the most lead pipes, according to the EPA. 
Lead is able to enter drinking water through the corrosion of lead or lead-contaminated water service lines. 
No amount of lead exposure is safe for children, the lawmakers said.
“Replacing each of these (lead lines) will be a challenging task, but one we firmly believe is attainable,” Robb Blasdel said. “This bill would mandate local water providers to work with the state to identify these lines, develop a plan to replace these lines with safe alternatives, and execute this plan over a 15 year time period.”
The Ohio Environmental Protection Agency would be responsible for overseeing enacting this mandate if the legislation passes.  
“This bill also prohibits partial replacements that can make contamination worse,” Jarrells said. 
It would cost nearly $5 billion to remediate every single lead line in Ohio, he said. 
“I didn’t introduce this in the budget because I wanted to do the work to make it bipartisan,” Jarrells said. 
He put forth a similar bill during the last General Assembly, but it only had sponsor testimony in committee. 
“This is necessary,” Jarrells said. “This is a human issue, and to introduce this bill with bipartisan support, that’s how we’re going to ultimately see this bill become law.”
Lawmakers say replacing Ohio’s lead lines would lead to fewer cases of dementia, depression, anemia, coronary heart disease, cardiovascular mortality, infant mortality, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. 
Lead poisoning poses a threat not just to children. Adults exposed to lead are more likely to experience increased risks of cardiovascular disease, high blood pressure, kidney and nervous system problems, said Annalisa Rocca, the drinking water manager for the Ohio Environmental Council Action Fund. 
“I grew up turning on the kitchen tap without a second thought, and most Ohioans still do the same, unaware that an unseen lead service line may be supplying their water,” she said. 
Archie Beasley, lead program director of the Junction Coalition, serves a Toledo neighborhood that has 100-year-old homes with lead lines underneath them that are transporting lead into kitchens and bathrooms. 
“We’re going to make sure that no child goes to their kitchen sink, that no child goes to their grandmother’s kitchen sink and gets water out of the refrigerator, and they’re going to be drinking lead water that is going to impact their health,” he said.

Gov. Jim Tressel speaking at a news conference. (Photo by Morgan Trau, WEWS.)Ohio Lt. Gov. Jim Tressel is still considering a run for governor, saying that the state GOP’s endorsement of Vivek Ramaswamy won’t affect his decision.
The night before the Ohio Republican Party Central Committee was set to endorse a candidate for the 2026 gubernatorial primary, Tressel said that he was interested in a possible run to succeed Gov. Mike DeWine. Because he commented so late, he wasn’t considered during the meeting as a candidate.
Strategists have been pushing the former OSU coach to jump into the race, but he hasn’t given a firm answer on what he plans to do.
We asked why he decided to say he was considering a run the night before the Ohio Republican Party endorsement, and whether he thinks that endorsement will impact his decision on whether to enter the race.
“Well, I don’t think an endorsement would impact, at least in my opinion, whether I would be interested in getting in the race or not,” he responded.
He said that wherever he goes, he has been getting “so many questions,” so he decided to say something.
In a meeting in Columbus on May 9, the Ohio Republican Party voted 60-3 in favor of Cincinnati entrepreneur Ramaswamy over Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost.
In an email to supporters Friday, Yost suspended his campaign, saying that although he has worked to better Ohio for years, this is “not a time for a family squabble.”
On the Democratic side, the only candidate to announce so far is former Ohio Health Department director Dr. Amy Acton.

When asked his thoughts about infighting for the primary nomination, Tressel explained that he isn’t experienced enough to have an opinion about “squabbles” or what “the party needs,” but that he is going around the state and speaking at dinners with “enthusiasts.”
“They’re thinking about this whole election cycle and their excitement and so forth, but I don’t really know about whether the family squabble gobble thing,” he said. “Every voter deserves a chance to decide what they’d like to vote for.”
We asked him what his top three priorities would be as governor. After saying we stumped him, he proceeded to explain he wants to focus on the livelihood of Ohioans — similar to DeWine.
“I always hear [DeWine] talk about safety, that he wants every person to feel safe and be safe,” he responded. “I’ve heard him talk every day about wanting every Ohioan to reach their God-given potential, and to me, those sound like non-negotiables. You better do darn well at those.”
He emphasized that he is an “education buff” as well. Also, he wants to make sure that veterans are supported.
He spoke to reporters following an event honoring fallen soldiers.
“Education is a big deal to me, and tradition, like we had today, and remembering sacrifice, being grateful, to me, might be number one,” he said.
We are awaiting a response from Ramaswamy’s team for his reaction.
Tressel didn’t have an answer on when he would, if he does, officially announce.

(Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)The Kansas Open Records Act makes clear demands of state and local government.
This vital law requires timely release of public records within three business days of receiving a request. If officials can’t fulfill that timeline, they’re required to explain why, in detail.
The Kansas Senate Committee on Government Efficiency claims to be working for the good of all by ferreting out waste and bloat in state government. Perhaps it should start with itself, or at least with chairwoman Renee Erickson, R-Wichita. She led the effort to stonewall news media requests for public recommendations submitted to COGE through its online portal. Kansas Reflector requested the records from her on Feb. 25. They weren’t released until April 9 — more than six weeks later.
By that time, our reporter Anna Kaminski had already examined a leaked copy of public feedback.
That batch of public comments suggested why Erickson pushed the public release until after the legislative session ended. Kansans blasted the committee with messages calling for Medicaid expansion, legalized cannabis and tolerance for LGBTQ+ youths. They show, in short, how anti-government narratives miss the mark in Kansas, where right-wing ideologues have poisoned the well of state government for years.
On Wednesday, Kansas Reflector editor in chief Sherman Smith submitted a complaint to the state Attorney General’s Office about this delay. Erickson’s committee did not respond to our request in a timely manner, and the broader public suffered because crucial information was hidden from them. COGE members could access the messages in mid-March, but their constituents could not. We believe that government officials should be held responsible for delay and obfuscation.
We heard attempts to justify the delays at a COGE meeting May 13. There were just so many messages. We had to screen them all. We didn’t delete anything.
Gordon Self, a legislative staff member, opined: “Once the KORA requests were received and a response was made, there was a review of the records, all 2,000, to determine if any of the records did contain information. After a thorough review, there were some identified that did have some sensitive information in them.”
Erickson harumphed: “At the end of the day, there are none that have been deleted, there are none that are not available for review. But as was said, we wanted to make sure that we were not including information that was not appropriate for such a situation.”
Forgive me for rolling my eyes. These self-satisfied excuses don’t add up.
None of the messages reviewed by Kansas Reflector staff appear to include sensitive information that the government had to shield from prying eyes. As noted earlier, a tranche of unredacted submissions was leaked to us in late March. We have compared the two versions. There’s no there there.
In one message, for instance, Statehouse staff omitted a profane phrase. That didn’t protect anyone’s personal or private information.
In another case, the same suggestion was apparently submitted in two categories. The messages mention Senate President Ty Masterson’s lucrative side hustle at Wichita Stare University, where he earns more than $150,000 a year as “director of GoCreate, a Koch Collaborative.” In one of them, Masterson’s name has been redacted, along with that of the author. In the other, neither Masterson nor the author has been redacted.
Only a few dozen of the thousand-plus messages saw any redactions at all.
Perhaps Statehouse staff don’t have the slightest idea what they’re doing. Perhaps they made a few random edits to the messages to justify the month-plus delay. Neither option should fill Kansans with confidence in their legislators or the work of COGE.
Finally, and perhaps most importantly, he COGE web portal includes the warning that “Portal submissions are public records that are subject to the Kansas Open Records Act.” Those sending in feedback have to check a box next to that warning. Why even bother to do that if you’re going to screen the material afterward?
Like other public records conflicts, this runs the risk of sounding petty. So what, I can hear some readers ask. You got the information anyway. Why fuss?
My answer remains the same as when I wrote about Emporia Stare University’s unconscionable response in turning over information to Kansas Reflector. This information belongs to everyone. Lawmakers don’t get to pass a law and then arbitrarily decide whether to follow it. If they expect town and county governments to follow KORA, if they expect other state agencies to follow KORA, they can damn well follow it themselves.
That’s what justice and fair play demands. That’s what their fellow Kansans deserve. And it’s what we’re going to do, no matter Erickson’s sanctimonious claptrap.

(Photo by Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images)It’s no secret Americans are struggling. From rent to groceries to medical care, the cost of living keeps climbing — and now, Congress is considering cuts to the very programs that help people survive.
It seems like we’re in for rougher times ahead — and our leaders at home haven’t made it any easier. Earlier this year, the Ohio House passed a budget proposal with a dangerous provision: If the federal government ever reduces its contribution to Medicaid, Ohio would immediately revoke health insurance for more than 750,000 Ohioans.
I understand the desire for fiscal responsibility — but eliminating life-saving programs isn’t responsible. It’s cruel.
I’ve lived with cerebral palsy my entire life. I rely on 10 hours of Medicaid-funded home care each day through Ohio’s Individual Options (I/O) waiver. This care helps me live independently at Creative Living, a supportive community in Columbus for people with disabilities. Without it, I wouldn’t be able to get out of bed, manage my health, or live on my own.
My income is $1,528 per month from Supplemental Security Income (SSI). That modest amount covers my rent, groceries, and basic needs. Without Medicaid, I’d lose my independence — and possibly my home. I’d be forced to rely on my aging parents, who can’t provide the kind of intensive care I need.
Losing Medicaid would introduce a huge unknown into my life. I have a loving family I could lean on — but many people don’t. I honestly don’t know what my life would look like without it: no home care, no therapy, no transportation, no housing. I’d lose rental support, medical care, and the freedom to move or live like any other bachelor in his mid-30s.
Even my wheelchair could become a luxury — something easy enough to axe.
But I’m not alone by far. More than 1 in 4 Ohioans rely on Medicaid – including 40% of children, 20% of working-age adults, and 10% of seniors. Republicans’ proposed budget cuts would send shockwaves through our communities, taking away support from those who need it and straining our already-overburdened health care system.
Since Medicaid expansion, Ohio’s uninsured rate has been cut in half. That means more people getting preventive care and fewer costly ER visits and hospital stays. Cutting Medicaid now would reverse that progress and hurt everyone — including hospitals, providers, and taxpayers. Some lawmakers justify these cuts by pointing to “fraud,” but the real impact would be stripping care from children, working families, seniors, and disabled people like me. We would suffer — just to make room for more tax breaks for the wealthy.
What I receive isn’t extravagant. It’s basic, essential care. Cutting it isn’t about reform: it’s blatant, anti-human abandonment. Watching politicians push these cuts while handing out giveaways to those at the top should outrage every American. Is that the kind of nation we want to be?
I urge our state representatives and members of Congress to reject Medicaid cuts and protect services that provide basic needs. Congress should make the ultra-wealthy pay their fair share and invest in programs that actually keep people alive. We don’t need to gut these programs — we need to make them work better.
These cuts would be devastating — for me, and for hundreds of thousands of others across our state who deserve to live with dignity.

As another school year ends, superintendents across the United States are staring down an autumn staffing crisis, with 1 in 8 teaching positions either vacant or filled by an underqualified educator.
States that are struggling with post-pandemic teacher shortages have spent millions to lure replacements and retain veterans with hiring bonuses and bumps in salaries. But hiring gaps remain, so some states also are trying another tactic: changing their standards.
The changes in teacher training and licensing come amid widespread turmoil in public schools: Tax revenue is being siphoned toward private school vouchers in many states; some classrooms are being scrutinized for banned books, displays or teaching lessons that trip into diversity, equity and inclusion territory; and students who went through pandemic-era shutdowns are struggling both with sitting still and with learning the material.
Some surveys show that fewer than a fifth of teachers are happy in their jobs.
“Teaching is not seen as an attractive profession right now,” said Drew Gitomer, an expert on teaching assessment at Rutgers Graduate School of Education.
“COVID exacerbated things, and teachers are caught in the middle of political battles — over curriculum, book bans, even personal attacks,” he said. “It’s not a healthy work environment, and that drives people away.”










Teaching is not seen as an attractive profession right now.


– Drew Gitomer, an expert on teaching assessment at Rutgers Graduate School of Education


Last year, Illinois enacted a law allowing teacher candidates to begin student teaching before passing content-area exams. It was an effort to reduce barriers for underrepresented groups, the measure’s sponsor said.
A bill under consideration this year would give more districts discretion over whether to factor pupils’ test scores into teacher evaluations, a break from a 15-year-old mandate.
In New Jersey, a new law formally removes the Praxis Core exam — traditionally used as an entry-level screening tool for aspiring teachers — from certification requirements.
And in Nevada — one of the states hit hardest by teacher shortages — a bill would streamline licensure for incoming educators. The bill would allow teachers credentialed in other states to begin working in Nevada classrooms while awaiting formal approval.
It also would remove extra steps for teachers switching grade levels and would waive application fees for recent substitute teachers.
Linda Darling-Hammond, founding president and chief knowledge officer of the Learning Policy Institute, a nonpartisan think tank, said teacher shortages hit hardest in schools serving low-income students and students of color, where instability often leads to larger class sizes, canceled courses or a revolving door of substitute teachers.
“When you walk into a school facing shortages, you see instability,” she said. “Students may be taught by people who don’t know what to do, who leave quickly, and who often rely more on discipline than engagement.”
The root cause? Teacher attrition.
Rapidly expanding school voucher programs pinch state budgets

“Nine out of 10 vacancies every year are because of attrition — and two-thirds of that is not retirement,” Darling-Hammond said. “Support in the beginning matters. Teachers who come in and get a mentor stay longer. If you’re just thrown in to sink or swim, the odds of leaving are much greater.”
States have long struggled to attract teachers, and credentialing changes aren’t unusual. But some education advocates fear long-term repercussions.
Melissa Tooley, director of K-12 educator quality at the left-leaning think tank New America, said most states now offer alternative and fast-track teacher certification pathways, many of which allow candidates to start teaching with little or no pedagogical training in how to teach.
“We’re churning through people who might have potential, but we’re not setting them up for success,” she said. “A lot of what states are doing is short term. It’s about filling seats, not necessarily building a sustainable or high-quality workforce.”
More than 40 states require aspiring teachers to take the costly Praxis Subject test for the subject they want to teach, which some experts argue excludes strong candidates and duplicates other assessments.
“You were excluding people who might be good teachers but didn’t do well on that specific test,” said Rutgers’ Gitomer, who has researched the test’s effects on recruitment.
However, he added, dropping tests doesn’t necessarily help.
Several states — Georgia, New Jersey, New York, Washington and Wisconsin — have dropped a licensure requirement known as edTPA since 2022, but there’s little evidence the move has helped ease teacher shortages, Gitomer said. (The acronym stands for Educative Teacher Performance Assessment and involves a portfolio that includes testing and videos of classroom performance.)
Some states reexamine school discipline as Trump order paves go-ahead

“The state eliminated edTPA but didn’t replace it with a specific alternative,” he said.
“Instead, it gave full discretion back to individual institutions to develop or adopt their own performance assessments,” he said. “When we talked to institutions, it became pretty clear they didn’t think removing edTPA would be a major driver in addressing the shortage — and they haven’t seen evidence that it has been.”
 How best to credential

Tooley said state credentialing systems must navigate a delicate balance: ensuring there are enough teachers, maintaining instructional quality and increasing workforce diversity.
“There’s this triangle — three pieces that need to be in place — and I think there are real tensions when it comes to how states are designing their certification policies,” she said.
And Gitomer described a fragmented national landscape, where some states are tightening teacher entry standards while others are dramatically loosening them — even allowing non-degreed individuals to teach.
“Some states are trying to raise standards; others are relaxing them to the point where you may not even need a college degree,” he said.
Indiana now requires all pre-K through grade 6 and special education teachers to complete 80 hours of training on the “science of reading,” a method that includes phonics, and pass an exam by 2027. State Sen. Jean Leising, a Republican, has proposed cutting the requirement in half, calling it “an excessive burden with little actual benefit” in a news release.
In Texas, a bill aims to reduce the use of uncertified teachers by the 2029-30 school year. The legislation would set a gradual cap on the percentage of uncertified teachers districts can employ in core curriculum classes — starting at 20% in 2026-27 and decreasing to 5% in 2029-30.
According to the Texas Education Agency, 31% of new hires in 2024-25 lacked a state teaching certificate or permit.
Yet some states stand out for how they’re changing their requirements, Tooley said.
She pointed to Washington, which has designed a recruitment strategy encouraging paraprofessionals, often known as teacher’s aides, to become classroom teachers. Also known as paraeducators, they’re a group with classroom experience, community ties and higher retention likelihood.
There, school districts are required to offer foundational training — ranging from 14 to 28 hours — directly to paraeducators.
Plagued by teacher shortages, some states turn to fast-track credentialing

In West Virginia, a new law now allows districts to count full-time behavior interventionists working in one or two classrooms toward meeting the required number of aides or paraprofessionals in K-3 classrooms.
Tooley noted that Pennsylvania and Alabama are experimenting with “menu-style” licensing flexibility — allowing candidates to demonstrate qualification through various combinations of GPA and test scores, rather than rigid cutoffs.
“These are people already in schools, often from the same cultural or linguistic backgrounds as students,” Tooley said. “They’re more likely to succeed and to stay.”
 Low pay

A 2024 national survey by the EdWeek Research Center found that public school teachers are increasingly reporting declines in mental health, job satisfaction and classroom stability. Seventy percent of teachers recommended student mental health interventions, and nearly half said schools lack enough counselors, psychologists and social workers.
As mental well-being has worsened, the share of public school teachers who are very satisfied with their jobs has also declined by 2 percentage points from the previous year, to 18%, according to the survey, which was conducted by the EdWeek Research Center on behalf of Merrimack College.
While teacher wellness supports remain limited, educators say improvements in pay and student discipline are the most needed changes.
To entice passionate but burned out educators from leaving the workforce, several states have raised minimum teacher pay. Arkansas boosted salaries to $50,000 statewide, and South Carolina raised starting pay to $47,000. South Dakota enacted a $45,000 minimum with yearly increases, and penalties for districts that fail to comply by 2026. Connecticut advanced a bill setting a $63,450 salary floor, while Indiana and others are eyeing further increases.
At the federal level, the proposed American Teacher Act seeks to establish a national $60,000 minimum salary for teachers at a qualifying school to boost recruitment and retention across the country. The bill, sponsored by U.S. Rep. Frederica Wilson, a Florida Democrat, remains in committee.

,California,2025-05-22 07:01:00+00:00,CalMatters,Gavin Newsom’s off-the-mark budget numbers undermine his credibility again,Dan Walters,,,,,https://calmatters.org/commentary/2025/05/newsoms-budget-numbers-credibility/,"Wrong revenue projections a few years ago led California to overspend, creating structural deficits. Now underestimated  Medi-Cal costs are blowing holes in the latest proposed budget.","Gov. Gavin Newsom’s revised state budget assumes California will see a sharp decline in projected revenue, largely because President Donald Trump’s tariffs will slow the nation’s economy.
Newsom blames a “Trump slump,” as well as an unanticipated increase in spending on Medi-Cal, California’s medical program for the poor, for punching a $12 billion hole in the budget.
Both of those factors, however, underscore a consistent trend in budgets Newsom has proposed and signed during the last six years — projections of income and outgo that miss the mark, often by many billions of dollars, thus undermining the credibility of the governor’s financial depictions.
The most obvious example happened in May 2022, as the state’s economy was recovering from the brief but severe recession caused by shutdowns during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Newsom presented a revised 2022-23 budget that was $14 billion higher than his original proposal, boasting that the state was experiencing a $97.5 billion surplus. “No other state in American history has ever experienced a surplus as large as this,” Newsom said as he unveiled the revision.
The budget he signed a month later added still another $7 billion in spending with immense new commitments, including cash payments to poor families, expanded health care for undocumented immigrants and new funds for early childhood education.
The surplus Newsom extolled, however, was an illusion. He and his budget advisors had assumed that a one-time spike in state revenues would be permanent, setting a new base of personal and corporate income taxes and sales taxes well in excess of $200 billion a year.
But it didn’t happen.
A year ago, a brief passage in Newsom’s 2024-25 budget revision acknowledged the error.
“Due to the revenue spike from 2019-20 to 2021-22, the budget acts of 2021 and 2022 were based on forecasts that projected substantially greater revenues in the last two fiscal years than occurred,” the budget declared.
“Substantially greater” indeed.
An accompanying chart on revenues from the state’s three major tax sources revealed that “The total difference across the four fiscal years is a negative $165.1 billion,” meaning the error was $40 billion or more a year.
However, the fiscal damage was done. Newsom and the Legislature had already committed the state to tens of billions of dollars in new spending based on revenues that didn’t exist. They created what’s called a structural deficit — a chronic gap between income and outgo — that’s currently estimated at $10 billion to $30 billion a year.
One might think that, having made such an immense error of fiscal judgment, Newsom and his Department of Finance would be ultra-careful in projecting revenues and spending.
Apparently not.
Last year, one of those 2022 commitments based on the erroneous surplus projection — the extension of Medi-Cal coverage to everyone in the state, including undocumented immigrants — took effect. Early this year, the administration revealed Medi-Cal costs were outpacing expectations by more than $6 billion, mostly due to the coverage expansion.
In other words it’s a double whammy. The false assumption of budget surpluses has been compounded by a false assumption about Medi-Cal costs, thereby worsening the structural deficit that, if left to fester, would compound itself even more. The Legislative Analyst’s Office says the deficit could reach $42 billion by 2028-29.
The administration’s sorry record on income and outgo projections should make the Legislature and the voting public very skeptical of Newsom’s current assumption that the “Trump slump” from tariffs will punch an even larger hole in the budget. 
That certainly could happen, but with tariffs and their impact shifting day-to-day, putting any number on the revenue impacts is nothing more than guesswork. And we already know that the administration’s fiscal guesses are unreliable.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/051425_Newsom-May-Budget_FG_CM_06.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-05-22 03:02:08.410248

Republican Gov. Brian Kemp and state regulators hailed on Wednesday Georgia Power’s tentative agreement to freeze base rates for the next three years as a symbol of the state’s economic growth.
Some clean energy advocates dismissed the timing of the Republican governor’s Wednesday press conference as an effort to shore up support for two sitting GOP Georgia Public Service Commission members before they face voters on this year’s ballot. 
On Monday, Georgia Power and the PSC staff reached an agreement for the company to “freeze” its base electric rates from 2026 to 2028.
The PSC is scheduled to hold hearings on the agreement in June that, if approved by the commission, would eliminate the need for this year’s planned rate case, which normally occurs every three years.
Critics say that despite the rate “freeze,” Georgia Power customers will still see their utility bills go up as hundreds of millions of dollars from storm damage and fuel recovery expenses are approved.
On Wednesday, Kemp credited lower electricity bills with the state attracting 193,000 jobs and $90 billion in industrial investments since 2019. 
“We are freezing (rates) because of smart choices by our utilities and buyers, the people you see here beside me today and many other leaders around the state,” Kemp said while flanked Wednesday by PSC Chairman Jason Shaw and Commissioner Lauren “Bubba” McDonald, who are not up for re-election this year. “Our rates are stable even in the midst of unprecedented growth because we have a strong, reliable energy grid and strong partners in both private and public sectors. 
“Coupled with the falling gas prices, this rate freeze will help Georgia families in the time they needed it most — after historic inflation and storms that challenged many people’s day-to-day lives,” Kemp said.
This week’s announcement is ahead of the early voting period that starts this coming Tuesday for the June 17 primary election for the two commission seats on the ballot this year. The winners will go on to compete in the Nov. 4 general election.
Republican incumbents Tim Echols and Fitz Johnson are facing challengers seeking to upset their bids to remain on the board.
Echols, who is seeking his third term on the PSC, will face challenger Lee Muns in the Republican primary for the commission’s District 2 seat. Whoever wins will face Alicia Johnson of Savannah, the sole Democrat in that race.
A large field of candidates qualified to run for the metro and suburban Atlanta area district represented by Johnson, who is seeking re-election after being appointed by Kemp to fill a vacancy in 2021.
Clock ticking for Georgia voter registration to elect two new members to Public Service Commission

One of the Democratic candidates is Daniel Blackman, who served as a regional administrator for the Environmental Protection Agency under President Joe Biden, and forced a run-off against McDonald in the 2020 PSC election.
Brionte McCorkle, the executive director of Georgia Conservation Voters, said the “freeze” will help Georgia Power ratepayers but said she suspects the agreement and Wednesday’s press conference is a political move to avoid voter backlash during an election year.
She accuses the five-member commission of having a history of favoring Georgia Power’s “irresponsible investments in fossil fuels” and ignoring public calls for renewable energy.
“Don’t get me wrong, I’m excited that there is a pause to the relentless rate increases that Georgians have experienced for the past several years,” McCorkle said. “But make no mistake, this is definitely an attempt to kick the rate increase down the road when there’s not two important elections on the ballot.” 
During the June hearing, expert witnesses for Georgia Power and PSC staff will present evidence and testimony and be cross examined by consumer and clean energy watchdogs, environmental groups, industrial customers and others. 
Commissioners are set to take a final vote on the new agreement on July 1.
Environmental groups said they’d like to get more information about the negotiated agreement that comes after a series of hikes since the start of 2023. Since then the average Georgia Power residential customer is paying about $43 more to cover base electric rate increases, excess fuel expenses, storm costs and the completion of two nuclear power generators at the Plant Vogtle.





Jennifer Whitfield, senior attorney with the Southern Environmental Law Center, said the “freeze” doesn’t mean Georgia Power customers won’t face higher bills since looming storm and fuel recovery costs would result in rate increases.





“What this agreement does is it says the only rate increases that will happen, other than fuel costs that could go up and down in the next couple of years, will be to the base rate for storm costs,” Whitfield said.
Shaw emphasized the role of reliable utilities and his own commission in maintaining low energy costs. 
Shaw denied the agreement was announced in order to ease criticism of board members while on the campaign trail this year.
Kemp defended the Public Service Commission’s handling of complex utility cases and said it’s ironic that there are complaints about base electric rates being paused for three years. 
“I think this is good news to sell to our state,” Kemp said. “The time, to me, doesn’t matter. We’re talking about an upcoming primary election for down ballot offices that will have to be decided in November. We’re not basing our calendars around here on what political elections are coming up.”
Georgia Power and PSC officials say that the company’s fuel and storm damage costs aren’t profit based, but instead intended to cover fuel cost overruns and money spent responding to natural disasters such as last year’s Hurricane Helene.
Georgia Power was expected to include storm damage assessments as part of its 2025 rate case. Instead, Georgia Power is currently undergoing an audit of storm-related costs and is set to file for recovery expenses in 2026. 
“This stipulated agreement helps balance the affordability needs of our customers while ensuring Georgia Power remains equipped to continue its support of our state’s incredible growth – which is good for all of our stakeholders,” Georgia Power spokesman John Kraft said in a statement.
Georgia Power projects that over the next decade the growth of data centers will significantly increase the state’s electricity consumption. The proliferation of data centers has become a source of consternation for a number of consumer and environmental watchdogs.
But on Wednesday, Shaw credited the rate case deal agreement with another agreement this year in which Georgia Power agreed not to pass down costs to serve data centers and other large manufacturers onto other customers.  
“Part of the reason we’re able to stand here today, in my opinion, is because we’re able to do things that other states weren’t able to do,” Shaw said. “We’re able to show that the revenue from these large load customers is indeed putting downward pressure on rates for others.”

Megan Hunt of Omaha listens to State Sen. Dave Murman of Glenvil kneeling at her desk. March 12, 2024. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — An uneasy compromise that became the Education Committee package bill died on the Nebraska statehouse floor Wednesday, in part because the quest to infuse more religion into public schools failed. 
A cross-section of committee members tried to get a group of loosely related education proposals out of committee and onto the floor for a month. 
The combined bill was viewed as a bipartisan deal involving several groups, including the conservative chair of the committee and the state’s largest teachers union, to marry a proposal that would allow K-12 students to be excused during the school day for off-site religious instruction and coursework to a bill from State Sen. Ashlei Spivey of Omaha that would help schools find more long-term substitutes so teachers could take paid time off around significant life events. 
Some who backed the deal have said that parents can already sign out their kids for any reason and that they do not see it as a state endorsement of religion. Other lawmakers have expressed that it would open the door for other religious-themed bills.
Floor debate tense
The floor debate was like many of the tense executive sessions on the package. The deal blew up on the floor after State Sen. Megan Hunt of Omaha successfully removed Central City’s State Sen. Loren Lippincott’s Legislative Bill 550, a release time proposal, killing the whole package.

While the original deal is dead – lawmakers involved in negotiations let lawmakers skip over the bill. Their aim: to bring back a cleaner version of LB 306 — mainly some clean-up language sought by State Sen. Dave Murman of Glenvil to address change terms and provisions in state law relating to higher education in the session’s final days while giving lawmakers an opportunity to pro attach their proposals to it individually and let the full Legislature vote on each. 
“I think in any normal course of a session, a bill like LB 550 would be seen as a radical piece of legislation,” Hunt said. 
The vote to remove Lippincott’s proposal was bipartisan, 25-9. Lawmakers from both sides of the aisle expressed concerns about the logistical challenges of letting students leave, including how often students would miss classes. Some wondered whether it might blur the line between church and state. The Lippincott bill was part of a national lobbying effort by a Christian education organization with ties to the populist right, LifeWise Academy. Lippincott confirmed in previous reporting that his bill is modeled after other states’ “release time” legislation.
Jesse Vohwinkel, LifeWise Academy’s Vice President of Growth, testified in favor of Lippincott’s bill during its public hearing in February. The company was mentioned multiple times during the debate. 
Some GOP dissent
In recent weeks, some legislative Republicans have privately told the Examiner that Lippincott’s bill could go a step too far for them. The vote indicates the climb some social conservatives backing religious bills face.

“I find that it has a high potential of being very discriminatory against other faiths,” State Sen. Merv Riepe of Ralston said during the debate. 
After the Lippincott proposal was removed from the package, state Sen. Dan Lonowski of Hastings attempted to remove Spivey’s bill from the package. It failed by a 22-16 vote, needing 25 votes. Then, after the failed motion to remove Spivey’s bill, some Republicans on the committee said Democrats had broken the “deal.” Education Committee Chair State Sen. Murman and other Republicans tanked the package. 
“We had an agreement in the Education Committee,” Murman said. “All of us on the committee had to compromise a little bit … the compromise is no longer in effect.”
Democrats on the committee said Murman’s approach requiring LB 550 in the package had caused the tension. The final nail came in an 8-29 vote, with the Legislature failing to adopt the committee package as an amendment to the bill, LB 306, killing Spivey’s priority bill and other parts of the package.
The Spivey bill sought to give teachers up to three weeks of paid leave to deal with significant life events. The bill would have paid for this leave using a new payroll fee on teacher salaries to cover the costs of paying long-term substitutes while the teachers are out. The fee would also help pay for special education teacher recruitment and retention.
NSEA frustration
The Nebraska State Education Association, one of the brokers of the package, saw the deal blow up as Tim Royers, president of the Nebraska State Education Association, was behind the glass watching lawmakers. He said the union was “disappointed” with the outcome.

“We’re disappointed with the vote. Only 8% of educators feel the Legislature takes them into account when they craft education policy,” Royers said. “Tonight’s vote is indicative of why they feel that way. We fully intend to come back next session and get a bill to the Governor’s desk.”
But the union may not need to wait long if the late compromise between Murman and other lawmakers who want to revive a backup plan comes to fruition. Speaker John Arch said he would bring the base of LB 306 back during the last few days of the session. 
The impromptu compromise came after Omaha State Sen. Machaela Cavanaugh threatened to grind the Legislature to a halt over the package’s death.
“This is awful when we can’t pass the committee priority package bill because the committee chairman won’t even vote for his own committee amendment,” Cavanaugh said. “This session is an abomination.” 
Lippincott told the Examiner that he’s considering attempting to propose his amended version of LB 550. However, he said he was thinking about it realistically, as a majority of senators have already rejected his proposal. 
Murman said the remaining proposals that were part of the package would likely get votes as separate amendments. 
“Making laws is like making sausage; you hope it sticks together,” Murman said. “It didn’t.”

(Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — A late legislative attempt Wednesday to give additional protections to health care practitioners who recommend medical cannabis to Nebraska patients fell well short of moving forward a day after a broader medical cannabis regulatory bill stalled.
State Sen. John Cavanaugh of Omaha sought to add those physician liability protections Wednesday to a broader Health and Human Services Committee bill: Legislative Bill 376. The measure seeks to slash various reporting requirements and make other changes primarily in the Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services. 
Cavanaugh said his effort was a “solution” that would be a “small but meaningful step” for some of the families who showed up Tuesday for LB 677, the medical cannabis regulatory bill from State Sen. Ben Hansen of Blair. LB 677 failed 23-22, falling 10 votes short of overcoming an all-day filibuster.
“Give these families some hope, some opportunity to get access to what the voters approved at over 70%,” Cavanaugh told his colleagues. “Vote to give doctors some small protection if they follow their conscience and their training.”
‘Absolute failure’: Medical cannabis regulatory bill stalls in Nebraska Legislature

Under the ballot measures approved in November, a patient can possess up to 5 ounces of medical cannabis for any condition with a health care practitioner’s recommendation.
Physician recommendation hesitancy
However, DHHS has not issued guidance and many advocates have reported that in-state physicians have refused to issue any medical cannabis recommendations. Until medical dispensaries are licensed, which is required under the voter-approved law by Oct. 1, cannabis can’t legally be purchased in Nebraska.
Part of Cavanaugh’s push also comes as Nebraska Attorney General Mike Hilgers has acknowledged the possibility of investigating the licenses of physicians who recommend cannabis and continued to challenge the voter-approved laws. 
  State Sen. John Cavanaugh of Omaha speaks with reporters after a legislative proposal seeking to help implement medical cannabis stalls in committee. April 17, 2025. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)
Under Cavanaugh’s amendment, in language identical to the medical provider protections in LB 677, a health care practitioner could not be arrested, prosecuted or disciplined solely for providing a written recommendation or for stating in their professional opinion that a patient is likely to benefit from using cannabis to treat or alleviate a medical condition.
The Nebraska Medical Association had voiced support for the protections.
‘Cheap parlor trick’
State Sen. Bob Andersen of north-central Sarpy County, who staunchly opposed LB 677, argued that Cavanaugh’s amendment was not “germane,” or related, to LB 376. Speaker John Arch of La Vista, a former HHS Committee chair who was presiding over the Legislature at the time, agreed.
Cavanaugh moved to overrule the chair, which fell short 15-30, so the proposal didn’t reach an overarching vote. The motion needed at least 24 votes because three senators had left the Capitol.

Hansen, a former HHS Committee chair, said there was no “boogeyman” in the amendment.
But State Sen. Brian Hardin of Gering, current chair of the HHS Committee, called the attempt a “cheap parlor trick” that could get LB 376 vetoed. Gov. Jim Pillen has said LB 677 wasn’t needed.
“Fascinating process of playing chess where they’re trying to deep-six the committee bill from HHS with an unwelcome amendment,” Hardin said.
State Sens. Bob Hallstrom of Syracuse and Mike Moser of Columbus also disagreed that the amendment was in the “natural and logical sequence” to the subject matter of LB 376,” as Cavanaugh argued under legislative rules. Cavanaugh also pointed to a section in the bill that discussed civil and criminal protections for certain physicians or hospital staff.

If the amendment was worthy, Hallstrom and Moser said, senators needed more time.
“I think this is crazy,” Moser said of the amendment, lambasting that it came around 8 p.m.
Last-minute amendments, particularly late at night in legislative sessions, are not unusual.
Germaneness is a mixed bag
State Sen. Megan Hunt of Omaha said she thought the amendment was germane and that her opinion was just as valuable as that of Hallstrom or Moser.
Hunt said the “gag” is that germaneness is whatever the majority says it is. She pointed to the 2023 merger of bills to restrict abortion and health care for transgender youths, which State Sen. Wendy DeBoer of Omaha also mentioned. The Nebraska Supreme Court later affirmed the combined 2023 bill as having been germane.
DeBoer said she understood Wednesday’s hesitation and asked Cavanaugh why he chose a last-second approach and hadn’t warned Hardin or others before filing his amendment. He responded that LB 677 stalled late Tuesday and that he came up with the idea Wednesday.

DeBoer said that if lawmakers followed past practice on determining germaneness, the amendment was likely germane. But she acknowledged “it’s kind of crappy to do it last minute like this, no offense.” 
DeBoer was one of seven senators who voted for LB 677 but on Wednesday voted to uphold Arch’s ruling against Cavanaugh’s amendment. The others were progressive State Sen. Danielle Conrad of Lincoln and conservative State Sens. Stan Clouse of Kearney, Myron Dorn of Adams, Rick Holdcroft of Bellevue and Jana Hughes of Seward.
‘Do the right thing’
The two senators voting to overrule Arch’s ruling and who did not vote for LB 677 were State Sen. Carolyn Bosn of Lincoln, who was “present, not voting” as she continued discussing concerns with Hansen, and State Sen. Ashlei Spivey of Omaha, who missed the final vote but had supported the bill.
Bosn, a former prosecutor who chairs the Judiciary Committee, and whom Pillen first appointed to the Legislature in 2023 before she was elected in November, told the Nebraska Examiner that she was convinced by Cavanaugh’s argument that LB 376 opened up many sections of law.

Had Cavanaugh’s amendment come up for a vote, Bosn confirmed she would have voted for it. Bosn said it made sense and is within legislative responsibility if physicians are reluctant to act. Bosn, Cavanaugh and Hansen said it was also a question the Legislature would have to grapple with soon because the regulatory commission can’t shield physicians through regulations.
In his final plea to senators, Cavanaugh uttered a popular phrase that the “hottest places in hell are reserved for those, when in times of moral crisis, preserve their neutrality.”
“Don’t relegate yourself to the hottest places in Hell,” Cavanaugh said. “Do the right thing for these families.”
Cavanaugh and Hansen said the medical cannabis fight continues in whatever way possible, either in the final seven days of the 2025 session, the regulatory process or in 2026.
Hansen pointed to a phrase on the north side of the State Capitol that he said was crucial as regulations moved forward: “The salvation of the state is watchfulness in the citizen.”



Germaneness of adding medical cannabis physician protections to LB 376
Speaker John Arch of La Vista ruled that liability protections for physicians who recommend medical cannabis was not “germane” to Legislative Bill 376. A vote to overrule Arch failed 15-30. It needed 24 votes.

But in other parts of the country, the shock remains and the debate continues.","Malik Shabazz representing Black Lawyers for Justice, second from left, leads a rally May 20 in Annapolis demanding the Maryland General Assembly override a veto by Gov. Wes Moore (D) of the Reparations Commission bill. (Photo by William J. Ford/Maryland Matters)Gov. Wes Moore’s veto of the Maryland Reparations Commission bill came as a shock to lawmakers here, but they are confident they can override the veto, making it little more than a temporary setback for the initiative.
“We’re not done in getting this bill into a law. That is the ultimately goal, no matter what hurdles are in front of us,” said Del. Aletheia McCaskill (D-Baltimore County), who sponsored a House version of the measure and helped pass Senate Bill 587, sponsored by Sen. C. Anthony Muse (D-Prince George’s).
For advocates around the country, however, the shock is still being felt. They worry about what the bill’s troubles in Maryland — a state with a Black governor, a Black attorney general, a Black House Speaker, a Democratic super-majority and a powerful Legislative Black Caucus — portend for efforts in their own states.
“Gov. Moore needs to realize that he’s not only impacting Maryland, but he’s impacting South Carolina and many other states with the veto,” said South Carolina state Rep. John King, a Democrat from the Rock Hill area of the state.
The Maryland bill called for the creation of a commission that would assess specific federal, state and local policies from 1877 to 1965, the post-Reconstruction and Jim Crow eras, that “led to economic disparities based on race, including housing, segregation and discrimination, redlining, restrictive covenants, and tax policies.”
The all-volunteer commission would also have examined how public and private institutions may have benefited from those policies, and would then recommend appropriate reparations, which could include statements of apology, monetary compensation, social service assistance, business incentives or child care costs. Unlike previous years, when reparations bills had price tags of $1 million or more, the bill passed this year drew heavily on volunteers and existing resources, and was expected to cost $54,500 in its first year.
In his veto letter, Moore praised the work and the intentions of those behind the bill, but said “now is not the time for another study. Now is the time for continued action that delivers results for the people we serve.” He cited a number of studies over the past 25 years on the legacy of slavery, and promised that his legislative agenda next year would include a package of proposals to “address the barriers that have walled off Black families in Maryland from work, wages and wealth for generations.”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Those justifications appeared to be lost on many advocates, however, who called the veto everything from shocking to a betrayal.
King expressed his disappointment on his Facebook page Monday, when he called on his state’s Democratic Party to rescind an invitation to Moore, who is scheduled to be the featured speaker at the party’s annual Blue Palmetto Dinner on May 30 in South Carolina. Tickets start at $150 for the dinner, which has featured potential presidential candidates in the past, like U.S. Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.), who headlined last year’s dinner with Sen. Raphael Warnock (D-Ga.).
“I will still support [the] governor, if he decided to run for president,” said King, who spent summers in Maryland where his mother grew up in the Baltimore area. But in light of the reparations veto, “I don’t think the timing is right for him to come to South Carolina,” he said in an interview Tuesday.
South Carolina Democratic Party officials did not respond to requests for comment, but as recently as Wednesday the party was sending out email appeals urging people to buy tickets for the dinner and the chance to “hear from Maryland Governor Wes Moore.”
King’s colleague, Rep. Annie McDaniel, a Democrat from Fairfield, said she also disagrees with Moore’s veto.
“I’m not saying whether the governor’s right or wrong. I’m just saying that the way he chose to handle this is not good,” McDaniel said in an interview Tuesday. “It’s not good for the plight that African Americans are on now in this state.”
But McDaniel, who chairs the state’s Legislative Black Caucus, also said Moore should attend the Blue Palmetto Dinner and explain himself. She said she would also like to see an invitation extended to Del. Jheanelle Wilkins (D-Montgomery), the chair of the Maryland Legislative Black Caucus.
“I think that would be an awesome opportunity,” McDaniel said. “I don’t want the conversation to be one-sided. I believe in fairness. I just think that having her [Wilkins] in the room and having him [Moore] in the room at the same time will give us an opportunity to hear both sides.”
Wilkins declined to comment Tuesday. A spokesperson for the governor’s office also declined to comment.
‘Reparations now’
Moore’s veto Friday was announced hours after he spoke at commencement for the University of Maryland Eastern Shore, one of the state’s four historically Black colleges and universities, and the day before an unrelated reparations rally in Washington, D.C.
Moore to veto reparations bill, one of a list of measures he will reject

The governor’s decision has sparked some conversation on online broadcasts and among civil rights organizations. David Johns, CEO and executive director of the National Black Justice Collective, called the governor’s decision in a statement Tuesday “a betrayal of generational efforts to pursue truth, healing, and repair.”
“As the first Black governor of Maryland, Gov. Moore had an opportunity to lead with moral clarity, political courage, and historical awareness,” Johns said in a statement Tuesday. “Instead, his decision represents a dangerous step backward in the long and necessary march toward racial justice.”
Outside the State House on Tuesday, as the governor was inside for the last bill-signing of the year, a small group of protesters stood on Lawyers Mall, holding signs and chanting: “What do we want? Reparations! When do we want it? Now!” The rally was led by Malik Shabazz, an attorney representing Black Lawyers for Justice, who said the legislature should override Moore’s veto.
“Clearly, the governor’s not for reparations,” Shabazz said to reporters. “And clearly, he’s looking to cut off a study and calculation of an assessment of the damages of what has been done to the people and the constituents of his own state, and that’s unacceptable.”
But Linda Lee Tarver, with the Black conservative organization Project 21, said Wednesday that reparations aren’t the answer to help Black communities.
Tarver, who runs a political consulting business in Lansing, Michigan, agreed with Moore’s veto message that studies have been, and continue to be, done by other organizations.  She referenced her own group’s policy recommendations, which include election integrity, reducing “harmful ‘environmental justice’ agenda,” making health care more market oriented and protecting science, technology, engineering and math instruction “from the poison of ‘equity’ activists.”
She said she was surprised at the apparent disconnect between Moore and the Legislative Black Caucus, which had endorsed the reparations bill.
“I believe that Gov. Wes Moore got caught in pretending to care for reparations, and then his pen was required, and he punted,” Tarver said. “It’s shameful. Just say up front you don’t believe in it.”
Disconnect or not, McCaskill said the debate is healthy — and the debate will continue as the commission moves forward, as she believes it will.
“I am excited to hear that it’s on folks’ minds, in opposition or proponents for it,” she said. “This commission is important to hear from all Marylanders because it will eventually affect every Marylander.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Reparations-rally-5-20-2025-1024x664.jpg,,,2025-05-22 01:03:24.763795

(Cindy Gonzalez/Nebraska Examiner)OMAHA — Could North Omaha create its own version of Kansas City’s Keystone Innovation District? Or Indianapolis’ 16 Tech, or the RICE innovation hub in Atlanta, which focuses on building Black businesses?
The three campuses were spotlighted Wednesday as examples of entrepreneurial and tech-centric hubs akin to what could be built locally as the Omaha Inland Port Authority embarks on its newest mission: development of an innovation district, funded partly with $30 million in state funding.
  Small groups generated ideas and goals for the innovation district poised to rise in Omaha’s Inland Port Authority boundaries. (Cindy Gonzalez/Nebraska Examiner)
Nearly 100 people turned out for the public meeting that kicked off a six-month visioning process for the new district, which is to be developed within the boundaries of the port authority’s roughly 3,000 acres in North Omaha, near Eppley Airfield.
Davielle Phillips, an Omaha architect who is vice chair of the port authority board, said the initiative got off to a good start, with more participation than anticipated at the meeting held at the Venue at Highlander Accelerator. 
The board is also overseeing development of an industrial-focused business park funded by a separate $90 million state grant. That initiative, in contrast, was beset early on by criticism that the development team did not seek enough public engagement and input.
For the innovation district, the port authority board hired HR&A Advisors Inc. as a consultant that, along with partners Lamp Rynearson and Vireo, are to create a business plan model for the local innovation district. The consulting contract is for $546,000.
 Music, block parties, housing

During the public meeting Wednesday, the consultant team presented demographic and other data about the North Omaha area and offered examples of other innovation districts. It also highlighted the health-focused EDGE District rising on the University of Nebraska Medical Center campus.
Participants split into groups to discuss what they’d like such a district to look like and achieve. Several said they’d like housing to be a component, along with job training. Many said they’d want the campus to nurture and grow tech startups; draw young talent; raise the area’s per capita income and have a multigenerational and multicultural flair.

One group said music should play a role, along with cultural events and block parties to build community.
Phillips said his goals for the meeting were met, including good attendance and engagement. He said he also wanted to clarify that the innovation district is separate from the long-discussed industrial business park, which was met with resistance from many area residents who worried the city might use the power of eminent domain to force acquisition. That option has been ruled out.
“I want to let people know we heard them; we listened,” Phillips said of the gathering. 
Other port authority board members attended, including mayoral chief of staff Tom Warren, as did North Omaha City Councilwoman-elect LaVonya Goodwin. 
Tuesday, focus groups were invited to offer input. Next steps, Phillips and the consultant said, include a public meeting this summer to continue to build upon the ideas.
 Spot, size yet to be determined

Still to be determined is the exact location of the innovation district within the port authority boundaries, along with its size, shape and character, Phillips said. He said the port authority board likely would seek bids for a developer to build out the district campus.
Both the innovation district and the industrial business park are to be anchors of the port authority and are seen as key to helping more private businesses produce jobs and economic development that benefits North Omaha area residents. 
Funds for both projects originally were approved by the Nebraska Legislature as part of the Nebraska Economic Recovery Act of 2022, seeded with federal pandemic-related dollars, though the legislation and funding sources have since been updated.

(Photo by William J. Ford/Maryland Matters)At-Large Montgomery County Councilmember Will Jawando (D) said Wednesday he will run to replace current County Executive Marc Elrich (D), who is term-limited and cannot run for a third term next year.
Elrich was on hand Wednesday night with at least 200 others for Jawando’s announcement at Citizens and Culture in Silver Spring.
“People need to know you’re going to fight. If they know you’re going to fight, they respect you. They deal with you,” Elrich said. “That’s one of the things that I like about Will, and what I think he brings to this race is that kind of leadership.
“The other thing is independence. You cannot elect the county executive who already has millions of dollars from developers,” he said.
Other speakers included fellow Democratic County Councilmembers Laurie-Anne Sayles and Kristin Mink, and former “The Real Housewives of Potomac” cast member Candiace Dillard Bassett. Support also came from Prince George’s County State’s Attorney Aisha Braveboy (D), who is heavily favored in a June 3 special election for county executive there to fill out the term of former Executive Angela Alsobrooks (D), who was elected to the U.S. Senate last fall.
“It matters who you elect as executives in this capital region,” said Braveboy, pointing to the challenges from the Trump administration for local governments. “I can’t think of a brighter, smarter, tougher person for Montgomery County than you. We’re all about diversity, equity and inclusion. We’re going to keep talking about it.”
Jawando, 42, was elected in 2018 to an at-large council seat from the county of 1 million people, the state’s largest. He’s an attorney who’s worked in the U.S. Senate for then-Sen. Barack Obama and for former Ohio Sen. Sherrod Brown. He was the first to announce a bid for the Democratic nomination to replace retiring U.S. Sen. Ben Cardin, but he withdrew in October 2023.

On Wednesday, Jawando highlighted some of his priorities as county executive, such as supporting rent stabilization and affordable housing, continuing to invest in the public schools and supporting small businesses, which he said represent about 80% of county businesses.
He touched on the importance of diversity and the “beautiful tapestry” at the restaurant and throughout the county. He talked about his family, including his parents, a Nigerian father and white mother who moved to Montgomery from his mother’s home state of Kansas in 1980.
Besides Jawando walking on stage and his wife, Michele, giving rousing remarks, some of the biggest applause came when he mentioned potholes.
“I promise to fix your potholes in your neighborhood. I know that’s a problem,” he said. “When you have good streets, you have good commerce, and you have good safety. It’s a good thing.”
At least two other candidates have announced bids for county executive. Celeste Iroha, a registered medical assistant, was the first person to announce in March, according to Bethesda Today, whike At-Large County Councilmember Evan Glass (D) said  Wednesday he qualified to use the county’s public financing option. Glass, who was the first openly LGBTQ+ member of the council when elected in 2018, would become the first as county executive, if elected.
County Councilmember Andrew Friedson (D) is expected to also enter the county executive race.
Montgomery and Prince George’s aren’t the only counties getting new leaders. Howard County Executive Calvin Ball (D) and Anne Arundel County Executive Steuart Pittman (D) are both term limited and cannot seek a third term next year.
In Baltimore County, former state Sen. Kathy Klausmeier (D) was appointed replace County Executive Johnny Olszewski Jr. when he was elected to Congress last fall, but she is not expected to seek reelection next year. Baltimore County Councilman Pat Young (D), one of four Democrats eyeing the executive’s seat, announced Wednesday he will be the first candidate in the race to fund his campaign through public financing. The council approved the law in 2021 and funds will be available for disbursements next month for the 2026 election cycle.

The CT Office of the Consumer Counsel has good ideas on how to do that.,"When SB 1560, An Act Concerning Connecticut’s Economy, Electricity Affordability and Business Competitiveness and Establishing the Connecticut Energy Procurement Authority and the Green Bond was posted, it raised eyebrows. 
It’s not often a comprehensive 80-page energy bill is introduced in a committee other than Energy & Technology.
The bill creates the Connecticut Energy Procurement Authority (CEPA), charged with taking over the buying of electricity, a function performed by our utilities. Also created is a Green Bond fund to pay for parts of electricity bills currently funded by ratepayers.  
The complexity of energy markets is daunting, but it’s important to note that there are processes, called dockets, in which all the players get a chance to participate equally. That due process is vital. It minimizes favoring one interest group over another.
SB 1560 needs work in that area. From testimony posted on the CGA’s website, it clear that many of the bill’s proposals caught energy stakeholders off guard. 
For example, if you put solar on your house or business, you are compensated for that, just like a power plant. And on really sunny days, unlike a fossil fuel plant, you’re putting 100% clean electricity into the grid. SB 1560 would drastically reduce that compensation for solar, just when grid-helpful solar with battery backup installations are increasing.
Solar vendors testified the change would wipe out the solar industry in Connecticut. The exodus of those businesses, jobs, and tax revenue from the state is in no way a positive. There’s a docket currently underway examining solar compensation. Let’s allow that to play out.
Another change proposes redefining nuclear power as renewable energy. To be clear, this won’t suddenly make spent uranium fuel rods unspent. But it will take funding away from true renewables that are cheaper in the long term. 
Ironically, for legislation promoting cost reductions, the solar and nuclear sections will save little, if anything, in the short term, and likely increase costs long term. Similarly, a section to reduce high demand charges to businesses would simply spread that among other ratepayers.
Tasked with electricity procurement, CEPA, according to the Connecticut Office of Consumer Counsel, is not obligated to follow the Uniform Administrative Procedures Act, which means “… both participants appearing before it and ratepayers are not guaranteed due process.” Further, CEPA can accept monetary gifts. It’s worth contemplating how sizable donations might influence CEPA’s politically appointed directors.
CEPA would use bonds to fund some of the combined public benefits programs. This could work if done with care. But as written, there are safeguards that are missing. Concerns raised by OCC’s analysis articulate situations that could require ratepayers to “… cover costs of the new programs in addition to the current costs ratepayers pay for on bills.” 
OCC points out they’ve already “… evaluated different potential revisions to our current procurement laws and processes…” in collaboration with the Public Utilities Regulatory Authority, the Energy & Technology Committee, and other stakeholders. If legislators elect to go with a CEPA type entity, OCC has recommendations, one of which places it under the auspices of PURA or the Dept of Energy & Environmental Protection. This would continue necessary oversight on behalf of all ratepayers.  
Legislators voted SB 1560 out of the Finance, Revenue & Bonding committee, making clear it needs to be improved. They want to prudently address high utility rates. The OCC’s expertise is in understanding how to best put that in play.
Let’s put their guidance to work.

Contrary to her claim, effective age verification (‘AV’) does not require either identifying users or building databases of sensitive personal data. In fact, industry-standard systems ensure there is nothing to hack – because no personal data is retained at all.
Today’s age assurance solutions, recognized as “highly effective” by the UK’s globally-respected regulator, Ofcom, already in use across many European Union member states and about to be required in Australia to keep young children off social media completely, use techniques that determine on only your age, never your identity.
Privacy-preserving technologies like zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs), outlined in standards such as ISO/IEC 27566 and IEEE 2089.1, allow independent, regulated third-party age-verification providers to confirm a user is over or under a threshold age without the websites or platforms they are accessing ever knowing who they are.
The data breaches Caccamo references were not from age verification providers – who are audited and certified to avoid retaining personal data – but from identity verification services, which necessarily store information that could be compromised. That distinction matters.
Modern age verification does not rely only on government-issued ID. It can be achieved through tokenized signals, anonymized hand movement and facial estimation (where images are immediately deleted, and often never leave the palm of your hand as the estimate is processed on your own smartphone), or verified credentials stored securely in users’ own devices. These approaches work across all communities, including those who lack traditional ID or are rightly concerned about discrimination or surveillance.
Equally misguided is the idea that platforms will downgrade services for everyone. Just as websites currently tailor content based on device, location or cookies, they can provide age-appropriate access without creating a “Disneyfied” internet.  The latest interoperable technology means you can do one age check and then use it across multiple sites – truly making the Internet age-aware.  Note that is age, not identity.  The essence of the age verification industry is proving your age without disclosing who you are.
Laws do need to be carefully drafted – targeting only harmful content and functionality, not entire apps that for many young people are the principal way they access the many benefits of the Internet. But dismissing age assurance entirely ignores the global shift towards privacy-first, standards-based solutions that protect children without compromising adult freedoms.
Connecticut has the chance to lead with smart, privacy-respecting legislation. That means rejecting myths and recognizing that age verification is not about identity – it’s about child safety, anonymity, and trust.

The protesters carried signs calling out various actions by the Trump administration, including the unlawful deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia to El Salvador, the Trump administration’s cuts to veterans services, the recent federal budget proposal that includes cuts to Medicaid, the administration’s position on Ukraine and the detention of Mahmoud Khalil, a former Columbia University student who played a strong role in pro-Palestinian protests.

While demonstrators protested right outside of the campus, Noem got a polite and warm reception from Cadet Memorial Field as she delivered a 20-minute keynote address.
“You’re the first graduating class of a brand new Coast Guard,” Noem said. “I want to share with you today what part of President Trump’s vision is for the future of this force. With your help, President Trump and I are going to make America’s Coast Guard the strongest, the most capable, the also most effective military service in the entire government.”
She highlighted recent conversations with President Donald J. Trump from the Oval Office about the needs of the Coast Guard, which, unlike other military branches, is overseen by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. And she detailed how the administration plans to “transform” the service through a new effort called “Force Design 2028.”
Protesters, meanwhile, uniformly told The Connecticut Mirror they had no problem with the Coast Guard. In fact, they expressed admiration for the service.
“[I] highly respect the Coast Guard,” said Janet Bannister of Coventry. “I’ve known a lot of young people who have made it through. I’m just so proud of them. So yes, we hope it’s clear to people that we are pro-Coast Guard and celebrating the graduates, but … here we are.”

Montville resident Linda Ness said she was against the current federal budget proposal, particularly cuts to Medicaid and the amount of money it would add to the national debt.
“It’s where they’re putting their money. It has nothing to do with the country[’s] needs and the people. They’re taking care of corporations, they’re taking care of the ultra-wealthy. That’s not democracy,” she said.
Ness held a sign listing police, fire departments, hospitals and utilities as some of the benefits that the wealthy use and said she was opposed to the idea of them receiving tax cuts.
Claudia Allen, a resident of Thompson, told CT Mirror that she’d been attending protests since Ronald Reagan was elected president.
“ My son was sent to Iraq, and I’m a peace activist. That was horrifying, with George Bush. But even that, there were some people who were competent and who were not aligned [with] him instead of the U.S. Constitution,” said Allen. “This is the Constitution state, and she’s not upholding the Constitution, nor is that administration. That’s a big reason that I’m here.”

Immigration enforcement was another common theme among the protesters. They mentioned the violation of court orders, instances of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement apprehending people, and deportations to countries like El Salvador and South Sudan without due process.
“[The administration] is so incompetent,” said Denise Weinschenker of Salem. “ He was supposed to drain the swamp. Instead he went into the swamp and pulled all those people out.”
Joanne Sheehan, one of the protest’s organizers and a member of the Unify & Resist Coalition, told CT Mirror that they have organized protests in the past against U.S. Coast Guard Academy commencement speakers. She said they had counted 250 people present at the protest today but estimated that there were more.
Sheehan said the protests were different sizes each year. Some years, only a few dozen people showed up, and others counted protesters in the hundreds. The largest, she said, was the spring after Trump was elected for the first time.

Other protesters mentioned the abrupt firing of Admiral Linda Lee Fagan in late January, a day after Trump’s inauguration.
They criticized the administration for Fagan’s dismissal, noting that she was the first woman to lead a branch of the U.S. Armed Forces and praising her focus on diversity in the Coast Guard.
“Sexual assault has been endemic and such a problem here. And they finally get someone to clean it up, and he fires her immediately. Day one,” said Mystic resident Martha Crum.
The firing drew condemnation from some of Connecticut’s congressional delegation at the time.
DHS officials cited issues with deployment of the Coast Guard to assist with border security, dissatisfaction with recruitment and retention, efforts surrounding diversity, equity and inclusion policies, and cost overruns on icebreakers and helicopters used in the Arctic region.
They also raised concerns about the handling of Operation Fouled Anchor, an investigation into decades of sexual misconduct claims at the Coast Guard Academy and past leaders’ decisions not to disclose a report about it to Congress. Fagan did not serve as commandant at that time but had apologized for not acting on it until CNN broke the story in 2023.

In addition to a shift in top leadership, the Coast Guard and its New London service academy have already undergone other structural changes.
Since Trump’s executive order taking aim at DEI policies, the Coast Guard has shuttered a number of DEI-related programs and offices, including the Academy’s Office of Culture and Climate.
The Coast Guard had prioritized DEI as a way to boost recruitment and retention among cadets as well as within the force. In a Coast Guard Academy diversity report submitted to Congress in 2024, Fagan wrote that such initiatives show progress was made “in attracting a workforce that is representative of the nation and preparing culturally competent leaders for the future.”
Recruitment was a big part of Noem’s keynote address Wednesday, pointing out the current shortfalls in the enlisted workforce as well as ships with incomplete crews. According to Admiral Kevin Lunday, who is currently serving as acting commandant, the Coast Guard has surpassed its annual recruitment goal and has so far recruited 4,700 new members, Noem said.
Since Trump’s executive order taking aim at DEI policies, the Coast Guard has shuttered a number of DEI-related programs and offices, including the Academy’s Office of Culture and Climate.
Along with recruitment, Noem said, “Force Design 2028” will aim to reorganize the service by reducing the number of admirals by 25%, replacing outdated technology, fixing crumbling infrastructure and increasing the number of icebreakers. She said the goal over the next four years is to increase the size of the Coast Guard by at least 15,000 personnel.
“Those needs represent the biggest Coast Guard readiness crisis that we have seen since World War II,” Noem said. “That may have been the Coast Guard of the past, but that will not be the Coast Guard of the future.”
As her speech concluded, Noem made an initially unplanned announcement about the new leadership team at the Coast Guard. Among other promotions, Lunday will now be nominated for the commandant role permanently. He spoke shortly before Noem and praised the administration for its “inspiring leadership and remarkable advocacy” of the Coast Guard.

(Reena Rose Sibayan for New Jersey Monitor)The federal judge overseeing the case of a Columbia University student activist held at a Louisiana immigration detention center has deferred to the private prison company managing the facility in determining certain rules for her court. 
The questioned standards come into play as Mahmoud Khalil faces his next court hearing Thursday morning at the LaSalle Detention Center in Jena, when his attorneys say they’ll file a motion to throw out the case against him for “egregious government misconduct,” namely that Khalil was arrested without a warrant. They’ll also argue that Khalil is at risk of harm by Israel “anywhere in the world” and thus cannot be removed to Syria or Algeria.
The hearing is the first since one of Khalil’s attorneys, Nora Ahmed with the American Civil Liberties Union, was prevented from bringing her laptop computer into the courtroom on the grounds of the LaSalle Detention Center for an April 11 hearing. Assistant Chief Immigration Judge Jamee Comans said Khalil’s attorneys must abide by policies set by the facility’s operator, the GEO Group. Ahmed was prevented from having her electronics with her, despite attorneys for the federal government being allowed to have their computers.

Comans’ ruling gives the Trump administration an unfair advantage in the case, Ahmed said in an interview with the Illuminator.
“It facially goes to show how biased the hearing was from the get-go – that this attorney was denied all of the access to electronics that the government” had, Ahmed said. 
Khalil has been held at the Lasalle Detention Center since March 8, when federal authorities took him from his Columbia University apartment building in New York City. Although he’s a legal U.S. resident, ICE officials said they had a warrant to revoke Khalil’s student visa. He’s the first person President Donald Trump sought to deport from the U.S. for his involvement in pro-Palestinian campus protests.
Motion sought formal order
Over two months after being taken into federal custody, Khalil has yet to be charged with a crime. At his April 11 hearing, Comans ruled him deportable in light of a letter from Secretary of State Marco Rubio stating that Khalil’s activities at Columbia could have “adverse foreign policy consequences.” 
According to a motion filed April 28, Ahmed was prevented from bringing her laptop and phone into that hearing, despite DOJ policy explicitly allowing counsel to have electronics. Ahmed said she had already been given permission to take her electronics inside by the ICE facility’s warden, GEO Group employee Shad Rice. GEO Group personnel handle security for the facility, including the secured area between the facility’s entrance and the courtroom doors. 
Unable to bring her computer into the courtroom, Ahmed worked with a notebook and pen instead.
Judge Comans’ refusal to let Ahmed retrieve her computer is in direct violation of the Department of Justice’s policy, according to the April 29 motion. The policy states that attorneys “in proceedings before [Executive Office for Immigration Review] will be permitted to use electronic devices in EOIR courtrooms.”
After the hearing, according to the motion, Rice told Ahmed that “the Judge appeared to contradict herself” by blaming him and the GEO Group for Ahmed not being allowed to bring her laptop into the courtroom.
Jason Burke, administrator for the LaSalle Immigration Court, told the Illuminator that Justice Department rules do indeed allow Ahmed to bring her laptop to court proceedings, “but they got to get to EOIR space first. which we don’t control when we’re in a detention center.” 
The GEO Group declined to answer questions regarding the matter.
In light of the confusion on April 11, the April 28 motion asked the court to ensure that Khalil’s counsel at upcoming hearings could bring their electronics into chambers. 
Comans ruled May 9 that the motion was moot, writing that “should an attorney elect to appear in person, they are subject to the detention facility’s rules.”
Homero López, director of Immigration Services and Legal Advocacy in New Orleans, was startled when he learned of the judge’s order, which he described as “bulls–t.” López previously had a similar issue in 2022 at the South Louisiana ICE Processing Center in the Acadia Parish town of Basile. It was resolved when ICE Field Office Director Melissa Harper “clarified with Basile management that laptops will be permitted,” per emails López provided to Illuminator.
López said it was particularly surprising to have that issue at the Jena center, where, unlike other Louisiana ICE centers, the detention area and courtroom have separate entrances. 
“I’ve never had to once ask anybody for additional permission to bring electronics into court” at Jena, nor has any other attorney he knows, López said. Comans should have directed ICE to get GEO Group to abide by federal policy – not defer to the company – he added. 
The judge’s failure to do so “is another way to discourage people from taking on cases at that facility,” López said.

Unequal footing for ICE detainees
Khalil’s lawyers argue that the unequal access highlights a lack of transparency around immigration proceedings, and the hurdles the GEO Group and the federal justice present that affect a detainee’s legal proceedings. In a briefing for reporters Wednesday, co-counsel Ramzi Kassem, a law professor at City University of New York, described Comans as “an immigration judge who’s not an independent judge, who’s really a DOJ functionary.”
Khalil’s counsel decried this lack of transparency in a second motion, also filed April 28. The motion requested that, due to enormous public interest in Khalil’s case, Comans allow virtual or telephonic access for her proceedings.
During the April 11 hearing, Ahmed had asked permission to read out a statement about public access – a request Comans refused.
Ahmed’s quashed statement was a plea for Comans to ensure broader access to the hearing, noting that “what transpires today – determining who is allowed to stay on American soil and who must leave it – will have reverberations for years to come. As such, we ask this court to accommodate those intent on observing these proceedings.”
Instead, GEO Group security allowed less than two dozen people to enter the facility, leaving supporters and members of the news media to wait outside, some of whom had traveled from as far as New York. 
Zach Kopkin, a member of Jewish Voice for Peace in New Orleans, was among those denied access. He told Illuminator that it “felt really important that Jewish folks be in that room” and “that we fight back with the truth, which is that a ton of Jews are also critical of the Israeli government’s war crimes and genocide.” 
Comans also called the second motion moot, noting simply that “immigration hearings are generally open to the public, although certain exceptions apply.”  Khalil’s team still has an outstanding request to the judge for an overflow room.
Khalil hopes to hold month-old son
New allegations against the GEO Group of violating federal policy in Khalil’s case were levied Wednesday. The LaSalle facility has refused to allow Khalil to hold his newborn son, who was born while he’s been in federal custody, citing “security concerns.” This comes despite ICE directives and federal policies which explicitly encourage contact between detained parents and children.
Khalil filed a request Wednesday with a federal court to order ICE to allow him a contact visit with his month-old son by the end of the day. The federal court accepted the argument and Khalil’s counsel say they’re working out details of the visit. Khalil’s wife, Dr. Noor Abdalla, traveled over 1,000 miles with their child so Khalil could hold him for the first time.  
According to emails within the filing, the GEO Group’s facility administrator said its procedures allow for “non-contact” visits only through a secure window. 
ICE policy notes that contact visits “may be facilitated at all ICE detention facilities.” 
Khalil’s lawyers argue the GEO Group’s refusal of contact is part of the “punitive” nature of his detention and transfer from its New Jersey facility, where family contact visits are provided daily and parents are allowed to hold their children.
Judge Comans will also decide whether Dr. Abdalla is permitted to hold their infant while attending proceedings Thursday.

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)Are 15 minutes enough time for a lunch break? That’s the typical time Utah schools allocate for children to eat, counting the time to walk to the cafeteria, and line up to get food. 
That’s a big deal for many parents and children, Rep. Tiara Auxier, R-Morgan, said during the the Education Interim Committee’s first meeting of the year on Wednesday, while she advocated for the panel to study expanding the seat time for lunch in public schools.
As her colleagues passed a House bill this year making school lunch free for students who qualify for reduced-priced meals, Auxier kept thinking about unresolved issues, especially the timing concern she experienced with her kids.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
“One of my biggest concerns was that we were going to be putting a lot of money into this program, and the kids still weren’t going to be able to eat them,” Auxier said. “We heard so many times about full trash cans and kids just being rushed out.”
With some lawmakers supporting the idea, while acknowledging that its implementation could be a challenge, the committee voted unanimously to add a review of policies and best practices centered around lunch times to its list of interim study items and audits. 
Starting July 1, Utah students qualifying for reduced-priced lunches can get meals for free

Sen. Kathleen Riebe, D-Cottonwood Heights, who is an educator, said this is a step in the right direction, though she worried about how extending the lunch break may affect existing legislation requiring certain time minimums for core subjects. 
That’s a concern that the chair of the committee, Rep. Candice Pierucci, R-Herriman, had heard as well from teachers.
“They usually say, ‘well, we just don’t have time, right? You’ve got to pack everything in.’” Pierucci said. “So that should be a part of this discussion.”
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends schools provide at least 20 minutes of seat time for students to eat their meals and socialize. That’s apart from the time it takes them to use the restroom and wash their hands, wait in line, walk to their tables and bus trays after the meals. 



Let us know what you think...


 


“About half of school districts nationwide do not require or recommend that schools give students at least 20 minutes to eat, once they receive their meal,” the CDC’s website reads. “Some students report that insufficient time to eat is a key reason for not participating in the school lunch program.”
The Utah State Board of Education has a similar guideline in its Health and Wellness Policy, directing schools to provide a minimum of 10 minutes for breakfast, and 20 minutes of lunch, “which excludes time to arrive at the cafeteria and waiting in line.” However, lawmakers noted that it seems like the direction isn’t being followed in all schools.
As of Wednesday, the committee is prioritizing other study items, including changes to the Department of Education and other federal programs with the new administration; any progress on universities’ plans to reallocate 10% of their budget for courses; reviewing school employees’ disciplinary actions; and solutions for chronic absenteeism.

(Photo by James Brooks/Alaska Beacon)After 22 years in the Alaska Senate, Senate President Gary Stevens is retiring. 
Stevens’ decision has been discussed in the Alaska Capitol for more than a year, but on Tuesday, it became official as Kodiak Republican Rep. Louise Stutes became the first person to announce that she will run for Stevens’ seat.
“I certainly will endorse Louise any way I can to help her out,” Stevens said on Wednesday. “She should be a really fine senator. She’s had a lot of experience in the House, and I think she’d do a great job, and I’d be glad to help her out in any way I can.”
Stutes filed a letter of intent with the Alaska Public Offices Commission shortly after the Alaska Legislature adjourned its regular session for the year. 
Legislators are forbidden from campaigning during the session, and the day after the first year of the legislative session typically marks the informal opening of the candidate filing period.
Campaigning typically doesn’t begin in earnest until after the second year of the legislative session.
Stutes’ early start may be a foreshadowing of things to come in the district: Stevens has represented the area covering Kodiak and the southern Kenai Peninsula since being appointed to the seat in 2003, making next year’s election a generational shift for the district.
Stutes said on Wednesday that fundraising doesn’t come naturally to her, “so I thought that I’d better get a jump start on it. You can’t get a jump start on it until you file your letter.”
Stutes said she doesn’t know whether there will be many candidates in the race.
Each of Alaska’s Senate districts includes two House districts. Rep. Sarah Vance, R-Homer, represents the other half of Stevens’ district and hasn’t filed a letter of intent for next year’s elections. She did not return a phone call seeking comment on Wednesday afternoon.
Stutes noted that her husband, commercial fisherman Stormy Stutes, grew up in Anchor Point, and they still have family members who live in Vance’s district, so she has connections to that part of Alaska.
This isn’t the first time that Stevens has said he will retire, but it’s certain this time.
“I’m 83 now. I’ll be 85 when I retire, and I think that’s just enough,” he said by phone. “I have other plans, things I want to do. I wrote a play about Ted Stevens that was successful in Anchorage; I want to do another one. I’m a bit of a painter, and I want to go on and do painting and writing and concentrate on those things, as well as spend time with my grandkids.”
Stutes said she’s been interested in running to replace Stevens since that first abortive retirement.
“I’m really lucky. Gary and I get along really well. … He’s been wonderful to work with. I’ll really miss him, of course, because we have such a great working relationship,” she said.
Voters elected Stutes to replace longtime Kodiak lawmaker Alan Austerman in 2014 and reelected her five times since then. She has governed as a moderate Republican, frequently joining the House’s predominantly Democratic coalition and once served a term as speaker of the House.  
“I’m like every legislator. I really feel like I’m helping my district and Alaskans. Right or wrong, I feel like I’ve been able to make a difference with the Marine Highway System. I believe I’ve been able to help bring fisheries to the forefront,” Stutes said. “When I first got elected years ago, I told Stormy that the one thing I want to do is take fisheries from the back burner and put them on the front burner. And I think that I’ve been somewhat successful in moving it forward.”
The Alaska Senate is currently controlled by a 14-person bipartisan coalition that includes nine Democrats and five Republicans. Three of those Republicans are up for reelection next year, and all are in potential swing districts.
Sen. Bert Stedman, R-Sitka, and Senate Majority Leader Cathy Giessel, R-Anchorage, said they will run for office again. Stevens is the third. 
Among the coalition’s Democrats, Sens. Elvi Gray-Jackson, D-Anchorage, and Löki Tobin, D-Anchorage, both confirmed that they will run for reelection. 
Sens. Bill Wielechowski, D-Anchorage, and Lyman Hoffman, D-Bethel, have not yet filed letters of intent. Hoffman has been in the Legislature since 1987 and in the Senate since 1991, making him the longest-serving legislator in state history.
Senate Minority Leader Mike Shower, R-Wasilla, said on Wednesday that he hasn’t yet decided whether he will run for reelection. 
Sens. Shelley Hughes, R-Palmer, and Rob Myers, R-North Pole, also face reelection next year. Neither returned a text message seeking comment on Wednesday.
Among incumbent members of the state House, Reps. Maxine Dibert, D-Anchorage, Carolyn Hall, D-Anchorage, and Donna Mears, D-Anchorage, have all filed letters of intent for reelection. 
Former Rep. Cliff Groh, D-Anchorage, announced that he will again seek to challenge Rep. David Nelson, R-Anchorage, in 2026. Nelson had been elected in 2020, lost to Groh in 2022 and defeated Groh in 2024.Through Wednesday afternoon, Groh was the only nonincumbent to file with the Public Offices Commission.

(Photo by Skylar Laird/SC Daily Gazette)COLUMBIA — A pay raise for legislators, lottery ticket payments using debit cards and a potential reduction in funding for the city of Columbia were all part of a spending plan a panel of legislators approved Wednesday.
Much of the actual spending in the state’s $14.7 billion budget, including a $1,500 bump in the state’s minimum teacher pay and the completion of an income tax reduction already in law, was locked in when the six-person committee started negotiating Tuesday.
A $1 billion hike in revenue projections Tuesday helped legislators quickly settle the remaining differences between the House and Senate spending plans.
The newly recognized revenue allowed budget negotiators to choose whichever plan had the larger amount. That includes sending the state Department of Transportation $200 million to fix aging bridges and $35 million for Hurricane Helene cleanup (the House version), instead of the Senate’s $100 million and $25 million.
Negotiators also approved $45 million to pay private K-12 school tuition and other costs for up to 10,000 eligible K-12 students under a law Gov. Henry McMaster signed earlier this year. (The Senate version put $20 million toward the scholarships.)
SC legislators get extra $1B to spend as budget negotiations begin

They left roughly $500 million of the unexpected revenues unspent. That could become part of discussions next year in changing the state’s income tax structure. It could also serve to fill holes amid economic uncertainties, said House Ways and Means Chairman Bruce Bannister, R-Greenville.
“That’s left us a lot of flexibility, which I think is a good, responsible way to do it,” Bannister said.
Not included in this year’s budget were earmarks.
Removing all one-time funding requested by legislators, usually for their districts, sped up the process, said Senate Finance Chairman Harvey Peeler, R-Gaffney.
While some legislators have said the decision will disproportionately hurt poor, rural areas that lack the tax base to pay for projects themselves, Peeler and Bannister said a one-year moratorium was needed to rein in spending that swelled into the hundreds of millions of dollars the last several years.
“It’s something that needed to happen this year,” said Peeler, who made the initial announcement refusing earmarks this year. “It had gotten out of hand — too many earmarks, too large — and we had to have a full stop.”
Legislators are expected to take a final vote on the spending package next week. It takes effect with the July 1 start of the fiscal year.
Pay raise for legislators
Budget clauses that direct how to spend money made up most of the items of contention this year.
That included a directive that effectively increases legislators’ pay by $18,000 over the fiscal year.
The clause inserted into the Senate plan during that chamber’s floor debate was approved unanimously Wednesday by the panel’s three representatives and three senators. It officially raises their allowance for “in-district” expenses from $1,000 to $2,500 per month. But there are no limitations on how it can be spent, so it’s really just a raise.
That adds to their salaries of $10,400, which hasn’t changed since 1990. They also receive stipends that are meant to cover meals and lodging as well as mileage while they’re in session. Their $1,000 “in-district compensation” hasn’t changed since 1995.
The last time legislators attempted to increase it was in 2014, when then-Gov. Nikki Haley vetoed the effort. In that time, inflation has caused costs to rise drastically, legislators who proposed the change said.
“It’s just time,” Bannister told reporters.
Peeler, who voted against the raise on the floor, said he voted for it Wednesday in order to reflect the will of the full Senate, which voted 24-15 on the raise. But he said he still didn’t fully support it personally.
McMaster recently told reporters he’ll decide whether to veto the clause after the final package reaches his desk. But he hinted he may let it go, unlike his predecessor.
Being a legislator is officially a part-time job. But legislators work hard and often late into the night. It makes sense that inflation has hit them hard too, he said.
“They need to be able to work without a whole lot of distraction,” McMaster said. “I’d like to see exactly what the details are, but everyone, if they’re working at home, they have a home office, an office in their business, I think they’re entitled to be reimbursed for all their expenses, and that’s the nature of this.”
Other spending clauses
Also adopted by negotiators was a clause that would revoke an estimated $3.7 million from the state’s capital city unless it repeals a ban on so-called conversion therapy.
The Columbia City Council deferred a vote Tuesday on the 2021 ordinance that threatens a $500 fine for anyone who tries to alter a juvenile’s gender identity or sexual orientation through counseling. Officials wanted to wait and see whether the clause was included in the final version of the budget.
Attorney General Alan Wilson sent the city a letter earlier this year asking council members to repeal the ban to “avoid any future legal action.” Under a 2022 state law, only the state can license and regulate medical fields, including counselors, Wilson wrote.
Columbia postpones vote on conversion therapy ban awaiting state budget decision

The clause included in the state budget threatens to pull state aid from any city with an ordinance banning the practice, but Columbia is the only city in the state with such a ban.
Bannister spoke with members of the Columbia City Council before the vote. He said the officials he spoke with — he declined to name them — supported including the threat in the budget, as they feared the city would lose any lawsuit challenging the ordinance.
Adding the clause “would encourage their members to think a little harder about it,” Bannister said.
Another adopted budget directive would allow people to buy lottery tickets using debit cards, which Gov. Henry McMaster recommended as part of his executive budget. Opponents of gambling insisted on banning sales using credit and debit cards in 2001, when legislators created the lottery.
But as fewer people regularly carry cash with them, allowing sales using debit cards could increase revenue by about $52 million, the state Lottery Commission estimated. The money pays for college scholarships, and it could potentially pay for K-12 students to attend private schools under the voucher law legislators passed.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_2439-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-05-21 22:03:37.309333

(Photo: Galen Bacharier/NC Newsline)The state House budget proposal drew broad bipartisan support Wednesday after Gov. Josh Stein, a Democrat, said he liked a lot of it. 
The House gave its budget preliminary approval with a vote of 93-20 after hours of debate on proposed amendments. Thursday’s vote will start negotiations between House and Senate Republicans on a compromise spending plan. The Senate passed a budget last month that is significantly different from the House plan. A final vote on the House plan is expected to take place on Thursday.
The House Republican-authored budget would significantly increase beginning teacher salaries. It also gives state employees 2.5% raises, though House Republicans said workers will get more because agencies will be able to use money from the elimination of thousands of vacant jobs to fund wage hikes.
Rep. Donny Lambeth (R-Forsyth), a House senior budget writer, called it a “well-crafted plan” that builds on the state’s “strong fiscal management.”
Stein praised the House budget for these proposed salary increases and, in a statement, highlighted the differences between the House and Senate tax policies. 
The state’s 2023 budget built in up to three automatic personal income tax cuts in tax years 2027 to 2034 that depend on the state meeting revenue targets. 
The House budget changes those targets, meaning the state would need to bring in more money to trigger a reduction in the personal income tax rate and likely delay a cut.

Rep. Julia Howard (R-Davie) said the increased revenue amounts needed to trigger tax cuts were based on inflation and population growth. 
The House budget also increases personal income tax standard deductions and restores a back-to-school sales tax holiday. An income tax deduction on tips of up to $5,000 would begin in the 2026 tax year. 
Nonpartisan economists in the state budget office and the legislature have projected state revenues will drop in 2026-2027 as planned tax cuts take effect. In addition to cuts in the personal income tax rate, the corporate income tax is being phased out.
The Senate budget proposal took the opposite approach, adding more triggered cuts. 
Senate leader Phil Berger (R-Rockingham) told reporters he did not believe the revenue forecast. 
Stein wanted to freeze income tax cuts, but among the Republican options, he prefers the House approach. 
“Importantly, the House budget cuts taxes for working families while recognizing that North Carolina is a growing state and reduces personal income tax rates after this year only when the economy is growing,” Stein said in a statement. “In contrast, the Senate’s fiscally irresponsible revenue scheme will result in fewer teachers and law enforcement officers and diminished services that would harm our people.”

In an interview, House Democratic Leader Robert Reives (D-Chatham), said the state is in tough fiscal shape because of cuts to revenues and overspending on vouchers that rural students don’t even have the chance to use.
Republicans are protective of vouchers, and the House rejected amendments that would take even modest amounts from voucher reserves to fund other education needs. They also rejected an amendment that would restore family income limits, require schools accepting vouchers to limit their annual tuition and fee increases to 5%, and require teachers in voucher schools to hold a bachelor’s degree or a teacher license.
The House budget is a negotiating document, a counterproposal to the Senate budget, Reives said in the interview.
“Our ultimate goal is we have got to get a budget that is responsible,” Reives said. “The Senate budget is completely irresponsible. We’ve got to get a budget that recognizes the fiscal position that we’re in, and we’ve got to get a budget that starts talking about the tough questions.”
Reives and 26 other Democrats voted for the budget. Reives said during the floor debate he wouldn’t vote for it if it was the final bill.
“There is a lot of work that has to get done before we have a bipartisan budget,” he said.
House Speaker Destin Hall (R-Caldwell) acknowledged that it was unlikely the final budget would earn such broad support.
“Both sides got a chance to put forth their amendments,” Hall told reporters after the vote. “And I think that … made up most of the reason why you see a bipartisan vote today.”
Meanwhile, the House budget faced resistance from outside conservative voices.
Club for Growth, a national group that focuses on tax cuts and often spends big in elections, sent out a public threat to anyone voting for the House budget. Those who support it “should expect to be held accountable on election day, and kiss their political future goodbye,” the group wrote on social media.
And the Carolina Partnership for Reform, in its newsletter and blog, decried the plan as a “Republican-sponsored tax increase.”
“Having no budget deal is a better outcome than this one,” the group wrote.

Rep. Keith Kidwell (R-Beaufort), leader of the body’s hard right Freedom Caucus, sought to counter any criticism of the House approach to taxes.
“We’ve got one of the best bills from a tax perspective I’ve seen,” he said. “Let’s send a message to the Senate that we have one heck of a bill here, and they need to pass it.” 
Hall remarked that he believed the critical conservative groups “like the Senate budget, and would prefer House members to like the Senate budget.”
The House rejected 40 amendments offered by Democrats over hours of debate. The House adopted four amendments, including one that would kill tolling a portion of Raleigh’s Capital Boulevard to pay to widen it. The state Department of Transportation is planning to toll the road from I-540 in Raleigh into Wake Forest.
“We do not tax free roads in North Carolina,” said Rep. Mike Schietzelt (R-Wake). The amendment will prevent using public money to study, design, build, operate, or implement tolling on Capital Boulevard.
Two Wake Democrats said shutting down the option for tolls would curtail efforts to improve the highly trafficked thoroughfare
“We need to have the conversation with the communities to get to the right solutions,” said Rep. Maria Cervania (D-Wake). “This is not going to get the outcome that you need.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_1868-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-21 21:03:46.028913
,Connecticut Mirror,2025-05-22 00:32:17+00:00,CT Mirror,Teachers arrested at CT Capitol after rally for education funding,Jessika Harkay,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/05/21/teachers-arrested-capitol-education-funding/,"The apprehensions took place following a rally of teachers, students and others seeking more per-pupil funding for CT school districts.","Several educators and at least one student were arrested for disorderly conduct after staging a sit-down in front of Gov. Ned Lamont’s office at the state Capitol Wednesday afternoon.
The apprehensions took place in the wake of a rally, organized by the state’s chapter of the American Federation of Teachers union. For over an hour Wednesday afternoon, chants of “Fund our schools!” echoed within and outside the building as dozens of union members, students and other community leaders called on the governor and lawmakers to increase assistance for school districts and boost support for growing special education costs.
The group is seeking provisions in Senate Bill 1511, a proposal to increase per-pupil funding in the state’s Education Cost Sharing Grant, to be implemented in the state budget.
“Our children should not be subjected to the reality of two Connecticuts,” said Leslie Blatteau, who serves as the president of the New Haven Federation of Teachers. “Our children in New Haven, New Britain, Bridgeport, Hartford, Meriden and rural parts of this state deserve the world class education we know students in other parts of the state get.”
Since 2013, the state has contributed $11,525 per student to education districts, with additional funding for students who come from low-income backgrounds and those who are multilingual learners. S.B. 1511 proposes raising that “foundation” amount by over $960, to at least $12,488 per pupil; It also proposes adding a 50% weight for students with disabilities who receive special education services.
Earlier this year, legislators passed emergency legislation to provide $40 million in supplemental aid this fiscal year to local schools to offset what many called a crisis in special education. The School and State Finance Project, a nonpartisan education policy group, estimated districts needed $108 million.
The governor has proposed sending schools an extra $40 million annually for special education, but that wouldn’t kick in until 2027-28 — two years from now.
The Appropriations Committee budget, released in late April, would maintain the extra $40 million in state payments in the next two fiscal years and add another $124 million in special education grants in each of the next two years.
At a news conference Wednesday morning, House Speaker Matt Ritter said he thought much of what educators were seeking was already in the committee’s proposed budget. 
“I’d have to know what the argument is,” he said. “I mean we are doing the 50% weight, so if that’s the cause, don’t get arrested for that. We’re doing it.”
In response to Ritter’s comments earlier Wednesday, educators said the proposed budget was a step in the right direction, but that the state also has to also make up for decades of chronic underfunding.
“We will recognize that yes, the [Education Cost Sharing] formula is fully funded now, but still we are dealing with years after years of deficits before,” Blatteau said. “That’s hard to rebound from.” She said remedies would include the 50% weight for special education and an increase to the “foundation” amount. 
“We shouldn’t have to wait another 10 years,” she said.

After a brief news conference outside Wednesday afternoon, Blatteau joined over 100 education advocates who marched into the Capitol and overtook two floors in the building. The governor then spoke with roughly two dozen of the protestors in a closed-door meeting in his office.
“Gov. Lamont invited members from AFT to his office today to hear their thoughts and concerns. Connecticut has the best schools in the country because we have the best teachers in the country. That’s why he has made historic investments and increases in education funding,” Julia Bergman, a spokesperson for Lamont’s office, said in a written statement Wednesday evening. “During the final weeks of session, he plans to work with the legislature that continues that progress.”
Following the meeting with the governor, Blatteau told her fellow protestors that Lamont “was not able to commit to us today the necessary increase that we want to see that will fix the formula and that will prevent staffing cuts and layoffs across the state.”
Blatteau’s comments triggered loud booing from the crowd. 
Then Blatteau and nine other educators and students sat down outside the governor’s office, blocking the doors. After ignoring requests to leave the premises and threats of arrest for disorderly conduct from Capitol police officers, the ten individuals were placed in flex cuffs and escorted outside. They were met with cheers and chants from the crowd there as they were charged.

“I feel embarrassed by some of [Lamont’s] questions to the crew,” said David Weinreb, a magnet resource teacher at Elm City Montessori School in New Haven and one of the educators who spoke with Lamont Wednesday. 
“He asked us ‘How are the kids doing?’ as if it’s a question that we hadn’t wrestled with or a thought about a ton every day,” Weinreb said. “I was disappointed in how out of touch he sounded and how confused he seemed to be in terms of processing what we were asking for.”
The demonstration Wednesday was just one of many ongoing efforts by education leaders and advocates during this year’s legislative session, in which they’ve called on the state government to increase funding for public schools. On multiple occasions, students have lent their voices to the effort, including bussing in from around the state and leading rallies of their own. Superintendents and mayors from the largest school districts in Connecticut have also held news conferences seeking more funding.
In January, education advocates called for $545 million in increased funding, a figure derived from an October report put out by the Connecticut Conference of Municipalities, which offered recommendations for reengaging students who have lost touch with the education system. 
In recent weeks however, education leaders and advocates have switched gears, saying their requests are simply to help maintain staffing.
“We’re bleeding staff left and right and class sizes are going to increase. We also have issues that we might not be able to fully schedule students because we don’t have enough personnel,” Norwalk Superintendent Alexandra Estrella told The Connecticut Mirror earlier this month. 
“We just got out of a pandemic. The crisis has not ended yet. The resources have been depleted, and the need continues.”

Jimenez/National Park Service)A state judge has extended a restraining order that bars the Alaska Department of Fish and Game from killing bears in a controversial predator-control program.
Superior Court Judge Christina Rankin, in an order issued late Monday, said the department’s decision to shoot bears earlier this month in violation of a previous court ruling justified her decision to keep the temporary restraining order in place beyond the 10 days that is standard in Alaska law.
The department will be prohibited from conducting its planned bear cull in the Mulchatna caribou herd range until it corrects the legal flaws identified in a March 14 ruling issued by a different judge, Rankin said.
She rejected the state’s request to lift the restraining order and its argument that the prohibition was no longer needed.
“Despite the State’s stated intention of discontinuing its bear predator control measures this season, due to its prior position that it would continue bear abatement unless specifically enjoined, this Court thinks it is prudent to specifically state that the TRO will not expire after ten days and extends the TRO until further order of the Court or until the State obtains proper legal authority, consistent with the March 14 Order, and the May 7, 2025 Order,” she said in her order.
It is the latest development in a lawsuit filed in 2023 by the Alaska Wildlife Alliance that challenged the predator control program.
State officials say the program is needed to boost Mulchatna caribou herd numbers, and it must be conducted in spring and early summer, when newborn caribou calves are vulnerable to bear predation. But the Alaska Wildlife Alliance and other critics say the program lacks scientific validity and was put into place without proper public input.
Superior Court Judge Andrew Guidi ruled on March 14 that the department and the Alaska Board of Game had violated state constitutional requirements when approving and starting the program. He agreed with the Alaska Wildlife Alliance’s argument that public notice and opportunity for public input was inadequate. He also found that state officials violated the constitution’s mandate that replenishable resources be maintained for sustained yield, by failing to properly analyze the program’s impact on bear populations.
After Guidi’s ruling, and after Rankin ruled on May 7 that a Board of Game emergency regulation allowing the program to resume was legally void, the department restarted the bear culls on May 10 anyway.
Eleven brown bears and one wolf were killed that weekend, the department said. That toll added to the 175 brown bears, five black bears and 19 wolves that the state said were killed during 2023 and 2024.
That weekend action led to Rankin’s determination that the state had acted in “bad faith” and her decision to impose the temporary restraining order.
The Alaska Wildlife Alliance has also served notice that it may ask for the department to be held in civil contempt for its bear kills earlier in the month.
The Mulchatna caribou herd numbers about 15,000 animals, after hitting a peak size of about 200,000 in the 1990s, according to the department. The department’s goal is to have the herd expand to between 30,000 and 80,000 animals, big enough to support a hunt. Hunting of that caribou herd was closed in 2021.

Gov. Wes Moore (D) plans to nominate Anne Arundel County Executive Steuart Pittman for the job.","Maryland Democratic Party Chair Ken Ulman. (Photo by Emily Condon/Capital News Service)Maryland Democratic Party Chair Ken Ulman, a longtime player on the state political scene, announced Wednesday night that he plans to resign effective June 13.
Gov. Wes Moore (D) intends to nominate Anne Arundel County Executive Steuart Pittman (D) to replace Ulman when the state Democratic Central Committee next meets at its regularly scheduled meeting late next month — shortly after the state party holds its annual fundraising gala June 12 in Baltimore County.
The party’s first vice chair, Charlene Dukes, does not intend to seek the top job but will remain in her current post.
Ulman, a former Howard County executive, has told top Democrats that he wants to return full time to his development consulting company, Margrave Strategies, which is involved in several high-profile economic development projects across the state. He has served as state party chair since November 2023
Ulman announced his intention to resign during a meeting Wednesday evening with the state party’s trustees — an advisory group of top donors.
“I am grateful to Ken for his willingness to lead us through an intense and demanding election,” Moore said in a statement.

If Pittman is elected state chair — and he is unlikely to be the only candidate for the position next month — he too would split his time between his full-time gig as county executive and the state party post. Moore called Pittman “the right leader for this moment.”
Pittman is termed out of office in December 2026 and has been pondering his next political move. Heading the state party would enable him to stay in the political arena — though he has also been mentioned as a possible candidate to succeed veteran U.S. Rep. Steny Hoyer (D-5th) whenever Hoyer decides to end his 60-year political career.
“With an all-out assault on our state and our values underway from Washington, D.C., I know Steuart Pittman will put his experience and his moral clarity to work to defend our state, fight back against the Trump administration, and ensure Democrats win elections,” Moore’s statement said
Ulman and Pittman did not immediately respond to messages seeking comment.
The state party in the 2026 election cycle will be preoccupied with reelecting Moore – who could face a tough race, especially if former Gov. Larry Hogan (R) runs again – and other statewide elected officials, who should be on firmer political ground.
Party leaders are also determined to field a strong challenger against the state’s lone Republican member of Congress, Rep. Andy Harris (R-1st); Jake Day, the secretary at Maryland’s Department of Housing and Community Development, is actively exploring a bid.
Ulman’s looming departure from the Maryland Democratic Party ends a short-lived reentry into the state political fray. Ulman, 51, was considered a rising political star after four years on the Howard County Council and eight years as county executive. He was the Democratic nominee for lieutenant governor in 2014, losing in an upset to a Republican ticket headed by Hogan
Ulman launched his development firm shortly after that election and, before becoming state chair, worked on the fringes of politics, using his contacts to firm up development projects.
As state chair, Ulman helped now-U.S. Sen. Angela Alsobrooks (D) win her first term in 2024, kept the Democrats’ 7-1 advantage in the state’s congressional delegation, helped defeat several conservative school board candidates throughout the state, and raised more than $5.5 million for the state party.
Pittman was a political novice when he ran for Anne Arundel executive in 2018, when better-known Democrats chose to skip the race. He ousted Republican incumbent Steve Schuh in an upset.

(Illustration by Alex Cochran for New Jersey Monitor)The final GOP debate of the gubernatorial primary season was Tuesday night in Newark, with the three front-runners — state Sen. Jon Bramnick, former Assemblyman Jack Ciattarelli, and radio talk show host Bill Spadea — on the stage. Here are my thoughts, in no particular order:
Energy
The audience was rowdy, much more so than the larger crowd that attended the five-person Democratic debate on Sunday. Not sure if audience members met up to pregame or whether Republican voters are just more rambunctious, but it sure got loud.
Attacks
The Dem debate was light on one-on-one attacks. Ciattarelli and Spadea did not hold back, with Ciattarelli hitting Spadea for never winning elective office and Spadea attacking both his chief rivals for being insiders. Bramnick, who got in a few jabs of his own, often appeared like a peacemaking dad to two brawling children. “Let’s stay with the substance, and in the general election none of this is going to help us. Let’s concentrate on the Democratic policies that have put our state in a situation where we’re unaffordable, energy costs are off the charts, and of course we’re closing prisons as opposed to putting people in prisons,” he said.
Trump
President Trump loomed large, naturally, especially his endorsement of Ciattarelli over Spadea, who got this issue out of the way from the start, saying in his opening statement, “The president endorsed a poll, a poll that was conducted and paid for by Jack’s campaign. The president did not endorse a plan. The president did not endorse a set of principles.” Bramnick, who has been a Trump critic for years, was not in the running for the president’s nod, which he noted with a quip: “I did not get the endorsement from Donald Trump. I waited up late at night — no phone call.”
Thoughts on New Jersey Democrats’ long, long debate night

Death penalty
All three candidates came out in favor of restoring the death penalty, which was abolished in 2007, during a discussion of the Newark 14-year-old accused of killing Newark Police Sgt. Joseph Azcona in March. After Ciattarelli said he would make sure the teen gets prosecuted as an adult, Spadea said he supports the death penalty for all cop killers. Ciattarelli said he supports the death penalty for serial killers, mass murderers, and terrorists. Bramnick, who voted against getting rid of capital punishment when he was in the Assembly, said it should be in place for certain instances, like for people who murder and rape children. “So I have a voting record on that, not a radio record,” he said, taking a swipe at Spadea.
Tax cuts
Bramnick doesn’t think much of Democratic governor hopeful Rep. Josh Gottheimer’s pledge to cut property taxes by 15%. “I’m going to put Josh on my tax reduction team,” Bramnick said. “He can serve with Houdini and other people who make stuff up, right? Look, Josh keeps saying that and I’ve been serving the Legislature and as the leader for 10 years — he’s talking nuts.”
Pronouns
Boy, Republicans do not like pronouns. Spadea and Ciattarelli mentioned pronouns four times last night, with Ciattarelli saying about Democrats, “They worry about pronouns, I worry about property taxes” (two pronouns in that sentence, by the way) and Spadea saying several times that schools and colleges are too focused on “pronouns and propaganda.” 
Pop-up parties
All three candidates came out strongly in favor of punishing juveniles who show up in large masses on boardwalks because of pop-up parties advertised on social media. Local authorities have griped that they can’t handle so many teens hanging out in one place at a time, and Spadea said kids should be punished. “There are local laws that are being violated in terms of the number of people that are gathering outside. We’ve handcuffed our police officers so, A, I believe we need to start charging 14-year-olds as adults,” he said. A wild response to large mobs of kids showing up and hanging out at beaches and boardwalks, some of our state’s most popular tourist destinations. Ciattarelli pledged, “We’re not going to have flash mobs on our Jersey Shore when I’m governor.”
Bramnick, meanwhile, said, “I would give no leeway whatsoever to rioting anywhere, especially on the sacred ground of the Jersey Shore.” Ah, yes, sacred. Exactly the word I think of when I’m stepping over someone puking on the boardwalk outside Martell’s on a Friday night in July.
Budget
Gov. Phil Murphy’s budget proposal for the fiscal year that begins July 1 is $58.1 billion. The Republican candidates to succeed Murphy have all said they think there’s too much spending now — but how much do they think a state budget should be? Moderator David Wildstein of New Jersey Globe asked this question, and Bramnick sorta answered by saying he’d get rid of pork projects that he said have added $5 billion to the budget over the last seven years, while Spadea said the budget should be about $46 billion. Ciattarelli noted that budgets under Murphy’s predecessors included billions less in spending, though he did not specify what he thought the budget should be. “Jack’s going to have to check with his lobbyist before he’ll give you a specific answer on what he’ll actually cut,” Spadea said.
A missing candidate
There are two more candidates who will be on the June 10 GOP primary ballot: Burlington County contractor Justin Barbera and former Englewood Cliffs Mayor Mario Kranjac. Neither of them raised enough money to receive matching funds from the state for their campaign, so they were barred from appearing at last night’s debate. Kranjac held counter-programming in the form of a tele-town hall with Clinton-era GOP hero Newt Gingrich. Barbera showed up last night and was escorted out by police after he verbally tussled with debate organizers (he wanted to be featured in the post-debate press conference). “I deserve to be up there,” he said. “You’re what’s wrong with this state.”

(Mary Hennigan/Arkansas Advocate)The Arkansas Natural Resources Commission approved a $1.8 million grant to test surface waters for PFAS, the first known statewide effort to catalogue potential contamination from these “forever chemicals.”
PFAS, which stands for per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, are a group of thousands of chemicals that don’t break down naturally and have been linked to a number of health concerns, such as cancer. Revelations of PFAS’ health implications — and how chemical companies knew for decades about the dangers they posed — have led to thousands of lawsuits, with many claiming it caused cancer. States, including Arkansas, have also sued.
The Division of Environmental Quality will use the funding to test surface waters for contamination. 
DEQ submitted a pilot project proposal to the commission last year requesting funds from the emerging contaminants allocation of the state revolving loan fund, said Melony Martinez, Department of Energy and Environment spokesperson. The multi-year project will use a “phased approach to evaluate potential sources of PFAS” along with how it enters state waters. 
“DEQ proposes to evaluate the status of PFAS in Arkansas’ waters before considering implementation of monitoring requirements, pretreatment requirements, or other permit conditions for PFAS as recommended by the EPA,” Martinez said.
The Environmental Protection Agency under the Biden administration moved aggressively to regulate PFAS in drinking water and surface waters, and classified the chemicals as a hazardous substance under the federal Superfund law. 
The Trump EPA has begun efforts to roll back some of those policies. The EPA announced last week that drinking water limits on four PFAS chemicals would be scrapped, while limits on PFOA and PFOS — two of the most common chemicals in the group — would be kept, but would not go into effect until 2031, two years later than originally scheduled.
However, the EPA also said in April that it plans to take extensive action on PFAS.
“We are tackling PFAS from all of EPA’s program offices, advancing research and testing, stopping PFAS from getting into drinking water systems, holding polluters accountable, and providing certainty for passive receivers,” EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin said in a press release.
The EPA plans to list PFAS on the Toxic Release Inventory, a list of hazardous chemicals and substances, while making efforts to hold polluters responsible for PFAS contamination, according to the release.
Arkansas, Tennessee, Wyoming and Washington D.C. do not have existing or planned PFAS standards or limits for drinking water, according to an April report by the Environmental Council of the States, a national nonprofit, nonpartisan association of state environmental agency leaders. 
Stacie Wassell, head of DEQ’s Office of Water Quality, told commissioners Wednesday that identifying and addressing PFAS contamination at the source was more cost-effective than trying to do so during the drinking water treatment process. 
“It would be much cheaper to prevent it from contaminating our waters of the state than to remove it on the backside after it’s already been contaminated,” Wassell said. 
State regulators have suspected that sources of PFAS contamination exist in the state, outside of two known sites — the Little Rock Air Force Base in Jacksonville and a former BASF facility in West Memphis.
“There are likely numerous other AFFF contamination sites in Arkansas that are yet to be investigated,” according to a DEQ memo written in March 2023 that was obtained via an Arkansas Freedom of Information Act request. 
“At present E&E has no information regarding dumping sites or industrial users of PFAs,” the memo reads. “Industrial contamination sites likely exist in Arkansas, but due to lack of funding, equipment and human capital, no concerted, widespread investigation of PFAs contamination has occurred. … To date no field work has been done regarding PFAs.”
AFFF is a type of firefighting foam used by the military and other entities due to its efficiency in putting out jet fuel fires, and is a leading cause of PFAS pollution.",https://arkansasadvocate.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/LakeStumps-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-05-21 21:03:46.028913

(Photo by Michael Salerno/Rhode Island Current)Unionized Butler Hospital workers are likely to see their final paychecks arrive Friday if the now seven-day long strike continues. Some now have another expense to handle: A possible $500 fine for allegedly violating one of the city of Providence’s noise ordinances.
A Tuesday press release from the Providence City Council praised the striking workforce for “their commitment to making their voices heard in a way that minimizes disruption for the surrounding neighborhood,” the release read, adding that organizers agreed to “observe quiet hours before 8:00 AM and avoid the use of bullhorns or other noisemakers during that time.” 
Yet Providence police issued four summons — three on Monday, and one more on Tuesday — to people demonstrating outside the private psychiatric hospital on Blackstone Boulevard. Josh Estrella, spokesperson for Mayor Brett Smiley, confirmed Wednesday that each fine was for $500. 
“While the City recognizes and respects Butler Hospital workers’ right to peacefully and lawfully strike, we have received multiple complaints from neighbors and providers in the area concerned about the excessive levels of noise resulting from this demonstration,” Estrella said.
Three of the fines were for striking workers who used megaphones without a permit, and the other summons was for a motorist who honked when passing the picket line. Estrella said in an email Wednesday night that the four people cited can pay the fine online or choose to contest the fine and get assigned a Municipal Court date.
“Warnings were given to all four individuals prior to issuing the summons and an explanation of the City’s noise ordinance policies was given to the organizers of the demonstration,” Estrella said. “Unfortunately after that engagement, summons were issued following a warning to individuals that were found in continued violation of ordinances in accordance with our standard enforcement practices.”
The city’s actions drew condemnation from Providence Democratic Rep. David Morales, who issued a news release and posted to Bluesky Wednesday morning that the Smiley administration had “chosen to punish” the workers, many of whom reside in Providence. Morales has marched with workers consistently over the course of their seven-day strike. 
“This isn’t leadership. It’s intimidation. This is a page out of the MAGA Republican playbook,” Morales wrote.

The city’s noise ordinance permits up to 65 decibels during the daytime and 55 decibels at night in residential zones. Areas bordering schools, churches and hospitals still need to stay under the 65 decibel limit, but violations can be issued for lower volumes considered “unnecessary, excessive or offensive” if “a person of reasonably sensitive hearing” at 200 feet away can hear them.
The Butler campus includes the hospital, elderly housing, and a child care facility. 
The open-ended strike began May 15 and the union, SEIU 1199NE, and Care New England, the hospital’s parent company, have yet to return to the negotiating table. The approximately 800 workers — who include mental health staff, nurses, and clerical, custodial and dietary staff — are demanding wage increases and safety reforms after their set of four contracts expired March 31. Both parties last gathered to discuss terms on May 7. 
Tensions have not subsided in the week since the strike began. The union announced Thursday that it plans to rally at the Rhode Island State House — for the second time in three days — with photos and testimonies about injuries they received at work.
Jesse Martin, executive vice president of the striking workers’ union SEIU 1199NE, said in a statement Wednesday that workers are exercising their First Amendment rights to “shine a light on the ongoing safety crisis at their facility that impacts workers and patients alike.” 
“They take care of all who need support, including those right here in this community,” Martin wrote. “Though it may be slightly inconvenient for some, it is vastly more uncomfortable for Butler workers who are forced to sleep in their cars because of poverty wages or have to take months off of work because they were assaulted at work.”
Steven Brown, executive director of the ACLU of Rhode Island, said in an email Wednesday that the citations misrepresent the municipal code.
“The police are blatantly misleading people by issuing citations that refer to $500 fines,” Brown wrote. 
The ordinance outlines penalties of $200 for first-time offenders or $300 for second-time offenders who plead their case, Brown said, citing section 16-106 of the municipal code. 
“Somebody who contests the charges in court can be punished with up to a $500 fine. This deceptive tactic is very disturbing,” Brown wrote, bolding the phrase “up to.”
But Estrella said Wednesday night the violations and fines were derived from ordinances about noise from bullhorns and vehicle horns — separate parts of the municipal code, located at sections 16-105 and 16-93, respectively. Of the four people who received summons, one person received three tickets for bullhorn use, categorized in the city code as “amplified sound.” There was one more amplified sound violation for a different person, and two people were ticketed under the “excessive noise” category, Estrella said.
Section 16-106 specifies the fine structure for violations within the entire set of laws on “noise control,” as the municipal code phrases it. Neither 16-93 nor 16-105 specify the fine structure for violations. The section on bullhorns does specify that use of such equipment must be registered at least five days in advance with local police.
Mary E. Marran, Butler’s president and COO, wrote in a statement posted online Monday that striking workers will receive their final paychecks on Friday, May 23, with hospital-sponsored health plans set to expire on June 1. Other benefits like life insurance have already lapsed because of eligibility rules tied to active employment, Marran wrote.

MASSACHUSETTS RENTERS ARE already grappling with sky-high housing costs. Now imagine trying to renew your lease, only to be hit with a $300 lease renewal fee.

Now imagine trying to renew your lease, only to be hit with a $300 lease renewal fee. Or needing to sublet your apartment for a few months and being told that’ll cost another $400. Or logging in to pay rent and finding there’s a $15 processing fee, with no way to avoid it.  These aren’t hypotheticals. They’re real charges to tenants across the Commonwealth, and they’re examples of a broken rental system filled with hidden, predatory fees. Throw on top of these charges – charges which buy the renter quite literally nothing – the broker’s fee that often adds a whole month’s rent on top of move-in costs like security deposit and first- and last-months’ rent and you see one of the reasons so many families and students are leaving the state for more affordable places to live. In 2024, more than half of all Massachusetts renters – 51 percent – were cost-burdened, spending over 30 percent of their income on rent. That number includes families in Gateway Cities, working professionals in Boston, and seniors in small towns. The weight of rent alone is enough to put many families on the brink when it comes to paying for utilities, prescriptions, and even food, yet tenants are being asked to shoulder, often unexpectedly, far more through unjustified add-on costs. There are solutions. Gov. Healey and the Legislature appear ready to repeal the broker’s fees paid by renters, and legislation that would get rid of other junk fees is now before the Legislature. H.1553/S.984 – An Act to Regulate Junk Fees in Rental Housing, filed by Reps. Sam Montaño and Amy Sangiolo, and Sen. Jamie Eldridge, is a targeted, common-sense solution that ends the nickel-and-diming of renters through junk fees that are both exploitative and destabilizing. The bill would stop landlords and brokers from gaming the system by charging for things they shouldn’t. For instance, landlords are already prohibited by law from charging certain upfront costs – but loopholes in the law allow the brokers to do so instead. This bill closes that loophole and limits permissible upfront charges to just first month’s rent, last month’s rent or a security deposit, and a lock change fee — nothing more. It also tackles lease renewal and subletting/assignment fees, which tenants often have no choice but to pay in order to keep a roof over their heads. I recently spoke to a tenant in Roxbury who was charged $350 simply for swapping roommates at the end of his lease term. The kicker? Nothing about the lease changed – not the rent, not the terms, nothing. That fee was pure profit. Another tenant in Worcester was forced to use the landlord’s online rent portal – which came with a $15 monthly processing fee.  This bill would prohibit these kinds of portal fees unless an alternative, no-cost option is provided. This bill also protects tenants from being charged for attorneys’ fees without court oversight to prevent what happened to a tenant recently, where even after her case was dismissed, she still owed her landlord $6,000 in attorney fees. Housing instability doesn’t happen in a vacuum – it’s often death by a thousand cuts. Junk fees are one of those cuts. The Legislature can offer renters a measure of relief, fairness, and predictability in an increasingly unpredictable housing market. Mark Martinez is a housing attorney with the Massachusetts Law Reform Institute. The post It’s time to rein in ‘junk’ rental fees appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Worcester_Housing_Triple_Three_Decker_Homes.png?fit=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-05-21 20:05:59.003460

Public markets like ours are part of the civic fabric in many cities. They bring character and identity to a place, provide economic opportunity, and foster a sense of belonging. 
The post A decade of local flavor: What the Boston Public Market has taught us appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.","THIS SUMMER MARKS the 10-year anniversary of the Boston Public Market—ten years since a long-held vision for a year-round indoor public food market in downtown Boston finally came to life at 100 Hanover Street. Inspired by iconic public markets in other cities—like Pike Place in Seattle, Reading Terminal in Philadelphia, and the Ferry Building in San Francisco—the idea was to create a permanent home for New England food producers, connecting urban residents and visitors with the region’s bounty. Unlike many of its counterparts, the Boston Public Market was founded as a nonprofit and conceived as a “market on a mission.” Since opening in 2015, the market has been home to over 30 permanent vendors and more than 100 pop-up businesses each year. It supports local farmers, fishermen, bakers, cheesemakers, and other food entrepreneurs—many of whom face steep barriers to entering traditional retail. More than just a food hall, the Market was built to nurture small businesses, educate the public on nutrition and sustainability, and bring the community together around food.The impact of that mission is now being recognized nationally. Just this month, USA Today named the Boston Public Market the #3 public market in America—a jump from 7th place last year—outranking several of the very markets that originally served as its inspiration. For a nonprofit market that started with a bold idea and local ambition, it’s a meaningful milestone.That mission was tested like never before just five years into our story, when the COVID-19 pandemic turned bustling markets across the world into ghost towns. For a place that thrives on in-person connection and foot traffic, the early days of the pandemic were devastating. Our vendors rely on daily sales, and the disappearance of downtown workers and tourists meant that staying afloat became a daily challenge.Many public spaces and businesses closed permanently during that time. But the Boston Public Market made a different choice: to weather the storm as a collective. As CEO since 2016, I can say unequivocally that the Market’s survival—and its recovery since—has hinged on staying true to its core mission.We made the radical decision not to charge rent while our doors were closed. When we reopened, we introduced flexible lease terms tied to vendor sales, ensuring that their success was our success. We thought creatively—launching an outdoor farmers market on our patio, delivering groceries across the city, and reconfiguring our space to welcome people back safely.And it worked. Nearly all of our vendors made it through the pandemic. Community partnerships deepened. The City of Boston’s Resiliency Fund helped support vendors as they collectively prepared more than 32,000 meals for Pine Street Inn. We learned that when local government understands the central role small businesses play in a city’s vitality, good things happen.Public markets like ours are part of the civic fabric in many cities. They bring character and identity to a place, provide economic opportunity, and foster a sense of belonging. Boston deserves that same richness—and that’s what we’ve tried to build over the past decade.We’re still recovering from the long tail of the pandemic, but we’ve doubled down on our mission. In 2024 alone, we hosted over 650 community engagement events—92 percent of them free to the public. Not every idea was a hit (our comedy night was light on laughs, and a dog adoption day went sideways when the dogs didn’t show up), but every one of them brought people together and supported our vendors.Ten years in, the Boston Public Market is a thriving example of what’s possible when a city invests in its small businesses, local food systems, and public spaces. The biggest lesson from the challenges we’ve faced? If we want Boston to remain vibrant, diverse, and resilient, we must keep championing the small businesses that give it life.Cheryl Cronin is CEO of the Boston Public Market.The post A decade of local flavor: What the Boston Public Market has taught us appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/BPM-Lunch-Rush-scaled.jpeg?fit=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-05-21 20:05:59.003460

The bill would exempt Umatilla County from the state’s ban on new nuclear projects. (Photo by Alex Baumhardt/Oregon Capital Chronicle)A bill that would exempt Umatilla County from the statewide ban on new nuclear energy facilities has drawn the opposition of environmentalists, tribes, doctors and northeast Oregon community groups who showed up Monday at the Capitol in Salem to rally against it.
If passed, House Bill 2410 would allow the state’s Energy Facility Siting Council to approve development of a modular nuclear reactor in northeast Oregon’s Umatilla County. Oregon voters in 1980 approved a statewide ban on new nuclear development, barring the federal government creates a national repository for nuclear waste or voters decide to appeal. Neither has happened.
The bill’s architects characterize it as allowing a “demonstration project” of modular nuclear that would operate on a microgrid and support “community energy resilience.” Small reactors have about one-third the generating capacity of a traditional reactor, according to the International Atomic Energy Agency, and can power individual neighborhoods, factories and facilities such as data centers that consume large amounts of energy.
Bill sponsor state Rep. Bobby Levy, R-Echo, has touted it in hearings as a clean energy solution to growing power demand in the state. Levy declined an interview Monday, but she told the Capital Chronicle in an email that local residents and the state would benefit from “reliable, carbon-free baseload power, job creation, and potential economic growth through new infrastructure investments.”
“At the broader level, small-scale nuclear would also contribute to Oregon’s clean energy goals, supporting a resilient and diversified energy mix across the state,” she said.
Nuclear energy does not directly produce carbon dioxide or other greenhouse gases contributing to climate change, and it can produce more energy with less fuel than any other individual source of existing power, according to MIT.
But protesters Monday said they suspect House Bill 2410 is less about “community energy resilience” than powering Umatilla County’s booming data centers. The protesters said eastern Oregon lawmakers continue to treat the state’s northeast corner like an “environmental sacrifice zone,” noting that there is nowhere to safely store nuclear waste.
The bill passed 8-4 with recommendation in April from the House Committee on Climate, Energy and Environment, of which Levy is a vice-chair, to the Joint Ways & Means Committee. Another nuclear bill currently in the Ways & Means Committee, House Bill 2038, is also co-sponsored by Levy, and has drawn concerns from environmental and community groups as well as tribes. It would create a committee to study the benefits and risks of developing nuclear energy facilities in Oregon.
“The Umatilla Basin is one of the most polluted places in Oregon, some of the worst groundwater pollution in the state, some of the worst industrial air pollution in the state, and it just keeps getting worse. Now we’re talking about adding radioactive waste on top of that?” said Kaleb Lay, policy director at Oregon Rural Action, at the rally.
Representatives from nonprofit environmental groups Columbia Riverkeeper and the Sierra Club of Oregon and Oregon Physicians for Social Responsibility also attended.
 Data demand

Demand for power from the Umatilla Electric Cooperative, which supplies electricity to the region, has grown 556% in the last decade according to recent analysis by the nonprofit research organization Sightline Institute. Nearly all of that is from Amazon data centers in the county. Amazon and Microsoft are investing billions in small scale nuclear reactors to power their data centers, including those in eastern Oregon, and Microsoft CEO Bill Gates last year invested $1 billion into a nuclear power plant in Wyoming, operated by his new company TerraPower.
Levy said it is an “oversimplification” to suggest data centers are the only or primary beneficiaries of modular nuclear reactors.
“The reality is that all ratepayers benefit from a more stable, reliable, and carbon-free energy supply — especially as demand across sectors continues to rise,” she said.
The bill has so far drawn 168 letters of testimony, about 75% of them in opposition to the bill. Many expressed concerns about where nuclear waste would end up and environmental concerns about uranium mining, especially on native land.
The bill would bar “high-level radioactive waste” from being stored at the demonstration project site after the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission terminates the project’s operating license, but it does not include details about where waste would eventually end up.
It’s supported by members of the Morrow and Umatilla county commissions.
“I’m very excited that someone else is willing to take on the experiment risk, and they’re close enough that we can, hopefully if it goes well, benefit from it,” Morrow County Commissioner Jeff Wenholz recently told Elkhorn Media Group.
 Across the river

Cathy Sampson-Kruse, 71, a member of the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation, grew up in Umatilla County and went to high school in Echo. She said her family members that still live there do not support the bills.
“We have to ask ourselves, really, who is this supply for?” Sampson-Kruse said. “And what is it really taking away from generations of children that do not have a say in this — just like we’re going to have generations of children that are going to deal with the Hanford debacle.”
The problem with where to put nuclear waste continues to plague the Hanford Site across the Columbia River north of Richland, Washington, where the Washington Department of Ecology, the U.S. Department of Energy and the Environmental Protection Agency are trying to figure out how to move 56 million gallons of radioactive sludge. The sludge is a byproduct of World War II-era plutonium production that still sits 80 years later in 177 underground tanks, some of which are leaking.
The agencies are hoping to move at least 2,000 gallons of that sludge via rail or truck through Oregon to facilities in Utah and Texas that can process it into a grout cement and dispose of it. The proposal doesn’t yet detail a route, but critics have said it would most likely end up on major interstate highways through Oregon, or on a rail line through central Oregon along the Deschutes River, passing near areas like Bend and the Confederated Tribes of the Warm Springs Reservation.
Oregon Gov. Tina Kotek is opposed to the plan as proposed by the agencies.
House Bill 2410  is not the first time state or federal governments have proposed sacrificing the health of the environment for industry when it comes to power in the Northwest, Sampson-Kruse said. She was a child when the Dalles Dam was constructed, flooding the Celilo Falls where Northwest tribes traditionally fished.
“Now, one of our most beloved natural foods, the salmon, is on the list for extinction. It constantly begs the question, how much more? Where do we draw the line?” Sampson-Kruse said.

SPRINGFIELD — Lawmakers approved measures limiting AI instruction at community colleges, requiring seat belts on school buses, and mandating food handlers receive certain allergen training among dozens of bills Wednesday.

The Illinois Senate gave its approval to a bill that would prohibit community colleges from using artificial intelligence programs instead of human instructors to teach their classes.

House Bill 1859 would not entirely ban the use of AI as an instructional tool. Faculty members would still be allowed to use those platforms to “augment course instruction.” But it would prohibit colleges from using AI instead of human faculty members as the “sole source of instruction for students.”

The measure comes at a time when colleges and universities across the country have been struggling with the ethical issues raised by such platforms as ChatGPT and Copilot. Many schools have adopted policies prohibiting students from using those platforms to write papers or complete assignments while at the same time allowing their instructors to use them as teaching aids.

The New York Times recently reported a student at Northeastern University, in Boston, filed a complaint with the school and sought a refund for tuition she had paid for one class after discovering her professor had used ChatGPT to produce the lecture notes that were used in a business class.

The bill passed the Senate 46-12 with several Republicans objecting. Sen. Sue Rezin, R-Morris, said she was concerned the bill goes too far in limiting the options of local community college boards that want to offer classes in subjects where human instructors are hard to find.

“I’m concerned that this bill will take local control away from the community college to be able to make decisions that are in the best interest of their students,” she said.

But Sen. Mike Porfirio, D-Lyons Township, the bill’s chief Senate sponsor, said the aim was to protect the interests of both students and human instructors.

“I think if anything we’re guaranteeing that our students receive proper instruction and also that we acknowledge the role that instructors, faculty, staff play in students’ lives,” he said.

The bill now returns to the House, which must concur on an amendment made in the Senate before it can be sent to Gov. JB Pritzker for his consideration.

Food allergen training for food handlers

A bill mandating food handlers undergo educational training on celiac disease and other food allergies passed the House unanimously on Wednesday.

Senate Bill 1288 was sponsored by Sen. Sally Turner, R-Beason, to provide food handlers with more knowledge about the disease in hopes that they’ll take allergies and cross-contamination issues more seriously. The training will include information such as the symptoms of celiac disease and ways to prevent cross-contamination.

The bill also mandates training on allergies related to milk, eggs, fish, crustaceans, tree nuts, wheat, peanuts, soybeans, sesame and food ingredients that contain protein derived from those allergens.

Turner said the issue of cross-contamination was brought to her attention when she visited a restaurant with a friend who has celiac disease, an autoimmune disease linked to gluten. When they ordered their meal, Turner’s friend told their server she was gluten free and ordered a salad without croutons. Although the prepared salad didn’t have croutons on it when her friend consumed it, Turner said her friend had symptoms of gluten ingestion quickly after eating the salad.

Turner said she’s heard this issue before and began to wonder whether the cooks at some restaurants simply pick croutons off salads. After that, she said she wondered about how many food handlers take cross-contamination seriously.

“It was really an easy bill to pass, because so many people now have some friends, neighbors and relatives that have celiac and are recognizing that and they just want to make sure that everybody is going to be healthy when they go out to eat,” Turner said following the bill’s passage. “It just might encourage more people to recognize that.”

School buses requiring seat belts

Another bill that cleared the General Assembly would require all school buses in K-12 schools to have seat belts on them.

According to Senate Bill 191, any school buses made after 2031 would be required to have seat belts that go over the lap and shoulders of all passengers.

The bill doesn’t require school district staff, a contractor or any entity in charge of school buses to make sure students are wearing seat belts; it would just require new buses to have them.

The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration lists on its website that buses are designed so “children are protected from crashes by strong, closely spaced seats that have energy-absorbing seat backs.” Short school buses already require seat belts because they are closer in weight to normal cars.

Rep. Bob Morgan, D-Deerfield, said Wednesday on the House floor that he presumes school districts will have their own policies for how to handle seat-belt usage on buses.

“This might sound interesting, it's really not that notable in the sense that school buses are already pretty safe, and all new manufactured school buses already are really focusing on having a three-point seat belt,” Morgan said.

Morgan said there shouldn’t be an across-the-board price increase of buses, although Rep. Patrick Windhorst, R-Metropolis, cited an estimated $7,000 to $18,000 increase in bus prices given by the Illinois School Transportation Association.

The bill passed with a vote of 83-27 and awaits the governor’s signature.

Gov. Greg Gianforte made decisions on four firefighting laws this week, signing two bills and vetoing two others.
The two bills Gianforte signed — House Bills 84 and 421 — dealt with wildland firefighting. The two he vetoed, House Bill 511 and House Bill 547, would have added $5 million in funding for local fire departments and another seeking to change a law preventing coordinated fire response in consolidated governments.
HB 84, called the Prescribed Fire Manager Certification and Liability Act, creates a certification program and outlines who is liable if a prescribed fire gets out of control. In 2022, a prescribed fire in New Mexico did, becoming the state’s largest in history.
The program will including training for fire managers and that their certification standards must match other states and organizations. A certified prescribed fire manager will only be able to be held liable for a wildfire getting out of control if, their actions “constituted negligence or a higher degree of fault.”
Fire scientists and proponents of HB 84 — brought by Rep. Steve Gist, R-Cascade — have pointed to prescribed fires as an important forestry management tool.
“I know it seems counterintuitive to fight fire with more fire, but the science is clear,” said Mike Schaedel, representing The Nature Conservancy and member of the state’s prescribed fire council. “It’s the best tool we have. We know what wildfires can do without prescribed fire. They damage our forests and all those values we hold dear. This bill protects our forests. It enables private landowners to manage their lands in a safe and effective way that keeps people working in the woods.”
Land management practices in the United States have led to some forests being overgrown and at risk for more intense wildfires, said proponents of the bill.
“To address the current forest health and wildland fire crisis, we need to get on this,” Gist said during a Senate hearing on his bill. “We need to do prescribed fire. We need to do fuel mitigation followed up with prescribed fire. Prescribed fire is one tool of doing fuels reduction. It’s essential.” 
HB 421, also sponsored by Gist, increased fire protection fees for land classified as forest from $50 to $58.70 for each landowner in a wildland fire protection district. For landowners with more than 20 acres of land, there’s an additional fee per acre which increased from $0.30 to $0.49.
  Two vetoes 

The two vetoed bills were brought by Anaconda Democrat Rep. Scott DeMarois, who is a career firefighter.
HB 511 would have taken $5 million from the general fund and directed it to a special revenue account for dispersion to local governments via grants. The money would have gone to training facilities.
“Training with the right equipment gives us critical knowledge of fire behavior and response techniques, along with that 3 a.m. muscle memory that saves lives,” DeMarois said in a press release. “With this veto, Governor Gianforte has shown us that he doesn’t really stand with first responders, and doesn’t really care about protecting firefighters or the communities that we put their lives on the line to defend.”
Gianforte’s veto letter pointed to the state needing a balanced budget and said instead of grants, should look at creating a low-interest loan program.
“The budget and other bills with hefty price tags that the Legislature passed, however, are not fiscally responsible,” the veto letter reads. “Therefore, I will keenly review the budget and spending bills the Legislature passed, making some difficult decisions to protect taxpayers and their hard-earned resources.”
The Butte-Silver Bow Fire Department also saw a setback in the form of a veto on HB 547. Due to a decision made in the 1970s to create a consolidated city-county government — only used by Butte and Anaconda — the Butte-Silver Bow Fire Department hasn’t been able to coordinate as well with its outlying volunteer fire departments.
The bill would have struck a clause and replaced it with language that said, “The fire department of the municipality must have a director of fire service or a fire chief, who shall manage and control the department in the manner prescribed by the ordinances of the municipality.”
Proponents said that would fix the problem. Butte-Silver Bow officials and firefighters lined up in support of the bill.
“We have great volunteers that work in Butte-Silver Bow, and this is not to take anything away from them,” J.P. Gallagher, Butte-Silver Bow chief executive said during a Senate hearing on the bill. “The director of Fire Services works directly for me and within the powers that are directed to the director of fire services, he has the ability to coordinate those services, but the unintended consequences of 1979 kind of stripped him of that ability to coordinate services.”
Members of rural fire associations across the state spoke against the bill during House and Senate hearings. Opponents included Jerry Brothers, who is the vice president of both the Montana State Volunteer Fire Association and of the National Volunteer Firefighters Association.
“We did not have a voice in the system at all,” Brothers said during the bill’s Senate hearing.
DeMarois said during his Senate testimony the change would only impact the state’s two consolidated city-county governments, but Gianforte, a Republican, disagreed in his veto letter.
“House Bill 547 raises more questions than it answers, and it introduces instability into the operations of rural fire districts, the backbone of Montana’s emergency network,” the veto letter reads. “Ultimately, House Bill 547 erodes the reliability and strength of rural fire protection throughout our state, while appearing to provide a one-sided resolution to a dispute within one consolidated government.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Crews-3-Horse-Gulch-715-768x1024.jpg,,,2025-05-21 20:05:59.003460

Pennsylvania is the fourth-largest recipient of aid under the Commodity Supplemental Food Program (CSFP), behind California, Texas and Michigan. Cuts to the USDA funding bill would have an outsized impact on the commonwealth, where 38,000 seniors receive monthly food packages through the program, Hunger-Free Pennsylvania said.
“We must at all costs preserve the critical and vital safety net that CSFP provides for our most vulnerable Pennsylvanians – our seniors,” Hunger-Free Pennsylvania Executive Director Stuart I.R. Haniff said.
According to the nonprofit Food Research & Action Center, the Trump administration proposes a $425 million cut to eliminate CSFP and replace the aid with Make America Healthy Again Food Boxes, which source food items directly from farmers.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Hunger-Free Pennsylvania, which represents the commonwealth’s 18 food banks serving all 67 counties, said funding should be maintained at current levels, at a minimum.
“If Congress fails to fully fund this program, our most vulnerable seniors will lose access to the nutritious food they need to live healthier lives,” Haniff said.
The CSFP delivers food packages designed to provide protein, calcium, iron and vitamins A and C to people 60 and older who have an income below 150% of the federal poverty level. For a single-person household, that’s about $23,500 a year, according to Hunger-Free Pennsylvania.
The network said the program has been a “resounding success,” recently surpassing 250,000 deliveries through the meal delivery app DoorDash’s Project DASH, which allows food banks and pantries to work with DoorDash drivers and technology to distribute aid.
“Often, the contact with a home delivery representative is the only human contact these seniors have – and sometimes the only eyes to check on them and their well-being,” Hunger-Free Pennsylvania said in a statement.  
The organization’s call for attention to the program comes as Pennsylvania officials fight with the Trump administration over the cancellation of an initiative that provides millions of dollars for farmers who provide products for food banks across the state. 
Along with a threatened lawsuit, Gov. Josh Shapiro has said the Trump administration broke a three-year contract between the federal government and the state.
The deal, the Local Food Purchase Assistance Cooperative Agreement Program (LFPA), was established in 2021 under President Joe Biden’s administration in response to the coronavirus pandemic. It supported about 190 farms and 13 food banks.
The latest contract was renewed in the final months of Biden’s term. However, Trump’s administration confirmed in March that the program was ending, impacting farmers and food banks across the nation.

Republicans in the chamber overwhelmingly rejected a bill from Sen. Royce Duplessis, D-New Orleans, to allow people convicted by non-unanimous juries before 2018 to petition for their cases to be reviewed. The proposal failed on a 9-26 vote despite having the support of the Louisiana Republican Party and GOP Congressman Clay Higgins, who’s long campaigned on a tough-on-crime platform.
Louisiana and Oregon were the last two states to allow split-jury verdicts in the prosecution of violent felonies. Voters in Louisiana amended the state constitution in 2018 to eliminate non-unanimous juries, though it didn’t apply to such convictions before the change.   
In 2020, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled split-jury convictions were unconstitutional, but justices allowed Louisiana and Oregon to determine if their ruling would apply retroactively to older cases. 
Split juries originated during the Jim Crow era, when the law was created to silence the voice of newly enfranchised Black citizens who were allowed to serve as jurors for the first time.

As another school year ends, superintendents across the United States are staring down an autumn staffing crisis, with 1 in 8 teaching positions either vacant or filled by an underqualified educator.
States that are struggling with post-pandemic teacher shortages have spent millions to lure replacements and retain veterans with hiring bonuses and bumps in salaries. But hiring gaps remain, so some states also are trying another tactic: changing their standards.
The changes in teacher training and licensing come amid widespread turmoil in public schools: Tax revenue is being siphoned toward private school vouchers in many states; some classrooms are being scrutinized for banned books, displays or teaching lessons that trip into diversity, equity and inclusion territory; and students who went through pandemic-era shutdowns are struggling both with sitting still and with learning the material.

Some surveys show that fewer than a fifth of teachers are happy in their jobs.
“Teaching is not seen as an attractive profession right now,” said Drew Gitomer, an expert on teaching assessment at Rutgers Graduate School of Education.
“COVID exacerbated things, and teachers are caught in the middle of political battles — over curriculum, book bans, even personal attacks,” he said. “It’s not a healthy work environment, and that drives people away.”










Teaching is not seen as an attractive profession right now.


– Drew Gitomer, an expert on teaching assessment at Rutgers Graduate School of Education


Last year, Illinois enacted a law allowing teacher candidates to begin student teaching before passing content-area exams. It was an effort to reduce barriers for underrepresented groups, the measure’s sponsor said.
A bill under consideration this year would give more districts discretion over whether to factor pupils’ test scores into teacher evaluations, a break from a 15-year-old mandate.
In New Jersey, a new law formally removes the Praxis Core exam — traditionally used as an entry-level screening tool for aspiring teachers — from certification requirements.
And in Nevada — one of the states hit hardest by teacher shortages — a bill would streamline licensure for incoming educators. The bill would allow teachers credentialed in other states to begin working in Nevada classrooms while awaiting formal approval.
It also would remove extra steps for teachers switching grade levels and would waive application fees for recent substitute teachers.
Linda Darling-Hammond, founding president and chief knowledge officer of the Learning Policy Institute, a nonpartisan think tank, said teacher shortages hit hardest in schools serving low-income students and students of color, where instability often leads to larger class sizes, canceled courses or a revolving door of substitute teachers.
“When you walk into a school facing shortages, you see instability,” she said. “Students may be taught by people who don’t know what to do, who leave quickly, and who often rely more on discipline than engagement.”
The root cause? Teacher attrition.

“Nine out of 10 vacancies every year are because of attrition — and two-thirds of that is not retirement,” Darling-Hammond said. “Support in the beginning matters. Teachers who come in and get a mentor stay longer. If you’re just thrown in to sink or swim, the odds of leaving are much greater.”
States have long struggled to attract teachers, and credentialing changes aren’t unusual. But some education advocates fear long-term repercussions.
Melissa Tooley, director of K-12 educator quality at the left-leaning think tank New America, said most states now offer alternative and fast-track teacher certification pathways, many of which allow candidates to start teaching with little or no pedagogical training in how to teach.
“We’re churning through people who might have potential, but we’re not setting them up for success,” she said. “A lot of what states are doing is short term. It’s about filling seats, not necessarily building a sustainable or high-quality workforce.”
More than 40 states require aspiring teachers to take the costly Praxis Subject test for the subject they want to teach, which some experts argue excludes strong candidates and duplicates other assessments.
“You were excluding people who might be good teachers but didn’t do well on that specific test,” said Rutgers’ Gitomer, who has researched the test’s effects on recruitment.
However, he added, dropping tests doesn’t necessarily help.
Several states — Georgia, New Jersey, New York, Washington and Wisconsin — have dropped a licensure requirement known as edTPA since 2022, but there’s little evidence the move has helped ease teacher shortages, Gitomer said. (The acronym stands for Educative Teacher Performance Assessment and involves a portfolio that includes testing and videos of classroom performance.)

“The state eliminated edTPA but didn’t replace it with a specific alternative,” he said.
“Instead, it gave full discretion back to individual institutions to develop or adopt their own performance assessments,” he said. “When we talked to institutions, it became pretty clear they didn’t think removing edTPA would be a major driver in addressing the shortage — and they haven’t seen evidence that it has been.”

How best to credential

Tooley said state credentialing systems must navigate a delicate balance: ensuring there are enough teachers, maintaining instructional quality and increasing workforce diversity.
“There’s this triangle — three pieces that need to be in place — and I think there are real tensions when it comes to how states are designing their certification policies,” she said.
And Gitomer described a fragmented national landscape, where some states are tightening teacher entry standards while others are dramatically loosening them — even allowing non-degreed individuals to teach.
“Some states are trying to raise standards; others are relaxing them to the point where you may not even need a college degree,” he said.
Indiana now requires all pre-K through grade 6 and special education teachers to complete 80 hours of training on the “science of reading,” a method that includes phonics, and pass an exam by 2027. State Sen. Jean Leising, a Republican, has proposed cutting the requirement in half, calling it “an excessive burden with little actual benefit” in a news release.
In Texas, a bill aims to reduce the use of uncertified teachers by the 2029-30 school year. The legislation would set a gradual cap on the percentage of uncertified teachers districts can employ in core curriculum classes — starting at 20% in 2026-27 and decreasing to 5% in 2029-30.
According to the Texas Education Agency, 31% of new hires in 2024-25 lacked a state teaching certificate or permit.
Yet some states stand out for how they’re changing their requirements, Tooley said.
She pointed to Washington, which has designed a recruitment strategy encouraging paraprofessionals, often known as teacher’s aides, to become classroom teachers. Also known as paraeducators, they’re a group with classroom experience, community ties and higher retention likelihood.
There, school districts are required to offer foundational training — ranging from 14 to 28 hours — directly to paraeducators.

In West Virginia, a new law now allows districts to count full-time behavior interventionists working in one or two classrooms toward meeting the required number of aides or paraprofessionals in K-3 classrooms.
Tooley noted that Pennsylvania and Alabama are experimenting with “menu-style” licensing flexibility — allowing candidates to demonstrate qualification through various combinations of GPA and test scores, rather than rigid cutoffs.
“These are people already in schools, often from the same cultural or linguistic backgrounds as students,” Tooley said. “They’re more likely to succeed and to stay.”

Low pay

A 2024 national survey by the EdWeek Research Center found that public school teachers are increasingly reporting declines in mental health, job satisfaction and classroom stability. Seventy percent of teachers recommended student mental health interventions, and nearly half said schools lack enough counselors, psychologists and social workers.
As mental well-being has worsened, the share of public school teachers who are very satisfied with their jobs has also declined by 2 percentage points from the previous year, to 18%, according to the survey, which was conducted by the EdWeek Research Center on behalf of Merrimack College.
While teacher wellness supports remain limited, educators say improvements in pay and student discipline are the most needed changes.
To entice passionate but burned out educators from leaving the workforce, several states have raised minimum teacher pay. Arkansas boosted salaries to $50,000 statewide, and South Carolina raised starting pay to $47,000. South Dakota enacted a $45,000 minimum with yearly increases, and penalties for districts that fail to comply by 2026. Connecticut advanced a bill setting a $63,450 salary floor, while Indiana and others are eyeing further increases.
At the federal level, the proposed American Teacher Act seeks to establish a national $60,000 minimum salary for teachers at a qualifying school to boost recruitment and retention across the country. The bill, sponsored by U.S. Rep. Frederica Wilson, a Florida Democrat, remains in committee.

The governor had sharp words for the state’s largest city on Wednesday.

Photo by Glenn Russell/VTDigger“I don’t think that is going to fix what ails Burlington.”That’s what Gov. Phil Scott told reporters Wednesday at his weekly press conference, speaking about a proposed change to the laws governing the state’s largest city that would ban guns from bars and other establishments that serve alcohol. He said he would veto the proposal — the only gun control measure legislators have advanced this year — if it makes it to his desk.The charter change, S.131, cleared the Senate late last month. It has since been in the House Government Operations and Military Affairs Committee, which took testimony on the proposal as recently as Tuesday afternoon. Asked if his committee would pass out the proposal in time to get it to the governor before the end of the session, Rep. Matt Birong, D-Vergennes, who is the panel’s chair, gave only a short answer: “perhaps.”Regardless, a veto may spell the end for the legislation, since it didn’t pass the Senate with enough votes — just 17 — to rebuke Scott’s red pen. Charter changes, after being approved by local voters, must get a sign-off from the Legislature and the governor before taking effect. The bill is Burlington voters’ second attempt in a decade at asking legislators to approve a ban on guns in bars. This year’s effort was prompted by a fatal shooting last summer outside a bar and nightclub in the city’s downtown that police said was preceded by a fight inside the venue. Backers of the bill in the Statehouse, top among them Burlingtonian and Senate President Pro Tempore Phil Baruth, D/P-Chittenden Central, have called the proposal a common sense change to keep bar patrons and staff safe. But the measure has drawn opposition from some gun owners’ rights groups, including the Vermont Federation of Sportsmen’s Clubs. Scott said his main issue with the proposal was that he did not think bar owners could effectively enforce it. He also said he was opposed to banning guns from bars in one municipality, while no such policy exists elsewhere in the state, though added he would oppose a statewide ban, too. “Like, who’s going to stand at the door and frisk people?” he told reporters Wednesday. “Are you going to have a metal detector?” (Proponents of the bill have said that enforcement would ultimately be up to the Burlington Police Department, whom bar owners could call if needed.)One reporter then contended that bars don’t often have someone posted at the door to check for other things that would be illegal to carry inside, such as illicit drugs. “Well, I don’t think they see that as a problem in Burlington,” Scott replied, referring to illicit drugs. “I mean, it’s pretty flagrant around the community.”— Shaun RobinsonIn the knowVermont legislators are struggling with what to do next with a major education reform bill, which Gov. Phil Scott is pushing them to pass this year. Sharp disagreements among lawmakers have emerged in the Vermont Senate over the past week, as education leaders publicly lobby against the chamber’s latest version of legislation. Both chambers of the Legislature and the governor see education reform as a key issue in response to last year’s double-digit average property tax increases. All three have put forward different versions of wide-ranging reforms. The proposal, H.454, was originally slated for a vote on the Senate floor Wednesday after passing out of a key committee last week. But at a tense caucus meeting of the Senate’s Democratic majority Tuesday evening, Senate President Pro Tempore Phil Baruth, D/P-Chittenden Central, pulled the plug on those plans and conceded that a majority of the caucus was not willing to support the current version of the bill, even after taking weeks of testimony. “I made a promise to people in the caucus that I wouldn’t bring a bill that had a little bit of Democratic support and a lot of Republican support,” Baruth said Tuesday. “Currently, that’s the only way that (H.454) would make it through the process — would be for, you know, a handful, at best, of Democrats to support it, and then a majority of Republicans to support it.”Plans were for the education bill to come up for action on the floor Thursday, said Ashley Moore, who is Baruth’s chief of staff, on Wednesday afternoon.Read more about what educators and lawmakers are saying about the bill here. — Habib Sabet and Shaun RobinsonOn the moveA bill that would radically restructure Vermont’s response to homelessness is headed for a full vote in the Senate Thursday.

But he noted that he could not greenlight a bill that continues allowing the mass use of motel and hotel rooms for shelter, and maintains historically high spending levels.“There’s a lot of conditions that have to be put into place before we do this,” Scott said.H.91 would shift Vermont’s homelessness response system from one centered on state government to one administered by private nonprofit organizations. It passed the House in early April.In its current form, the bill would make that transition in stages. Next summer, the statewide motel voucher program would end, and regional anti-poverty organizations would take over the task of providing emergency shelter under the banner of the newly-created Vermont Homeless Emergency Assistance and Responsive Transition to Housing Program. The state would maintain an oversight role.Read more about the bill and its next steps here.  — Carly BerlinVisit our 2025 bill tracker for the latest updates on major legislation we are following. Read the story on VTDigger here:  Final Reading: Gov.

In response to President Donald Trump’s tariff whipsaw, international cargo imports spiked in March and April as shippers tried to get ahead of anticipated tariffs. 
Traffic through the ports of Seattle and Tacoma dropped significantly in recent weeks, but forecasts now predict a rebound. Shippers are trying to rush goods after the United States agreed to lower import taxes on China from 145% to 30% for a 90-day truce, according to Seattle port commissioner Ryan Calkins. Businesses fear what could come after those 90 days.
The president’s on-again, off-again relationship with tariffs “is not the optimal way to operate a port facility,” Calkins said Wednesday. “We really want a steady stream, rather than peaks and valleys.”
The instability means inconsistent work for local longshoremen, truckers and warehouse workers. And it’s left businesses struggling to plan.
“You’re planting seeds now in the spring, for harvest in the fall. And if you don’t know exactly whether you’ll be able to sell your soybeans to China or your corn to Southeast Asia, what does that mean for how you plant now?” Calkins said. “And unfortunately, I think it means that a lot of businesses are choosing to be conservative, and the knock-on impacts of that mean a drag on our economy.”
This uncertainty led Washington leaders, including Gov. Bob Ferguson, the mayors of Seattle and Spokane, state legislators, union officials and business groups, to call on judges to block the president’s tariffs. 
Last month, a dozen states filed suit in the U.S. Court of International Trade in New York in a bid to stop the tariffs. The lawsuit, in which Washington is not a plaintiff, argues Trump has circumvented the congressional power to set trade policy outlined in the U.S. Constitution in setting tariffs. 
The White House has said persistent trade deficits necessitated the tariffs. 
The states argued their case in court Wednesday. The day before, the Washington officials tried to show the three judges overseeing the case the harms Trump’s tariffs have wrought on the state.
Washington is the ninth-largest exporter in the country, according to the state’s brief filed by pro-bono attorneys from the Seattle law firm Corr Cronin. Last year, Washington exported $57.8 billion in goods, making up over 7% of the state’s gross domestic product. Retaliatory tariffs other countries have instituted in response to Trump’s actions hurt the competitiveness of Washington’s products and threatens trade relationships, officials say.
The three countries Trump has singled out — China, Canada and Mexico — account for nearly half of Washington’s imports.
At a press conference Wednesday at the Port of Seattle, Ferguson used the example of North Cascades Builders Supply to emphasize how tariffs are impacting Washington businesses. The Okanogan County-based company imports windows from Canada, but uncertainty from tariffs has cost the business $250,000 in lost projects, the governor said.

“These reckless, erratic and illegal tariffs have thrown the global economy into chaos,” Ferguson said. “American working people and consumers, including Washingtonians, are paying the price.”
Ferguson’s comments came the day after he signed billions of dollars in new and increased taxes, including on businesses, to address a major budget shortfall.
Washington companies last year paid $2 billion in tariffs on imports. Trump’s tariffs could cost 10 times that, according to the state’s amicus brief.
Ferguson said “history will judge Congress” for its inaction to stop what he sees as the president’s abuse of power.
“I’m a governor, not a member of Congress, thank God,” he said.
Vehicle purchases are one area where consumers will see rising prices due to tariffs, even if cars are manufactured domestically, a national policy expert told a state panel Wednesday.
“All vehicles are going to get more expensive, regardless of where it is finally assembled,” said Nick Nigro, founder of Atlas Public Policy, in a presentation to the Electric Vehicle Coordinating Council. Panel members come from 10 state agencies leading the state’s efforts to transition to electric vehicles.
U.S. Sen. Maria Cantwell, a Democrat from Washington, has filed bipartisan legislation looking to flex the legislative branch’s muscles on tariffs. The bill would require the president to notify Congress of the imposition or increase in a tariff within 48 hours. The notice must explain the rationale and analyze potential impacts to the country’s businesses and consumers.
Within 60 days, Congress would have to pass a joint resolution approving the new tariff, or it would expire. Congress could also end tariffs at any time via resolution.
The proposal, known as the Trade Review Act of 2025, has very little chance of success in the Republican-controlled Congress.

(Photo by Michael Loccisano/Getty Images)As another school year ends, superintendents across the United States are staring down an autumn staffing crisis, with 1 in 8 teaching positions either vacant or filled by an underqualified educator.
States that are struggling with post-pandemic teacher shortages have spent millions to lure replacements and retain veterans with hiring bonuses and bumps in salaries. But hiring gaps remain, so some states also are trying another tactic: changing their standards.
The changes in teacher training and licensing come amid widespread turmoil in public schools: Tax revenue is being siphoned toward private school vouchers in many states; some classrooms are being scrutinized for banned books, displays or teaching lessons that trip into diversity, equity and inclusion territory; and students who went through pandemic-era shutdowns are struggling both with sitting still and with learning the material.
Some surveys show that fewer than a fifth of teachers are happy in their jobs.
“Teaching is not seen as an attractive profession right now,” said Drew Gitomer, an expert on teaching assessment at Rutgers Graduate School of Education.
“COVID exacerbated things, and teachers are caught in the middle of political battles — over curriculum, book bans, even personal attacks,” he said. “It’s not a healthy work environment, and that drives people away.”










Teaching is not seen as an attractive profession right now.


– Drew Gitomer, an expert on teaching assessment at Rutgers Graduate School of Education


Last year, Illinois enacted a law allowing teacher candidates to begin student teaching before passing content-area exams. It was an effort to reduce barriers for underrepresented groups, the measure’s sponsor said.


SC education changes
The following proposals involving K-12 public schools became law in 2025:
• Excused school absences, signed into law April 28. It requires school districts to excuse students for attending certain extracurricular events.
• K-12 scholarships for private tuition, signed May 7. It provides $7,500 scholarships for up to 10,000 students in 2025-26.
• “Educator Assistance Act,” also signed May 7. Its changes include providing teachers dedicated planning time, more information on and flexibility with their contract, and the ability to count district training toward the 120 hours of continuing education credits needed to renew their teaching certificate every five years.
• Work experience credit, signed May 12. It allows people who change careers and become newly certified teachers to count prior years of work experience toward their paycheck.
• Noncertified teacher pilot program, also signed May 12. It allows schools to fill up to 10% of its teaching slots with noncertified teachers who have at least five years of relevant work experience. The five-year pilot program sunsets June 30, 2030.
• An approved change that’s not yet law: The state budget will boost the minimum pay for teachers by $1,500 statewide across all experience levels. The floor for first-year teachers will be $48,500 in the coming school year.


A bill under consideration this year would give more districts discretion over whether to factor pupils’ test scores into teacher evaluations, a break from a 15-year-old mandate.
In New Jersey, a new law formally removes the Praxis Core exam — traditionally used as an entry-level screening tool for aspiring teachers — from certification requirements.
And in Nevada — one of the states hit hardest by teacher shortages — a bill would streamline licensure for incoming educators. The bill would allow teachers credentialed in other states to begin working in Nevada classrooms while awaiting formal approval.
It also would remove extra steps for teachers switching grade levels and would waive application fees for recent substitute teachers.
Linda Darling-Hammond, founding president and chief knowledge officer of the Learning Policy Institute, a nonpartisan think tank, said teacher shortages hit hardest in schools serving low-income students and students of color, where instability often leads to larger class sizes, canceled courses or a revolving door of substitute teachers.
“When you walk into a school facing shortages, you see instability,” she said. “Students may be taught by people who don’t know what to do, who leave quickly, and who often rely more on discipline than engagement.”
The root cause? Teacher attrition.
“Nine out of 10 vacancies every year are because of attrition — and two-thirds of that is not retirement,” Darling-Hammond said. “Support in the beginning matters. Teachers who come in and get a mentor stay longer. If you’re just thrown in to sink or swim, the odds of leaving are much greater.”
States have long struggled to attract teachers, and credentialing changes aren’t unusual. But some education advocates fear long-term repercussions.
Melissa Tooley, director of K-12 educator quality at the left-leaning think tank New America, said most states now offer alternative and fast-track teacher certification pathways, many of which allow candidates to start teaching with little or no pedagogical training in how to teach.
“We’re churning through people who might have potential, but we’re not setting them up for success,” she said. “A lot of what states are doing is short term. It’s about filling seats, not necessarily building a sustainable or high-quality workforce.”
More than 40 states require aspiring teachers to take the costly Praxis Subject test for the subject they want to teach, which some experts argue excludes strong candidates and duplicates other assessments.
“You were excluding people who might be good teachers but didn’t do well on that specific test,” said Rutgers’ Gitomer, who has researched the test’s effects on recruitment.
However, he added, dropping tests doesn’t necessarily help.
Several states — Georgia, New Jersey, New York, Washington and Wisconsin — have dropped a licensure requirement known as edTPA since 2022, but there’s little evidence the move has helped ease teacher shortages, Gitomer said. (The acronym stands for Educative Teacher Performance Assessment and involves a portfolio that includes testing and videos of classroom performance.)
“The state eliminated edTPA but didn’t replace it with a specific alternative,” he said.
“Instead, it gave full discretion back to individual institutions to develop or adopt their own performance assessments,” he said. “When we talked to institutions, it became pretty clear they didn’t think removing edTPA would be a major driver in addressing the shortage — and they haven’t seen evidence that it has been.”
Some states reexamine school discipline as Trump order paves go-ahead

 How best to credential

Tooley said state credentialing systems must navigate a delicate balance: ensuring there are enough teachers, maintaining instructional quality and increasing workforce diversity.
“There’s this triangle — three pieces that need to be in place — and I think there are real tensions when it comes to how states are designing their certification policies,” she said.
And Gitomer described a fragmented national landscape, where some states are tightening teacher entry standards while others are dramatically loosening them — even allowing non-degreed individuals to teach.
“Some states are trying to raise standards; others are relaxing them to the point where you may not even need a college degree,” he said.
Indiana now requires all pre-K through grade 6 and special education teachers to complete 80 hours of training on the “science of reading,” a method that includes phonics, and pass an exam by 2027. State Sen. Jean Leising, a Republican, has proposed cutting the requirement in half, calling it “an excessive burden with little actual benefit” in a news release.
In Texas, a bill aims to reduce the use of uncertified teachers by the 2029-30 school year. The legislation would set a gradual cap on the percentage of uncertified teachers districts can employ in core curriculum classes — starting at 20% in 2026-27 and decreasing to 5% in 2029-30.
According to the Texas Education Agency, 31% of new hires in 2024-25 lacked a state teaching certificate or permit.
A South Carolina law signed by Gov. Henry McMaster earlier this month is testing the idea, starting smaller. It will newly allow districts to fill up to 10% of its teaching slots with noncertified instructors who have at least five years of relevant work experience in their subject. A proposal that died last year would’ve allowed up to a quarter of teachers to be noncertified.
Yet some states stand out for how they’re changing their requirements, Tooley said.
She pointed to Washington, which has designed a recruitment strategy encouraging paraprofessionals, often known as teacher’s aides, to become classroom teachers. Also known as paraeducators, they’re a group with classroom experience, community ties and higher retention likelihood.
There, school districts are required to offer foundational training — ranging from 14 to 28 hours — directly to paraeducators.
SC teacher vacancies decrease but remain above pre-pandemic levels, report finds

In West Virginia, a new law now allows districts to count full-time behavior interventionists working in one or two classrooms toward meeting the required number of aides or paraprofessionals in K-3 classrooms.
Tooley noted that Pennsylvania and Alabama are experimenting with “menu-style” licensing flexibility — allowing candidates to demonstrate qualification through various combinations of GPA and test scores, rather than rigid cutoffs.
“These are people already in schools, often from the same cultural or linguistic backgrounds as students,” Tooley said. “They’re more likely to succeed and to stay.”
 Low pay

A 2024 national survey by the EdWeek Research Center found that public school teachers are increasingly reporting declines in mental health, job satisfaction and classroom stability. Seventy percent of teachers recommended student mental health interventions, and nearly half said schools lack enough counselors, psychologists and social workers.
As mental well-being has worsened, the share of public school teachers who are very satisfied with their jobs has also declined by 2 percentage points from the previous year, to 18%, according to the survey, which was conducted by the EdWeek Research Center on behalf of Merrimack College.
While teacher wellness supports remain limited, educators say improvements in pay and student discipline are the most needed changes.
To entice passionate but burned out educators from leaving the workforce, several states have raised minimum teacher pay. Arkansas boosted salaries to $50,000 statewide.
In South Carolina, the state-set minimum salaries for all teachers will increase by $1,500 in the coming school year. That will boost the floor for first-year teachers to $48,500, representing a 72% increase in teachers’ starting pay since 2017. McMaster has set a goal of raising that floor to $50,000 next year.
South Dakota enacted a $45,000 minimum with yearly increases, and penalties for districts that fail to comply by 2026. Connecticut advanced a bill setting a $63,450 salary floor, while Indiana and others are eyeing further increases.
At the federal level, the proposed American Teacher Act seeks to establish a national $60,000 minimum salary for teachers at a qualifying school to boost recruitment and retention across the country. The bill, sponsored by U.S. Rep. Frederica Wilson, a Florida Democrat, remains in committee.

(Photo by Emma Murphy/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — In an effort to “protect family privacy,” Oklahoma lawmakers fast-tracked a bill to the governor on Wednesday that will no longer allow the public to view the names of Oklahomans who received a controversial private school tax credit. 
If signed into law by Gov. Kevin Stitt, Senate Bill 684 would also remove individual names that were recently published to an existing state database of recipients of many tax credits. It listed those who received a share of hundreds of millions of state dollars allocated to the Oklahoma Parental Choice Tax Credit program. 
House Democrats opposing the measure said it doesn’t align with how other tax credit program recipients are treated and will create a lack of accountability on where tax dollars are spent and who receives them. 
The voucher-like program offers a refundable income tax credit of up to $7,500 to families who attend eligible private schools in the state. When creating the program, lawmakers gave priority to families earning $150,000 or less, and promised it would help lower-income students have the ability to attend private schools. A recent report showed over 46% of participants made over $150,000. 
House Speaker Kyle Hilbert, R-Bristow, said the bill is about protecting the privacy of children and families. The publicly posted information does not list any children’s names or schools, just the taxpaying adult who applied for and received the funds and how much they received. 
“And while it does not list the names of students, it absolutely is to expose the students via their parents about the fact that they receive tax credits,” he said. 
The measure also requires participating private schools to be accredited by March 2027.
Democrats argued that the tax credit program has benefited high-income families, not underprivileged children. A recent analysis of the recipients by Oklahoma Watch found less than 3,000 of recipients had attended public school the year prior to the credit and only 9% were families that qualify for income-based public assistance programs. 
The recipients of other tax credit programs are publicly available online because that’s how tax credits in Oklahoma work, said Rep. Ellen Pogemiller, D-Oklahoma City.
Rep. Forrest Bennett, D-Oklahoma City, said as a taxpayer he would feel uncomfortable not knowing where his tax dollars were going and who they were really benefitting. 
He said he was bothered by “dismissive” answers from the bill author to questions from other lawmakers on the House floor, specifically responses saying that questions weren’t specific to the bill language. 
“It behooves us, I think, to acknowledge that everything that we vote on is done in context,” he said. “And if I had a nickel for every time I have to talk about this issue, we could fund the voucher program, I think.” 
While most of the debate and discussion focused on the privacy aspects of the tax credit program, the bill also would give priority consideration for the credit to those who received it the prior year. 
First priority would go to families with income below $150,000 and second to any others who received the credit the prior year, regardless of income. 
The Senate unanimously approved the measure Wednesday morning, while the House voted 68-23 to approve the measure Wednesday afternoon.

Steve Carra (R-Three Rivers), chair of the House Oversight Subcommittee on Corporate Subsidies and State Investments on May 21, 2025 | Kyle DavidsonAs Michigan Republicans continue to take a magnifying glass to economic development spending, the House Oversight Subcommittee on Corporate Subsidies and State Investments invited James Hohman of the free-market Mackinac Center for Public Policy to offer his analysis of the state’s Strategic Outreach and Attraction Reserve (SOAR) Fund. 
Hohman, who serves as the Mackinac Center’s director of Fiscal Policy, walked committee members through a collection of several projects through the state’s critical industries program, comparing the number of jobs promised with the jobs delivered.
As he broke down each agreement, Hohman repeatedly noted that these deals were structured to deliver short-term payoffs for companies, and were not tied to job creation, with many deals tying the bulk of their funding requirements to a company’s capital expenditures, or money a company spends to buy, maintain or improve their assets.
  James Hohman of the Mackinac Center for Public Policy testified before the House Oversight Subcommittee on Corporate Subsidies and State Investments on May 21, discussing flaws with the state’s Strategic Outreach and Attraction Reserve (SOAR) Fund. | Kyle Davidson
Additionally, not all deals move forward, with Hohman pointing to a $100.8 million dollar deal with Ford made in 2022 as an example.
Hohman urged lawmakers and members of the public to bring more skepticism to these deals, noting they often fail to deliver on their promises. 
“There’s a massive difference between what gets announced and what actually happens when it comes to living up to expectations,” Hohman said. 
“A lot of them wind up with no jobs at all. Some of them do meet [or] exceed expectations, but when you look at the rhetoric behind the deals, when they’re getting made, there’s rarely even an acknowledgement that deals might not deliver on their pledges,” Hohman said. 
If companies fail to create the jobs they promised, the state has to wait years before it can ask for its money back, Hohman said. If they eliminate jobs after the deal concludes, the state has no way of getting its money back, he said. 
Additionally when asked about the level of transparency offered into these deals, Hohman said they were meeting the minimum standard of transparency, publishing an annual report on how much money was offered, how much the company received and whether they created the jobs that were announced. However, the report’s schedule leaves the status of most current projects unknown, while sometimes forcing people to wait 18 months to learn an agreement didn’t move forward.
Overall the state has allocated $1.46 billion in taxpayer funds to create 14,779 jobs, Hohman said. While lawmakers clearly had ambitious plans for the program, those goals have not panned out, he said.
And while the companies receiving this funding will likely create jobs to fill the buildings they’ve built using state funding, the number of jobs they create will depend on an uncertain future, Hohman said. 
“My major takeaway for you is that if you’re going to continue operating the critical industry program, more of the deal needs to be based on actual job creation. When you have deals that consistently fall apart, that fail to deliver, you should not be paying them until they finally do the things they’re obligated or that lawmakers expect them to do,” Hohman said. 
This would not require a change to the law, Hohman said, only a change in expectations for lawmakers, asking them not to approve projects based on capital expenditures rather than job creation.
  State Rep. Laurie Pohustky (D-Livonia) calls for accurate criticism of Michigan’s Strategic Outreach and Attraction Reserve (SOAR) Fund during a May 21 meeting of the House Oversight Subcommittee on Corporate Subsidies and State Investments. | Kyle Davidson
While there are a number of areas where the Mackinac Center believes these dollars could better benefit residents, Hohman offered his support for House Republicans’ road funding plan, which draws the bulk of its funding by reallocating or eliminating funding set aside for economic development, including $500 million set for automatic deposits into the SOAR fund. 
Despite the issues with the program, State Rep. Laurie Pohutsky (D-Livonia) raised repeated concerns about ensuring criticism of the program was accurate. While some press releases may be disingenuous in promising to deliver jobs, SOAR funding that is allocated for site readiness should not be expected to create jobs. 
“You can’t put 2,000 jobs in a site that is not ready for 2,000 jobs,” Pohutsky said. 
While the SOAR program is not the best use of the state’s money, there are enough flaws that are not based around promises made in press releases, she said.

(Kansas Reflector screen capture)TOPEKA — “Total bunk” is what Kansas Gov. Laura Kelly, the chair of the Democratic Governors Association, called the notion from federal lawmakers that states can backfill potential cuts to public programs, which are part of a Republican budget proposal.
“We don’t have the money,” Kelly said on a press call Wednesday with Democratic governors from Colorado, Michigan and New Mexico.
The call came ahead of a determinative U.S. House vote expected this week on what’s been dubbed “one big beautiful bill.”
The budget bill could drastically cut public programs like Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. Kelly called the proposed bill “deeply unpopular.” Kelly, Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, Colorado Gov. Jared Polis and New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham presented a united front of opposition to the bill.
“It is literally a tariff on every American, so that mega — the ultra rich — mega-billionaires and corporations get to have yet another tax break for many folks who already don’t pay taxes,” Lujan Grisham said.
The most recent version of the bill proposes around $700 billion in cuts to federal Medicaid subsidies, the largest in U.S. history, and $267 billion less in SNAP spending. A preliminary analysis from the Congressional Budget Office estimated that states will have to increase spending by a combined $78 million to offset cuts. It also offers complicated tax code modifications and an elimination of taxes on tips and overtime.
The budget office wrote Tuesday that the bill increases resources for households in the highest 10% of earners, while household resources would decrease for those in the lowest 10% of earners.
SNAP in Kansas benefits around 190,000 people, 87,000 of whom are children, Kelly said. In New Mexico, SNAP has been crucial to reducing child poverty rates, Lujan Grisham said.
Lost Medicaid access would cause citizens to choose between which bills to pay and which medications households can afford, Whitmer, the Michigan governor, said.
“We should be working across the aisle to make health care better and easier to afford,” Whitmer said.
Polis, the Colorado governor, said each proposal this year to cut Medicaid has been “dangerous.” Echoing Kelly, he said states don’t have the money to mitigate cuts and rollbacks to health care.
“They’re basically asking states to do their dirty work for them,” he said.
The Republican Governors Association, in a Tuesday letter signed by 20 governors and addressed to President Donald Trump, remained in support of the bill.
“This landmark piece of legislation embodies your powerful vision to bring about the next great American revival,” the letter said. “It truly delivers on the bold promises all Republicans made to the American people to restore the security, prosperity, and fiscal sanity for our nation.”
 
Medicaid ‘a lifeline’
Staff with Alliance for a Healthy Kansas, a statewide Medicaid advocacy organization, traveled to Washington, D.C., this week to urge the state’s congressional delegation to expand Medicaid access. Kansas is one of 10 states in the country that have not expanded Medicaid through the Affordable Care Act to include low-income adults. The state’s lack of expansion has been billed by Republicans as a benefit in the face of Congress’ drastic cuts.
“That is just false,” Kelly said. “The fact of the matter is we have left $8 billion Kansas taxpayer dollars back in Washington, D.C., that’s been distributed to 40 other states that did expand Medicaid for them to take care of their people and for them to expand their economies, while we sit here in Kansas trying to make do on what we’ve got.”
Millions across the country will lose coverage as a result of Medicaid cuts, said April Holman, executive director of the alliance.
The alliance visited with people in each of Kansas’ five congressional districts, speaking with more than 200 Kansans who informed a 12-page booklet that alliance staff gave to each federal representative.
“Medicaid is not just a budget line — it’s a lifeline,” Holman said in a news release. “We came to Washington to ensure that the voices of Kansans are being heard by federal lawmakers. The proposed House cuts will undermine Medicaid and put lives at risk.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Screenshot-2025-05-21-at-3.56.09 PM-1024x611.png,,,2025-05-21 19:08:47.319423

Phil Scott and outraged school leaders on education reform, lawmakers see no good options.","Senate President Pro Tempore Phil Baruth, D/P-Chittenden Central, speaks on the floor of the Senate at the Statehouse in Montpelier on Friday, May 16. Photo by Glenn Russell/VTDiggerVermont legislators are struggling with what to do next with a major education reform bill, which Gov. Phil Scott is pushing them to pass this year. Sharp disagreements among lawmakers have emerged in the Vermont Senate over the past week, as education leaders publicly lobby against the chamber’s latest version of legislation. Both chambers of the Legislature and the governor see education reform as a key issue in response to last year’s double-digit average property tax increases. All three have put forward different versions of wide-ranging reforms. The proposal, H.454, was originally slated for a vote on the Senate floor Wednesday after passing out of a key committee last week. But at a tense caucus meeting of the Senate’s Democratic majority Tuesday evening, Senate President Pro Tempore Phil Baruth, D/P-Chittenden Central, pulled the plug on those plans and conceded that a majority of the caucus was not willing to support the current version of the bill, even after taking weeks of testimony. “I made a promise to people in the caucus that I wouldn’t bring a bill that had a little bit of Democratic support and a lot of Republican support,” Baruth said Tuesday. “Currently, that’s the only way that (H.454) would make it through the process — would be for, you know, a handful, at best, of Democrats to support it, and then a majority of Republicans to support it.”Plans were for the education bill to come up for action on the floor Thursday, said Ashley Moore, who is Baruth’s chief of staff, on Wednesday afternoon.Both chambers, and Scott’s administration, have broadly agreed that the state should transition to a new education funding formula and move toward consolidating school districts. But disagreements have developed over the details and the timeline. Moreover, the Senate’s version of the landmark legislation has faced sustained opposition from superintendents across Vermont, who have spoken out en masse against the bill over the last week, either in open letters to community members or in direct communications with lawmakers. At Tuesday’s caucus meeting, one Democratic senator described getting a rash of emails from school officials in her district in recent days condemning legislators’ recent work on the bill. Sen. Ann Cummings, D-Washington, characterized their criticism as almost overwhelming.“I stopped doing emails when I didn’t feel I could bleed anymore,” she said. READ MORE
‘Our children deserve better than this political charade’School leaders have argued that the Senate’s proposed funding model could upend operations at schools across the state, slashing budgets unsustainably for some districts while spiking tax rates in others. “There’s something for everyone to dislike in the legislation,” John Castle, the executive director of the Vermont Rural Education Collaborative, a nonprofit advocacy group representing districts in the Northeast Kingdom, said in an interview. Castle said lawmakers were laboring under a “false narrative” that school consolidation could solve all of the state’s education woes while failing to tackle the root causes of education spending increases, like skyrocketing health care premiums and deferred facility maintenance costs. In a letter sent to members of the Senate Finance Committee last week, Brooke Olsen-Farrell, superintendent of the Slate Valley Unified School District in Rutland County, similarly expressed her concern about the “lack of long-term vision for education in Vermont” included in the Senate’s version of the bill.Although Slate Valley schools would receive an increase in education funding from the proposed spending model, Olsen-Farrell wrote that homeowners in the district could see property tax increases of up to 22%. “The Senate’s version of H.454 does not reflect the values or needs of our students, families, and communities,” Olsen-Farell wrote. “It jeopardizes our ability to deliver equitable educational opportunities and modernize our education system, while placing an untenable financial strain on Vermonters.”Olsen-Farrell’s sentiments were largely shared by superintendents in Franklin County, who collectively panned the Senate proposal in a scathing open letter to community members sent earlier this week.“The latest attempts at school funding reform are a stark reminder of how disconnected the current legislative process is from the realities facing our local districts,” wrote Maple Run superintendent Bill Kimball, Missisquoi Valley superintendent Julie Regimbal,Franklin Northeast superintendent Lynn Cota and Franklin West superintendent John Tague. Noting that the proposed model could yield tax increases of up to 30 percent for some homeowners in Franklin County, the superintendents wrote that the bill would do little to address the “core drivers” of increased education costs.“Until our elected officials demonstrate the courage to confront these fundamental cost drivers and craft equitable solutions, we’re simply rearranging the deck chairs on a sinking ship,” the superintendents wrote. “Our children deserve better than this political charade.”In a letter sent last week to Senate and House leadership, Burlington School District superintendent Tom Flanigan similarly wrote that the Senate version of H.454 would have “deeply harmful impacts” on the district, potentially costing it “many millions of dollars.”In an interview, Flanigan said that, rather than try to rush out a bill this year based on either the Senate or House proposals, legislators should now “take a step back” and consider delivering a more comprehensive, measured plan in the next legislative cycle. “It’s just clear to me that we’re not ready now,” he said. “There are some ideas there, and there is the need for change, but we need the right people at the table to determine what that change looks like and map out a responsible timeline to enact it.”‘Regardless of what bill we vote on, we lose’It’s unclear, though, whether lawmakers will heed that advice, especially with pressure from Gov. Scott to move forward. Baruth said Tuesday there appeared to be more support within the caucus for the House-passed version of H.454, and he proposed making a series of procedural moves on the floor Wednesday that would instead bring up the House language on the Senate floor, and allow senators to amend the language, also on the floor, from that point. Another option, he said, would be for the Senate to take up and pass its own version of the bill — with senators essentially holding their noses — so that the bill could go to a conference committee of House and Senate leaders to work out their differences. Amending the bill on the floor, per Baruth’s other suggestion, could lead to a conference committee being formed, as well. Senators were discussing both of those options on Wednesday, after Baruth postponed the vote, and it wasn’t clear that afternoon which, if either, they would take. Several senators pushed back during Tuesday’s caucus meeting on Baruth’s proposal to rely on floor amendments to alter the bill, saying that wouldn’t give them enough time to thoroughly vet the language being considered. “I get cold chills thinking about making floor amendments to address the biggest change that we can get to the entire education tax system,” said Sen. Nader Hashim, D-Windham.“To do a floor amendment on something that complicated — where we don’t have the time to really think about all the implications — is kind of scary to me,” added Sen. Ruth Hardy, D-Addison. She called the Senate’s work on the bill “infuriating.”It wasn’t clear at the end of Tuesday’s hour-and-a-half meeting whether the caucus would come to any agreement on the proposal. Hardy suggested the Senate send H.454 back to a committee for further consideration and, potentially, not pass an education reform bill at all this year. “It sounds like regardless of what bill we vote on, we lose,” said Sen. Ginny Lyons, D-Chittenden Southeast. “We put the House bill up, we lose. We put the Senate bill up, we lose.”But it’s possible Scott won’t let that happen. At his weekly press conference Wednesday, he urged legislators to get a version of the bill to the point of a conference committee to work out the House and Senate’s disagreements. He added, too, that he would use his power to call legislators back into session after they’ve adjourned for the year if they do not pass an education reform bill first. Baruth had indicated at Tuesday’s caucus meeting Scott would do that. “I’ll call them back — and we’ll keep calling them back — until we get something accomplished,” Scott said. “We can’t go home without this transformation.”Read the story on VTDigger here:  Stuck between Gov.

Fred Eshelman's legal team asked for more time to petition the nation’s high court to take up the long-contested legal matter.
The post Ranch owner wants U.S. Supreme Court to hear corner-crossing case appeared first on WyoFile .","The Elk Mountain ranch owner at the center of Wyoming’s closely watched corner crossing case is preparing an appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court, new filings show.
Lawyers for Fred Eshelman asked the nation’s highest court Wednesday for a 30-day extension to file a petition seeking Supreme Court review of the case. At stake, they wrote, is “one of the broadest abrogations of private property rights in American history.”
Eshelman, through his company Iron Bar Holdings, sued four hunters in 2022, alleging they trespassed on his Elk Mountain Ranch when they passed through the airspace of his property while traveling to hunt on public land. The hunters were corner crossing — stepping from one piece of public land to another where those two parcels meet at a common corner with two private parcels, all arranged in a checkerboard pattern of ownership. They did not step on private land.
The appeals court used this graphic to depict corner crossing. (IU.S. 10th Circuit Court of Appeals)
Eshelman, a wealthy North Carolina pharmaceutical executive, lost his federal suit in 2023, but appealed the matter to the U.S. 10th Circuit in Denver. A three-judge panel sided with the hunters in March. Iron Bar was given until June 16 to appeal.
Now, Iron Bar wants an additional 30 days to file a petition seeking U.S. Supreme Court review of the case.
“This case raises exceptionally important issues at the intersection of private property rights and public access that warrant this Court’s review,” Iron Bar attorney Robert Reeves Anderson wrote in his application.
“The Tenth Circuit’s decision has vast reach, covering a huge portion of the roughly 300 million acres of checkerboard land and affecting landowners throughout the American West,” he added.
The 10th Circuit ruling unsettled a long-established understanding that corner crossing constitutes an unlawful trespass, the lawyer wrote.
“This area of confusion and disagreement must be resolved to provide clarity to landowners and hunters alike,” Anderson wrote.
An extension would give Iron Bar lawyers time to “fully prepare the petition” to the high court while also handling a number of other pending matters, Anderson wrote. He did not immediately respond Wednesday to a voicemail and email seeking comment. 
Lengthy legal battle
The hunters — Bradly Cape, Phillip Yeomans, Zachary Smith and John Slowensky — corner crossed to hunt on Elk Mountain, where Eshelman owns a 22,000-acre ranch. Carbon County Prosecutor Ashley Mayfield Davis charged the men with criminal trespass but they were found not guilty by a local jury.
The federal civil lawsuit followed, but the men again prevailed — first at the district court level, and later in the 10th Circuit. Their attorney, Ryan Semerad of Casper, said Wednesday they were prepared for the additional legal battle ahead.
“Mr. Cape, Mr. Slowensky, Mr. Smith, Mr. Yeomans, and our legal team stand ready to keep fighting for and defending public access to public lands,” Semerad told WyoFile.

Public land advocates cheered the quartet’s 10th Circuit victory. But Semerad, earlier this month, urged outdoor enthusiasts to exercise caution and goodwill if they attempt to corner cross.
“It doesn’t mean you get to go on private property without permission, consent or something else,” Semerad said during a May 1 panel discussion in Laramie. “What it means is that you have reasonable access to step from one section to the next section, so long as you can be situated appropriately, you know where the monument marker is, you know where you’re going and you respect that.”

(Photo by Emma Murphy/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — With bipartisan support, House lawmakers on Wednesday sent a series of altered education rules to the governor that eliminate the requirements for public schools to collect proof of U.S. citizenship and for teachers to pass the U.S. Naturalization Test.
Lawmakers unanimously approved Senate Joint Resolution 22, which now heads to Gov. Kevin Stitt. The Republican has repeatedly vowed to block efforts by the state Department of Education to require schools to collect the immigration status of children.
With the same measure, lawmakers also rejected a rule requiring all public school teachers to pass a written version of the U.S. Naturalization Test to earn or renew their certifications. 
Rep. Molly Jenkins, R-Coyle, attempted to amend the measure to reinstate the controversial immigration rule, but it failed 75-12. 
Under the rule backed by state Superintendent Ryan Walters, districts would have been required to report to the state the number of children unable to verify U.S. citizenship or legal residency. The Republican said it would help schools accurately provide the resources needed to serve those students, but also said he would turn over such information to federal immigration authorities if asked.
Jenkins said the amendment would have collected “aggregate” data, not any individual student names, and would help to better allocate funding throughout Oklahoma public schools. 
Opponents on both sides of the aisle said the rule was unenforceable. The numbers could still be traced to students and could create a strain on the public school system, they said. Schools already provide services to immigrant students without requiring proof of citizenship. 
Rep. Gerrid Kendrix, R-Altus, said the immigration rule does not have statutory authority. Kendrix, the measure’s author, said the process is about ensuring the rules have statute backing them up, not about policy. 
State agencies are supposed to create rules that expand on existing law relating to the policy. The Legislature and the governor then review every agency’s rules and can accept or reject them. If approved, the rules have the force of law. 
The same measure also passed the Senate unanimously.

,DC,2025-05-21 22:27:06+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,U.S. House GOP revamps giant budget bill in bid to appease hard right,"Jennifer Shutt, Ashley Murray",,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-house-gop-revamps-giant-budget-bill-bid-appease-hard-right,,"This report has been updated.WASHINGTON — U.S. House Republican leaders released changes to their “one big beautiful bill” late Wednesday after marathon negotiations with conservatives demanding deeper cuts to safety net programs, teeing up debate and a final vote likely sometime Thursday.The alterations, which will have to be adopted later, moved up implementation of work requirements for Medicaid by at least a couple of years and tossed out plans to sell some public lands. The new language also tightened the timeline for clean energy tax breaks and raised the ceiling for taxpayers who deduct state and local taxes.The package of adjustments — the manager’s amendment — must pass a House committee and then a procedural vote on the floor before lawmakers can take a final vote on the reconciliation deal.With a razor-thin margin, House Speaker Mike Johnson can only lose a handful of members on each vote. Democrats are expected to uniformly vote “no” in the procedural and final votes.MedicaidRepublicans moved up implementation of work requirements for Medicaid enrollees from taking effect after January 1, 2029 to no later than December 31, 2026. That could mean some states will make the changes before next year’s midterm elections.The provision would require those who rely on the state-federal health program for lower-income Americans and some people with disabilities, who are between the ages of 19 and 65, to work, participate in community service, or attend an educational program at least 80 hours a month.The language has numerous exceptions, including for pregnant people, parents of dependent children, people who have complex medical conditions, tribal community members, people in the foster system, people who were in the foster system who are below the age of 26 and people released from incarceration in the last 90 days, among others.The GOP changes also would bar Medicaid from covering gender transition procedures for anyone in the program. The bill previously barred that type of treatment for anyone below the age of 18.Clean energy tax creditsRepublicans also tightened the timeline on the termination of clean energy tax credits enacted under President Joe Biden. Hardliners focused on reducing the deficit had demanded a quicker phase-out for the credits.The new language would accelerate phase-outs for clean energy investment tax credits to 2028, up from 2031, with special carve-outs for nuclear facilities. Companies that break ground on new facilities 60 days after the bill is enacted, if passed, will not qualify for the tax credits. The same applies to any facility placed into service after 2028.State and local taxesA separate contingent of Republican holdouts reached a deal with Johnson to raise the SALT cap to $40,000, up from the $10,000 lid enacted under the 2017 tax law. The SALT cap  — the amount of state and local taxes constituents can deduct from federal taxable income — is a top issue for Republicans who represent districts in high-tax blue states, including California, New Jersey and New York.The amount of SALT taxpayers can deduct decreases for those making more than $500,000 annually. The SALT cap and the income cut-off will increase by 1% each year from 2027 until 2033.Public lands saleThe amendment removed language that would have allowed the sale of public lands in Nevada and Utah.The National Wildlife Federation credited Montana Republican Rep. Ryan Zinke with removing the provision.“Thank you to Rep. Ryan Zinke and his colleagues who listened to their constituents and worked with House leaders to eliminate the provision from the budget reconciliation bill,” NWF Associate Vice President for Public Lands David Wilms said in a statement. “We urge all members of Congress to refrain from similar attacks on America’s public lands.”Jessica Turner, president of the Outdoor Recreation Roundtable, wrote in a statement that ""Congress avoided setting a dangerous precedent that lands can be sold anytime the U.S. Treasury needs a budget ‘pay-for’ and threatening outdoor recreation businesses and rural communities alike that need certainty, access, and long-term infrastructure.""The Center for Biological Diversity’s Great Basin Director Patrick Donnelly wrote in a separate statement that it was ""appalling that GOP leaders tried to get away with auctioning off some of our country’s most beautiful landscapes to fund tax cuts for billionaires and make developers richer. This is Gilded Age-level stuff, and I hope people remember it the next time Republicans try to pretend they care about public lands.”A separate provision in the amendment appeared to narrow the federal authorizations energy projects could bypass by paying a $10 million fee. The section had been attacked by environmental groups as a “pay-to-play” for energy companies.White House meetingThe changes come after Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, and far-right holdouts huddled with President Donald Trump at the White House Wednesday afternoon.Johnson, speaking to reporters at the Capitol following the meeting, said that lawmakers had “a good discussion” and that he believes the GOP is “in a very good place.”“I think that all of our colleagues here will really like this final product, and I think we're going to move forward,” Johnson said.Johnson said members of the Freedom Caucus, who previously argued the legislation doesn’t go far enough to restructure Medicaid and reduce federal spending, may end up supporting the bill, in part because Trump plans to address their other concerns through unilateral actions.“You will see how all this is resolved. But I think we can resolve their concerns and it'll be probably some combination of work by the president in these areas as well as here in Congress,” Johnson said. “So there may be executive orders related to some of these issues in the near future.“And, you know, this is a commitment the president has made. He wants to go after fraud, waste and abuse.”White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt released a written statement saying the “meeting was productive and moved the ball in the right direction.“The President reiterated how critical it is for the country to pass the One Big Beautiful Bill as quickly as possible.”Complex processRepublicans are using the complex reconciliation process to move the package through Congress with simple majority votes in each chamber, avoiding the Senate’s 60-vote legislative filibuster, which would otherwise require bipartisanship.Reconciliation measures must address federal revenue, spending, or the debt limit in a way not deemed “merely incidental” by the Senate parliamentarian. That means the GOP proposals must carry some sort of price tag and cannot focus simply on changing federal policy.Republicans are using the package to extend the 2017 tax law, increase spending on border security and defense by hundreds of billions of dollars, overhaul American energy production, restructure higher education aid and cut spending on Medicaid.A new Congressional Budget Office analysis released late Tuesday projected the massive reconciliation package would decrease resources for low-income families over the next decade while increasing resources for top earners.Freedom CaucusEarlier Wednesday, members of the Freedom Caucus told reporters following a different meeting with Johnson that they believed negotiations were moving in the right direction, but were skeptical of trying to approve the entire package this week.Maryland Republican Rep. Andy Harris, chairman of the group, said they wanted the legislation to go further in terms of addressing “waste, fraud and abuse” within Medicaid, though he declined to elaborate.The Medicaid proposals in the version of the bill prior to the negotiated changes would cut $625 billion in federal spending during the next decade, under a CBO analysis. Democrats have warned the result would be millions of vulnerable people losing access to the health program for lower income people and some people with disabilities.Texas Republican Rep. Chip Roy said during that same impromptu press conference that leadership and members of the Freedom Caucus had made “significant progress” toward a final agreement.“We're trying to deliver so that the people who are actually out there working hard can actually get the health care that they want to get, that they can get, and get it the best way possible,” Roy said. “That's what this is all about; changing a broken system, making sure we're saving taxpayer dollars and being able to provide a better environment for people to be able to thrive.”Pennsylvania Republican Rep. Scott Perry, who used to chair the Freedom Caucus, said that holding a House vote before Memorial Day was a made-up timeline and that if negotiations needed to last longer, they should.“This is a completely arbitrary deadline set by people here to force people into a corner to make bad decisions,” Perry said. “It's more important to get this right, to get it correct, than to get it fast.

Michelle Lujan Grisham, top right, joined other Democratic governors in Michigan and Kansas to decry the proposed Medicaid cuts. (Screenshot from DGA Zoom call)New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham on Wednesday called on Congress to halt its effort to cut Medicaid, joining a handful of other Democratic governors to decry the cuts as a giveaway to the ultra-wealthy on the backs of the working poor.
As Lujan Grisham noted in the call with the Democratic Governors of America, 840,000 New Mexicans are on Medicaid, which is more than 40% of the state. That’s the highest per capita rate of Medicaid coverage in the country, according to recent estimates. 
In addition to people losing their healthcare, she predicted the cuts would spell the closure of several hundred hospitals nationwide. In New Mexico, which already faces healthcare shortages particularly in rural areas, that will result in less access to care, she said.
“That means you’re driving not one hour or two hours for care,” she said. “It means that you’re likely driving four or five hours for care.”
NM reps say GOP bill will gut Medicaid and also reduce oil money that could help state save it

According to estimates from the Congressional Budget Office, more than 10 million people would lose Medicaid coverage by 2030 under the current version of the spending bill making its way through Congress. 
The bill also would impose work requirements for those receiving Medicaid. The other Democratic governors on the call, including Jared Polis of Colorado, Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan and Laura Kelly of Kansas, had slightly different takes on what the work requirements could mean. 
Polis, for example, said the American people would be fortunate if Medicaid work requirements emerged as the worst thing to come out of Congress, so long as states had flexibility in how to administer it. 
Lujan Grisham spoke up after Polis’ comment, saying that Medicaid work requirements are “tried, not true,” and would ultimately impose a heavy administrative burden on states without spurring an increase in employment.
“You have many working poor people on minimum wage in any of our states, whether that’s a state minimum wage or the federal wage, it’s not enough to afford health insurance,” she said. “This notion that you’ve got all these folks who aren’t working, who willingly choose that, is also a false narrative.”
The governors expressed alarm at the proposed cuts, and said their states can’t afford them. A recent state estimate said New Mexico received nearly $9 billion for Medicaid in 2024. That’s equal to more than 80% of the state’s newly passed, record operational budget of $10.8 billion.
“We want every American to understand what this really means, and not let Congress off the hook in the dark of night to cut a backroom deal with this president on the backs of working American families, on the backs of New Mexico working families,” Lujan Grisham said. “Let’s tell Congress what we think of these outrageous cuts to basic necessities for everyday, hardworking families.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Screen-Shot-2025-05-21-at-2.50.39-PM-1024x597.png,,,2025-05-21 19:08:47.319423

This year, advocates didn’t bother consulting with Gov. Dan McKee’s office for feedback prior to unveiling proposed changes to the Access to Public Records Act. Instead, they made the case directly to lawmakers, and the public, at a State House press conference Wednesday, one day before an initial Senate panel hearing on the legislation.
“Last year, we made a number of changes after dozens of meetings with the administration, and we still got opposition,” said John Marion, executive director of Common Cause Rhode Island. “We didn’t want to compromise against ourselves this year.”
Indeed, the companion bills introduced by Sen. Lou DiPalma, a Middletown Democrat, and Rep. Pat Serpa, a West Warwick Democrat, are nearly identical to the sweeping set of reforms pitched during the 2024 session. The bills failed to advance out of committee in either chamber last year, buried in a mountain of objections by state agencies.
Scott Pickering, publisher of East Bay Media Group and president of ACCESS/RI, called the administration’s past concerns “exaggerated” and “intended to create fear.”
“I don’t buy it,” Pickering said of arguments that the proposed reforms burdened state agencies and  jeopardized sensitive information. “Look at the groups supporting it. These are not radical groups hoping to undermine the government. These are groups devoted to the best interests of our democracy with noble intentions rooted in the public interest.”
Supporters also include the American Civil Liberties Union of Rhode Island, the New England First Amendment Coalition, the League of Women Voters of Rhode Island and the Rhode Island Press Association, of which Rhode Island Current is a member.
McKee’s office did not respond to inquiries for comment Wednesday.
Despite Pickering’s adamant refusal to kowtow to “scare tactics,” one new addition this year aims to assuage objections by municipalities. Among the 48 proposed amendments to the 1978 law — last updated in 2012  — is a section addressing “vexatious requests.” The caveat weeds out requests intended to “disrupt government operations,” authorizing the chief administrator of any public body subject to open records laws to seek a Rhode Island Superior Court order exempting them from fulfilling a records request.
Across the country, and in Rhode Island, public bodies are seeing records requests for no other reason than to take them away from their regular duties. Marion referred to a coordinated effort on the heels of the 2020 election to bombard local elections officials with requests about voting equipment, with the intent to “gum up the works of election offices around the country.”
DiPalma stressed the “fine line” between nuisance requests and those with good intentions, but noted that the proposed bill still requires public bodies to proceed with filling “vexatious” requests if and until a court orders otherwise. Under the proposed legislation, anyone who obtains records through a request later determined to be vexatious will have to reimburse the public body for the time and cost to complete the task.
Reducing fees, adding clarity 
Much of the remaining reforms, however, aim to make it easier, and more affordable, for the public to request and obtain various forms of public information, including body camera footage, traffic accident data and investigations into police misconduct.
“We’re really here to make sure members of the public have access to public information without having to pay burdensome costs, and when the government withholds it, they do it for a good reason,” said Michael McDermott, a board member for ACCESS/RI.
For example, the reform bill clarifies that university police departments given power to make arrests are subject to the same public disclosure of arrest records as other public law enforcement groups. Brown University’s police department has argued it is exempt from the state public records law, said Steven Brown, executive director for the RI ACLU. 
Another paragraph specifies that traffic accident data is subject to public records laws, reflecting the Rhode Island Department of Transportation’s use of existing loopholes to refuse to provide crash data requested by community advocates with the Providence Streets Coalition.
Other changes reflect modern technology which was nonexistent, or at least less heavily relied upon, when the law was last updated more than a decade ago. Police body camera footage is among the new types of records that would be added to the law under the legislation, as well as text messages and emails sent in official government capacity — previously exempt but now subject to sharing unless they are unrelated to official government business. Another nod to the shift to the digital age: requiring public bodies to upload any documents related to their meetings online beforehand, like a contract for a new hire or a proposed policy change.
The proposal also reduces the cost charged for locating and sharing public records — increasing the number of free hours of work from one to two hours while cutting the cost-per-page for copies of information from 15 to five cents. And it specifies that fees for records requests “shall” be waived if the person requesting them can demonstrate the information is of public interest. The existing law offers the option that fees “may” be waived for public interest reasons.
Several tweaks aim to head off privacy concerns voiced by state agencies during the 2024 session hearings, narrowing the scope of medical records subject to public disclosure, for example, and allowing identifying information in police misconduct reports to be redacted to protect privacy.
Charlie Galligan, a criminal defense private investigator, was optimistic that the amendments would pass muster with McKee’s office.
“I can only imagine [the amendments have] addressed concerns and removed concerns by Governor McKee and other entities that have objected to previous versions of this legislation,” Galligan said.
New Senate leaders on board
DiPalma was less certain of the administration’s viewpoint, but pointed to the change in Senate leadership as a potential advantage; newly elected Senate President Valarie Lawson and Senate Majority Leader Frank Ciccone are both co-sponsors on the Senate bill. The bill is scheduled to have a first hearing before the Senate Committee on Judiciary Thursday night.
“As a former history teacher, I am very mindful of the importance of robust public records laws to the strength of our democracy, and to maintaining public trust,” Lawson said in an emailed statement Wednesday. “I am grateful to Senator DiPalma for his passion and his tireless work on this issue. When concerns were raised with previous versions of this proposal, Chairman DiPalma worked to bring parties together and address those concerns. Subsequent to the Senate hearing tomorrow evening, I will review the testimony regarding this year’s version of the bill with an open mind.”
House Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi, however, noted past opposition from the administration, without taking a position on the bill either way.
“I look forward to reviewing Senator DiPalma’s amended language after his bill is heard in the Senate,” Shekarchi said in an emailed statement Wednesday.
A hearing on the House companion bill has also not been scheduled as of Wednesday.

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch)Farmers with Modern Ag Alliance, a coalition that has been pushing for the adoption of pesticide labeling policies that would make it more difficult to build cancer-related lawsuits against pesticides, fear the impact of an upcoming “Make America Healthy Again” report they believe will target pesticides. 
The farmers said on a press call Wednesday an attack on pesticide chemicals, specifically mentioning glyphosate in the widely used Roundup herbicide, would be “a terrible development for American agriculture” and lead to higher food costs for the American consumer. 
U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. testified Tuesday to U.S. senators and said there is not a “single word” in his agency’s upcoming report that “should worry the American farmer.” 
Scott Henry, a farmer from central Iowa, was not persuaded by the secretary’s remarks. He noted Kennedy’s past as an environmental law attorney who said, several years ago, he believed hog farmers were worse than Osama bin Laden. 
“I think it’s hard to have been compared to al Qaeda in the past and then be told that I’m a partner now,” Henry said.
Henry said if the report, which is anticipated to be released Thursday, contains anti-glyphosate guidance, and policymakers follow suit, it will cause commodity yields to drop, prices to increase and food inflation to “more than double.” 
A report on the impact of a farm bill that doesn’t allow the use of glyphosate found that consumer food inflation would increase 2.4 times. 
“The biggest thing that I want to make clear today is that if the MAHA commission’s report drives future policy decisions, food prices will go up, and instead of making America healthy again, we’ll be making America hungry again,” Henry said. 
Modern Ag Alliance reports input prices for farmers could more than double without access to glyphosate. Henry said these costs would be passed up the supply chain and to consumers. 
“The American farmer still has the best interest of the consumer in mind,” Henry said. “We want them to buy food, we want it to be cheap, we want it to be safe, because don’t forget, we feed our children these same products. So for somebody to tell us that we don’t care about them is a true slap in the face.” 
An executive order from President Donald Trump in February created the Make America Healthy Again commission and tasked it with developing a “Make our Children Healthy Again Assessment” to evaluate the chemicals, pharmaceuticals, food ingredients and other factors that contribute to childhood chronic disease in the country. 
Kennedy has spoken publicly in the past about glyphosate and alleged the common weed-killing chemical causes cancer and other health concerns. 
Roundup’s manufacturer, Bayer, holds that the product is safe to use, as does the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency which reviews and certifies pesticides in the country. 
The company, however, has spent billions defending lawsuits in which plaintiffs allege the product gave them cancer. This led the company to partner with ag groups through Modern Ag Alliance and push for state legislation across the country, including in Iowa this year and last, to block lawsuits built on failure to warn claims. 
The bill did not advance through the House in Iowa, but has been signed into law in both North Dakota and Georgia.  
Modern Ag Alliance promoted the legislation, largely through ad campaigns. Elizabeth Burns-Thompson, the executive director of the alliance, said the attention to the MAHA report is much like the push for state policy on the issue. 
“No different than how we have been trying to work proactively in many of the state legislative chambers on providing clarity and consistency so that farmers have these tools available today, and in the future, we see similar themes here and why we’re working towards it at the federal level,” Burns-Thompson said. 
Henry said the report itself might not have a direct effect, but could lead to “shifts in policy” that would send farming back to the practices of his grandfather. 
“Today, hundreds of people can eat because of one individual farmer’s efforts, and it’s all due to tools like glyphosate and Roundup that allow us to do more with less and make safe, clean, affordable food available,” Henry said.

SPRINGFIELD — The Senate passed a bill on Wednesday that adds new anti-bias education requirements for providers of maternal health services.

The measure is aimed at combating maternal mortality in marginalized groups. If signed into law, it would mandate providers receive one hour of training prior to renewing a state license, starting in July 2026. The Senate passed the bill on a 44-12 vote, following its passage 82-29 in the House in April. It needs only a signature from Gov. JB Pritzker to become law.

The training required by House Bill 2517 would educate providers on historic racial discrepancies in maternal care in an effort to reduce implicit biases among providers. Health care professionals would be allowed to count completion of the course toward minimum continuing education requirements.

“As a country, the United States is the most dangerous place to give birth in the developed world, and it’s three times as dangerous for Black people,” said Kelly Hubbard, director of policy and advocacy at EverThrive Illinois, where she works to advocate for optimal maternal health policies. That statistic comes from the Illinois Department of Public Health’s 2023 Maternal Morbidity and Mortality Report.

Compared to white women in America who died at a rate of 14.5 deaths per 100,000 live births in 2023, Black women died at a rate of 50.3 out of 100,000 live births, according to the most recent data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Kimberly Collier, president of the National Coalition of 100 Black Women, Chicago Metropolitan Chapter, compared this level of mortality to the Middle Ages, when women had significantly higher maternal mortality rates.

“Childbirth killed women,” Collier said. “We’re not living in that world. But Black women are.”

Marianne Gray, a registered nurse who has a doctorate in education, came to Springfield to support the bill through its passage in the Senate Licensed Activities Committee earlier this month. She said part of the problem is that caregivers often do not listen to the health concerns of Black women.

“The moms need to be heard, and if a mom tells you, ‘I don’t feel well,’ or ‘something’s wrong,’ you can’t shrug that mom off and not listen to them,” Gray said. “And that happens.”

Gray spoke from her firsthand experience as a Black mother, recounting how during the birth of her first son, her providers did not listen when she said she felt the baby pushing. The baby came earlier than providers expected, resulting in her husband missing the birth of their first son.

The proposed law would mandate that health care professionals working on maternal health services and seeking to renew their license through the Illinois Department of Financial and Professional Regulation take one hour of training in implicit bias awareness prior to renewal. The training for prenatal and postnatal care providers should include information about potential risk factors for childbearing individuals in marginalized racial or ethnic groups with higher maternal mortality rates.

Part of the issue, advocates say, is the historical misconception within the medical field that Black people have a higher pain threshold or do not feel pain as acutely as others.

One example of such medical racism is that of J. Marion Sims, often called the “father of modern gynecology,” who conducted painful experimental surgeries on enslaved Black women without anesthesia.

“There is a mistrust,” Gray said, referencing the history of unethical medical testing on Black people. “A lot of times people in underserved communities, they don’t trust health care providers who don’t look like them.”

Rep. Lisa Davis, D-Chicago, introduced the bill in the House. Like Gray, Davis spoke from her own experience as a Black mother.

“When it comes to Black moms, sometimes those generalizations and attitudes can possibly have lethal consequences,” Davis said. “If a Black mom is complaining about pain, that could be ignored, and maybe something is going on with the baby.”

While pregnant with her first son, Davis was past due to deliver. She did not want to induce birth, but rather to let him arrive naturally, she said. She developed a plan with her primary OB-GYN provider, a Black woman who respected her wishes not to induce.

In a follow-up visit, Davis said her usual prenatal provider was unavailable, so she saw someone else, a white woman. Davis felt this woman to be less sensitive of her wishes, telling Davis she should schedule an induction.

Then, Davis said, the provider checked her cervix in a rough manner that caused Davis pain. When Davis expressed her discomfort, the woman told her the pain was common. After the visit, Davis realized her water had broken. She went to the hospital, where they kept her until she gave birth the next day.

Whether or not it was the outcome the provider intended, Davis said the interaction left her wondering if her race was the reason the provider seemed not to be attentive or listen to her concerns.

Lauren Sayah, a senior research specialist at the University of Illinois Chicago Center for Research on Women and Gender, said she hopes the training will make providers more aware of their own biases.

“Having health care providers learn about those biases and misconceptions will likely help them hopefully see their patients first as human,” Sayah said.

Sayah added that the training will help educate providers on the other social factors affecting maternal health outcomes for people of color. Access to healthy neighborhoods, green spaces, healthy food and affordable housing are all important aspects of “culturally competent health care,” Sayah said.

The measure passed the House with bipartisan support despite opposition from most of the Republican caucus. Senate sponsor Willie Preston, D-Chicago, said he believes the bill will make a difference in the experiences of mothers.

“Black women in Illinois are three times more likely to die from pregnancy related causes than white women. This is simply not acceptable, and it's not a mystery,” Preston said Wednesday during Senate floor debate. “It’s about how people are treated, who gets listened to and whether their pain is believed. This bill doesn’t ask for a heavy lift. It asks for awareness. It asks for education.”

Under the measure, the Illinois Department of Financial and Professional Regulation will be responsible for developing the curriculum, but Sayah said she hoped the department would consult with community members when designing the training materials, which she said “adds value and is necessary in the influence of their care.”

Collier said the National Coalition of 100 Black Women is “ready to help with implementation” if the department is interested in partnering on curriculum development.

Although advocates said this bill is not a silver bullet that will fix the racial disparity in maternal health outcomes, many said it was a step forward that brought them hope.

“The war is not over, but this battle has been won,” Collier said. “And I think it is okay for us to be excited, be happy, to check it off and to celebrate the wins, because we have a long fight ahead of us.”

(Photo by Ariana Figueroa/States Newsroom)South Dakota’s governor and attorney general separately visited the U.S.-Mexico border this week and announced efforts to involve the state in federal immigration enforcement.
During a news conference Wednesday with a coalition of Republican attorneys general in Arizona, Attorney General Marty Jackley said he has authorized the South Dakota Division of Criminal Investigation, which he oversees, to pursue a 287(g) agreement with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. The federal agency is within the Department of Homeland Security led by former South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem.

(Joshua Haiar/South Dakota Searchlight)

The agreement would allow state agents, after receiving federal training, to “identify, process, and detain individuals for immigration violations they encounter during their regular law enforcement activities,” the Attorney General’s Office wrote in a press release.
“I applaud and encourage the Trump administration to continue its efforts to close this border and to enforce our immigration laws across the United States,” Jackley said.
Meanwhile, South Dakota Gov. Larry Rhoden was in Eagle Pass, Texas, on Tuesday visiting South Dakota National Guard soldiers from the 109th Engineer Battalion. They’re on a yearlong federal deployment as part of “Operation International Drug Trafficking.” Their duties include supporting U.S. Customs and Border Protection.
Following his visit, Rhoden announced Wednesday that he sent a letter of intent to Noem requesting a 287(g) agreement for the South Dakota Highway Patrol, which is part of the Department of Public Safety in Rhoden’s executive branch.
Rhoden’s letter specifies that he is requesting a task force model agreement, which would allow trained officers to enforce immigration laws during their regular patrols or investigations. The Obama administration discontinued the model in 2012 due to concerns over potential civil rights abuses arising from local and state law enforcement officers stopping people on the street and inquiring about their immigration status. The Trump administration revived the task force model this year.

American Civil Liberties Union of South Dakota spokeswoman Jana Farley said in a statement that 287(g) agreements have led to racial profiling, civil rights abuses and diverted resources from state and local law enforcement.
“Most of us can agree that the federal government needs to do much better on immigration policy and identify real solutions that are orderly, humane and fair,” she said. “Instead of imposing the federal government’s wishes upon every community in South Dakota, we encourage local control and support the right of local law enforcement to put the needs of their communities first by declining to participate in unnecessary, voluntary immigration enforcement.”
Taneeza Islam, CEO of South Dakota Voices for Peace, which advocates for immigrants, said the state’s pursuit of 287(g) agreements puts “politics over the best interests of South Dakota.” She predicted negative consequences.
“Victims of crimes will be scared to call law enforcement in fear of deportation. Labor and sex trafficking will increase as the perpetrators will leverage ICE working with law enforcement over their victims,” she said.
Rhoden, who is serving the remainder of Noem’s term after she resigned to serve in the Trump Cabinet, and Jackley, who ran unsuccessfully for governor in 2018, are both frequently mentioned as potential candidates for governor next year. Both are Republicans.
The announcements from both state leaders come amid an increase in immigration enforcement actions within South Dakota. Earlier this month, federal agents arrested eight immigrants in Madison for allegedly using fraudulent documents to gain employment. As of last week, more than two dozen people were being held in South Dakota jails for immigration matters.
Two local South Dakota jurisdictions have already signed 287(g) agreements. Minnehaha County Sheriff Mike Milstead and Hughes County Sheriff Patrick Callahan both signed on earlier this spring. The counties are participating in the warrant service officer program. It allows local jail staff to serve ICE-issued immigration warrants on inmates already in custody for other criminal charges, negating the need for ICE officers to serve those warrants themselves.

(Matt Weiner/Rapid City Journal)Luckily for Priya Saxena, Jim Leach doesn’t like bullies.
Saxena is a citizen of India who collected her doctoral degree in chemical and biological engineering from South Dakota Mines in Rapid City on May 10. Just one month earlier, she was facing revocation of her F-1 student visa and the very real threat of deportation, thanks to President Donald Trump and his Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem, the former governor of South Dakota. 
Apparently, Noem or someone who works for her believed that a four-year-old traffic violation was a good enough reason to deport Saxena and disrupt her hopes for post-doctoral work here in the United States.   
Leach is a Rapid City attorney who decided to represent Saxena in a lawsuit against Noem to prevent that from happening. 
Why?  
Because he believes due process under the law is essential. Because he knows democracy is worth protecting. Because he doesn’t like bullies. Because Priya Saxena needed his help. And because somebody had to.
International student recounts ‘numb’ feeling after receiving email about her potential deportation

Saxena was one of more than a thousand legally admitted international students who were suddenly targeted for potential deportation because of a check of their criminal records, or because the Trump administration didn’t like their participation in protests against the war in Gaza.
“I think it’s outrageous what this administration did to these students, and as soon as I looked at it, I discovered it was completely lawless,” Leach said. “That’s the modus operandi of this administration – lawlessness. In trying to get what they want, they have been lawless.”
Ever since Trump’s second inauguration and the blizzard of executive orders that followed it, I have put my faith in the power of the American legal system to be a bulwark of due process against presidential power run amok. I believe that our judicial system – and all those judges who demand that we stand when they enter a courtroom, want to be called “Your Honor,” and have a deep and abiding faith in the rule of law – may be the only thing that will prevent Trump and his cronies from dismantling our Constitution and trampling on the rights it guarantees.  
Many days, it feels like that belief hangs by a thin thread. But this past week my faith was rewarded, and my belief strengthened, thanks to the trio of U.S. District Court Judge Karen Schreier, Saxena and Leach.  
Schreier ruled that for now, Saxena has the right to stay in the U.S. under the terms of her F-1 visa. The judge basically told Noem, in no uncertain terms, to leave Saxena alone and let her continue to pursue her educational and employment goals. The temporary order secures Saxena’s status while the lawsuit proceeds. Leach immediately followed up with a request for a similar, permanent order, which Schreier will consider next.
Saxena and another lawyer who helps her with immigration matters have since submitted a work authorization application. Saxena hopes to do post-doctorate work in her field of expertise here in the U.S. for the next three years. 
Kudos to Schreier for issuing a preliminary injunction that protects Saxena’s status. Bigger kudos to Leach, who took Saxena’s case pro bono, meaning he’s providing his legal services free of charge to his client, with a possibility but no guarantee that the judge will order the other side to cover his fees and costs. 
At 73, Leach is a rarity – a sole practitioner who still loves the work and is financially able to do it for free if needed. He takes cases that interest him, including violations of free speech, public access and civil rights, and he counts himself lucky to do so.  
“I love what I do,” he said. “It’s a great privilege to do this work.”

Recently, Leach lost nearly $20,000 in fees and costs for his work representing a ballot question committee against petition restrictions imposed by Lawrence County. A district court awarded the money, but the legal basis for that award was wiped out by a new U.S. Supreme Court precedent established in February. 
All three Trump-nominated justices supported the Lackey v. Stinnie decision. It addresses cases that are resolved with a preliminary order, like the Lawrence County case, in which the county reversed course without the need for a permanent order. The Supreme Court ruled that plaintiffs in those circumstances aren’t truly “prevailing parties” and therefore don’t qualify for court-awarded attorney fees. 
Leach knows that “to fight illegal action by the government, you need a lawyer.” So it comes as no surprise to him that justices appointed by Trump would weaken the pro bono system that helps provide access to the courts for people without resources.  
“I will stand up to bullies,” he said. “And this is the ultimate bully.” 
Pro bono is short for the Latin phrase “pro bono publico,” which translates as “for the people’s good.”

(Wisconsin Examiner photo)SEIU Wisconsin and Meriter hospital management confirmed Wednesday plans to meet on Thursday, May 29 to resume negotiation on a new contract covering about 950 nurses.
Talks ended Monday without an agreement, and the union said it would go forward on Tuesday, May 27, with a five-day strike.
On Wednesday, however, the two parties gave contradictory accounts of the conclusion of their talks and the prospect of further negotiations before the walkout begins.
In Meriter’s initial statement on Tuesday after the strike was announced, the hospital reported that a bargaining session was scheduled for Monday, May 26.
In a statement Wednesday, however, the union bargaining committee said they had never scheduled talks for that day.
UnityPoint Health-Meriter issued an updated statement Wednesday asserting that “SEIU Wisconsin notified Meriter on Tuesday that they are no longer available to meet on May 26 and are now offering May 29 as their first available date to resume negotiations.”
The management statement quoted Meriter’s vice president of human resources Shana Wuebben: “SEIU Wisconsin has declined the bargaining session previously set for Monday, May 26 and has rescheduled bargaining sessions to Thursday, May 29 near the end of the 5-day strike period,” Wuebben said.
The bargaining committee flatly disputed the characterization that the Monday date had been agreed to.
“There was no agreement between the parties to meet on Monday May 26,” the committee’s statement said.
In the hospital’s statement, Wuebben said, “Meriter is listening. We have made great strides in our proposals and tentative agreements to date.  And we are ready to continue bargaining.”  
The union, however, charged that management — not the union — was responsible for ending the talks Monday.
“At our last bargaining session on Monday May 19, the union bargaining committee offered to stay as late as needed to reach an agreement,” the bargaining committee statement said.
“The union was clear that management needed to make movement on our core priorities — priorities we have been crystal clear about since Day 1 — in order to avoid a strike,” the committee said. “Instead of engaging in discussions about our priority issues, management chose to end the bargaining session.”
Wuebben reiterated that Meriter’s management negotiators are “ready to return to the bargaining table at any time.” 
The union statement said bargaining team members are also ready to return to the table, but said they would need to see evidence that management was willing to move on their issues relating to staffing ratios, stronger hospital security and compensation.
“The union bargaining team has consistently made themselves available to meet with Meriter management, and we will continue to do so,” the union statement said. “If Meriter management would commit to make meaningful movement on our priority issues before the strike, we would consider scheduling a meeting with them before Tuesday May 27.”

Baraka appeared in federal court for a status conference on the Trump administration's charge that he trespassed last week at Delaney Hall, an ICE immigration detention center in Newark. (Photo by Stephanie Keith/Getty Images)A federal judge took federal prosecutors to task in astonishing fashion Wednesday over what he called the “hasty arrest” of Newark Mayor Ras Baraka and their decision to drop his federal trespassing charge Monday, just 10 days after his arrest. 
U.S. Magistrate Judge André Espinosa told prosecutors that the swiftness of their decision to drop the charge “suggests a worrying misstep by your office.”
“An arrest, particularly of a public figure, is not a preliminary investigative tool. It is a severe action, carrying significant reputational and personal consequences, and it should only be undertaken after a thorough, dispassionate evaluation of credible evidence,” Espinosa said to Assistant U.S. Attorney Stephen Demanovich, who was prosecuting Baraka’s case. 
Espinosa said the government’s rush to charge Baraka culminated in the “embarrassing retraction” of the charge — which he said suggests “a failure to adequately investigate, to carefully gather facts, and to thoughtfully consider the implications of your actions before wielding your immense power.”
He emphasized the legacy of high standards of prosecutorial ethics and professionalism from prior U.S. attorneys in New Jersey, adding that charges are brought only after considerate and exhaustive fact-gathering. He noted Demanovich himself acted appropriately, but the office must “operate with a higher standard.”
“Let this incident serve as an inflection point and a reminder to uphold your solemn oath to the people of this district and to your client, justice itself, and ensure that every charge brought is a product of rigorous investigation and earned confidence in its merit, mirroring the exemplary conduct that has long defined your office,” he said. 
Demanovich responded that the office had conducted a thorough review of the claims against Baraka, and he agreed that it’s the goal of his office to uphold justice.
Thursday’s hearing, during which Espinosa formally dismissed the trespassing charge, capped a dramatic two-week period for Baraka, who is one of six Democrats running for governor this year (the primary is June 10).
Baraka was arrested May 9 while House members attempted to tour Delaney Hall, a recently reopened federal immigration detention center in Newark. Baraka had previously tried to gain entrance to the facility, which is engaged in a legal court battle with the city over whether the facility’s owner secured proper city permits to open.
Baraka has maintained that he was invited onto the property by federal agents, and arrested even after he complied with agents’ request for him to leave. He posted a video last week on social media showing a guard opening a gate to let him in.
Though Demanovich told Espinosa during a hearing in the case last week that prosecutors had “clear evidence” Baraka was trespassing, the U.S. Attorney’s Office revealed in a criminal complaint filed against Rep. LaMonica McIver Monday that a guard allowed Baraka onto the property because the guard thought Baraka was a member of Congress with the power to inspect the facility.
After Baraka’s arrest, acting U.S. Attorney Alina Habba said Baraka “has willingly chosen to disregard the law” and added, “NO ONE IS ABOVE THE LAW.” Habba, a personal attorney for President Donald Trump, attended last week’s court hearing in Baraka’s case.
Rahul Agarwal, an attorney for the mayor, said Wednesday if the matter had gone to trial, he’s “confident” that the “charges did not and would not survive scrutiny.” Agarwal also said the dismissal of the charge doesn’t erase the five hours Baraka was detained and the public scrutiny the mayor faced.
When Habba announced Monday that she agreed to drop Baraka’s trespassing charge, she also said she would be charging McIver with a crime. Prosecutors allege McIver assaulted two federal agents while trying to prevent Baraka’s arrest.
McIver maintains the charges are politically motivated and said Tuesday she looks forward “to the truth being laid out clearly in court.”
After Wednesday’s hearing, Baraka was heard on a microphone acknowledging the admonishment from the judge, according to the New Jersey Globe. It’s not clear he knew he could be heard. 
“Jesus, he tore these people a new a**hole. Good grief,” Baraka said.

(Paige Eichkorn / Arkansas Advocate)Attorney General Tim Griffin on Wednesday substituted and certified the popular name and ballot title of a constitutional amendment proposed by the League of Women Voters of Arkansas aimed at preserving the state’s direct democracy process.
Griffin had rejected the proposal three times prior to Wednesday’s certification. In his most recent rejection, Griffin cited a new state law that prohibits ballot titles from being written above an eighth-grade reading level as his reason for denying certification.
In Wednesday’s opinion, Griffin said he previously did not approve the League of Women Voters’ proposal because it ranked at grade level 12.2 on the Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level formula. The test uses word complexity and sentence lengths to calculate what grade of education is needed to comprehend written material.  
Arkansas attorney general rejects first ballot measure under new law

Additionally, the attorney general identified two other “minor issues” —  a grammatical error in the text and the proposal’s “failure to mention any standards upon which a popular name could be challenged.”
Griffin noted in Wednesday’s opinion, which Assistant Attorney General Kelly Summerside prepared, that the League of Women Voters had corrected both issues and rewrote the ballot title so it ranks at an 8.5 grade level on the Flesch-Kincaid test. 
“With regard to your proposed ballot title, I have made several minor changes to ensure that the ballot title clearly and accurately sets forth the purpose of your proposed initiated amendment to the Arkansas Constitution, while remaining at an eighth-grade reading level,” Griffin said. 
The League of Women Voters of Arkansas and its ballot question committee, Save AR Democracy, said they were pleased with “this long-awaited approval,” in a statement issued Wednesday afternoon. 
“This victory belongs to every Arkansan who believes in the power of the people to shape their own government,” said Bonnie Miller, president of the League. “Despite the challenges, we refused to give up because the right to direct democracy is worth fighting for.”
The League of Women Voters of Arkansas submitted its first proposal in March. The amendment’s goal is to “restore Arkansans’ constitutional right to direct democracy by preventing legislative interference, streamlining legal reviews, and simplifying the citizen-led petition process while ensuring that the fundamental rights of the amendment are subject to strict scrutiny by the courts in order to be valid,” according to a Wednesday press release.
Direct democracy is the process by which Arkansans can propose new laws or constitutional amendments and place them on the ballot for a statewide vote. Arkansas is one of 24 states that allow citizen-led initiatives, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.

The nonpartisan LWVA, which submitted its most recent proposal on May 7, is proposing a constitutional amendment to prohibit state lawmakers from changing the Arkansas Constitution themselves and require that any new law affecting the initiative and referendum process must be approved by voters at the next general election.
Additionally, the ballot measure would only permit voters, not state lawmakers, to propose changes to Article 5, Section 1 of the state Constitution, the section that outlines the initiative and referendum process. 
Under the proposed constitutional amendment, the General Assembly would determine the name and title of referendums, and votes on a bill with an emergency clause (a provision that allows laws to become effective immediately) would have to occur at least 24 hours after the bill passes.
Additional provisions of the proposal address the signature-gathering process, as well as the process for certifying and challenging ballot titles. 
These reforms are essential to ensuring Arkansans can continue bringing issues “directly to the ballot without unnecessary obstacles,” according to the release.
“This is about protecting the voice of the people,” Miller said. “It should be the voters, not politicians, who have the final say in how Arkansas is governed.” 
Preserving Arkansans’ right to propose state laws and constitutional amendments became a priority for several groups after lawmakers approved about a dozen bills related to direct democracy during the recently concluded legislative session. The bills’ sponsors said they will ensure integrity with the process, while opponents have argued the new laws make it nearly impossible for Arkansans’ proposed measures to qualify for the ballot.
Arkansas coalition submits proposal to protect ‘fundamental right’ to direct democracy

The League of Women Voters of Arkansas filed a federal lawsuit in April alleging that eight of those laws are unconstitutional. Two ballot question committees, Protect AR Rights and For AR Kids, filed a motion to intervene in the case last week because they want to challenge additional laws not included in the original suit, including Act 602 of 2025, the law that prohibits initiative petitions from being written above an eighth-grade reading level.
Protect AR Rights also submitted its own proposed constitutional amendment Monday that would protect Arkansans’ “fundamental right” to direct democracy. Arkansas Advocates for Children and Families is a member of the Protect AR Rights coalition, and Executive Director Keesa Smith-Brantley said Monday that the group’s goal is for its proposal and the League of Women Voters’ to work together.
“There were things that we felt like we needed to equally add to make sure that we enshrine the rights of Arkansans in the Constitution, but we are hopeful to be able to work together in this process and talk about ways that we can make sure that both of the measures that we’re working on get passed,” she said. 
Under state law, the attorney general’s office has 10 business days to approve or reject a proposed ballot measure. The deadline for a response on Protect AR Rights’ proposal is June 3.

The private medical university announced Wednesday the launch of the Dr. Robert and Brenda Good Faculty Development Academy, a campus-wide initiative to “advance excellence in teaching, educational research and leadership among its faculty members,” according to a news release.
“This is a bold, forward-looking initiative designed to support faculty throughout their professional growth,” said DMU Assistant Vice President for Academic Innovation and Enhancement Nehad El-Sawi in the release. “From peer-led consultations to faculty workshops on cutting-edge topics like artificial intelligence and enhanced preceptor development, the academy fosters a collaborative ecosystem for academic excellence.”

According to the release, the initiative will focus on six areas relating to faculty training and development, including improving onboarding, offering continuous professional development, encouraging educational research, furthering collaboration across campus and bettering teaching skills.
El-Sawi said in the release this initiative will help the college invest in the future of health care by investing in its own faculty.
A gift from 1977 DMU graduate Robert Good and his wife, Brenda, is funding the program, the release stated. DMU Director of Marketing and Communications Denise Lamphier said in an email the university is not providing the gift amount at the request of the donors.
The Goods said in the release DMU needs to give the students who will eventually be caring for Iowans and others the best start they can, and a way to do that is to ensure faculty have the best training and skills to pass onto their classes.
“Their generosity will ripple through future generations and help prepare the health care heroes our world so urgently needs, including rural physicians, groundbreaking researchers and compassionate therapists,” said DMU President Angela Walker Franklin in the release. “This is more than a gift. It’s a promise of hope and innovation. The entire DMU community is grateful to the Goods for believing in our mission and investing in its future.”

(Photo by Christopher Shea/Rhode Island Current)The Massachusetts company accused of dumping thousands of tons of contaminated soil during construction of the Route 6/10 Interchange in Providence and lying about it has paid $11 million to settle criminal charges set to go to trial next month. 
Nearly all the money will go toward funding dental care for Providence children living in neighborhoods near the highway, Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha said in announcing the settlement with Barletta Heavy Division Inc. during a news conference at his Providence office Wednesday. The settlement was signed May 15.
Complaints over contaminated soil surfaced in the summer of 2020 after workers voiced concerns about excessive dust. Barletta, based in Canton, Massachusetts, claims such allegations were the result of a scheme involving extortion and bribery by its now-defunct competitor, Cardi Corp. 
The AG’s office filed criminal charges against Barletta in early 2023 after the company 
had agreed to pay $1.5 million to settle federal charges over the issue. The state charged Barletta with two counts of illegal disposal of solid waste, one count of operating a solid waste management facility without a license, and one count of providing a false document to a public official.
Neronha said the $1.5 million federal fine wasn’t enough to deter future use of contaminated fill in Rhode Island.
“For there to be any hope that Barletta learned their lesson, they would have to pay a lot more,” Neronha said. 
Under the settlement, Barletta will contribute $10 million toward a newly-created Attorney General’s 6/10 Children’s Fund, which will be managed by the Rhode Island Foundation to address health needs and concerns of children in Providence. Priority will be given to children living in the Olneyville, Silver Lake and West End neighborhoods.
Rhode Island Foundation CEO David Cicilline lauded the state’s settlement agreement, noting that Neronha’s goal is central to the nonprofit’s work.
“Focusing the funding on neighborhoods where health disparities are high won’t just close gaps in access to care; the benefits will spill over into their everyday lives,” Cicilline said in a statement. “Children who are healthy can concentrate on school, enjoy play and contribute to their communities, creating pathways to a brighter future.”
Another $750,000 will go to the AG’s office to pay for investigation and prosecution expenses. The remaining $250,000 will go to the Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management, which investigated the contamination claims.
“Getting them to this point was not easy,” Neronha said. “Barletta knew what it did a long time ago, and it was not necessary for them to take this long.”
Under the terms of the settlement, Barletta admitted to all the claims made in a civil complaint filed on Tuesday. The state alleged that Barletta dumped more than 4,500 tons of stone and soil containing arsenic and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) from the Pawtucket/Central Falls Commuter Rail Station and a stockpile from Boston’s Jamaica Plain neighborhood at the Route 6/10 Interchange construction project.
The Route 6/10 project reconstructed the interchange at Interstate 95 and involved replacing or removing seven structurally deficient bridges. The Rhode Island Department of Transportation awarded Barletta a $247 million in 2017 contract to rebuild the interchange.
“It wasn’t hazardous, but it was contaminated for certain,” Neronha said of the soil.
Barletta attorney Shannon Reilly said the company is eager to move forward from the case, which was scheduled to head to trial in Providence County Superior Court June 9. The case is now permanently closed and cannot be brought back to court.
“With today’s settlement agreement and the dismissal with prejudice of all criminal and civil charges in this case, Barletta is pleased to put this matter behind us and looks forward to continuing our long history of successfully and responsibly delivering world class public infrastructure projects,” she said in an emailed statement. “We will not have any further comment on this matter.”
Barletta has claimed it is no longer able to obtain work in Rhode Island because of the use of contaminated soil on the 6/10 project.

‘Proud of their smile’
Neronha cited a 2024 Providence Journal article on rising tooth decay among children in low-income and immigrant neighborhoods in Providence as his motivation for using the settlement funds toward a grant program.
“There’s no child in Rhode Island that should face that experience,” Neronha said. “I want every kid to be proud of their smile.”
Neronha said he chose to have money administered by the Rhode Island Foundation rather than go to the state’s general fund because he felt Barletta’s impact was neighborhood specific, rather than an entire state issue. 
“$10 million is a lot of money, and I wanted it to be used for kids who are facing a crisis but live in that area,” Neronha said.
Unlike multistate lawsuits, the Barletta settlement does not have to go directly into state coffers, Neronha said. He noted his predecessor Peter Kilmartin disbursed proceeds to nonprofit environmental groups from the state’s 2017 settlement with Volkswagen over misrepresenting emissions.
Neronha said he hopes funds from the Barletta settlement will start covering kids’ dental care before his term as the state’s top prosecutor wraps up in 2026.
“I’ve got 18 months to go. I want to see movement,” Neronha told reporters.
Details for how the money will be disbursed are still to be determined. 
Greg Stepka, a North Smithfield-based dentist who attended the press conference, told Rhode Island Current he would like to see the $10 million go toward more community health centers and dental buses that visit schools, along with the creation of a centralized surgical center.
“This is a win-win,” he said. “The kids need this.”
Barletta is among 13 contractors the state is suing for negligent work on the westbound Washington Bridge. Seven defendants, including Barletta, tried to get the case dismissed, but Judge Brian Stern denied their petitions on Feb. 27.

Kevin Stitt laughs when answering a question during a press conference on Wednesday, May 21, 2025. (Photo by Janelle Stecklein/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY – The Oklahoma Senate on Wednesday sent Gov. Kevin Stitt a measure that would make it more difficult for residents to put things on the ballot.
Critics said the measure is an unconstitutional legislative power grab, while supporters said it is necessary to ensure  more input from rural counties and prevent fraud.
Currently, state law requires 97,263 signatures to get statutory changes before the voters and 172,993 for constitutional amendments. 
There are no restrictions on where the signatures are collected.
But Senate Bill 1027 would put limits on how many signatures could come from counties.
For a statute change, no more than 11.5% of votes cast in the most recent gubernatorial election could come from a single county. That signature threshold increases to 20.8% for a constitutional amendment.
“This forces them out to 18 to 20 different counties,” said Sen. David Bullard, R-Durant, the bill’s author. “It doesn’t even force them out to all 77 counties. We’re just asking that you go to 18 to 20 different counties to gather these signatures and get various opinions on whether or not this is something you want to do.”
Oklahoma has more than 2.3 million registered voters, of which 1.15 million voters cast ballots for governor in the 2022 general election, according to the Tulsa-based Oklahoma Policy Institute. 
The bill’s requirements would exclude 2.2 million registered voters, or 94.4% of them, from signing a petition for statutory changes, according to the organization.
It would exclude 2.1 million registered voters , or 89.8% of them, from signing a petition for constitutional amendments, according to the organization.
The measure would prohibit the payment to circulators based on the number of signatures collected. It would require sources of payment to circulators to be disclosed and bar out of state interests from donating. 
Bullard asked why Oklahomans would want “massive liberal organizations coming in here and shoving this stuff down your throat.” 
It would require petition circulators to be registered Oklahoma voters. Finally, it would require a political appointee, the Secretary of State, to approve the gist, the brief summary of the ballot measure that voters see at the top of the signature sheet.
Critics say the process has been used to get needed reforms on the ballot, such as Medicaid expansion, medical marijuana legalization and criminal justice reform, when lawmakers declined to act.
The bill will “suppress and subvert what we used to know as democracy,” said Sen. Regina Goodwin, D-Tulsa.
Sen. Mark Mann, D-Oklahoma City, called the measure “a power grab.” 
“It takes power away from everyday Oklahoma voters,” he said “It silences the voice of everyday citizens.”
Mann said the bill is likely unconstitutional and violates a U.S. Supreme Court ruling that says out-of-state money from corporations can be spent on elections and ballot initiatives.
He said the artificial signature cap also discriminates against voters in Oklahoma and Tulsa counties, whose residents combined make up 40% of the state’s population, but can comprise only 23% of the total signatures collected. 
“It violates the one person one vote principle,” he said.”
Senate Minority Leader Julia Kirt, D-Oklahoma City, said the measure establishes barriers that make it nearly impossible to get issues on the ballot.
Bullard said the state Constitution says laws shall prevent corruption in the referendum process.
“Let me be very clear,” Bullard said. “If you are willing to go to two or three counties to gather those signatures and completely willing to completely ignore 97.5% of the state counties, that’s corruption.”
The measure passed by a vote of 39-7.
Stitt said Wednesday that he will review the measure before deciding whether to sign it.
He said it is easier to get something on the ballot in Oklahoma than in other states, and lawmakers are trying to find a balance.
It would become effective immediately with Stitt’s signature.

Ron DeSantis signed Wednesday.
The change is part of an expansion of the school guardian program that already allows public and private school employees to act as law enforcement when an active shooter enters their campus. The Florida Legislature established the program after the 2018 shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School that killed 17 people.
Currently, 53 counties participate in the program, which requires volunteer school employees to undergo a 144-hour training, according to a legislative analysis of the bill, SB 1470, which lawmakers passed unanimously.
“I think that’s going to be something that people are going to like,” DeSantis said of the program expansion during a Wednesday press conference at Winter Haven Senior High.
Additionally, the law revises school door locking requirements, appeasing sheriffs’ concerns. The new law allows classrooms to use temporary locks, requires school safety protocol to apply for 30 minutes before and after school, and exempts door locking for career and technical education classrooms where ventilation is required.
“I think what the Legislature did is they tweaked this. They made sure that, yes, we want to be able to create blocks to keep bad guys out, but we also want it to be practical,” the governor said. “We want to make sure people are able to do their daily tasks and get to where they need to go.”
Polk County Sheriff Grady Judd previously told Florida Phoenix that the door-locking law passed in 2024 was “clunky and difficult to understand and easy to violate it even without the intent to violate it.”
DeSantis signed two other bills. HB 279 brings harsher penalties for false reporting of a crime, and HB 1099 gives police officers discretion over whether they should immediately arrest someone in a hospital, nursing home, or assisted living facility.

The project calls for logging and burning 4,400 acres (about 7 square miles) of the Uinta-Wasatch-Cache National Forest in the Soapstone Basin area about 20 miles southeast of Kamas. This area in the Uinta Mountains of northeastern Utah is known for its abundant recreational opportunities, scenic beauty, and pristine wildlife habitat.
This land is particularly sensitive since its Inventoried Roadless Areas include habitat for lynx and wolverines, which are listed as “threatened” under the Endangered Species Act, as well as elk and mountain lions. The area is of great interest to the public, including the Alliance, which regularly comments on projects affecting national forests throughout the Northern Rockies.
The Forest Service neither informed nor gave the public an opportunity to comment on the project, it wasn’t listed on the agency’s projects page nor Schedule of Proposed Activities on its website. Nor was a legal notice published in area newspapers informing the public of the project as required by law.
Yet, on May 8, Deputy District Ranger Kenneth G. Verboncoeur, signed the decision memo authorizing the project.
We found pages 19-24 of the decision memo after it was posted on the agency’s website on May 9. But the first 18 pages were mysteriously missing — including maps and locations for the logging and burning or how many miles of logging roads would be bulldozed into the Inventoried Roadless Area.
Because the Forest Service never informed or gave the public an opportunity to comment on this project, we informed the agency that it was violating the National Environmental Policy Act and the decision memo must be withdrawn or we would take prompt legal action.
Due to the obvious violation of these laws, the Forest Service notified the Alliance by email on Friday, May 16, that the agency rescinded the decision memo authorizing the secret logging and burning project.
The Alliance appreciates the Forest Service for withdrawing their decision after we pointed out that they were breaking federal law and didn’t make us take them to court. But we think the Forest Service should always follow the law like most Americans do, and not just when they get caught breaking the law.
Fortunately for the American public, the National Environmental Policy Act, the National Forest Management Act and the Endangered Species Act are still on the books. We are a democracy, and according to the Constitution only Congress can change laws, not federal agencies, and not the president.
National Forests do not belong to the Forest Service; they belong to all Americans who have a right to review and comment on projects on national forests. Congress passed these laws because the Forest Service was destroying our public lands by putting clearcutting ahead of preserving habitat for biodiversity, preservation of species, hunting, fishing and the clean, vital watersheds national forests provide.
But bureaucrats can’t just operate in secret and pretend laws don’t exist when those laws get in the way of logging and burning the National Forests that belong to all Americans.
For now this decision has been rescinded. The Forest Service could sign a new decision in the future, but the Alliance will be watching — and holding the agency’s feet to fire to follow applicable federal laws.

(Danielle Prokop / Source NM)Three years after a hazing scandal within New Mexico State University’s men’s basketball team, New Mexico Attorney General Raúl Torrez says the university has taken “valiant” steps to improve safety and accountability.
Three former NMSU basketball players were charged in late 2023 after several other younger student athletes revealed they were forcibly restrained and sexually assaulted on multiple occasions during the season. Deshawndre Washington, Doctor Bradley and Kim Aiken Jr. were all charged with various counts including criminal sexual penetration, false imprisonment and criminal sexual contact. 
According to court documents, Bradley and Aiken pleaded guilty to several of the lesser charges and await sentencing, while prosecutors dismissed the rest of the charges. Washington’s trial was set to begin in mid-April, but he appealed several of the lower court’s rulings to the state Supreme Court.
The New Mexico Department of Justice conducted an investigation into the university’s athletics department and released a full report of their findings in December 2024. The report included seven areas of concerns and 35 recommendations to improve student safety, university accountability and compliance with federal laws. 
Areas of concern include: institutional governance and student engagement; university policies; reporting; training; culture and recruiting practices within the athletics department; resources for sexual assault victims; and coordination between university departments. The DOJ provided NMSU with a checklist of 35 recommendations for improvement.
This week, Torrez released a statement commending NMSU for completing two-thirds of the recommendations so far and making progress toward the rest of the list. 
“NMSU has taken swift and decisive action,” Torrez said in a statement. “I encourage every university in New Mexico to review this report and adopt similar reforms to foster safer, more supportive environments for their students.”
The DOJ pointed out in the report that New Mexico is one of six states that lacks anti-hazing laws and recommended lawmakers pass legislation criminalizing hazing practices during the most recent legislative session. Lawmakers introduced two bills addressing hazing and one proposing criminalizing cyberbullying. However, all three bills died in committee.
During the interim, the DOJ has encouraged other state universities to implement the recommendations from the NMSU report to help further safeguard students from hazing acts and ensure the university’s system of reporting and investigating such instances are satisfactory.
“We want to thank the Attorney General’s Office for its support in helping us understand these challenges,” NMSU President Valerio Ferme said in a statement. “There’s still work to be done to ensure our campuses are places where everyone, especially students, can safely pursue their educational and professional goals. We have an incredibly devoted group of leaders who are committed to making us better, and we will continue to dedicate time and resources to address hazing and harassment to the best of our abilities.”

Administration officials have been pressuring lawmakers to speed up the transition away from the emergency motel housing program, and cut down on costs. Despite winning some concessions, the governor’s administration wouldn’t say whether it was satisfied.

Photo by Glenn Russell/VTDiggerThis story, by Report for America corps member Carly Berlin, was produced through a partnership between VTDigger and Vermont Public.A bill that would radically restructure Vermont’s response to homelessness is headed for a full vote in the Senate Thursday. But Gov. Phil Scott’s administration has expressed continued concern about the legislation, making its path to becoming law uncertain.Asked at a Wednesday press conference whether he would support the bill, H.91, Scott said he hadn’t seen its latest iteration. But he noted that he could not greenlight a bill that continues allowing the mass use of motel and hotel rooms for shelter, and maintains historically high spending levels.“There’s a lot of conditions that have to be put into place before we do this,” Scott said. H.91 would shift Vermont’s homelessness response system from one centered on state government to one administered by private nonprofit organizations. It passed the House in early April.In its current form, the bill would make that transition in stages. Next summer, the statewide motel voucher program would end, and regional anti-poverty organizations would take over the task of providing emergency shelter under the banner of the newly-created Vermont Homeless Emergency Assistance and Responsive Transition to Housing Program. The state would maintain an oversight role.The following year, a separate state program that doles out funding to build and operate shelters and run homelessness prevention programs would also dissolve and get folded into the new regional setup. Local shelter directors have pushed back against shifting this program’s current form, arguing the move could destabilize their work.READ MORE
Legislators and state officials have generally agreed on the prospect of shifting the state-run motel voucher program over to the five regional community action agencies – something that was contemplated for years even before the Covid-19 pandemic put the safety-net program in the spotlight. Scott has long called for the program’s pandemic-era expansion to come to an end.As outlined in the bill, the regional agencies, along with the statewide nonprofit focused on domestic violence, would undergo a planning process to figure out how best to use the funds that had historically gone toward the voucher program. But administration officials have expressed concerns that these groups might turn around and use the funds on hotel and motel rooms for unhoused people when traditional shelters are full.Meanwhile, the Scott administration has pressed lawmakers to speed up the transition process. In a last-minute memo to a key Senate committee last Friday, Jenney Samuelson, secretary of the Agency of Human Services, wrote that “we cannot defer all reform” until fiscal year 2027. She urged legislators to make more changes to the motel program in the fiscal year that begins this July, including “verification of residency, homelessness, and income,” prioritizing those most in need when motel capacity is limited, and shifting eligibility “to better target the most vulnerable.”Without these changes, and others, “the administration will have a hard time supporting the bill in its current form,” the Friday memo read.Members of the Senate Health and Welfare Committee bristled at officials’ eleventh-hour requests. But they acquiesced, to a point, by adding a study to the bill to consider shifting responsibilities to regional providers before next July.It’s unclear whether this change will suffice. Scott administration officials did not make anyone available for follow-up interviews about the current status of the bill Wednesday, despite multiple interview requests.Some directors of the nonprofit agencies that would take over the state’s homelessness response have balked at the prospect of a faster transition.“It is hard to understand how we’re going to create a community-based system, have some innovation, and shift the system thoughtfully around homelessness if we don’t get the resources and the timing,” said Paul Dragon, executive director of the Champlain Valley Office of Economic Opportunity, earlier this week. “It doesn’t seem like this latest version allows for that.”The Scott administration has also taken issue with a $10 million allocation – anticipated in the already-signed state budget – intended to aid the transition to a community-based system. Samuelson’s memo demanded that funding “must be greatly reduced,” but did not provide specifics. That $10 million in transition funding remains in the version of the bill set for a Senate vote Thursday. But after the administration said the bill directs too much spending in the long term, the Senate Health and Welfare Committee removed references in the bill to a roughly $82 million baseline for the new program’s first year.Rep. Theresa Wood, D-Waterbury, the bill’s architect in the House, took issue with that change – and expects the bill to land in a conference committee, where House and Senate lawmakers can hash out their differences.If the two chambers can’t come to a place of agreement with each other – and the administration – by the end of the session, Wood said she doesn’t expect to put forward similar legislation next year. H.91 is the Legislature’s last-best shot at shifting away from the motel voucher program, she indicated.“I just need to be clear that if we don’t have this, then what we have is the program as it stands right now – which nobody is satisfied with,” she said.Read the story on VTDigger here:  Just before a key vote, Scott administration’s position on motel program overhaul is unclear.",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/samuelson-winters-1-20250402-1024x681.jpg,,,2025-05-21 18:10:16.245823

(Photo by Jackie Llanos/Florida Phoenix)Gov. Ron DeSantis called the investigation by a state attorney into First Lady Casey DeSantis’ Hope Florida Foundation a manufactured political operation during a press conference Wednesday afternoon,
The governor spoke at more length Wednesday than he’d done Tuesday when the Tampa Bay Times and Miami Herald first reported the open investigation by State’s Attorney Jack Campbell in Tallahassee into the transfer to the foundation of $10 million from a $67 million Medicaid overpayment settlement with the state.
After signing three bills in Winter Haven, DeSantis answered questions about the Hope Florida investigation by insulting Pensacola Republican Alex Andrade, chair of the House Health Care Budget Subcommittee, who launched a legislative probe into the settlement during this year’s legislative session.
“You have one Jackass in the legislature — I’m sorry, it’s true — who’s trying to smear her, smear good people, and just understand what happened,” DeSantis said. “He took documents and he dropped them in a prosecutor’s office that is not an organic investigation, that’s a manufactured political operation. That’s all this is: Somebody with an agenda dropped off documents, and that’s all that.”
Hope Florida Foundation steered the funds to two groups that sent a combined $8.5 million to Keep Florida Clean, a political action committee created to oppose Amendment 3, the failed 2024 ballot measure that would have legalized marijuana. The governor’s then-chief of staff and current attorney general, James Uthmeier, chaired that committee.
Andrade responded to DeSantis’ comments on X, stating, “I can feel the love…”

Photo by Alex Driehaus/Valley NewsThis story by John Lipmann was first published in the Valley News on May 20.BURLINGTON— When it comes to a doctor’s wrongful termination lawsuit against Dartmouth Health, legal fees could end up costing the state’s largest health system more than the financial judgment itself.Attorneys for Dr. Misty Blanchette Porter are seeking to recover $1.7 million in legal fees “and related expenses” from DH for their work representing the fertility doctor during the nearly seven years she battled the hospital over her 2017 firing.A jury determined last month that DH violated Vermont’s disability protections for employees and awarded a total of $1.125 million in damages to Blanchette Porter, who was a specialist in Dartmouth Hitchcock Medical Center’s now-shuttered reproductive endocrinology and infertility unit.The jury sided with DH in the five other claims Blanchette Porter had alleged. DH’s attorney’s have not responded to the motion for attorney fees. DH still has until Thursday to file motions to set aside the verdict or to reduce the amount of damages. The judge presiding over the case will determine the question of attorney’s fees.Geoffrey Vitt, lead attorney for Blanchette Porter, said it likely would be “late June or early July before the judge makes any decision.” If granted, the $1.7 million in legal fees would be shared by law firms Vitt & Nunan in Norwich and Langrock Sperry & Wool in Burlington, who jointly represented Blanchette Porter, according to the filing.In addition to recovering their legal fees from Dartmouth Health, attorneys for Blanchette Porter are asking the court to award $241,000 in “pre-judgment interest,” which is an amount equivalent to the statutory annualized 12% allowed under Vermont law based upon the $1 million in economic damages awarded to the plaintiff.Dartmouth Health’s attorneys are opposing the motion seeking the pre-judgment interest award, arguing the presiding judge should either reject it out of hand or “significantly” lower the amount, according to court documents. Blanchette Porter was awarded an additional $125,000 in non-economic damages such as “lost enjoyment of life, mental anguish, or pain and suffering.”Motions by plaintiff attorneys to recover fees on prevailing claims against defendants are typical in civil lawsuits and require attorneys to submit detailed records of the hours they worked, the tasks they did and rates they charged in the case.Judges have the discretion to grant the motion as submitted, amend it or reject it.The trial jury found Dartmouth Health had failed to meet Vermont Fair Employment Practices, relating to Blanchette Porter’s disability. In 2015, she suffered a cerebral spinal fluid leak that required multiple surgeries at Mayo Clinic in Minnesota and two lengthy leaves of absence from work.A “preponderance of the evidence” showed Blanchette Porter’s disability was a “motivating factor” in her firing, the jury determined. (Since Blanchette Porter lives in Norwich, she could file her lawsuit in a Vermont federal court).Blanchette Porter, a graduate of Hanover High School and a 1998 graduate of Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth, is now a fertility specialist with the Reproductive Health and Infertility Center at the University of Vermont Medical Center in Burlington.Read the story on VTDigger here:  Former Dartmouth Hitchcock fertility doctor seeking $1.7 million in legal fees.",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/misty-blanchette-porter.jpg,,,2025-05-21 17:09:47.183686

Montana health officials on Wednesday confirmed a case of measles in Flathead County.
The Montana Department of Public Health and Human Services along with the Flathead City-County Health Department in Kalispell confirmed the state’s 9th case of the highly infectious disease in a county resident. Eight cases have been reported in Gallatin County, which marked the first outbreak of measles in Montana since 1990, and all eight individuals have recovered.
The Flathead County resident is an adult, of unknown vaccination status, who is currently isolating at home. The individual reported recent travel outside of the Flathead, but “there is no clear indication of the exact point of exposure,” according to a press release from the Flathead City-County Health Department.
“Our staff swiftly conducted the investigation upon receiving notification from the state and were able to quickly identify close contacts to prevent further spread,” said county Health Officer Jan Rankosky. “Staff are diligently working with local healthcare providers to remain in communication.”
The Flathead City-County Health Department disease investigation staff determined the individual was not in any public settings while infectious, and there are no known community exposures related to the case, including no known cases or exposed individuals associated with schools or daycares. Health department staff are providing people potentially exposed with information about the exposure date and disease symptoms to watch out for.
Measles is a highly infectious airborne disease that spreads when an infected individual coughs, sneezes or talks. Measles can also be spread through touching contaminated surfaces and then touching the mouth, nose or eyes. Symptoms typically begin with a fever, cough, runny nose, red eyes, white spots in the mouth and a red rash that appears about 14 days after exposure. The rash usually starts on the face and spreads downward to the rest of the body.
Individuals who are immune to measles through vaccination, laboratory evidence of immunity, laboratory confirmation of disease, or were born before 1957 are not considered at risk for infection. Individuals without prior measles infection or vaccination have a 90% likelihood of contracting the disease if exposed.
If you are unsure of your vaccination status, here are a few places you can review:


Call your old high school, college, or university and ask if they have vaccination records.
Contact your doctor’s office, urgent care, or pediatrician. Even if you have not been there in years, they may still have records.
Reach out to the health department where you grew up.
Check your home state immunization registries.

A measles infection is particularly dangerous for infants for whom vaccination is generally not recommended until 12 months of age. Maintaining a high level of vaccination in the community helps protect infants who are too young to be vaccinated, as well as individuals who cannot be vaccinated for medical reasons.
Measles continues to be prevalent in many regions worldwide, resulting in an estimated 300 deaths every day. Cases in the U.S. are generally rare but have been increasing in recent years.
The best way to protect against measles is vaccination. No changes have been made to the existing measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine recommendations in the United States. Two doses of MMR, a measles-containing vaccine that protects against measles, mumps and rubella, are 97% to 99% effective in preventing measles. Measles vaccines have been available in the U.S. since 1963, and two doses have been recommended for children since 1989.
If you are in need of the MMR vaccine, please call your primary care physician as soon as possible.

The Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission (FWC) gave preliminary approval Wednesday for the first bear hunt in Florida in nearly a decade, to take place later this year. Commissioners will return for a final vote in August.
Their decision followed several hours of comments both for and against the FWC’s proposed rules for a 23-day bear hunt, tentatively proposed to take place in December, plus annual hunts from October through December beginning in 2026.
There hasn’t been a bear hunt in Florida since 2015, when a scheduled week-long hunt was shut down in just 48 hours after more than 300 bears were killed. That’s also the last year that FWC counted the bear population, which it estimated at approximately 4,050 bears statewide.
In justifying the need for a hunt, the agency has said that since that 2015 count, they believe that the four largest subpopulations of bears have grown annually and no subpopulations have shown evidence of decline.
The FWC’s plan is to remove 187 bears from four “Bear hunting zones”: 68 in the East Panhandle area; 46 in the North; 18 in Central Florida; and 55 in the South hunting area. As of now, the plan calls for the permits to be issued through a random drawing and they would cost $100 for a Florida resident and $300 for those from out of state. The applications for those permits would cost $5.
‘Gun-toting individuals 
That was the backdrop of Wednesday’s meeting, held at FWC’s headquarters in Ocala, where the public was limited to just one minute due to the large number of people who signed up for public comment.
Marion County Sheriff Billy Woods supports the hunt. He said that in the past nine months there have been 107 reported interactions between bears and human beings in his county but that he believes there were at least three times as many, or at least 300 human-bear interactions.
The elimination of black bears should be regulated, Woods said, adding of his residents that “they’re gun-toting individuals, and I love them for it. They will protect their selves. They will protect their property. And they will have my support.”
“Emotions don’t drive wildlife policy. Science does,” said Travis Thompson, executive director of the conservation group All Florida. “It’s time to have a bear hunt.”
Thompson’s comments that the decision by the FWC was based on science and not emotions was a common theme among those who supported a bear hunt.
“What we need to do is follow the science. It’s that simple,” said Thomas Van Note, with the South Florida chapter of Safari Club International, who added that through his Ring door camera he now sees bears on a regular basis at his home in Ocala.
“This is getting to the point where something needs to be done. Science-based hunting is the answer,” he asserted. “This isn’t a political issue, this is a science issue, and we need to follow the science.”
Elizabeth Bland, Florida chapter president of American Daughters of Conservation, disputed the notion that bear hunters are unethical. “We are not evil, vile monsters that some may portray us to be. We genuinely want the habitat, and the species sustain and thrive.”
‘Trophy hunt’
Critics assailed the proposal, arguing that in fact the science isn’t settled.
“I do agree that science should drive actions, ” said Gina Camilleri. “The data that you are using for a data-based decision is over 10 years old. My question — why hasn’t that data been updated in time for a proposed hunt?”
“This is a trophy hunt and there is no good reason to hold it,” said Megan Sorbo. “The proposal for this bear hunt is unethical and unpopular. Hunting does not regulate bear-human interactions. The answer to this problem is reducing attractants in human areas. There is no scientific backing to this suggested trophy hunt. It is rooted in emotion and the desire to hunt.”
Another opponent was Diamond Bergeron, daughter of “Alligator” Ron Bergeron, who served two terms as an FWC Commissioner. Although she is a hunter herself, she might be able to support the plan if it were “clearly grounded in science and demonstrated to be in the best long-term interest of the bear and our ecosystem. This is a comment about rushing a premature decision,” she said, adding that “much of the data appears outdated and incomplete.”
Bobbie Lee Davenport from Collier County said there are “thousands” of people like herself living in a “bear habitat” and that the real issue is a lack of a sufficient trash receptacles. “The problem is with trash, that’s why the bears are coming.”
  Public opinion survey on a bear hunt that was posted during FWC hearing on bear hunt on May 21, 2025 (Screenshot from the Florida Channel broadcast)
The idea of a bear hunt is not popular with the public. In a survey conducted by the FWC by UCF that was displayed on Wednesday of more than 13,000 self-selected participants, 75% opposed the proposal, with just 23% in support.
Other polls, such as a Remington Research survey commissioned by the Humane World for Animals showed that 81% of Florida residents opposed the reopening of a bear-hunting season.
The FWC ultimately voted, 4-1, to support what was labelled as “Alternative 2,” which includes the option of allowing bear hunting with dogs and the taking of bears at game feeding stations, where food is displayed to attract the animal.
Morgan Richardson, FWC’s director for hunting and game management, said that when a bear comes to a feeding station, hunters can judge the size of the bear. He noted that most female bears weigh 250 pounds or less, while most males weigh more than that.
“When they’re at the feeder, hunters can see them for an extended period of time and judge their size, and they’re less likely to take females — particularly less like to take females with cubs — because they would see the cubs with her. So it’s a more selected method.”
The vote came less than two weeks after the FWC confirmed the first Florida black bear fatal attack of a human being in state history. The death involved an 89-year-old man in a rural area east of Naples, just south of the Big Cypress Wildlife Management Area, according to WESH-TV.

CalMatters reviewed footage from a nearby office building’s security camera that appears to show Sen. Sabrina Cervantes, 37, wasn’t at fault in the crash that occurred around 1 p.m. Monday. 
The footage shows a white SUV rolling through a stop sign and careening into Cervantes’ black sedan at the intersection of 14th and S streets in midtown Sacramento. Cervantes appeared to have had the right-of-way as she drove east on S Street.
In a written statement to Politico, Cervantes said she “did nothing wrong” and the crash wasn’t her fault. Her office did not respond to requests for comment Wednesday.
“The lab results I sought in the hospital show conclusively I had no alcohol in my system. I expect this to be quickly and justly resolved,” the Riverside Democrat told Politico.
“I was accosted by Sacramento Police Department officers, falsely accused of driving under the influence, and involuntarily detained for several hours at the hospital. This ordeal was deeply distressing and left me even more shaken. As a senator, wife, and mother, I hold myself to the highest standard and expect others that serve our communities to do the same,” she said in the statement.
Prosecutors are waiting for toxicology results before deciding whether to file charges, the Sacramento County District Attorney’s office said.
Police say it was a drug, not booze
Sacramento Police Department spokesperson Anthony Gamble said Cervantes was cited under a California statute that prohibits driving under the influence of “any drug.” That includes prescription or even over-the-counter medications. 
“Sen. Cervantes was cited for suspicion of driving a motor vehicle under the influence of a central nervous system depressant,” Gamble told CalMatters Wednesday in an email. 
At the hospital where police met Cervantes, they “observed objective signs of intoxication and conducted a DUI investigation,” then cited the senator on suspicion of DUI, a misdemeanor, Gamble said.
“Based on the objective signs, officers believed that Cervantes was under the influence of a central nervous system depressant,” Gamble said. “Blood was drawn and it will take time for the results to come back.”
Gamble declined to say what the “objective signs” were and did not address Cervantes’ claims. CalMatters has filed a public records request seeking body camera footage and police reports.
Asked why officers did not take Cervantes into custody, Gamble said “every investigation is different.” State law gives a wide range of reasons for police to release people cited for misdemeanors.
Other lawmakers’ DUI arrests
Gamble said the senator was driving a state-owned vehicle, a Toyota Camry, when she was struck in the intersection by a Ford Explorer. The cause of the collision was still under investigation, he said.
The state fleet manager called police to report the collision, Gamble said, and told police that Cervantes’ chief of staff drove her to the hospital. 
The footage CalMatters reviewed shows Cervantes speaking with the other driver and waiting near her vehicle until men in business attire arrive. They remove a suitcase and other items from her vehicle before departing. 
Cervantes’ chief of staff, Cesar Anda, did not immediately respond to CalMatters today.
The Explorer’s driver did not show signs of intoxication or injuries, Gamble said. 
Cervantes moved to the Senate last year after serving in the Assembly since 2016.
Cervantes is hardly the first member of the Legislature to be accused of driving while under the influence. 
Former Sen. Dave Min, a Democrat from Irvine who was elected in November to Congress in another close race, also was cited in 2023 for driving drunk in Sacramento. He pleaded guilty. 
Former Assemblymember Wendy Carrillo, a Los Angeles Democrat, also pleaded no contest last year to a DUI she received the previous year in Los Angeles. 
She lost a race last year for Los Angeles City Council. She later introduced legislation to educate students about the harms of excessive drinking. Carrillo told CalMatters last month that she’s been sober ever since. She said she plans to run for state Senate.  
Cervantes’ sister, Clarissa Cervantes, who sought unsuccessfully to replace her sister in the Assembly last November, was arrested on suspicion of drunken driving in the summer of 2023. She later pleaded guilty. It was her second DUI in less than 10 years, according to the Riverside Press-Enterprise.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/012325_Capitol-Session_FG_CM_36.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-05-21 17:09:47.183686

Included in the bill revising various criminal statutes is a provision allowing “any aggrieved person” to seek an injunction against a municipality or its agents, including police and school employees, that do not follow the Trust Act.
Without the provision, advocates say, municipalities can ignore the state law that limits the circumstances in which police and others can alert federal agents to the location of an undocumented immigrant or detain them for deportation.
The bill would not provide recourse to a migrant detained after a municipal official violated the Trust Act; an injunction would apply to future cases. If found in violation, a municipality would have to pay the plaintiff’s court costs and legal fees.
The legislation, House Bill 7259, passed the House on a largely party-line 96-51 vote that highlighted the wide divide between Democrats and Republicans on deportations in the years since the original Trust Act was unanimously passed during the Obama administration in 2013.
House Minority Leader Vincent J. Candelora, R-North Branford, who voted for the 2013 law, said the current bill broadened the reach of the Trust Act to other municipal officials not enumerated in the previous versions, and it could expose them to legal costs.
“It’s not enough that municipalities and our public safety cannot communicate with ICE for them to do their job. They’re now going to allow these same individuals to sue our towns and cities,” Candelora said.
Rep. Steven Stafstrom, D-Bridgeport, said the original bill, a revision passed in 2019 during the first Trump administration and the current proposal all are intended to ensure an undocumented immigrant will feel safe reporting a crime or seeking aid from police without fear of being turned over to ICE.

At the same time, local authorities must honor any court-issued warrant seeking custody of an immigrant or hold them for ICE if they are arrested on one of a list of serious charges, Stafstrom said.
“We’re trying to strike the right balance,” Stafstrom said.
The reach of the Trust Act and the politics surrounding immigration have changed since 2013, and Republicans elected after their GOP colleagues voted for the original law were scathing in their appraisal of the latest revision and what preceded it.
“The Trust Act is a travesty. It is an insult to the people of this state. The only purpose that the Trust Act serves is to hide criminals from law enforcement,” said Rep. Doug Dubitsky, R-Chaplin, who was elected in 2014.
Rep. Craig Fishbein, R-Wallingford, the ranking Republican on the Judiciary Committee, questioned the original intent and name of the Trust Act, a measure described 12 years ago as engendering trust by immigrants in local law enforcement.
“A lot of times these bills get wrapped in a package, a public relations term,” said Fishbein, who was elected in 2016. “It really should be called the Anti-Trust Act. Do we trust the government to use the statutes that are in place to protect us?”
The anti-commandeering clause of the Constitution bars the federal government from forcing local and state authorities to act as agents of the federal government, meaning they are under no legal obligation to report encounters with undocumented migrants.
Stafstrom said the Trust Act reassures immigrants and keeps law enforcement focused on their primary duties.
“The intent and goal of the Trust Act was to make sure that our local law enforcement was focused on prosecuting crimes and protecting the citizens of Connecticut for offenses that occurred In the state of Connecticut,” Stafstrom said.
Rep. Tom O’Dea, R-New Canaan, complained that the new bill could put municipal officials in jeopardy of facing federal prosecution, as has happened to a judge in Wisconsin.
The judge, Hannah C. Dugan, was accused of actively obstructing the federal authorities, not simply refusing to assist them, by allegedly directing an undocumented immigrant down a hallway away from the agents. She denies any wrongdoing.
Stafstrom bore the responsibility of responding to Republicans who criticized the bill as drawn to frustrate ICE agents trying to lawfully do their jobs.
But Rep. Farley Santos, D-Danbury, rose to offer a personal perspective as, most likely, the only member of the House who once was an undocumented immigrant, albeit one brought to the U.S. from Brazil as a child.
Too much of the debate, he said, focused on criminals, not the people like his parents who fled poverty, overstayed a tourist visa on a trip to the U.S., and built a life. He said he thought of the girl in Danbury who told him her fears of coming home one day to find her parents gone.
“They are the next doctors, they are the next entrepreneurs, they are the next public servants,” he said. “I urge my colleagues to have some compassion.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/fishbeincandelora-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-05-21 17:09:47.183686
,DC,2025-05-21 20:54:49+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,Democrats on U.S. House spending panel grill Education Secretary McMahon over planned cuts,Shauneen Miranda,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/democrats-us-house-spending-panel-grill-education-secretary-mcmahon-over-planned-cuts,,"WASHINGTON — U.S. Education Secretary Linda McMahon took heat from U.S. House Democrats on Wednesday over the drastic cuts and proposed changes at her federal agency in the months since President Donald Trump took office.Democrats on a panel within the U.S. House Committee on Appropriations expressed dissatisfaction with McMahon’s education initiatives so far, as well as Trump’s fiscal year 2026 budget request released earlier this month. The request calls for $12 billion in spending cuts at the department.McMahon appeared before the Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies to outline the budget request as part of the panel’s work to write the bill to fund the department for the coming fiscal year.McMahon told the panel that the department aims to “shrink federal bureaucracy, save taxpayer money and empower states — who best know their local needs — to manage education in this country.”“We’ve reduced a department that was overstaffed by thousands of positions, cut old contracts that were enriching private parties at taxpayer expense, suspended grants for illegal (diversity, equity and inclusion) programs and now are putting forward a budget request that reduces department funding by more than 15%,” she said.Trump and his administration have sought to dramatically reshape the federal role in education, including an executive order calling on McMahon to facilitate the closure of her own department, the gutting of more than 1,300 employees at the agency, threats to revoke funds for schools that use DEI practices and a crackdown on “woke” higher education.‘Disdain for public education’Rep. Rosa DeLauro, ranking member of the full panel and the subcommittee, called McMahon’s actions at the department “lawless,” adding that they “reek of disdain for public education” and are “hurting the most vulnerable in our nation.” “Under your leadership of the department, hundreds of millions of dollars have been frozen, and entire programs have been terminated,” the Connecticut Democrat said. “Funding for vital research, protection of students’ civil rights and programs that support the recruitment and professional development of effective educators have been terminated.”DeLauro also lambasted the budget’s proposal to consolidate 18 grant programs for K-12 education and replace them with a $2 billion formula grant that would give states spending flexibility.A White House document summarizing major changes in the budget request said the consolidation would cut spending by more than $4.5 billion, a point DeLauro emphasized.“Yet at the same time, you propose that we provide $4.5 billion less to educate our nation’s children overall,” she said. “A block grant is a cut — all of my colleagues here know that the states cannot afford to pick up the slack.”In another exchange in the lengthy hearing, McMahon pushed back against New Jersey Democratic Rep. Bonnie Watson Coleman’s assertion that the department’s Office for Civil Rights is “being decimated.” The unit has seen significant staffing cuts as part of the department’s reduction in force effort along with the closure of several regional offices.“Well, it isn’t being decimated,” McMahon said. “We have reduced the size of it, however, we are taking on a backlog of cases that were left over from the Biden administration and we’re working through those.”Watson Coleman proceeded to press McMahon on why the department would reduce its resources if the agency has a backlog in addition to confronting cases that will come before it now. “Because we are working more efficiently in the department,” McMahon replied.Prioritizing school choiceMeanwhile, Republicans focused largely on school choice initiatives and how McMahon and the department are prioritizing those efforts.  The term “school choice” applies to alternative programs to a student’s assigned public school. Proponents say school choice programs are necessary for parents dissatisfied with their local public schools, though critics argue these efforts drain critical funds from school districts.Rep. Robert Aderholt, chair of the subcommittee, said “too many schools, encouraged and facilitated by federal funding, have let things like social justice advocacy and divisive issues crowd out the focus on teaching students and the core subjects.”“Thankfully, some states have pursued choice options for students whose traditional public schools have not served them well, including through charter schools,” the Alabama Republican said.McMahon said increasing school choice was one of her priorities as secretary and highlighted the budget’s proposed increase of $60 million to expand the number of charter schools in the country, according to the budget request.“The president absolutely believes, as do I, that the more choice that parents have, the better off the students are, and we’ve seen that repeatedly in different states,” she said.",,,,2025-05-21 17:09:47.183686

(Photo by Jim Neuger/ Maine Morning Star)Lawmakers who heard hours of public testimony on transgender rights in schools were divided on whether transgender girls should be allowed to compete on girls’ sports teams. But they overwhelmingly rejected broader efforts to roll back rights for transgender students, including bills that would restrict pronoun use or remove gender identity as a protected class under Maine law.
The legislative debate unfolded amid national attention, fueled by President Donald Trump’s administration claiming that Maine is violating Title IX — the federal law that prohibits sex-based discrimination in education — by allowing trans girls to compete in girls’ sports. The discussion included how the proposed bills would impact the state’s compliance with Title IX, with several legal experts explaining to committee members Tuesday that affirming trans students is not a violation of federal law, despite the administration’s interpretation and threats.

To what extent Title IX protects trans students’ rights in schools per legal precedent is unclear, according to Mary Bonauto, acclaimed civil rights attorney and senior director of civil rights and legal strategies at GLAD Law.
“I think this raises the bigger issue, which is what constitutes sex discrimination, and is it sex discrimination to exclude a transgender student from a meaningful opportunity for girls and young women,” she said. 
She pointed to the U.S. Supreme Court’s 2020 decision in Bostock v. Clayton County, which found that discrimination based on sexual orientation or transgender status is inherently rooted in sex, and therefore violates Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, which is related to employment law.
“When you want to forbid somebody from participating in sports…because they’re transgender, the first thing you’re thinking about is their sex,” she said. “You essentially, at that point, are penalizing somebody for a trait or action that would be acceptable if they were the other sex.”
Bonauto noted that while Bostock applied to employment law, its reasoning has significant implications for education law under Title IX. 
Alternately, Erica O’Connell from the conservative Christian law firm Alliance Defending Freedom told the committee that Bostock decision can’t be applied to Title IX directly, because girls have been historically discriminated against, and allowing trans athletes to participate in girls’ sports takes away opportunities from cisgender girls. 
“One boy taking a part on a team that belongs to a girl, is eroding that equal protection in education,” she said.
Judiciary Committee members were split on that issue, with a 6-6 vote on two bills restricting the rights of trans athletes — LD 233 and LD 1134. These bills would cut funding to school districts that allowed trans girls to participate on girls teams and use school facilities aligned with their gender identity, including bathrooms and locker rooms. Rep. Dani O’Hallaran (D-Brewer) broke from the Democrats on those bills, although she voted against all other anti-trans legislation.
Debate centers on fairness and safety during hearing on transgender sports bills

“You’re making a choice to transition. And I’m struggling to understand why that person’s choice has the ability to take away a right position from a biological girl,” she said. 
“To me, in some sense .. I guess the phrase is ‘you can’t have it all.’” 
A third bill, LD 868, proposing co-ed teams as an alternative for trans students was defeated 7-5, but O’Hallaran said she would have voted in favor of the bill if it was amended.
Other Democratic lawmakers on the committee raised concerns about the lack of options for trans students, and the dangerous precedent these bills set for scrutinizing all girls and targeting those that don’t present as stereotypically feminine. 
“There is no choice in this. For those who do not identify according to their biological marker, they get one choice, and that’s called co-ed,” said Sen. Rachel Talbot Ross, explaining her opposition to the bill. “And if the school does not have the resources or can’t put a regional team together, then we have de facto just discriminated against those students because we have not given them choice — choices.”
Rep. Ellie Sato (D-Gorham) said her concern was with the enforcement of the bills. 
“It would backtrack the progress that we’ve made in how we’re surveilling girls’ bodies, because I’m very concerned that girls that do not present feminine with feminine attributes — cis or trans — will be targeted regardless, because they don’t fit into the model of what we believe a woman or a girl should look like,” she said.
Rep. Rachel Henderson (R-Rumford) voted to support the restrictions on trans students because she said she believes in ​​“the truth of the biological reality of two sexes,” although the American Medical Association recognizes trans people and supports their right to affirming spaces.
“My hope is that my vote on these doesn’t define me as someone who hates members of the LGBTQ community or wants to be cruel towards minors who are struggling with gender ideology, because it’s simply not true,” Henderson said.
Some Republican lawmakers including Henderson voted against the broader rollback of trans rights. These included LD 1002, which would mandate that educators use the name and gender listed on a students’ birth certificate even if it doesn’t align with their gender identity, and two bills (LD 1337 and LD 1432) that aim to remove gender identity as a protected class under the Maine Human Rights Act.   
Those bills will head to the full Legislature with a recommendation from the committee to reject them. .
Rep. Mike Soboleski (R-Phillips) said the intention behind LD 1432 is to retain gender identity protections under the umbrella of sexual orientation under the Maine Human Rights Act, but not designate gender identity as a separate protected class. He said he wanted to make the change to align with Title IX.
Barbara Archer Hirsch, executive director of the Maine Human Rights Commission, which enforces the act, disagreed. She said she doesn’t think removing the gender identity language “does anything to align or not align with the current administration’s interpretation of Title IX.
Since gender identity and sexual orientation are not the same thing, she said protecting gender identity under the broader umbrella of sexual orientation would make complying with the Human Rights Act harder if the bill were to pass.
“I think that would create a lot of confusion,” she said. “I think we would be getting more and more calls from folks not knowing what’s covered and what’s not, which was what was happening beforehand.”
O’Hallaran asked whether there was a way to retain gender identity protections while still making it clear that trans girls can’t play in girls sports. As an example, Hirsch pointed to religious schools, which because of exemptions do not have to follow the protections for gender identity and sexual orientation, as long as they don’t receive state funding.

(Submitted) TOPEKA — Last week’s news that the U.S. and China had reached a 90-day tariff deal elevated the uncertainty surrounding President Donald Trump’s trade war.
But at Wichita State University’s Center for Economic Development and Business Research, director Bekah Selby-Leach watches the trade war with the interest of an economist whose deep knowledge helps her interpret what’s happening.
She answered questions about tariffs, their impact, and what it would look like to strengthen the manufacturing economy.
What is a tariff?
“A tariff is a tax on the businesses that are bringing goods and services into the country,” Selby-Leach said. “It really is a tax levied against domestic businesses to encourage them to not import as much but rather produce locally.”
“Oftentimes, people who don’t understand tariffs think it’s going to be paid by the other country,” she added. “It might indirectly be paid through a reduced amount of purchasing from those countries, but in this case it really is trying to threaten them with reduced purchasing to get them to change their own policies.”
What is the goal of putting tariffs in place?
She said Trump administration policies could address trade imbalances.
“About one-third of goods and services are being produced out of the China region,” she said. “That puts them at a huge advantage in terms of their control of global markets, and the United States wants to reclaim some of that control. It is really just a strong arm move, I think. I don’t think they really want to damage the global economy. It doesn’t make sense for any governmental entity to put any country or the whole world into a recession.”
Selby-Leach and economists nationwide are seeing slow-downs indicative of an approaching recession. The short-term China trade deal led some analysts to reconsider but that news was quickly followed by a U.S. credit rating downgrade from Moody’s. That news caused mortgage rates to jump up near 7%. Yet inflation also increased at a lower-than-expected rate, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported.
Much depends on how Trump trade deals benefit the United States, Selby-Leach said.
“If it doesn’t go right, it could very well lead to a deepening recession. It is a risky move, but if it does pay off and advanced manufacturing does relocate to the United States, that could have long-term gains,” she said.
Have tariffs previously been put in place like they are now?
Current tariff policies in the United States are reminiscent of a similar situation from the past.
“The Smoot-Hawley Act, just after the Great Depression, was the closest version of this as a country,” Selby-Leach said. “It wasn’t worldwide, but it was a substantial number of tariffs that were levied. We do know from history what to expect from these types of policies.”
The act passed in June 1930, under President Herbert Hoover, and it increased U.S. tariffs on agricultural imports and thousands of imported goods. Many economists credit it with deepening the Great Depression because of retaliatory tariffs and causing decreased U.S. exports.
What effects do you typically see from tariffs?
“The economist in me knows very much how tariffs play out in terms of taxes — it almost always leads to inflation in prices. There’s really no case in which prices won’t change if these tariffs take effect,” Selby-Leach said.
Almost all goods the United States consumes have some portion of their supply chain that will be affected by tariffs, she said. For instance, the truck that transports products may have parts that are imported.
“That global connection has really helped us grow as a country,” Selby-Leach said. “Every step of the way, there’s an international component that’s going to increase the total cost.”
In terms of global economic power, Selby-Leach said, there is value in reclaiming and maintaining the country’s status. Global economic power has shifted toward China for some time, and pulling some of that back would add more democracy to the global markets, with less centralization in one country, she said.
“It also reduces risk, so if there’s something massive that happens in that one country, it won’t damage the entire world as much,” she said. “I can see the reasoning for it, but I don’t think the current actions are consistent with the reality of what it would take to shift that manufacturing back to the United States.”
What does this mean for consumers?
Selby-Leach said consumers will “most certainly” see rising costs of items typically purchased from abroad, even if companies move manufacturing to the United States.
“Take, for example, a T-shirt produced in China. Their labor costs in China are considerably lower, so they’re able to produce that T-shirt at a remarkably low cost,” she said. “Whereas labor laws in the United States, as well as our history of higher-wage jobs, do mean that when that production happens it necessarily will increase in the labor cost to produce that thing.”
What does it look like to expand U.S. manufacturing and import fewer goods?
Bringing manufacturing back to the U.S. isn’t as simple as it may appear to be, Selby-Leach said.
“Most countries start off predominantly agricultural,” she said. “On average, we typically see this movement from agricultural to industrial and manufacturing and then into the service industry, what we would typically think of as part of economic growth, a shift towards services as we become higher educated.”
“Manufacturing is then located in areas that are at that stage in their economic development,” she added.
Most of the richest countries in the world do not have a lot of production, Selby-Leach said.
“They offer an incredible amount of service, and that’s what economists would say is a natural progression. Whether it’s good or not good, that’s just the way it works,” she said. “Moving the opposite direction, I don’t know if a country’s ever done that without some sort of massive wartime event. During World War II, for example, we produced a lot of goods and services.”
High-tech manufacturing, though, can be considered its own new industry, which could complicate the understanding of what a shift toward manufacturing would mean for the United States. Selby-Leach said maybe it means delving into quantum computing or things as yet unknown.
Would this be a difficult shift?
Multiple factors influence how the United States would manage a return to manufacturing, Selby-Leach said. China has a head start, as the country has been working on advanced manufacturing for at least a decade.
Advanced manufacturing refers to the use of robotics, artificial intelligence, automation and other high-tech advances.
“They have a tremendous investment into high-tech manufacturing that a lot of Americans don’t even understand,” she said. “We often think of their manufacturing as traditional manufacturing but a lot is really high-tech, and they have a lot of investment that went into it. They have some production centers that have 500,000 workers. That’s the entire city of Wichita.”
How challenging are the workforce issues that plague many industries?
Selby-Leach said she’s not sure the U.S. could sustain large production centers. Low unemployment rates already create challenging workforce issues.
“You also have to develop the talent pool,” she said. “There aren’t people who know how to do those things in the United States because we haven’t done them for so long. So you’d have to go through a huge human training program to develop those skills. That will take at least a couple of years.”
Although there might be ways to train existing manufacturing workers and move them around to fill positions, there isn’t an available labor pool to reskill and place into newly created manufacturing jobs, Selby-Leach said.
Places like Wichita, with its highly skilled workforce in the aerospace industry and other advanced manufacturers, would have an advantage, she said.
“Fortunately, we have a big innovation with AI occurring simultaneously, and I think that can add efficiency into some of this, so that we can do more with fewer workers,” she said.
How does the uncertainty and complexity of all of this affect consumers?
“On the economic side of things, uncertainty has a very known effect and people tend to consume less and save more,” Selby-Leach said. “They tend to invest less and hold onto their money in what they consider to be more stable places, such as a savings account, or even cash and assets like that.”
Such individual decisions impact the economy, she said.
“The way we measure economic activity is through spending,” Selby-Leach said.
In her opinion, that’s the biggest concern right now — people are so uncertain that they’re just pulling back from economic activity.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Bekah-at-GWP-1-1024x673.jpg,,,2025-05-21 17:09:47.183686

(Photo by Michael Swensen/Getty Images)An initial state assessment finds it could cost more than $59 million to clean up more than 1.5 million cubic yards of debris from buildings and vegetation damaged by a tornado that tore through Somerset and London last week.
That’s according to a letter that Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear sent to President Donald Trump on Tuesday, requesting approval for an expedited major disaster declaration to help recover from storms across the state. The letter noted the damage and 19 deaths were primarily from an EF4 tornado with a maximum wind speed of 170 miles per hour that tore through Pulaski and Laurel counties. The letter also estimated around 1,500 homes have been destroyed or have sustained major damage.
“With just one day of assessments performed, and more assessments to be performed, the results clearly demonstrate severity, impact, and need,” Beshear wrote in his letter. “Without assistance, it is improbable that recovery will be fully realized.” 
Beshear’s letter mentions the estimate of homes destroyed or with major damage comes from comparing aerial footage with pre-disaster photos and records from county property valuation administrators. “That number can soar to over 5,000 when all impact levels are considered,” he wrote. 
The letter also details expected impacts to the region’s economy, which Beshear wrote “will be extensive and long lasting” with “many businesses severely impacted or destroyed.” 
“Laurel and Pulaski counties are situated in an area that relies heavily on tourism. Tourist season is just beginning and the area’s lodging inventory will be filled with survivors, curtailing the normal seasonal tourist income. It is likely that many tourists, hearing of this disaster, will opt to vacation elsewhere,” Beshear wrote. 
The governor also wrote more than 800 people are being sheltered in travel trailers, Airbnbs and motels following the disaster. Nineteen people have died as a result of the storms, almost all in Laurel County. 
Beshear in his request asked that residents of Laurel, Pulaski and six other counties be made eligible for  individual federal disaster assistance, which can provide individuals with money for post-disaster shelter and housing. He asked that 22 counties received public federal disaster assistance, which can help pay for infrastructure repairs.
In other areas of the country impacted by last week’s storm system, complaints have surfaced about Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) officials not being present or helping disaster survivors. The mayor of St. Louis complained this week about the absence of on-the-ground help from FEMA after a tornado there damaged thousands of buildings and killed five people. The storm that spurred the EF4 tornado hitting Pulaski and Laurel counties originated hundreds of miles away in Missouri.

(Photo via Getty Images; DIAL logo courtesy of Iowa Department of Inspections, Appeals and Licensing)State, city and county inspectors have cited Iowa restaurants and stores for hundreds of food-safety violations during the past five weeks, including offenses related to rodents, expired food and operating without a license.
The findings are reported by the Iowa Department of Inspections, Appeals and Licensing, which handles food-establishment inspections at the state level. Listed below are some of the more serious findings that stem from inspections at Iowa restaurants, stores, care facilities and other businesses between April 17 and May 13. (In March, DIAL began withholding from public disclosure, for eight days past the date of inspection, all food-safety inspection reports.)
The inspections department reminds the public that their reports are a “snapshot” in time, and violations are often corrected on the spot before the inspector leaves the establishment. For a more complete list of all inspections, along with additional details on each of the inspections listed below, visit the Iowa Department of Inspections, Appeals and Licensing’s website.
Dairy Queen, 1100 N. 2nd St., Cherokee — During a May 13 visit, a Siouxland District Health Department inspector cited this restaurant for seven risk-factor violations, noting that chili that had been left to cool from the previous day had not been reheated to 165 degrees within two hours as required. The inspector allowed the establishment to correct the violation by reheating the chili in a microwave oven.
The inspector also noticed that “various items” — including lettuce and ranch dressing that was made on site — were dated in a manner that suggested the items could be used past the maximum of seven days. Also, the ice machine was visibly soiled, and there was no hot water or soap at the handwashing sink near the front counter. In addition, a box of ice cream cones was stored directly on the floor, the front-counter coolers were visibly soiled and there was some sort of buildup on the cake-making table.
The inspector also reported that condensation in the walk-in cooler was not draining, resulting in a “visible water buildup” on the floor, and there was some sort of unidentified “visible buildup observed on flooring throughout kitchen area.”
King Buck’s, 6719 University Ave., Cedar Falls — During a May 13 visit, a Black Hawk County Health Department inspector cited this establishment for 12 risk-factor violations, an unusually high number.
Among the problems: The person in charge was not ensuring proper food safety in the areas of handwashing and proper holding temperatures; frozen foods were left uncovered in the freezer, risking contamination; pulled pork that was sitting in a warming unit was measured at 111 degrees, and burgers sitting in a warmer were measured at 125 degrees, both of which were too cool to ensure food safety.
Also, homemade sauces were left unrefrigerated, unspecified food items inside the walk-in cooler had been held for more than the seven-day maximum, the ice machine had an unidentified buildup of black debris, and there was no hot water supplied to the handwashing sink behind the bar.
The inspector also made note of “fly activity” in the kitchen. The inspector observed that the establishment used to be a Burger King and the hot-holding equipment left behind by Burger King was not keeping items at or above the minimum of 135 degrees.
Tapz Pub, 8450 Hickman Road, Clive — During a May 13 visit, a state inspector reported that wings prepared in a kitchen owned by someone other than Tapz Pub were being transferred into the pub. The wings were discarded, as were four tubs of wings that had no date-markings to ensure freshness and safety. Other foods were dated in a manner that suggested they had been kept longer than the seven-day maximum, including sausage that was dated April 29 and shredded cheddar dated May 1.
In addition, the dishwashing machine was not properly sanitizing dishes and was in need of service. The inspector also noted that the restaurant was operating without a license, having opened before obtaining approval from the Iowa Department of Inspections, Appeals and Licensing.
Three Samurai, 1801 2nd St., Coralville — During a May 13 visit, a Johnson County Health Department inspector found pho broth holding inside a walk-in cooler at 44 degrees after being placed in the cooler the day before. The broth, which had yet to cool to 41 degrees, was discarded. Also, several items in the sushi food line were not being held at 41 degrees or colder, including raw tuna, salmon, beef and white fish. In addition, containers of house-made sauces, roasted garlic cloves, kimchi and milk were not date-marked t ensure freshness and safety.
The inspector also observed that the establishment lacked a thin-tipped, probe-style thermometer to check food temperatures, there was a hole in the ceiling with insulation hanging down, and there was a heavy buildup of debris on the ceiling vent and ceiling tiles. The restaurant’s posted license was expired, and the most recent inspection report had not been posted for public viewing. (The previous routine inspection had resulted in the business being cited for 13 risk-factor violations, an exceptionally high number.)
Sisters African Food Market, 2210 Edgewood Road, Cedar Rapids — During a May 12 visit to this grocery store and meat-processing operation, a Linn County Public Health Department inspector reported that he discussed with managers the fact that “meat processing must be in a cooler temperature area — not 80 degrees — or chilled quickly.”
The inspector also observed that employees appeared to lack knowledge as to how to prepare sanitizing solution for use in the kitchen and lacked knowledge as to effective sanitization methods for meat processing. The workers also appeared to lack knowledge as to the proper methods of thawing frozen food, storing food and handling ready-to-eat food items.
The meat table and food-preparation areas were marred by debris and unnecessary equipment, such as maintenance tools, linens and bags, the inspector reported, and the was no handwashing soap at the handwashing sink in the meat-processing area and no paper towels in the employee or customer restrooms. In addition, various packaged foods were being stored on the floor in the freezer, cooler and kitchen. The store’s last routine inspection was in August 2022.
Biaggi’s Ristorante Italiano, 320 Collins Road NE, Cedar Rapids — During a May 8 visit, a Linn County Public Health Department inspector reported that several employees were observed changing gloves without first washing their hands, and that raw meats were being stored above ready-to-eat food inside a cooler, risking cross-contamination. Also, steam-table sauces were being held at 98 to 130 degrees and had to be discarded, and a mixture of fresh garlic and butter was being stored at room temperature rather than being refrigerated.
The inspector also reported that food items were being stored past the seven-day maximum, including pastrami that was dated April 29, langostino sauce dated April 19, and ham that was dated April 28. Also, the walls and ceilings in the bar area and the walk-in cooler were soiled. The visit was in response to an illness complaint. The complaint was deemed unverified.










“Entire premises has mouse-like droppings on the floors and on shelving ... Floors, walls and ceiling throughout the facility has excess grease and dust.


– Inspector's findings at Tommy's Cafe in Davenport


Tommy’s Café, 916 W. 3rd St., Davenport — During a May 6 visit, a Scott County Health Department inspector reported that employees of Tommy’s Café were “not washing hands and using gloves” when touching raw and ready-to-eat foods and that several food items were left uncovered in a cooler, risking contamination.
In addition, several unspecified food items in the cooler were not date-marked to ensure freshness and safety. The inspector also found an opened can of applesauce dated April 10, and reported that “all kitchen equipment” was marred by excess food debris and grease. In addition, a metal plate inside the bulk ice chest had a pink substance on it.
“Entire premises has mouse-like droppings on the floors and on shelving,” the inspector reported, and shelving throughout the business was marred by dust and debris. “Floors, walls and ceiling throughout the facility has excess grease and dust,” the inspector added. The visit was in response to a non-illness complaint of some unspecified nature. The complaint was deemed verified.
La Casa Azul, 708 1st Ave., Coralville — During a May 1 visit, a Johnson County Public Health Department inspector noted that raw beef steaks were stored above cooked chicken within the walk-in cooler, risking cross-contamination. Also, shrimp was being cooked to an internal temperature of only 120 degrees and had to be returned to a flat-top grill and cooked until it reached an internal temperature of 145 degrees.
In addition, cut lettuce was not date-marked to ensure freshness and safety, and house-made ranch sauce dated April 23 had been held longer than the maximum of seven days. The inspector also reported finding “multiple bottles of Raid” pesticide not formulated for use in food-service establishments, and noted there was no thin-tipped, probe-style thermometer on site for checking the internal temperature of food. In addition, there were bags of whole onions and canned foods stored “on the ground outside,” and the previous inspection report had not been posted for public viewing.
Back Berner Bar & Grill, 607 E. Marengo Road, Tiffin — During an April 30 visit, a Johnson County Public Health Department inspector reported that multiple house-made sauces — including garlic parmesan dated April 16, buffalo sauce dated April 11, and secret sauce dated April 21 — had been held past the seven-day maximum and had to be discarded. In addition, the thin-tipped, probe-style thermometer used to check food temperatures was inoperable, and there was an excessive buildup of debris on the soda dispenser at the bar. Also, the most recent inspection report had not been posted for public viewing.
Beach Pub, 1022 Front St., Buffalo — During an April 29 visit, a Scott County Health Department inspector noted the people in charge were “not ensuring that dishes throughout the facility are being properly sanitized” and failed to ensure that food items were being date-marked to ensure freshness and safety. Also, vegetables were mingled with raw fish inside a bag within the walk-in cooler, and various, unspecified items inside the cooler had no date-markings on them – a repeat violation.
The Fountains Assisted Living Center, 3752 Thunder Ridge Road, Bettendorf — During an April 29 visit, a Scott County Health Department inspector noted that a server was eating in the independent living kitchen in violation of regulations. Also, one large plastic container of potato soup prepared the day before had yet to cool to 41 degrees and was discarded. In addition, a small cooler was holding multiple food products, including cut tomatoes, cheese and dressing at 46 to 50 degrees, rather than 41 degrees or colder.
“Multiple prepared or opened food products were observed throughout the independent living and assisted living kitchens without proper date-marking,” the inspector reported, adding that the undated items included taco meat, cubed ham, corned beef, meatloaf and deli meat. The inspector also found egg salad with a preparation date of April 21 and which had to be discarded.
“Multiple food-contact surfaces were observed throughout the facility with a buildup of soil, grease, and food debris,” the inspector reported. A “used cigarette butt” was found in the bin used to store clean kitchen utensils, and several pieces of equipment required additional cleaning and sanitizing.
Also, salmon was being improperly thawed in a manner that would make spoilage hard to detect; the stainless steel shelves, dish carts, stainless steel rack all had a buildup of soil and debris, and a handwashing sink was clogged and not properly draining.










No roaches were observed but mouse droppings were observed, as were ants ... There are several areas in need of cleaning and sanitizing.


– Inspector's findings at Golden Corral in Davenport


Golden Corral, 5202 Elmore Ave., Davenport — During an April 29 visit, a Scott County Health Department inspector cited this business for 10 risk-factor violations, an unusually high number. The inspector noted there were “ants present in the dining area,” and “mouse droppings were found in all cabinets under the hot- and cold-holding areas.” In addition, ventilation hoods, floors, fryer cabinets, gas lines, and the walk-in cooler racks were marred by “dust, debris and gunk.”
Also, cans of beans and green chiles were either dented or were bulging. The inspector also reported that the compressor in the walk-in cooler was leaking fluid onto packages of food — a repeat violation. Ant spray that was not approved for use in food establishments was sitting next to the coffee creamer in the area set aside for waitresses.
The visit was in response to a complaint alleging there were cockroaches and mice in the restaurant, the building was not clean, and the staff was not cooking food to the proper temperature and was storing out-of-date food. “No roaches were observed but mouse droppings were observed, as were ants,” the inspector reported. “There are several areas in need of cleaning and sanitizing. Raw fish and chicken were stored at room temperatures with an internal temperature of between 55 degrees and 58 degrees, (but) all food was at the proper date range.”  The complaint was deemed verified.
Pho Viet, 5002 E.P. True Parkway, West Des Moines — During an April 29 visit, a state inspector cited this business for 10 risk-factor violations, an unusually high number. The inspector noted the restaurant did not employ a certified food protection manager as required, and that food-service employees were cutting raw jalapeno garnish with their bare hands. Also, the kitchen’s handwashing sink was being used as a dump sink for food, dishes or utensils and access to it was obstructed by large buckets of cut salad.
In addition, raw eggs were being sourced from an unlicensed vendor; cooked chicken was measured at 71 degrees; cut lettuce was stored at 65 degrees; and multiple house-prepared food items had no production dates to ensure freshness and safety. The inspector also reported finding shrimp that was “thawing directly on the floor, beef thawing on a countertop, and several bags of partially frozen chicken wings thawing on a tabletop.” Throughout the kitchen, various sauces, shrimp, lettuce and stocks were being stored directly on the floor.
Iowa 80 Kitchen, 755 W. Iowa 80 Road, Walcott — During an April 23 visit, a Scott County Health Department inspector cited this business for 10 risk-factor violations, an unusually high number.  “Witnessed employee removing an English muffin from customer plate and then scraping off butter and placing it back on the plate to be served,” the inspector reported. The inspector noted that the cold salad bar was holding items at 46 degrees rather than 41 degrees or colder, and so all of the items in the salad bar had to be removed.
Also, unspecified food items inside the walk-in meat cooler were marked with dates to ensure freshness and safety, which was a repeat violation. “All plastic food carts in kitchen area has excess food debris,” the inspector reported. “Inside kitchen coolers and freezers has excess food debris. Microwave in kitchen has excess food debris inside … Mouse-like droppings found in cabinet underneath the coffee machine in wait service area out front.”
Indian Garden, 2503 E. 53rd St., Bettendorf — During an April 22 visit, a Scott County Health Department inspector cited this restaurant for 12 risk-factor violations, an exceptionally high number. Food products pulled from the freezer and placed in the walk-in cooler had no date-markings to ensure freshness and safety; a container of mint yogurt was marked with a preparation date of April 10, indicating it was held for longer than the seven-day maximum; and some kitchen utensils or equipment were marred by “dried food debris, soil and/or grime.”
Also, a cooked container of tofu was sitting out at room temperature and was measured at 69 degrees, “stuffing for bread that contains cooked onions” was observed sitting out at room temperature, and packages of raw chicken breasts were left to thaw at room temperature. The inspector also observed that the flooring between and behind the cooking equipment had a buildup of grease and food debris, as did the sides of the fryer and the containers holding clean dishware. “Urine spots were observed on the toilet seats in both the women’s and men’s restroom,” the inspector added.
The inspector also noted that although the establishment was barred from serving mixed drinks until it had a handwashing sink in the bar area, there were bottles of liquor seen in the bar area.

(Photo by Matt Winkelmeyer/Getty Images for The Recording Academy)Michigan House lawmakers are trying again to make sure the game isn’t rigged for ticket buyers with reintroduced bills to ban the use of software or bot programs to scalp online tickets and purchase them in large quantities.
The initial bills, sponsored by Rep. Mike McFall (D-Hazel Park) and Rep. Mike Harris (R-Waterford Township), were passed by the House last session, but died in the Michigan Senate. They were reintroduced in March and were back up for a first round of testimony on Wednesday before the House Judiciary Committee.
Live Nation, a major player in concert promotion and ticket sales, said it supports the bills, but the secondary ticket reseller StubHub remained neutral.
Overall, the bills would ban people from creating bots that scrape websites for tickets and purchase them in large quantities. They would also ban users from using multiple accounts to buy tickets to circumvent or disable security features on websites to control sales volumes.
“We all have experience with trying to attend a concert or sports event only to be told that the event is sold out and only resale tickets are available at extreme markups,” McFall said. “Bad actors will purchase excessive amounts of tickets, commonly using bots with the intent of selling the tickets at prices that can be multiple times the original face value for popular artists like Taylor Swift. Tickets with value of $250 to $500 have been commonly resold for $5,000 to $10,000.”

McFall noted one instance of a ticket being resold for $17,000 in Arlington, Texas, for Swift’s widely popular Eras tour. He said it harms the entertainment industry but, more importantly, harms consumers by creating an unnecessary financial barrier.
The representative added that the bills would provide the Department of Attorney General with the means to investigate consumer complaints regarding scalped tickets and act against those who are misusing bots to buy several tickets at once.
Harris said a staffer wrote him a script to read in committee rife with Swift lyrics. He didn’t read it, much to the dismay of Rep. Kelly Breen (D-Novi), but said the package prioritizes the consumer.
“I think most of us here have constituents that have made comments or complaints about this,” he said.

Harris said his bill would empower the attorney general to investigate consumer complaints on ticket sales and provide clear penalties. If passed as written, the legislation would carry a civil fine of up to $5,000 for each violation.
Harris noted that one ticket sale purchase by a bot equaled one violation.
“These people are frauding the system and making it hard for the rest of us to actually take our families out and enjoy a good time at the concert,” he said. “As a father of six, yes, I have attended a Taylor Swift concert. That was my duty as a father of four girls. I believe these are meaningful safeguards that will increase transparency and ensure a much fairer purchasing process for people here in Michigan.”
Rep. Sarah Lightner (R-Springport) chair of the House Judiciary Committee, said that as a big Jimmy Buffett fan, she had a hard time getting tickets to his shows before she got on a special list, but could even then find them on a secondary reseller like StubHub. She wondered how the attorney general would begin to investigate instances where a show sold out quickly, and how would their office know if it was a case of a bot purchasing several tickets at once.
McFall said a person would have to file a consumer protection complaint and that the platform, whether it be Ticketmaster, Live Nation or some other seller, would have access to information on whether a bot or multiple accounts owned by the same person purchased the tickets.

Lawyers argued for a day and a half in a Jackson federal courthouse about the national park’s burden for enforcing proper trail use where Sunseri took a shortcut during his fastest-ever climb of the Grand Teton. 
The post Grand Teton switchback-cutting trial concludes; judge promises verdict soon appeared first on WyoFile .","JACKSON—The trial of the United States v. Sunseri in a courtroom here delved deep into the minutiae of trail management, proper signage, law enforcement protocol and what is quickly becoming Wyoming’s most notorious switchback cut.  
After a day and a half of testimony, the trial concluded Wednesday without a verdict. Magistrate Judge Stephanie Hambrick told the courtroom she will take the matter under advisement and review the copious exhibits and arguments before issuing a finding of fact. 
At issue: Whether ultra-runner Michelino Sunseri was properly cited for cutting a switchback during his 2024 fastest-ever out-and-back climb of the iconic Grand Teton. 
On its surface, extensive debate about a trail in the lofty and scenic Teton Range may appear frivolous. But the case has drawn intense attention in the world of alpine athletics, and the testimony underscored that both sides believe a great deal is at stake: from the preservation of a natural park landscape to the ability of public lands visitors to move about reasonably freely, how historic trail use plays into current rules and what factors should contribute to a federal misdemeanor citation. 
In her closing argument, prosecuting attorney Ariel Calmes said that just because something has historically gone unpunished — in this case, climbers using the switchback in question so extensively that it became an established singletrack — doesn’t mean it can’t be punished now.
“This is somebody who made a deliberate decision to make that cut,” Calmes said of Sunseri. “He intended to do what he did.”
Jackson attorney Ed Bushnell, who represented Sunseri, said the government did not fulfill the obligations required to enforce trail closures. Those include proper notification with conspicuous signs, he said, which the NPS did not install. He refuted that Sunseri had any criminal intent. 
The verdict could have implications for park law enforcement and trail norms in the increasingly popular world of elite mountain sports. 
A consequential route
On Sept. 2, Sunseri ran and scrambled the 13.2 miles from the Lupine Meadows parking lot to the summit of the 13,775-foot Grand Teton and back with a time of 2:50:50 — a stunning feat that broke a 12-year-old record.

The news made waves in the mountain sports world. One of Sunseri’s sponsors, The North Face, posted an announcement to its more than 5 million Instagram followers in the days following the achievement.
But on his way down the mountain, Sunseri cut a switchback while following the route of other previous record holders. He acknowledged his decision in a post on the sports tracking platform Strava, which also published a GPS track of his route showing where he cut the trail. Fastest Known Time — the organization that arbitrates and tracks official speed attempts — rejected his submission due to the offense. Not long after, park rangers issued him a citation.
Grand Teton National Park rangers gave Sunseri a ticket for violating 36CFR2.1(b), which prohibits “leaving a trail or walkway to shortcut between portions of the same trail or adjacent trail in the national park.” The citation comes with a maximum penalty of $5,000 and six months in jail. 
When offered a plea bargain of a misdemeanor conviction, five-year ban from the national park and a fine, Sunseri opted to challenge the charges, and the trial opened Tuesday morning in the Clifford P. Hansen Federal Courthouse in Jackson.
Witnesses and semantics
Over the day-and-a-half trial, eight witnesses took the stand. They included current professional athletes and older climbers who climbed the peak hundreds of times, park rangers and a trails management expert. 
Their testimony offered details on the historic conversation around and use of the switchback-cutting route; the procedures by which park rangers discern whether a citation is appropriate; the private conversations Sunseri had regarding his route and the semantics around trails considered either “established,” “maintained” or “designated.” 
While Calmes laid out evidence that rangers issued the citation simply because a violation occurred and Sunseri made a confession, Bushnell argued that the closure was not signed adequately enough to communicate the established route was closed.
This is a breaking news story and a follow up is planned. -Ed.

(Photo by Karen Pulfer Focht for Tennessee Lookout)The U.S. Department of Justice’s Civil Rights Division announced Wednesday it will close its investigation into the Memphis Police Department and retract a December 2024 report addressing constitutional violations by police. 
The DOJ found police in Memphis used excessive force, engaged in unlawful traffic stops and routinely discriminated against Black residents after a 2023 investigation spurred by the death of 23-year-old Tyre Nichols when he was beaten by police officers during a traffic stop. 
In addition to ending the Memphis case, the DOJ said in a press release it will close investigations into local law enforcement agencies in Phoenix; Oklahoma City; Trenton, New Jersey; Mt. Vernon, New York; and into the Louisiana State Police. 
The agency also will dismiss lawsuits against the Minneapolis and Louisville police departments, accusing the Biden administration — which filed the suits — of using flawed data to impose orders on the two departments to stop discrimination. 
Department of Justice opens civil rights probe of Memphis after Tyre Nichols death case

“Today, we are ending the Biden Civil Rights Division’s failed experiment of handcuffing local leaders and police departments with factually unjustified consent decrees,” said Assistant Attorney General Harmeet K. Dhillon of the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division.
Louisville police came under investigation after the shooting death of 26-year-old Breonna Taylor, who was in her apartment with her boyfriend when seven officers forced entry as part of a search for drugs. An investigation following the incident found the police had targeted the wrong apartment. 
The DOJ opened an investigation into police in Minnesota when a bystander’s video showed officer Derek Chauvin applying a chokehold to George Floyd — who was Black — in May 2020, killing Floyd. Chauvin was convicted of second- and third-degree murder and manslaughter.
Civil rights attorney Ben Crump, who represented the families of Nichols, Taylor and Floyd, called the move by the federal agency a “slap in the face” to the families. 
“By walking away from consent decrees in Minneapolis and Louisville, and closing its investigation into the Memphis Police Department while retracting findings of serious constitutional violations, the DOJ is not just rolling back reform, it is attempting to erase truth and contradicting the very principles for which justice stands,” Crump said in a statement.
“These consent decrees and investigations were not symbolic gestures, they were lifelines for communities crying out for change, rooted in years of organizing, suffering, and advocacy,” said Crump.

The Commission for Educational Quality and Accountability voted unanimously Wednesday to throw out performance expectations, known as cut scores, that the state set in 2024 and to restore the nationally aligned standard used from 2017 to 2023. Cut scores define what knowledge students should demonstrate on annual state tests to be considered proficient, or performing on grade level.
Maintaining high academic expectations, commissioners said, would shine a light on children who are struggling. 
Lowering expectations only masks poor performance and causes long-term harm to students, said Oklahoma Education Secretary Nellie Tayloe Sanders, who leads the commission.
State records show the now-discarded cut scores labeled students as proficient with significantly worse test results.

“We are committed to being a commission that is working very hard to provide truth and transparency that families can depend on to find out whether their children are ready for life after school,” Sanders said.
The Oklahoma State Department of Education developed the 2024 cut scores with committees of teachers last summer. State records show the Education Department provided the teacher committees with benchmark scores to use as guideposts. 
Although state Superintendent Ryan Walters said he wanted the agency to avoid putting a “thumb on the scale,” those guideposts suggested to the committees that they set lower expectations for student achievement on annual reading and math tests.
The commission approved the resulting cut scores in July, sending proficiency rates spiking statewide. No announcement from the Education Department explained the abrupt increase, leaving school officials suspicious and families unaware that the rising proficiency rates were a result of different scoring methods, not genuine academic improvement.
It wasn’t until news reports, including from Oklahoma Voice, revealed the cut score change that the Education Department acknowledged what happened.
Walters has since urged the commission to recalibrate the cut scores, claiming the process suffered from “political interference.”
“I’m glad that they’re taking action now,” Walters said Wednesday. “I mean, it took them forever to do it. It was pretty common sense. But look, they need to quit shifting the blame and actually do their job.”
The commission hired testing experts to study the process that produced the 2024 cut scores. 
The experts found the Education Department gave incomplete information to the commission when asking for approval of the cut scores in July.
“My opinion is you probably had less than half the information that you probably really needed to make an informed judgment,” said Chad Buckendahl, a testing expert from ACS Ventures who presented to the commission Wednesday.

Crucial information the commissioners were missing, Buckendahl said, was how the new cut scores would widen the difference between Oklahoma’s performance expectations and standards used for national testing. 
That divergence is known as the “honesty gap.”
In 2017, Oklahoma officials sought to limit the “honesty gap” by aligning the state’s cut scores with the national standards used for the Nation’s Report Card, which tests reading and math levels in all 50 states.
While national standards were integral to developing the 2017 cut scores, state documents show the Nation’s Report Card wasn’t considered when the 2024 expectations were developed.
Limiting the honesty gap is “probably the most substantial thing we could do to course correct,” Sanders said.
The Education Department should have included the commissioners and their corresponding state agency, the Office of Educational Quality and Accountability, from the beginning of the cut score setting process, Buckendahl said.
The commission is meant to give input on policy goals that are foundational to setting academic expectations for students, he said. The experts reported the Education Department still hasn’t disclosed what policy objectives it followed when directing the cut score setting process.
The commission’s vote to reject the 2024 cut scores now puts last year’s test results in doubt. 
OEQA executive director Megan Oftedal said her agency will work with the Education Department to decide how to interpret students’ scores from 2024.
She said the previous cut scores, now restored, will apply to 2025 test results.

“Congratulations!” the protesters called out to the cadets and their family members as they passed by on the sidewalk. Some of the graduation attendees thanked the protesters for their presence outside the academy. 
The protesters carried signs calling out various actions by the Trump administration, including the unlawful deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia to El Salvador, the Trump administration’s cuts to veterans services, the recent federal budget proposal that includes cuts to Medicaid, the administration’s position on Ukraine and the detention of Mahmoud Khalil, a former Columbia University student who played a strong role in pro-Palestinian protests.

While demonstrators protested right outside of the campus, Noem got a polite and warm reception from Cadet Memorial Field as she delivered a 20-minute keynote address.
“You’re the first graduating class of a brand new Coast Guard,” Noem said. “I want to share with you today what part of President Trump’s vision is for the future of this force. With your help, President Trump and I are going to make America’s Coast Guard the strongest, the most capable, the also most effective military service in the entire government.”
She highlighted recent conversations with President Donald J. Trump from the Oval Office about the needs of the Coast Guard, which, unlike other military branches, is overseen by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. And she detailed how the administration plans to “transform” the service through a new effort called “Force Design 2028.”
Protesters, meanwhile, uniformly told The Connecticut Mirror they had no problem with the Coast Guard. In fact, they expressed admiration for the service. 
“[I] highly respect the Coast Guard,” said Janet Bannister of Coventry. “I’ve known a lot of young people who have made it through. I’m just so proud of them. So yes, we hope it’s clear to people that we are pro-Coast Guard and celebrating the graduates, but … here we are.”

Montville resident Linda Ness said she was against the current federal budget proposal, particularly cuts to Medicaid and the amount of money it would add to the national debt. 
“It’s where they’re putting their money. It has nothing to do with the country[’s] needs and the people. They’re taking care of corporations, they’re taking care of the ultra-wealthy. That’s not democracy,” she said. 
Ness held a sign listing police, fire departments, hospitals and utilities as some of the benefits that the wealthy use and said she was opposed to the idea of them receiving tax cuts. 
Claudia Allen, a resident of Thompson, told CT Mirror that she’d been attending protests since Ronald Reagan was elected president. 
“ My son was sent to Iraq, and I’m a peace activist. That was horrifying, with George Bush. But even that, there were some people who were competent and who were not aligned [with] him instead of the U.S. Constitution,” said Allen. “This is the Constitution state, and she’s not upholding the Constitution, nor is that administration. That’s a big reason that I’m here.”

Immigration enforcement was another common theme among the protesters. They mentioned the violation of court orders, instances of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement apprehending people, and deportations to countries like El Salvador and South Sudan without due process. 
“[The administration] is so incompetent,” said Denise Weinschenker of Salem. “ He was supposed to drain the swamp. Instead he went into the swamp and pulled all those people out.” 
Joanne Sheehan, one of the protest’s organizers and a member of the Unify & Resist Coalition, told CT Mirror that they have organized protests in the past against U.S. Coast Guard Academy commencement speakers. She said they had counted 250 people present at the protest today but estimated that there were more. 
Sheehan said the protests were different sizes each year. Some years, only a few dozen people showed up, and others counted protesters in the hundreds. The largest, she said, was the spring after Trump was elected for the first time.

Other protesters mentioned the abrupt firing of Admiral Linda Lee Fagan in late January, a day after Trump’s inauguration.
They criticized the administration for Fagan’s dismissal, noting that she was the first woman to lead a branch of the U.S. Armed Forces and praising her focus on diversity in the Coast Guard. 
“Sexual assault has been endemic and such a problem here. And they finally get someone to clean it up, and he fires her immediately. Day one,” said Mystic resident Martha Crum. 
The firing drew condemnation from some of Connecticut’s congressional delegation at the time.
DHS officials cited issues with deployment of the Coast Guard to assist with border security, dissatisfaction with recruitment and retention, efforts surrounding diversity, equity and inclusion policies, and cost overruns on icebreakers and helicopters used in the Arctic region.
They also raised concerns about the handling of Operation Fouled Anchor, an investigation into decades of sexual misconduct claims at the Coast Guard Academy and past leaders’ decisions not to disclose a report about it to Congress. Fagan did not serve as commandant at that time but had apologized for not acting on it until CNN broke the story in 2023.

In addition to a shift in top leadership, the Coast Guard and its New London service academy have already undergone other structural changes.
Since Trump’s executive order taking aim at DEI policies, the Coast Guard has shuttered a number of DEI-related programs and offices, including the Academy’s Office of Culture and Climate.
The Coast Guard had prioritized DEI as a way to boost recruitment and retention among cadets as well as within the force. In a Coast Guard Academy diversity report submitted to Congress in 2024, Fagan wrote that such initiatives show progress was made “in attracting a workforce that is representative of the nation and preparing culturally competent leaders for the future.”
Recruitment was a big part of Noem’s keynote address Wednesday, pointing out the current shortfalls in the enlisted workforce as well as ships with incomplete crews. According to Admiral Kevin Lunday, who is currently serving as acting commandant, the Coast Guard has surpassed its annual recruitment goal and has so far recruited 4,700 new members, Noem said.

Along with recruitment, Noem said, “Force Design 2028” will aim to reorganize the service by reducing the number of admirals by 25%, replacing outdated technology, fixing crumbling infrastructure and increasing the number of icebreakers. She said the goal over the next four years is to increase the size of the Coast Guard by at least 15,000 personnel. 
“Those needs represent the biggest Coast Guard readiness crisis that we have seen since World War II,” Noem said. “That may have been the Coast Guard of the past, but that will not be the Coast Guard of the future.”
As her speech concluded, Noem made an initially unplanned announcement about the new leadership team at the Coast Guard. Among other promotions, Lunday will now be nominated for the commandant role permanently. He spoke shortly before Noem and praised the administration for its “inspiring leadership and remarkable advocacy” of the Coast Guard.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/USCGA-GRAD-0521-SR-9-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-21 17:09:47.183686

(VCU Capital News Service)Members of a Metro task force including Northern Virginia leaders reached a consensus to avoid a uniform sales tax and instead contribute to the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority’s capital projects to improve service. But some argue such a tax could be inevitable.
The urgency of the situation is highlighted by the need to address Metro’s “capital cliff,” and the ability to maintain and upgrade its infrastructure. 
On Friday, May 16, Metropolitan Washington area task force leaders supported “Option A,” which requires jurisdictions to generate sufficient revenue to cover their share of $500 million to $600 million starting in fiscal year 2028, and growing 3% each year.
The second concept, “Option B,” would have required jurisdictions to enact a sales tax.
Paul Smedberg, task force co-chair and WMATA Board of Directors First Vice Chair, said although the task force members came to a general consensus, they want to see more detail.

“They’re gonna want to see some of the algorithms or models that were used to develop this because they want to feel comfortable with it,”  Smedberg told reporters last Friday. “There’s still work to be done.”

The discussion about developing a regional Metro funding source is part of a yearlong effort to collaborate through an initiative called DMVMoves, led by Metro and the Council of Governments.
Several state lawmakers who represent the areas serviced by the transit agency urged the task force to consider taking a region-wide approach to transit workforce development by creating a partnership among multiple regional employers, and continuing the region’s commitment to providing dedicated capital funding for WMATA since 2018.
“Without future proofing the region’s capital contributions, WMATA will hit a fiscal cliff that would prevent it from tackling its backlog of state of good repair projects or from creating the fleets of the future for bus or rail operations that our region needs and deserves,” wrote Sens. Jennifer Carroll Foy, Danica Roem, Saddam Salim and Stella Pekarsky, and Dels. Michelle Maldando and Joshua Cole in a May 15 joint letter.
 How funding could help

As part of the proposal, Virginia could be responsible for an estimated $150 million to $180 million annually starting in fiscal year 2028, and that amount is likely to grow. The funding would be separate from what Metro receives from ridership, fare revenue, and contributions from the District of Columbia, Maryland, and Northern Virginia — members of the WMATA Compact.
“With this funding, either option, we are creating a sustainable revolving bond program that can meet the state of repair needs of the system, as well as implement rail operation,” said Nick Donohue, principal at Capitol Transportation Consulting.
If successful, the region would reinvest in and modernize Metro’s system. Funding could help reduce rail travel times with rail automation and advanced signaling, and improve bus services.
Rail automation would increase capacity with faster travel and more trains per hour, improve service reliability, and is projected to grow ridership and revenue.
Supporters of rail automation also say operations would be safer by reducing staff on the roadway, keeping trespassers off the tracks, and reducing track fires. But the Washington Metrorail Safety Commission said automation has contributed to train overruns — when a train doesn’t stop within the station’s platform area.
Metro is still seeking to expand automation across the entire rail system. Automation is currently only used on the red rail line, which does not run through Virginia. Automation will expand to the green and orange lines starting Friday, the transit announced on Tuesday. While the green line does not run in the commonwealth, the orange line operates from New Carrollton in Maryland to Vienna in Northern Virginia.
If automation is fully implemented, Metro would mirror rail systems in several countries where automation is already in use.

Virginia lawmakers in their letter said any plans for automatic train operation or signalling improvements must be done with “safety” and “workforce considerations” in mind. 
“All technology improvements should be paired with redundant safety features for the time when, not if, they fail to perform as expected,” the group wrote. “Workers who gave their careers to public transit should not be an afterthought in WMATA’s rush to implement cost-savings from automation.”
Funding could also improve Metro’s signal system, which guides and controls train movement, ensuring efficiency and safety. 
Metro said maintaining the system can be costly, because few vendors have parts and signals, and the infrastructure and technology are obsolete. 
 Support for investment concepts

Most task force leaders supported the option of a regional commitment. But a few said the plan could be in jeopardy if new jurisdictional leaders have different policy ideas. 
Loudoun County Supervisors Chair Phyllis Randall feared this and supported the sales tax option as jurisdictions, some of which can’t afford to pivot financially, are facing large deficits.
“If we want to use the word ‘dedicated source of revenue,’ then you get a dedicated source of revenue through a sales tax. I don’t know how you can actually literally say you get there any other way but by enacting a sales tax,” Randall said. 
“Nobody, no political official wants to say ‘Hey, we have a new tax coming up,’ but I don’t think you get there any other way. And quite frankly if we’re talking about FY28. I don’t think there’s an elected official who even knows if we’re going to be here in FY28 — I mean, we just don’t — and so we’re making promises we’re telling other people to keep and that’s never a wise thing to do either,” Randall added.

Donohue said the tax rate would not change as part of the sales tax option concept. But Fairfax County Supervisors Chair Jeff McKay, who prefers jurisdictions to commit to paying a specific amount, argued that a potential sales tax could be insufficient, which would bring everyone back to the drawing board.

The other knock against the sales tax option is that jurisdictions must manage their own revenues, McKay said, as the cost of capital projects has constantly changed. He said if the region is going to support the regional commitment option, everyone has to be on the same page, showing cooperation and protecting jurisdictions.
“The whole region has to be in on Option A because we have to go out and sell this as a regional solution,” McKay said. “The solutions are different among the jurisdictions, that’s fine, but we have to be as a region talking about a package that portends to accomplish Option A.”
 What’s next

The task force will review a full proposal for approval in the fall, allowing members to share this with jurisdictional leaders and lawmakers. Virginia’s legislature returns for its full session in January.Simultaneously, Virginia lawmakers created the Northern Virginia Growing Needs of Public Transit Joint Subcommittee, studying long-term, sustainable, dedicated operations and capital funding for Metro.

The new program is starting with just  half that amount.","In summary
To avoid regulations, Google and California agreed to commit $45 million in one year to prop up local news outlets. The new program is starting with just  half that amount. 


Google will pay $5 million less than it promised to a fund intended to help struggling California news outlets stay afloat, less than a year after committing to pay $15 million. 
The company will now pay $10 million into the initiative to fund local news which will be distributed among California news publishers, according to the office of Assemblymember Buffy Wicks, who has been involved in setting up the program. 
The announcement Wednesday came a week after Gov. Gavin Newsom proposed cutting the state’s own share of the first-year commitment to $10 million from $30 million, as California faces a $12 billion budget deficit. 
The new California Civic Media Fund will be administered by the California State Library, which will set up a board of publisher representatives to determine how to distribute it with the goal of “sustaining and enhancing community news coverage in California,” according to a news release from Wicks’ office. The library will also assess the regional availability of news coverage across California to help divvy up the money.
Library officials will oversee the fund’s public dollars to provide public oversight, while Google’s share of the money will be housed in a separate nonprofit. 
“Sustaining local journalism will take all of us — government, philanthropy, and the tech sector — stepping up together,” said Wicks.
Proponents of the new program described the money as “seed funding” and said it would attract other donations from philanthropies interested in funding local journalism — a shift from lawmakers’ initial efforts to fund local news through regulations on the tech sector. Google said it would contribute more money if the state receives private donations.
Jaffer Zaidi, a vice president at Google’s parent company Alphabet said in the release that the company is “committed” to the agreement it made last year. 
Google and California both pledged much more
In their original agreement, the state and Google each agreed to pay $10 million into the fund annually for four more years, for a total of $125 million. The funding now pledged amounts to less than half of what was promised for the program’s first year. The amount paid in future years could still change, depending on the state budget.
The tech titan agreed to the deal last August, having spent a record sum to lobby California lawmakers as they considered two bills that would have forced the company to pay to use news outlets’ published content. 
Advocates for publishers and local news have honed in on the search engine’s ability to profit from links and snippets of news content as one factor that has diminished the news industry nationwide over the past two decades. California has lost one-third of its newspapers since 2005, in a trend experts say worsens civic engagement, polarization and misinformation.
In exchange for lawmakers killing the bills last year, the company agreed to instead help the state start a fund that would have given $125 million to news outlets across California over five years. Most of that money would have come from state taxpayers, while Google also agreed to continue paying its existing grants to news organizations and to pour tens of millions of dollars into an unspecified new artificial intelligence program. 
The company will continue paying those grants, Wicks said Wednesday.
Proponents of the legislation, including news publishers, journalists’ unions and local news advocates, criticized the handshake deal for being too modest. By contrast, one of the bills would have garnered about $500 million a year in fees from Google and other platforms that link to news content, to pay for a tax credit for local journalists. 
Wicks, the author of the other bill which would have required Google, Meta and other platforms to negotiate payments directly with news outlets, said the deal was the best possible outcome in the face of stiff tech industry opposition. 
When Newsom announced the state would reduce its share of funding for the new program last week, it gave Google the opportunity to do the same: The company had only agreed to put money into the fund as a match to state dollars.

(West Virginia Office of Gov. Patrick Morrisey | Courtesy photo)Gov. Patrick Morrisey touted the state’s new “Troops to Teachers” program that aims to put veterans in classrooms while the state struggles with a teacher shortage. 
The governor called the program a “common sense solution.”
“Let’s get really smart, talented people into the classroom as quickly as possible,” Morrisey said. “It’s going to help veterans navigate the certification process, and it’s going to allow them to get into the classroom faster … It’s going to reduce some of the bureaucracy.”
He announced the program Wednesday at Hedgesville Middle School in the state’s Eastern Panhandle. 
“Veterans have certainly proven their worth for our state and for our country,” Morrisey said before ceremoniously signing the Republican-sponsored measure, Senate Bill 765, into law that created the state- level program.
The Troops-to-Teachers program helps veterans get classroom experience while they complete necessary requirements to become employed as K-12 teachers. 
Participants are required to have a bachelor’s degree and pass the state’s skills and subject matter tests in the area for which licensure is being sought. The state schools superintendent will issue teaching certificates to eligible participants.
Del. Bill Ridenour, who retired from the U.S. Marine Corps, has supported the legislation for years after his own experience looking for a career following his military service. He had hoped to be a teacher but wasn’t able to finance his education.
“West Virginia has one of the larger veteran populations in the country. We are not exploiting that resource,” said Ridenour, R-Jefferson.
He has worked on the legislation for several years ahead of its passage this year. The House of Delegates and Senate unanimously passed the bill earlier this year.
“I’m very, very proud we’re going to do this for our kids,” Ridenour said. 
Bill sponsor Sen. Tom Willis, R-Jefferson, is a West Virginia National Guard Green Beret.   “Veterans are uniquely suited to bring those qualities into our classrooms — to lead, inspire, and shape the next generation,” he said. 
Low teacher pay, PEIA issues continue 
West Virginia has the lowest teacher pay in the nation, which has contributed to the teacher shortage, particularly in border counties.
Morrisey has said he’d like to see a pay raise for teachers but hasn’t suggested legislation to accomplish it. This year, a Republican Senator proposed a bill that would have implemented locality pay for teachers; teachers in half the state’s counties could have seen a raise based on their area’s median home value. The bill didn’t get up for a full vote in the Senate, and this year’s legislative session ended without any action on teacher pay.
The state’s Public Employee Insurance Agency, which offers insurance to school employees, will see premium increases in July of 14% for state employees and 16% for local government employees in addition to out-of-pocket and copay increases. 
Union leaders representing West Virginia’s public workers have called on lawmakers to stabilize the rising costs of health care coverage for state employees. 
In April, Morrisey said he’d call a special legislative session for lawmakers to address the rising costs of the program, but no further details have been released ahead of the July price hike. 
The governor has signed several other education-focused bills this spring, including a key measure bolstering elementary teachers’ ability to remove disruptive and violent students. Other bills mandate that counties ban cell phones during classroom instructional time and that schools display a framed poster of “In God We Trust.”
West Virginia public schools continue to have some of the country’s lowest academic outcomes while serving many children in poverty, raised by grandparents and in the state’s foster care system.
“I’m committed to seeing our education system improve,” Morrisey said.

Bird is the third Democrat to announce a bid to unseat U.S. Rep. Gabe Evans, a Fort Lupton Republican who was elected in November 2024. 
“Colorado families are being squeezed by rising costs and broken promises from politicians like Donald Trump and Gabe Evans,” Bird said in a statement announcing her run. “While Trump and Evans push an agenda that’s making lives harder, I’ve dedicated my career to fighting for hardworking Coloradans. From city council to the state capitol, I’m battle-tested with a record of showing up, listening, and delivering real results.

The district is Colorado’s newest and most competitive, drawn by an independent redistricting commission after Colorado was awarded an additional congressional seat following the 2020 census. The district encompasses parts of Denver’s northern suburbs as well as more rural areas in southern Weld County.
Evans unseated former Democratic U.S. Rep. Yadira Caraveo, who was the first person to represent the district. She announced she would seek reelection in April, and Colorado state Rep. Manny Rutinel, a Commerce City Democrat, announced a bid for the seat as well. 
Bird serves on the Colorado Legislature’s powerful Joint Budget Committee, which drafts the annual state budget. She was first elected to the Legislature in 2018 after a stint on the Westminster City Council. 
With Republicans holding a slim majority in the House, the 8th District race could again prove crucial in determining control of Congress in the 2026 midterms. The National Republican Congressional Committee said the Democratic primary in the district is “a sprint to the left” and called Bird “the latest far-left liberal trying to out-extreme her opponents.” 
“Whether it’s Bird, Caraveo, or Rutinel crawling out of the wreckage, voters in Colorado will reject them just like they reject the Democrats’ extreme and out of touch agenda,” NRCC spokesperson Zach Bannon said in a statement. 
Since he was elected, Evans, who also served in the Colorado Legislature, has affirmed his support for Trump’s plans to carry out mass deportations of tens of millions of undocumented immigrants, and remained silent on the administration’s effort to end birthright citizenship. Last month, Evans voted for House Republicans’ sweeping budget resolution to cut taxes and slash social spending, and he has since falsely claimed that the plan would not force drastic cuts to Medicaid, as nonpartisan congressional budget analysts conclude that it would.

While the federal government protects animals listed under the Endangered Species Act, states are tasked with keeping the vast majority of other species out of the “emergency room.” Habitat loss, pollution and climate change are making that job much more difficult.
At the same time, states are finding it harder to count on the hunting and fishing revenues that have long funded most of their work. Agencies say they have more challenges than ever before, and less money to take them on.
In many states, lawmakers are rethinking the long-standing model for wildlife management. They’re considering new funding sources to make the agencies less reliant on license fees. They’re asking wildlife managers to expand their work beyond traditional “game” species, adding protections for threatened insects and other animals. And some are scrutinizing the commissions that have long governed wildlife management.
Some of the proposals have seen broad support from outdoors lovers who want to strengthen their wildlife agencies. Others have drawn opposition from sporting groups, who fear the new focus will diminish hunting and fishing opportunities.
“We’re seeing quite a bit of action this year,” said Logan Christian, wildlife and habitat specialist with the National Caucus of Environmental Legislators, a forum for state lawmakers. “We definitely have noticed that states are working on strengthening their wildlife agencies.”
As Stateline previously reported, New Mexico enacted the most sweeping overhaul this year. It renamed the Department of Game & Fish as the Department of Wildlife, giving it a more explicit focus on non-game species. Budget writers provided $10.5 million in new funding over the next three years to help threatened species. And lawmakers created a new process for appointing the agency’s commissioners, with guidelines ensuring a diversity of expertise and experience.
Wildlife advocates in other states say the New Mexico overhaul was a game changer. But lawmakers elsewhere are taking a more piecemeal approach.
Dollars
Numerous states are reconsidering their wildlife agencies’ funding model.
“There’s definitely a growing awareness that the current management system is outdated and really unfit for 21st century challenges,” said Michelle Lute, executive director of Wildlife for All, a nonprofit focused on overhauling state wildlife governance. “State wildlife agencies are seeing that they can’t rely on hunting and fishing license fees to be able to do this work.”

Earlier this year, lawmakers in Utah enacted a new tax on wind and solar projects that will help fund the state’s wildlife agency. The revenue could double the department’s funding to protect non-game species, from $5 million to $10 million.
“We have a funding model in place for game species,” said Paul Thompson, administrator of the Species Protection Account with the Utah Division of Wildlife Resources. “Funding to work on some of our native species programs has been really hard to come by.”
The new revenue could allow the agency to invest in more biologists, conservation easements, watershed restoration projects and native fish hatchery programs. State Rep. Casey Snider, the Republican who sponsored the bill, argued that the clean energy sector should pay because its development is harming Utah’s habitat.
“Wind and solar projects have an outsized impact on [non-game] species, and they have not been contributing financially,” he said.
But industry leaders said the law will threaten the state’s energy development.
“[The measure will] severely strain the economics of an existing project and send a negative message to developers and the financial institutions that provide capital for these projects,” said Theresa Foxley, chief of staff to rPlus Energies, a renewable developer, in testimony to lawmakers.
Lawmakers in Oregon are considering an increase to the state’s tax on hotel and short-term rental stays to help fund non-game wildlife work. The proposal would bring in about $30 million annually. State Rep. Ken Helm, the bill’s Democratic sponsor, said the state wildlife agency’s division to manage non-game species “has come and gone over the last 30 years as funding is available.”
Growing concerns about climate change and biodiversity have created urgency to find a stable funding source, he said. Helm said the lodging tax is a logical source, because the state’s tourism industry is centered on the outdoors. He noted that Oregon’s natural resources agencies receive only a tiny fraction of the state’s general revenue.
Travel and tourism groups oppose the bill, arguing it could drive visitors elsewhere. Helm has also proposed a bill that would bring in wildlife funding through an income tax increase.
He said his message to fellow lawmakers was: “I’ve given you two ways to get the money we need for this agency. Nobody’s been able to come up with a better idea. Just pick one.”
The bill was heard in committee earlier this month, but has not yet advanced.
As states rethink wildlife management, New Mexico offers a new model

Meanwhile, lawmakers in Hawaii approved a “green fee” — a lodging tax increase of 0.75% that Democratic Gov. Josh Green’s office estimates will bring in $100 million annually to help protect the state from climate change. While the fund is not explicitly focused on wildlife, it’s expected to contribute to efforts such as coral reef restoration and watershed protection that will benefit important habitats.
State Rep. Amy Perruso, a Democrat who was among the advocates for a green fee, said the COVID-19 pandemic was a wakeup call.
“With the absence of tourists, we saw a lot more fish in the ocean, everything about the environment was so much more healthy because we didn’t have 10 million extra people,” she said. “If we’re going to do something to protect the environment, [tourism] is a logical connection.”
Washington state was among the first to significantly invest in non-game conservation through state tax revenue, with legislation enacted two years ago. The budget passed by lawmakers this session continues that work, with $14 million set aside for biodiversity and species recovery each of the next two years.
Lawmakers in Kansas and North Carolina also proposed using more general fund revenue for wildlife work, although those measures have not advanced.
Mission
In other states, lawmakers are focused on expanding their wildlife agencies’ mission to more non-game species. Last year, Colorado gave wildlife managers the authority to manage insects and other invertebrates, as well as rare plants.
“Invertebrates are wildlife, and their conservation benefits the entire ecosystem, including the species [state wildlife officials] traditionally managed,” said Richard Reading, vice chair of the Colorado Parks and Wildlife Commission. “They do everything from creating our soils to filtering our water to pollinating the food we eat.”
Reading also serves as vice president of science and conservation at the Butterfly Pavilion, an insect zoo. He noted that studies are showing that many invertebrate species are in rapid decline. In addition to expanding the agency’s authority, lawmakers provided funding for six staff members to take on the additional work.
A similar bill in Nevada, focused on invertebrates, advanced through the Assembly’s natural resources committee.
“There’s definitely concerns about declines in pollinator species,” said Assemblymember Howard Watts, a Democrat who sponsored the bill. “Our wildlife agency can and should take proactive action to do research, surveys and habitat improvement to keep these species off the [endangered species list].”
Watts said the bill would allow wildlife managers to consider insects in state plans to protect imperiled species. He said the Nevada Department of Wildlife has requested an entomologist position if it’s asked to take on the additional species. Beyond that, he said, the measure would not require additional money, as it’s focused on voluntary, proactive work, rather than additional regulations.
State wildlife agencies focus on ‘hook and bullet’ work. Some see a new path.

Another bill in Pennsylvania would expand wildlife managers’ authority to include insects. That measure has been approved by the House Environmental and Natural Resources Protection Committee.
Sporting groups have largely been supportive of efforts to provide new funding sources to manage non-game species. But some are skeptical of plans to expand agencies’ mission without an increase in revenue.
“Most hunters and anglers understand that healthy game populations are dependent on ecosystem integrity,” said Devin O’Dea, Western policy and conservation manager with Backcountry Hunters & Anglers, a nonprofit focused on public lands. “But when you take a model that’s been developed with the intent of enforcing regulations for fish and game species, expand that scope without funding and additional capacity, it’s a recipe for something to fall off the plate.”
Governance
Meanwhile, some legislators want to rethink the commission model that oversees wildlife governance. Critics say that governors often select commissioners who are hunting guides, farmers and political donors. Once appointed, they enact wildlife policies to suit their economic interests.
Florida state Rep. Anna V. Eskamani, a Democrat, drafted a bill that would overhaul the state’s Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission. Her proposal would increase the board from seven to nine members. It would designate seats for scientists, conservationists, local officials, farmers, hunters and anglers.
“The commission has made decisions not based on science or conservation, but based on developers or landowners that engage in agricultural practices,” she said. “We tried to strike a balance to ensure there are voices with an environmental background, with a conservation and wildlife background, with an academic background.”
The bill did not advance, but Eskamani said grassroots support is building for systemic changes in wildlife management.
Some sporting groups are more wary of commission overhaul proposals.
“We have seen examples where proposed changes to commissions were politically motivated or motivated by anti-hunting and anti-angling interests,” said Kent Keene senior manager for Western states and agriculture policy with the Congressional Sportsmen’s Foundation, a group that promotes hunting and fishing priorities on Capitol Hill. “When those changes are focused on science-based needs, then the sportsmen’s community has a long history of supporting those steps to ensure we are protecting our heritage.”
Some hunting and fishing groups have emphasized that the expanded mission should come with additional funding, so agencies aren’t stretched thin. Keene noted that hunters and anglers pay an excise tax on the purchase of gear, which provides an important funding source for wildlife agencies. Some have proposed a similar “backpack tax” on gear for hikers, birdwatchers and others.
Another proposal in New Hampshire would give the wildlife agency’s executive director the authority to make policy decisions, relegating the Fish and Game Commission to an advisory body. That bill did not advance.

According to a news release from the Indianola college, no timeline for the search has been established, but the college’s board of trustees expects to have appointed an interim leader in time for the 2025-2026 school year to begin.
Until an interim president is found, former board of trustees chair Terry Handley will continue to serve as acting president of the institution, the release stated. He was chosen for the role days after he and the rest of the campus community heard the news that Jay Byers, who had served as president since 2023, died in the president’s residence on campus.
“Our intent is to move forward with both prudence and expediency,” said Board of Trustees Acting Chair Terry Lillis in the release. “We will leverage our extensive network of contacts to identify strong candidates who would be best positioned to lead Simpson through this challenging time of transition.”

Free.,"Trump administration violated order in deportations to South Sudan, judge says",Ariana Figueroa,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-administration-violated-order-deportations-south-sudan-judge-says,,"WASHINGTON — A federal judge in Boston Wednesday found the Trump administration violated his preliminary injunction barring third-country removals of migrants without due process, after immigration lawyers say their clients were placed on deportation flights to South Sudan.“It was impossible for these people to have a meaningful opportunity to object to their transfer to South Sudan,"" U.S. District Judge Brian E. Murphy said. “The government’s actions in this case are unquestionably violative of this court's order.”Murphy said he will narrowly tailor a remedy to the violation of his April order. He said the Trump administration must give proper due process to the eight men who were placed on deportation flights on Tuesday and given less than 24 hours to challenge their removal to South Sudan.South Sudan, in East Africa, is violence-ridden and the U.S. State Department advises against travel there.Department of Justice attorneys would not confirm where the plane landed, but according to flight tracking data reviewed by the New York Times, there is a chartered plane owned by a company used in the past for deportations that has landed in the East African nation of Djibouti.Murphy did not detail what contempt charges would look like, but asked Department of Justice attorneys for a list of names of people involved in the flights for potential consequences.The hearing in Massachusetts is one of several clashes between the Trump administration and the judiciary branch over the issue of due process in immigration enforcement, as the Trump administration aims to enact mass deportations.The White House in a statement attacked Murphy as a “far-left activist judge” trying to protect migrants with criminal convictions. The list of individuals the White House said were on the flight were from Cuba, Laos, Mexico, South Sudan, Burma and Vietnam.Flight originated in TexasAn hour before Wednesday’s hearing, top Department of Homeland Security officials at a press conference defended the decision, but declined to confirm if the migrants were sent to South Sudan and argued the country was not their “final destination.”However, U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement Acting Director Todd Lyons said that South Sudan had agreed to take the men.“We conducted a deportation flight from Texas to remove some of the most barbaric violent individuals illegally in the United States,” DHS spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin said at the press event.McLaughlin said that the men were still in DHS custody.Murphy, appointed by former President Joe Biden, has not ordered the Trump administration to return any of the men. At the hearing, he did question a top ICE official in Texas, Marcos Charles, and directed him to find out if it were possible to hold credible fear interviews for the men instead of requiring they be returned to the U.S.Immigration attorneys who last night had asked for the emergency hearing pushed for the immigrants to be brought back to the U.S.DOJ attorney Drew Ensign disagreed and said that any remedy from Murphy should be narrowly tailored and that ordering the men to be returned would be “too broad.”Ensign also said the Trump administration’s position is that 24 hours is enough time for an immigrant to challenge their removal to a country that is not their home.Trina Realmuto, of the National Immigration Litigation Alliance, argued 30 days is preferable, because many of those removed do not have legal representation and need time to find an attorney and determine if they could face possible harm in another country.Murphy said that he would clarify how much time is appropriate. He directed DOJ attorneys to make sure that everyone involved in third-country removals, from pilots to immigration officers, to be aware of his order and the possible criminal contempt charges if it’s not followed.On late Tuesday, in an emergency hearing, Murphy ordered the government to keep the eight migrants in DHS custody until more details could be revealed in Wednesday's hearing to determine if his April order was violated.In that earlier order, Murphy barred the Trump administration from removing individuals from a country that is not their home country without giving them time to raise any concerns that they might face harm in the country they would be removed to.Repeated conflicts between administration and judgesSending migrants to South Sudan would bring the same concerns as sending them to Libya, another third country with a history of clashes.The Trump administration extended Temporary Protection Status to nationals of South Sudan for six months to remain in the U.S., meaning those immigrants were granted work permits and deportation protections because their home country was deemed too dangerous to return to. In early May, Murphy warned Trump officials that any deportations to a third country such as Libya and Saudi Arabia — countries with human rights violations that the Trump administration was considering for deportations — would have clearly violated his April preliminary injunction. It’s not the first conflict between federal judges and the Trump administration.A federal judge in Maryland grilled Department of Justice lawyers and accused the administration of stonewalling information on its efforts to return a wrongly deported man from El Salvador. Another federal judge in Maryland ordered the return of a separate wrongly deported man to an El Salvador prison, an order that the DOJ is currently appealing.A federal judge in the District of Columbia ordered the administration to return deportation planes to the U.S. carrying men removed under the wartime Alien Enemies Act of 1798, but the planes landed in El Salvador to take the migrants to the notorious prison CECOT. The judge threatened possible contempt against the Trump administration.The U.S. Supreme Court on Friday again rejected a request from the Trump administration to remove its block on using the Alien Enemies Act over concerns about due process.The Trump administration in March invoked the Alien Enemies Act to apply to Venezuelans 14 and older with suspected gang ties to rapidly deport them, raising concerns about a lack of due process.",,,,2025-05-21 16:06:54.990157
,California,2025-05-21 19:35:35+00:00,CalMatters,Fraud pushes California’s community colleges to consider an application fee. Is it worth it?,Adam Echelman,,,,,https://calmatters.org/education/higher-education/2025/05/community-colleges-california/,"Faced with increasing financial aid fraud, the board of California’s community colleges is considering ways to charge students an application fee and tighten its identity verification process. Students are pushing back.","In summary
Faced with increasing financial aid fraud, the board of California’s community colleges is considering ways to charge students an application fee and tighten its identity verification process. Students are pushing back. 


Under scrutiny from state and federal lawmakers, California’s community colleges are trying to crack down on financial aid fraud. Scammers have increasingly infiltrated the state’s 116 community colleges, posing as students in an effort to steal financial aid from the state and federal government.   
At a meeting Tuesday, the board that oversees California’s community colleges voted to require all students to verify their identity, which is currently optional for most applicants. The board also considered asking the Legislature for approval to charge students a nominal application fee — which many said should be no more than $10. But after more than two hours of debate, the board rejected that proposal and instead asked staff to “explore” a fee policy.
“Some of you were asking questions, ‘Why is this happening so fast?’” said California Community Colleges Chancellor Sonya Christian. “Because on April 8, CalMatters ran an article that got national press. Guess what happened after that? Nine of our congressional leaders emailed the Secretary of Education of the United States and emailed the Attorney General asking them to start an investigation of the California Community Colleges.”
State representatives from both parties have since called for an audit of the community college system’s financial aid process. Christian said those audits are likely to happen. “We’re on a national stage right now.”
Students from across the state told board members that they were against imposing a fee, sharing stories of times when they were so poor that they didn’t have a bank account or $10 to buy lunch. Many had personal experiences with fake students. 
“A bot once took my seat in a class that I needed to graduate and transfer. That fraud almost cost me my future,” said Flo Cudal, a student at Santiago Canyon College in Orange County. “I understand the need for strong protections, but they must not come at the expense of excluding a real student.”
When Love Adu, a student and board member, tried to enroll at Moorpark College, she said she was unable to verify her identity online, so she had to drive five hours to present her documents in person. Incarcerated students, undocumented students, homeless students and students under 18 all struggle with the current ID verification software, she said. “These proposals would make it harder for students to get the very education that we’re trying to serve to them.”
Application fee delayed
California’s community colleges have a mission to serve every Californian and they’re funded primarily based on the number of students they enroll. When applying, students sign an affidavit affirming that their personal information is true. But besides that, only a few college districts mandate online identity verification. There is no fee to apply to community college and tuition is free for low-income students. Once enrolled, a student can obtain thousands of dollars in financial aid, money that can be used to cover the cost of books, housing, food and transportation. 
That aid has become an easy target for scammers, who often submit dozens or hundreds of applications at a time, using real California addresses and Social Security numbers in order to create fraudulent college accounts. Last month, CalMatters reported that roughly one-third of community college applicants were fake. The state chancellor’s office said it removed all the fraudulent applicants it detected but many scammers evaded detection and stole taxpayer dollars. In the last 12 months alone, colleges have lost more than $10 million in federal aid to fraud and $3 million in state aid, according to state reports, which CalMatters obtained through a public records request.  
Allowing fraud to continue to rise is “irresponsible,” said board member Amy Costa before voting in favor of Christian’s proposal. These “bots” are after government entitlement programs, such as Pell Grants and Cal Grants, and it’s the state’s job to help steward the use of those taxpayer dollars, she said. “We need somebody to say ‘I’m a real person,’ and payment is sort of one of the ways we do that.” 
In the proposal, Christian said her office would consider refunding or crediting the application fee to any student with “a demonstrated financial hardship.” Roughly 40% of California’s community community college students qualify for free tuition because they’re considered low-income, according to state data.
Even if the fee proposal had passed, Christian would still need the Legislature’s approval. It would have taken a year and involved many more discussions, including at the board level, Christian said.
But if lawmakers continue to keep the spotlight on this issue, changes could still happen, said Chris Ferguson, an executive vice chancellor with the state chancellor’s office. “If financial aid fraud were to continue to increase, I assure you, at a certain point, there will be measures, whether it’s at the state level or the federal level, that are implemented on us.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/053023_Community-College-Budget_LJ_CM_02.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-05-21 16:06:54.990157

The committee voted unanimously to advance Bradbury’s nomination for a seat on the Rhode Island Public Utilities Commission. (Screenshot/Capitol TV)Gov. Dan McKee’s pick to fill the open seat on the Rhode Island Public Utilities Commission (PUC) won easy approval from a Senate panel Tuesday.
The Senate Committee on Commerce’s unanimous vote advances Karen Bradbury’s nomination to the full Senate for a confirmation vote, likely next week, said Greg Pare, a Senate spokesperson. If approved, Bradbury, who works as a program administrator for the Rhode Island Office of Energy Resources, would fill the $139,000-a-year post on the PUC, left vacant after former commissioner John Revens resigned in December.
Bradbury’s experience and leadership in government and energy programs drew praise during the brief Senate panel hearing Tuesday. Supporters spanned her 20-year career in state and federal government work, including 14 years with U.S. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, according to her resume, obtained by Rhode Island Current. She joined the state energy resources office in December 2022, earning $108,900 as legislation and programs administrator. 
Neither Bradbury nor state lawmakers mentioned her marriage to Pat Crowley, president of the influential Rhode Island AFL-CIO. Crowley in an interview Wednesday declined to comment on her appointment. Crowley referred additional questions to McKee’s office.
“Ms. Bradbury’s qualifications spoke for themselves,” Olivia Da Rocha, a spokesperson for McKee’s office, said in response to questions Wednesday.
DaRocha did not comment on how many other candidates were considered for the position.
Former colleagues from Providence law firm Duffy & Sweeney Ltd, where Bradbury worked as a paralegal from 2004 to 2008, also spoke and wrote in favor of her nomination to the PUC.
“I’ve known Karen over 20 years,” Jean Harrington, partner at Duffy & Sweeney, told the committee Tuesday. “She has an uncanny ability to enter a chaotic situation, stand back, and say, ‘OK, this is what we need to do.’ She doesn’t get frazzled.”
That calm-under-pressure personality proved particularly important during her two-and-a-half years with the state energy resources office, which included overseeing renewable energy rebates funded through Biden-era congressional spending. Chris Kearns, acting director for the energy resources office and Bradbury’s boss, described her ability to manage abrupt federal funding cuts, grant applications on tight deadlines, and readying fuel supplies with local terminal providers ahead of winter snowstorms.
“Karen has all the personal and professional attributes you would want in a commissioner for the PUC,” Kearns told the Senate committee.
The high-profile appointment to the three-person regulatory body carries extra weight amid rising frustration over utility costs and profits held by Rhode Island Energy. Addressing the panel Tuesday, Bradbury acknowledged the struggles faced by working families and frontline communities while advancing the state’s greenhouse gas emission reductions. 
“If confirmed, it will be my job to ensure all the pieces fit together in a way that is beneficial to ratepayers and businesses,” Bradbury said.
However, she stopped short of making promises on rate cuts when Rhode Island Energy submits its biannual electric rate prices this fall. 
“I don’t want to prejudice any proceeding,” Bradbury said in response to questions by Sen. Victoria Gu, a Westerly Democrat. “I will keep all of that in mind, and look at the evidence presented before the commission.”
The utilities commission by law cannot reject the state utility provider’s proposed supply-side prices, as long as they do not include an extra markup beyond what it costs to purchase power directly from third-party suppliers. However, the commission has more authority over service-side charges and has scaled back Rhode Island Energy’s proposed investments in capital infrastructure projects in acknowledgement of the extra costs to customers.
In announcing Bradbury as his pick to the commission on May 14, McKee touted her experience in state and federal energy policy.
“Karen’s expertise in energy policy, combined with a proven track record of delivering real results for Rhode Island—from securing major federal funding to launching innovative programs—makes her uniquely qualified to take on this role,” McKee said in a statement. “Her commitment to advancing clean, affordable energy will be an asset to the Commission.”
A lifelong Rhode Islander, Bradbury has a bachelor’s degree in political science from Providence College and a master’s degree in labor and industrial relations from the University of Rhode Island.
If confirmed, Bradbury will fill the rest of Revens’ six-year term, which expires March 1, 2027.

Photo by Madison McVan/Minnesota Reformer.Four days before the five-year anniversary of the police murder of George Floyd, the Trump administration’s Department of Justice said it no longer intends to enforce Minneapolis Police Department reforms agreed to by the Biden administration. 
In the aftermath of Floyd’s murder, the Biden-led DOJ spent two years investigating the Minneapolis Police Department. Investigators found that the department routinely deprived people of their rights and discriminated against Black and Native American people. Investigators estimated MPD stopped Black people at 6.5 times the rate at which it stopped white people and Native American people at 7.9 times the rate at which it stopped white people. 
The investigation culminated in an agreement — called a “consent decree” — between the DOJ and the city of Minneapolis on a set of reforms. 
The Trump DOJ’s decision to drop the consent decree — and with it, close supervision of MPD — underscores the administration’s desire to give a freer hand to police. The department is also backing out of a similar decree in Louisville, where police shot and killed Breonna Taylor in her apartment in March 2020.
“The United States no longer believes that the proposed consent decree would be in the public interest,” DOJ attorneys wrote in a two-paragraph motion asking a federal judge to toss out the agreement with the city of Minneapolis. 
For years, Trump has derided efforts to rein in police brutality and scorned the rights of the accused. “(T)he laws are so horrendously stacked against us, because for years and years, they’ve been made to protect the criminal … [n]ot the officers,” he said during his first term.
The DOJ’s heel-turn on racial justice in law enforcement is showing up in Minnesota in other ways. 
In early May, the DOJ opened a civil rights investigation into the Hennepin County Attorney’s Office and County Attorney Mary Moriarty, after Moriarty instructed prosecutors to consider the racial identity of defendants when deciding how long of a sentence to ask for. Moriarty said the policy is constitutional and is meant to combat systemic racism in the criminal legal system that leads to longer sentences for Black and Indigenous defendants. 
“As a longtime prosecutor, I firmly believe in the paramount importance of a colorblind criminal justice system,” Attorney General Pamela Bondi said in a news release. “This Department of Justice will avail itself of every tool at its disposal to protect all Americans from illegal DEI discrimination.”
While the federal consent decree is on its way out, a similar agreement at the state level will remain in effect. The state Department of Human Rights also entered into a consent decree with the city in 2023.
The state’s court-enforcable consent decree limits officers’ use of force; requires police to de-escalate; prohibits certain pretextual stops; and restricts the use of chemical irritants and Tasers.
The nonprofit firm Effective Law Enforcement For All, which was hired as an independent monitor, released a semi-annual report this week. The report said progress toward the consent decree’s goals has been steady, if slow at times, the Star Tribune reported. 
Among other provisions, the federal consent decree would have prohibited: 

Handcuffing children under the age of 14. 
The use of neck restraints and choke holds.
The use of some tear gases, including Mace. 
The initiation of foot chases just because a person runs away when they see an officer.
Off-duty jobs for officers who are under investigation or suspended from the force.

It also set guidelines for misconduct investigations, requiring them to be completed within 180 days, with some exceptions. MPD’s disciplinary process had been notoriously slow and ineffective, as the Reformer reported in 2020. 
The DOJ’s investigation into the Minneapolis Police Department revealed systemic problems: racist policing practices; use of excessive force, including against restrained people; failure to address bias; and failure to intervene or investigate when an officer violates the law or department rules. 
The department failed to provide medical aid to people it injured. When police shot a Black man in 2018, officers waited at least 11 minutes — when video of the incident ended — to help him. 
Investigators found that officers fired weapons in situations that posed no threat to their lives. A “significant portion” of the 19 police shootings that occurred between January 2016 and August 2022 were unconstitutional uses of force, according to the DOJ report.
The 17 DFL state lawmakers representing Minneapolis condemned the DOJ’s motion to toss out the consent decree.
“We are deeply disappointed that the federal government is abandoning its responsibility to drive reform at the Minneapolis Police Department,” the Minneapolis delegation said in a joint statement. “For years, Minneapolis community members have spoken out to make their voices heard as part of this process, and now their work and commitment have been disregarded by the federal government.”
The DOJ’s refusal to enforce the consent decree comes as the city of Minneapolis prepares for a potential pardon of Derek Chauvin, the former MPD officer convicted of murdering Floyd. Right-wing figureheads like Rep. Marjorie Taylor Green, R-Georgia, and commentator Ben Shapiro have asked Trump to pardon Chauvin in recent weeks.
Chauvin was sentenced to 22 ½ years in prison on state murder and manslaughter charges in 2021. The following year, he pleaded guilty to federal charges, and a judge ordered him to serve 21 years in federal prison, concurrent with his state sentence. 
A presidential pardon would only erase the federal charges; Chauvin would then return to state prison to finish his sentence. 
Trump has repeatedly shown a willingness to pardon his political allies or at the behest of his political allies. Among the first acts of his second term was the blanket pardon of some 1,500 Jan. 6 rioters.
Among the injured that day were 140 police officers.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/P1208011-2048x1365-1-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-05-21 16:06:54.990157

(Photo: Brandon Kingdollar / NC Newsline)Immigrant rights advocates called on a crowd of about 100 to stand up against bills targeting undocumented immigrants in the state as part of an Immigrant Rights Advocacy Day demonstration outside the North Carolina General Assembly Wednesday.
Speakers from the ACLU of North Carolina, the Education Justice Alliance, the Carolina Migrant Network, Muslim Women For, and El Pueblo rallied on the lawn of the Legislative Building and denounced a set of four bills as part of a broader anti-immigrant agenda by lawmakers. After the demonstration, they split up into groups to talk to legislators and leave informational materials with their offices and marched to the Governor’s Mansion to deliver a petition demanding the veto of the bills.
The four bills seek to crack down on undocumented immigrants in a variety of ways: House Bill 318 requires sheriffs cooperate with ICE; Senate Bill 153 does the same for state law enforcement; House Bill 261 increases the felony level of criminal charges against defendants with past immigration-related offenses; and House Bill 690 requires state agencies and universities to vet the immigration status of benefit recipients.
Fernando Martinez, an organizing director with the Education Justice Alliance, urged lawmakers to “stop playing politics with our families.” He denounced North Carolina politicians for “painting us as criminals” who are “invading this country” and stressed that immigrants are neighbors, colleagues, and classmates who make up a fundamental part of the community.
“We go to prayer houses together. We serve and produce food. We are teachers, we are nurses, we are building this state — literally,” Martinez said. “Immigrants belong here, [we] are North Carolinians — and stop pushing us out.”
America Juarez, a coordinator for the Carolina Migrant Network, said families in Charlotte are living in fear of ICE, alleging that agents in unmarked vehicles have been detaining employees at their places of work and children at school in an expansive operation that began May 12. She said her organization has received more than 133 calls for help in just over a week, and warned that provisions in the bills expanding cooperation with ICE would only worsen this crackdown.
“When federal agents in unmarked vehicles and civilian abduct members in our community, our neighbors, our coworkers, our families, it does not make North Carolina safer, it makes us all less safe,” Juarez said. “For our elected officials, your silence is complicit. Will you stand by as children in your district lose their parents?”
Nora Khalifa, an organizer with Muslim Women For, said such “intimidation tactics” have had a tangible impact on her community. She said she’s noticed people who no longer come to worship services out of fear that they might be detained by ICE and has heard from people who avoid public spaces as much as possible for the same reason.
Closing the demonstration, Maria Fernanda Najera-Aguilar of El Pueblo said she prays for the safety of her family and friends every day amid the ongoing mass detention of immigrants, and in particular, last year’s House Bill 10, which required sheriffs to follow ICE detention orders. She urged lawmakers to take a stand for “basic human rights.”
“How can we pursue happiness and achieve aspirations when peace and security are constantly under threat?” she asked. “I stand here today not just to speak, but to remind you that we are watching, we are organizing, and we are not going anywhere.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/P5211878-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-05-21 16:06:54.990157

(Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)Minnesota lawmakers continued meeting mostly behind closed doors Wednesday to come to an agreement on the biggest budget bills to fund state government, including education and health and human services.
Lawmakers have a self-imposed deadline of 5 p.m. Wednesday to finish their work, which they will likely blow through. They are trying to come to an agreement on over a dozen budget and policy bills after the narrowly divided Legislature adjourned Monday.
Gov. Tim Walz has said he will not call legislators back for a special session until all the budget bills are agreed to in the tied 67-67 House and in the Senate, where Democrats have a one seat majority. Only Walz can call lawmakers back into session, but only legislators can adjourn once they’re in session.
Lawmakers are working to pass a $66 billion to $67 billion two-year budget that will fund everything from schools to parks to health care and services for people with disabilities. The state is grappling with a structural deficit that’s arisen from the rapidly increasing costs of special education and caring for an aging population. Given the Republican refusal to agree to any new tax revenue, lawmakers are looking to trim spending.
Most consequentially, Gov. Tim Walz and DFL leaders agreed — at Republicans’ behest — to remove undocumented adults from MinnesotaCare, the state’s subsidized health insurance for the working poor. Children will still be enrolled.
Lawmakers have to pass a budget by June 30 or the government will shut down.
Legislators over the past few days have been meeting in informal “working groups,” which include members of both parties from the House and Senate. If the working groups can’t come to an agreement by Wednesday, legislative leaders and Walz will take over negotiations.
The only working group to meet in public has been taxes; Senate and House members have exchanged several offers. But the working group has frequently adjourned on recesses to consider the offers in private.
Open government advocates have criticized the private nature of the legislative work.
“The public has ZERO way of knowing who to hold accountable,” Common Cause Minnesota wrote on X.
The Star Tribune reported that one of their reporters was kicked out of a working group meeting.
House DFL caucus leader Melissa Hortman told reporters on Monday that negotiations must occur behind closed doors, especially among leadership, so they can speak candidly.
“It just doesn’t work. You need people to be able to say what’s their bottom line and to make their emotional pitch,” Hortman said. “People have to really show their cards, so that is a space that has not ever and probably will not ever be transparent.”
Hortman said that if lawmakers can’t reach a deal by Friday, they will have to work over Memorial Day weekend. The earliest a special session could occur is Friday, she said, though next week is more likely.
Walz said he would like to pass a budget before June 1, because that’s when the state will be obligated to send layoff notices to state employees if there is no budget by then, and leaders want to avoid that.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/NN250507_0817-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-05-21 16:06:54.990157

The Indiana Office of Energy Development launched the $182 million federally funded program last week, aimed at reducing utility costs, improving home comfort and boosting energy efficiency for homeowners, tenants, landlords and contractors. 
According to the release, this first-come, first-served program aligns with Indiana Gov. Mike Braun’s mission to enhance affordability and promote sustainable living across the state. 
“Cutting energy costs is at the very heart of what we are focused on,” Braun said in the release. “The Indiana Energy Saver Program prioritizes practical solutions to improve energy affordability and deliver quality products.”
Starting this summer, eligible applicants can receive a no-cost energy audit to find potential energy-saving improvements. Following the audit, participants can access two rebate programs: the Home Efficiency Rebate and the Home Appliance Rebate. Each rebate amount depends on household income and project type. 
The HOMES program funds energy efficiency upgrades including insulation, air sealing, duct sealing, and Energy Star-certified heating, cooling, water heaters, appliances and lighting. Low-income households earning less than 80% of the county’s area median income can receive rebates up to 100% of project costs.
The HEAR program targets households earning less than 150% of the area median income. It provides subsidies for energy-efficient appliances and systems such as heat pump water heaters, HVAC systems, clothes dryer, electric stoves, cooktops, ranges, ovens and electrical system enhancements. 
“The Indiana Office of Energy Development is committed to affordable energy solutions to all Hoosiers,” said Jon Ford, executive director of IOED. “The Indiana Energy Saver Program is an important instrument in our all of the above strategy that strengthens our efforts to decrease energy costs and enhance home comfort for consumers.”
The IOED is partnering with Vincent Village, Inc., a Fort Wayne organization that provides housing and supportive services for families experiencing homelessness. Together, they are launching the program’s first pilot project, investing $60,000 to upgrade four homes with energy efficient improvements. 
Hoosiers can learn more about the required documentations needed for the application and apply here.

(AnnMarie Hilton/ Maine Morning Star) Though there are still funding details to sort out, a slate of proposals brought forward after 1,500 gallons of toxic firefighting foam concentrate spilled in Brunswick last August have been backed by the Maine Legislature. 
“Since August 19, 2024, hardly a day has gone by where our delegation hasn’t put work into an entire suite of legislation both to help Brunswick recover and, even more importantly, to make sure that what happened to us cannot happen anywhere else,” said Rep. Dan Ankeles (D-Brunswick) on the House of Representatives floor earlier this month.
On Wednesday, the Senate passed the last of a package of three bills that Ankeles crafted in the aftermath of the spill to help rid Maine of Aqueous Film Forming Foam, also known as AFFF, which was historically used for firefighting and has been linked to harmful effects to humans and the environment. 
Accidents not waiting to happen

The final proposal to receive initial passage votes would establish a voluntary, statewide takeback program for the foam. The Senate approved LD 222 30-0, and it will now go back to each chamber for final enactment votes. 
AFFF contains perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances, also known as PFAS, which has been linked to serious long-term health problems including cancer. Knowing these concerns, the state restricted use of the foam in 2021, but it is still stored at airports, fire stations and other industrial sites throughout the state.
Ankeles’ bills received sweeping bipartisan support from the Legislature’s Environment and Natural Resources Committee, as well as the chambers at large. However, two of the bills have been sent to the budget committee to determine whether they will be funded. 
Another bill in the package, LD 407, directs the quasi-governmental agency that manages the airport where the spill happened, called the Midcoast Regional Redevelopment Authority, to stop using and get rid of the toxic firefighting foam that is still at the site. Since the bill doesn’t tap into state funds, Ankeles said he’s working with the agency to secure the funding it will need to get rid of the chemicals. 
“Getting this resolve to the chief executive’s desk will help my constituents — and Rep. [Cheryl] Golek’s constituents just a couple of streets over — rest a tiny bit easier knowing that the toxic AFFF will never again be deployed in our community,” Ankeles said last week before the bill received a 128-14 vote in the House.
LD 407 received final enactment votes this week and will be sent to Gov. Janet Mills for her approval. 
Ankeles’ two bills awaiting funding are meant to not only protect Brunswick but all Maine communities from future toxic spills. 
Those two proposals are LD 400, which will create a publicly available inventory of the firefighting foam in the state, and LD 222. These will not only help the state know how much of the toxic foam still exists, but also assist fire departments that don’t have the budgets to properly dispose of it. 
After approval from both chambers, LD 400 was placed on the special appropriations table in late April with a fiscal note of about $86,000 annually for the next two years. That money would be used to cover the cost of a new position to compile the inventory. 
While it is now up to the Appropriations and Financial Affairs Committee, Ankeles said he is hopeful it will get funded after he worked with the Department of Environmental Protection to find a way to fund the proposal without using the state’s general fund. 
With a $5 million fiscal note, LD 222 will likely also end up on the appropriations table. It will first go back to the House for a final enactment vote and then return to the Senate. 
Since the bill asks for one-time funding rather than ongoing support, Ankeles hopes that will put it in a better position to be funded in a tight budget-cycle. However, he said he is also going to advocate for the Environment and Natural Resources Committee to rank LD 222 as the committee’s top priority to receive funding from the budget committee. 
Of all the bills the committee worked on this session that will cost money, Ankeles said this takeback program could have the “biggest impact.” 
“It will create the infrastructure with a single spending action that is not ongoing and the state will be able to get rid of every drop of this terrible poison,” he said.

(Photo by Michael Moline/Florida Phoenix)Florida’s strict new law on ballot initiatives faces its first test in court on Thursday when Chief U.S. District Judge Mark Walker hears arguments about whether to block provisions in HB 1205.
Several groups — including the organization that wants voters to expand Medicaid in the state — have challenged the law passed by the Republican-controlled Legislature that was a top priority for Gov. Ron DeSantis. Critics of the new law contend it will make it nearly impossible for outside groups to place initiatives on the ballot.
In filings with federal court in Tallahassee, attorneys for Florida Decides Healthcare asked the court to block a requirement that sponsors deliver completed petitions to the voter’s supervisor of elections office within 10 days after the voter signs the petition. 
Florida Decides and Smart & Safe Florida, the group behind a push to legalize marijuana, also want the court to enjoin the fines for delivering completed petitions late or to the wrong supervisor’s office; signing another person’s name or a fictitious name to any petition, or filling in missing information on a signed petition.
Lastly, the groups are asking the court to enjoin the state from enforcing criminal penalties for violating sections of the law, arguing it is vague and overly broad.
Voters in Florida over the last two decades have passed a number of initiatives that were opposed by GOP legislators, including measures that raised the state’s minimum wage and allowed for the use of medical marijuana. Last November, two initiatives — including one on recreational marijuana and another on abortion — fell just below the 60% margin needed to win.
Lawmakers responded with a bill that completely overhauls the process used to collect signatures.
The first legal skirmish centers on whether to block the law while the underlying court battle moves on.

William H. Stafford III, representing Attorney General James Uthmeier, has countered in his motion to dismiss that plaintiffs lack standing to bring the case because Florida Decides and Smart and Safe wouldn’t be subject to the fines they are seeking to waive.
 “[A]s far as the Secretary and Attorney General can tell, not one of Plaintiffs declarants stated that they have ever signed another person’s name or a fictitious name on a petition, or filled in missing information ‘on a signed petition’ , or ever intend to.”
Stafford argues that the fines are optional and “may” be waived — another reason the groups lack standing, meaning they have a stake in the outcome.
Stafford additionally defended HB 1205.
“Florida’s initiative petition process has a problem. Circulators sometimes forge voters’ signatures on petitions. Sometimes they sign for the deceased. Sometimes they misappropriate voter information. Some commit identity theft,” he wrote. 
“Petition sponsors fail to timely submit completed petitions to supervisors of elections, resulting in thousands of dollars in penalties. And the problems are magnified when petition sponsors use out-of-state petition circulators, contractors, and subcontractors, who lack ties to Florida and don’t respect its law enforcements’ subpoena power.”
Set up to fail
In her response to the state, Matletha Bennette, an attorney with the Southern Poverty Law Center representing Florida Decides, agreed with Stafford one one point: “As defendants say, Florida’s petition process has a problem — namely the State sometimes passes laws illegally restricting it.”
Bennette argued that the state’s position that the group lacks standing is incorrect. “Plaintiffs need not show that they have violated or intend to violate the law, or that it is ‘guaranteed’ that the State will impose penalties,” she wrote.
Additionally, citing the arguments of Smart & Safe in its filing, Bennette argues: “Even if it were logistically possible to consistently comply with the ten-day return rule, it is impossible to do so (a) without incurring significantly greater costs and diverting organizational resources and (b) forgoing quality control measures to guard against HB 1205’s other penalties,” she wrote.
“The First Amendment bars the Hobson’s choice HB 1205 demands: curtail core protected speech in an attempt to comply with the law, and likely fail to collect enough signatures for a successful campaign, or risk criminal liability and severe financial penalties that would bankrupt the organization. Defendants’ suggestion that the State may, in its beneficence, waive penalties it has otherwise assessed does not ‘ameliorate’ Plaintiffs’ harm.”
Florida Decides has been working for more than a year to get its proposed constitutional amendment to expand Medicaid on the statewide ballot in November 2026. 
It filed the underlying lawsuit three days after DeSantis signed the law.
Smart & Safe, the group behind the proposed constitutional amendment to legalize recreational use of cannabis in 2024, is actively working to place another measure on the ballot in 2026 
The new law stems from a January report published by the state’s Office of Election Crimes and Security asserting that more than 100 representatives of the group attempting to pass the abortion-rights amendment last year committed crimes related to gathering petitions.
The bill:

 Prohibits felons, noncitizens, and non-Florida residents from acting as petition circulators.
Requires additional personal identifying information for voters signing petition forms and for petition circulators.
Requires the sponsor to deliver petitions to supervisors of elections in the counties in which the voter resides within 10 days after the voter signs the form.
 And says that anyone who doesn’t register with the state as a signature-gatherer and possesses more than 25 signed petitions beyond their own and immediate family members’ faces a third-degree felony punishable by up to five years in prison.

As Congress considers a bill backed by President Donald Trump that would cut hundreds of billions of dollars from Medicaid over the next decade, Farmer shared her concerns for Michigan’s Medicaid-funded Home Health program, which has allowed her to care for her son Omar.
Her goal was to help Omar, now 40 years old and living with autism, to live as independently as possible, Farmer said. It took years of patience and love, and he’s learned many life skills to keep him healthy and happy, but Farmer said Omar will always depend on her and without Medicaid, families may not be able to tell their stories of triumph through care.
“Medicaid is part of many of the stories and we cannot allow them to lose their lifeline. To be a home care worker, you must understand and believe that the core that all people deserve, love, respect, dignity, health and opportunity to live their life on their own terms,” Farmer said. “Care is a blessing, not a burden, and we are called to serve others. I wish more people understood, and that I wish more people felt the way that I do.”

On Tuesday, Trump met with U.S. House Republicans, pushing a unified front for a speedy passage of legislation he has called a “big, beautiful bill,”that would, amongst other financial reforms like extending his 2017 tax cuts, axe more than $800 billion in funding, slated to mostly come from Medicaid.
House Speaker Mike Johnson has chosen Memorial Day as the deadline for the House to pass the bill off the floor, but a consensus amongst Republicans hasn’t been reached yet.
Talking to the media Tuesday on Capitol Hill, alongside Michigan U.S. Rep. Lisa McClain (R-Bruce Twp.), chair of the House Republican Conference, Trump stumped for his tax bill slamming the few Republicans that haven’t backed the effort, namely Kentucky Republican U.S. Rep. Thomas Massie.
“We don’t want any waste, fraud or abuse. It’s very simple, waste, fraud, abuse, other than that we’re leaving it, Medicare, we’re leaving it,” Trump said Tuesday.
Medicaid and Medicare are different programs, Michael Daeschlein, Long-Term Care Policy Specialist for Michigan Elder Justice Initiative said on the panel. Daeschlein pointed out Medicare, which provides health insurance for people who are 65 years old or older does not cover the long term care many Michiganders need as senior citizens, whereas Medicaid, which provides health care coverage for individuals with low-incomes, does cover such care.
Michigan has an aging population, Daeschlein said, and many of the direct care worker jobs in the state are remaining open as those in the industry are doing the work of multiple professionals in an “unsustainable” system.

Medicaid covers three in five nursing home residents, or 33,000 Michiganders, Daeschlein said, which is many families’ last option to ensure their loved ones are safe and taken care of.
“It’s important to understand that over 300,000 Michiganders on Medicare rely on Medicaid to pay their out-of-pocket expenses, their co-pays, their deductibles… if it wasn’t for Medicaid, 300,000 people wouldn’t be able to make Medicare work for them,” Daeschlein said.
Cutting Medicaid would perpetuate cycles of addiction and incarceration, working against efforts around the state to help Michiganders heal and contribute in their communities, Nathan Dunbar, a mental health worker with Community Mental Health Authority of Clinton, Eaton, and Ingham Counties said.
By the time someone goes into rehab or goes to prison, they likely don’t have a job anymore and will require Medicaid in order to access recovery resources to get their life back on track, Dunbar said. 
The best available access to treatment is through Medicaid, Dunbar said, adding that private insurance companies don’t “roll the dice” on people who are battling addiction.
“…but those people still need help and those people’s kids still need help,” Dunbar said. “I resent people calling my fellow Michiganders waste, and I resent people calling my fellow Michiganders abuse, and I resent people calling my fellow Michiganders fraud. None of those things are what’s happening. What is happening is our government is being unresponsive to the needs of its people.”

(Jemma Stephenson/Alabama Reflector)BIRMINGHAM — A federal judge said Wednesday she would consider sanctions on attorneys who filed a motion that used artificial intelligence and cited legal authorities that do not exist.
U.S. District Court Judge Anna M. Manasco told attorneys representing the state in the lawsuit — claiming corrections officers failed to protect an inmate — that lawyers continue to use artificial intelligence even after other courts have imposed corrective measures throughout the country.
“Generally, this has occurred in other cases where the courts have imposed sanctions and standing orders,” Manasco said during the hearing. “This incident is proof-positive that those sanctions were insufficient. That causes me to consider a fuller range of sanctions.”

Attorneys Matthew Reeves, the attorney who used AI; Bill Lunsford, the attorney overseeing the case, and litigants from Montgomery-based Butler Snow, the firm where Reeves and Lunsford are employed, expressed remorse and publicly apologized to both the plaintiffs and the court regarding the incident.
“I had limited use of artificial intelligence products such as Westlaw Precision with CoCounsel and ChatGTP,” Reeves said to Manasco during the hearing Wednesday. “I first used it related to dietary matters. That is how I started to use it.”
Reeves then said he began querying artificial intelligence to research colleges for his son before applying the technology professionally for research into policies and practices related to different issues. It then culminated in using it to obtain citations for the case.
He said he was aware that using artificial intelligence to obtain citations did not comply with the firm’s policies and that he did not verify the citations during the two instances that he relied on AI for the citations.
Reeves, who according to his LinkedIn profile has been a partner with Butler Snow since April 2023, said Manasco is within her discretion to impose sanctions.
“My only request, since I am the only one responsible, is not to punish my colleagues,” he said.
The incident involves five citations that Manasco characterized as “hallucinated” across two documents filed with the court. The court was made aware of the fabricated citations after the attorneys for Frankie Johnson, the plaintiff in the case, filed a document to oppose the state’s request to have their client available to give testimony on a certain date.
“As discussed below, Defendant has cited no legitimate authority to support his proposition that ordering a deposition before an anticipated document production is appropriate,” the filing said. “Instead, Defendant appears to have wholly invented case citations in his Motion for Leave, possibly through the use of generative artificial intelligence.”
Lunsford and Butler Snow have been awarded millions of dollars to represent the Alabama Department of Corrections in cases alleging abuse within Alabama’s prison facilities.
In December 2024, the Contract Review Committee approved contracts totaling $4.8 million to Lunsford and Butler Snow. The committee had previously approved $14.9 million in July 2023 and another $7.68 million in June of that same year.
Blood Money: Alabama Department of Corrections pays to settle lawsuits alleging excessive force

Manasco listed several possible consequences, from continuing education seminars and fines to referrals to the Alabama State Bar or even temporary suspensions.
Johnson, currently incarcerated at William E. Donaldson Correctional Facility in Bessemer, said in the lawsuit that he was attacked by as many as 13 people and stabbed at least nine times in the prison in December 2019. Johnson said that despite the attack, staff at the prison failed to properly protect him afterward.
“As a consequence of their individual and collective failure, on or about March 5, 2020, while restrained in shackles and handcuffs during a therapy session, Mr. Johnson was stabbed repeatedly by another prisoner at Donaldson,” the lawsuit states.
The attorneys for ADOC filed a motion to compel Johnson to testify the week of June 3. Johnson’s attorneys said that they would not have enough time to prepare their client to give testimony.
In response, Reeves and Lunsford filed another document stating that other courts have required people who are incarcerated to give their testimony during a deposition when they are given the appropriate notice, which they argue was done in this case.
“Defendant bolstered this assertion with a lengthy string citation of legal authority and parentheticals that appeared to support Defendant’s proposition,” Johnson’s attorneys said. “But the entire string citation appears to have been made up out of whole cloth.”
Johnson’s attorneys noted four of the citations in the ADOC filing. One included an appropriate case but was not relevant to the issue that Reeves and Lunsford claimed in the document they filed.
A second case, Kelley v. City of Birmingham, was said to be decided in the U.S. Northern District of Alabama in 2021, when it was actually a Alabama state case from 1939. Two other citations referred to cases that did not exist.
Attorneys for Johnson began to review other documents that Lunsford and Reeves filed with the court in the case.
They then found another citation that was fabricated in a different document in which “Plaintiff’s counsel found a string of similarly named opinions, none of them stood for the proposition Defendant represented, and Plaintiff’s counsel could not identify any case using the citation Defendant provided,” Johnson’s attorneys said in their filing.
The plaintiffs in the case agreed to allow Reeves to refile the document to have Johnson testify by the original date that he and Lunsford requested, but this time with the appropriate citations.
Manasco will allow the leadership at the Butler Snow law firm another 10 days to review its policies and practices pertaining to the use of artificial intelligence before considering the matter further.

(Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — A week after the procedural failure of a proposal to slow down voter-approved minimum wage increases, Nebraska lawmakers on Thursday will reconsider the final vote.
If the bill’s previous supporters hold, the measure would have enough support to pass. State Sen. Tony Sorrentino of the Elkhorn area, a freshman lawmaker, missed the final vote to pass Legislative Bill 258, from State Sen. Jane Raybould of Lincoln. 
That’s because the vote came up about two hours earlier than expected after lead opponent State Sen. Danielle Conrad of Lincoln realized Sorrentino’s absence and changed tactics. 
The bill failed 31-17. Amending a law that voters enact requires at least 33 votes. LB 258 would make annual bumps to the minimum wage smaller and more predictable, supporters say, and create carveouts to pay teen workers less.

One listed “no” vote, State Sen. Beau Ballard of Lincoln, supported the bill originally but tried to sit out the vote to let lawmakers reconsider the vote. He was marked as a “no” vote under a rule change in January. A reconsideration motion requires a senator on the “prevailing” side to want to change a vote, or the requesting senator must have missed the vote.
Sorrentino missed last Wednesday’s vote, because he was escorting colleagues he met through business to a meeting across the street. Of opponents who consider the issue decided, Sorrentino said, “We all have to learn the rules of the Legislature.”
Multiple senators said such a reconsideration motion on a bill from final reading, while likely allowed under the legislative rules, hadn’t been used since 1984.
The effort could ignite a rules fight over whether the reconsideration should be allowed.
Speaker John Arch of La Vista confirmed this week that a reconsideration motion would come Thursday, though he said he couldn’t say when. The Legislature will take up either Ballard’s motion or a new reconsideration motion Sorrentino filed Tuesday, the final day he could do so under the Legislature’s rules. At least 30 senators must agree to reconsider.
Asked to comment on the reconsideration, Raybould said, “No.” 
She said a reporter should ask Conrad for comment, who Raybould said was already discussing the motion. Last week, she said she thought Democratic-aligned lawmakers were acting in “goodwill,” because they knew Raybould had the votes.

The fight has been personal for Raybould, a longtime grocery store executive, who views the legislation as creating a “balance” that progressives, including Conrad, have rejected.
“I have never seen such a blatant, bald-faced, self-serving, self-dealing, selfish, unethical example of self-dealing as this bill in the Legislature,” State Sen. Megan Hunt of Omaha said during an April 1 debate.
Sorrentino, a former business owner, said he’s personally not in favor of a legislated minimum wage, describing himself as a “true fan of supply and demand.” He said the market is a better indicator.
Sorrentino said it’s not a vote about “putting people in poverty, because frankly, I’ve seen cases where minimum wage is never going to fly, it’s way too low.”
LB 258 is Raybould’s 2025 priority bill. She is the lone Democrat in favor of LB 258 as well as a separate LB 415 to weaken a voter-approved paid sick leave framework that takes effect Oct. 1, after 2024 passage. Republican State Sen. Dave Wordekemper of Fremont opposes LB 258 and the current version of LB 415. There are 33 Republicans in the officially nonpartisan body.
There were some initial conversations about attaching LB 258 to LB 415. That approach heightens the risk that voters could repeal the legislative changes and go back to the voter-approved language, which some advocates have discussed as a response to LB 415.






What LB 258 would do
Legislative Bill 258, related to the state minimum wage, would remove inflationary bumps after the base wage rises to $15 on Jan. 1, which voters approved in 2022. Future increases would be fixed at a 1.75% annual rate beginning in 2026. That was a deal struck between State Sens. Jane Raybould of Lincoln, the sponsor, and Stan Clouse of Kearney to provide “certainty.”
Average inflation, as calculated by the ballot measure’s current language, was 2.6% last year and 4.18% for the past five years. Over the past 10 years, inflation was 2.63%. And over the past 25 years, it was 2.39%, according to data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics for the Midwest.
LB 258 would also create a “youth minimum wage” for workers aged 14 or 15. Beginning next year, those young workers could be paid $13.50 (the current minimum wage), which would increase by 1.5% every five years, beginning in 2030.
The youth minimum wage would stay below $15 — the floor that voters created for all workers beginning Jan. 1 — until 2065 under LB 258, according to a Nebraska Examiner analysis.
Teen workers aged 16 to 19 could still be paid a “training wage,” which would no longer apply to 14 or 15 year olds with the creation of the “youth minimum wage.” The training wage allows employers to pay teen workers a lower rate for up to the first 90 days of employment.
Current law allows the training wage to be 75% of the federal minimum wage, so as low as $5.44. LB 258 would increase the training wage to $13.50 beginning in September. The amended training wage would rise by 1.5% annually beginning in 2027.

The Brownfields Grants will use funding from the Biden-era Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and are meant to help remediate sites and prepare them for redevelopment and safe use.
“Redevelopment of Brownfields properties is often an insurmountable challenge for many communities, which may lack the resources to assess and clean up these contaminated properties,” Tracie White, Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment’s Hazardous Materials and Waste Management Division director, said in a statement. “The award of EPA Brownfields funds is an exciting opportunity for the recipient communities, allowing them to return blighted properties to productive use and provide community benefits.”

The largest share of funding, at $4 million, will go toward cleaning asbestos contamination at the Sunset Park Apartments in Denver. The building has 242 units for people 62 years and older and people with disabilities. It is owned by the Volunteers of America.
The City of Fountain will get about $2 million to complete asbestos abatement on a 9-acre site that the city wants to redevelop into a community center, multifamily housing, outdoor recreation space and offices for medical services and childcare.
About $1.9 million will go to treat asbestos contamination at the 142-year-old Jaffa Opera House in Trinidad. Cañon City will receive about $1.5 million for two contaminated sites, including a former dry-cleaning business contaminated with tetrachloroethylene and a previous steel manufacturing site that is contaminated with heavy metals and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, which can cause health problems like cancer and kidney damage.
The other grants will go to the Cortez Municipal Airport and two buildings in Lamar.
CDPHE will also get $1 million for its revolving loan funds, which finance environmental cleanup activities.
“This Brownfields grant funding is a smart investment in Colorado’s future — cleaning up historic contamination while laying the groundwork for economic growth,” EPA Region 8 Administrator Cyrus Western said in a statement. “By empowering communities to turn abandoned properties into productive assets, we’re strengthening local economies and ensuring clean land for generations to come.”
Colorado’s grants are part of about $224 million of awards throughout the country.

(Screenshot via YouTube)Kentucky Republican Attorney General Russell Coleman joined some of his counterparts from other states at the U.S. border with Mexico Wednesday to back Trump administration efforts to bolster security at the site. 
In a press conference live streamed by the Republican Attorneys General Association, Coleman said the attorneys general heard in an earlier briefing that during the Biden administration, the border had an average of 1,500 illegal crossings a day, now down to an average of four a day — the result, Coleman said, of “solid leadership” by President Donald Trump. 
Coleman pointed to Trump administration efforts to tackle smuggling illegal drugs like fentanyl across the border and thanked border agents for their work. In 2024, 1,410 Kentuckians died from a drug overdose, according to the 2024 Drug Overdose Fatality Report. While that report found Kentucky’s overdose deaths have declined over the last three years, the state still has one of the highest rates of opioid use disorder in the United States. 
“The lack of border security has resulted in empty chairs at kitchen tables, empty seats at pews and workers not clocking in in the Commonwealth of Kentucky,” Coleman said. 
Ahead of the press conference, Coleman said in a post on X that he and the other attorneys general are joining Trump “to secure the southwest border and keep deadly drugs and violent criminals out of Kentucky.” 
Coleman led a coalition of attorneys general earlier this year asking Trump administration officials via a letter for greater scrutiny of an import pilot program, Entry Type 86. It allows small packages to enter the U.S. with minimal customs screening. A press release from Coleman’s office argued the program could be “used by adversaries and drug traffickers to flood deadly fentanyl into the United States.” 
The Republican Attorneys General Association, or RAGA, backs Republican attorneys general candidates across the country. 
Coleman, who was elected as Kentucky’s attorney general in 2023, ran on national issues like securing the southwest border. Last year, he was among Republican attorneys general and Kentucky politicians voicing solidarity with Texas Republican Gov. Greg Abbott against the Biden administration over blocking U.S. Border Patrol access to part of the border with Mexico. This year, Coleman joined other Republican attorneys general in court to back the Trump administration’s efforts to deport Venezuelan migrants.

The provision, part of Senate Bill 639, would remove responsibility from pesticide manufacturers and sellers to disclose a product’s risks as long as the pesticide container bears a label indicating that it has been approved by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act.
The bill’s language would also remove the ability of individuals and families harmed by pesticide exposure to seek justice in court, according to Toxic Free NC.
“This is a direct attack on our community’s right to hold chemical manufacturers accountable for the harm they cause,” Toxic Free NC Policy Manager Kendall Wimberley said. “This is not something communities are asking for.”
Bayer, a Triangle-based global pesticide manufacturer, has supported the language in the bill as it has moved through several committees in the North Carolina Senate. The bill was withdrawn from the chamber’s floor and referred to the Senate Rules Committee last week.
Similar bills have been introduced in other states. Eight have failed thus far in 2025 — in Iowa, Tennessee, Florida, Wyoming, Montana, Mississippi, Oklahoma, and Idaho — although North Dakota and Georgia passed their versions of the legislation.
In Iowa, critics branded the proposal as the “Cancer Gag Act” due to the dangers it allegedly posed.
“Evidence presented in the courts is showing that Bayer has failed to warn consumers about the harms of their products,” Wimberley said. “They are facing billions of dollars in settlement lawsuits, and they are now spending millions of dollars lobbying efforts to try to stop that.”
Section 19 would shield pesticide companies from responsibility even when their products pose high risks for cancer, brain damage, infertility, or developmental harm in children, according to Wimberley, as these specific health risks are not required to be included on pesticide labels.
The North Carolina Farm Act has come under fire for another portion of the bill as well. About 100 activists gathered in Raleigh at the start of the month to advocate against banning raw milk sales as the bill was heard before the Senate Judiciary Committee.

The Animal Welfare License Plate, now available through the Division of Motor Vehicles (DMV), is designed to raise funds for initiatives that promote the health and safety of companion animals throughout the state.
Featuring vibrant illustrations of animals set against a scenic backdrop, the plate allows residents to show their support for animal welfare in a visible and meaningful way.

“This initiative not only shows OAW’s commitment to animal welfare but also provides a unique way for residents to drive with a purpose and support the cause,” said Christina Motoyoshi, director of OAW. “We are looking forward to seeing the community embrace this opportunity to make a difference.”
The plate costs $50, with $35 from each sale directed to the State Spay Neuter Fund.
The fund supports efforts to reduce animal homelessness by making spay and neuter services more accessible.
“Spaying and neutering are the most effective and humane ways to control pet populations, but the services can be out of reach for some pet owners,” said Joanna Miller, deputy director of OAW. “Revenue is used to provide spay and neuter surgeries for low-income pet owners, community cat programs, and to supplement spay and neuter funds for Delaware shelters and rescues.”
Revenue from the plates helps provide surgeries for low-income pet owners, supports community cat initiatives, and assists shelters and rescues with their spay and neuter programs.
The plate can be ordered online here or by mail using an application form.

Homanit announced Wednesday it will build its first United States manufacturing facility on 140 acres near the small community of Alcolu — population 425.
The company pledged to employ 300 people in the area located off Interstate 95, about 40 miles north of its intersection with I-26.
“This investment marks a significant milestone for our company, and we’re proud to become part of such a vibrant and forward-looking region,” Homanit Managing Director Fritz Homann said in a statement. “The area’s skilled workforce, strategic location and strong infrastructure make Clarendon County the ideal foundation for our next phase of growth in North America.”
The announcement marks the largest in Clarendon County economic development history, according to Central SC Alliance President Jason Giulietti.
“Homanit’s announcement to establish such a large operation in Clarendon County represents a tremendous vote of confidence in our state’s forestry and manufacturing industries,” Secretary of Commerce Harry Lightsey said in a statement. “This significant $250 million investment and the opportunities it brings to a rural area will have a lasting impact.”

When it begins operations in 2028, Homanit will make wood paneling for furniture, vehicles and doors. It’s product line is of particular importance to a state timber industry that has been struggling amid closures of major paper mills.
“Homanit’s sizable investment — the largest forest products manufacturing announcement in the state in more than three years — is welcome news, particularly for our pine pulpwood markets,” State Forester Scott Phillips said in a statement.
The company currently operates production facilities in Germany, Lithuania and Poland.
In exchange for Homanit’s investment, Clarendon County officials approved a deal offering the company a reduced property tax rate of 4% for 40 years.
By state law, manufacturers without such an arrangement pay a 6% rate. (Industrial property owners previously paid a 10.5% rate, but state laws passed in 2017 and 2022 effectively lowered it to 6%.)
Clarendon County Council also approved $2.1 million in grants and $2.2 million in reimbursements for the company.  And the state approved the company for income tax credits worth $20,250 per each new job.
“The economic impact of a project of this magnitude will be felt throughout our community for generations to come,” Clarendon County Council Chairman John Johnson III said in a statement.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/wood-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-21 15:08:09.376083

Emanuel Cleaver speaks at Uptown Theater on Nov. 8, 2016 Kansas City (Photo by Whitney Curtis/Getty Images).Missouri’s Democratic members of Congress decried the proposed GOP cuts to Medicaid in a press briefing Wednesday, calling the move a handout to the rich that would harm the state’s most vulnerable. 
The U.S. House is debating a massive reconciliation package that, as written now, would slash roughly $800 billion from Medicaid and Affordable Care Act provisions, and $300 billion from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, according to the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.
U.S. Rep. Emanuel Cleaver, a Democrat who represents a district which includes Kansas City, said the proposed changes would have “disastrous consequences” in Missouri, where Medicaid access can be a “matter of life or death” for millions of enrollees.
“It will lead to sicker and more pain-filled communities. It will be a massive economic weight holding down Missouri families and small businesses alike, as more of our neighbors are stricken with increased medical debt,” Cleaver said.
The Congressional Budget Office found the House’s plan would result in the lowest-earning households seeing resources decrease while the highest-earners gain.
One in five Missourians is on Medicaid, or over 1.2 million people. Missouri’s Medicaid program covers 39% of all children in the state and pays for two-thirds of nursing home care.
Congressman Wesley Bell, a Democrat who represents the district including St. Louis, said Medicaid cuts would cause people to delay care.
“Medicaid serves as a stabilizing force for entire communities, and when it’s cut, the consequences show up everywhere, from overcrowded ERs to delayed treatment and preventable illness,” Bell said. “And when those folks don’t have access to quality health care and preventative medicine, they go to the ER so we’re going to pay for it one way or the other.”
  U.S. Rep. Wesley Bell speaks Weds May 21, 2025 at a virtual press conference about Medicaid cuts (screenshot).
The GOP budget includes adding work requirements and other changes to Medicaid that the Congressional Budget Office estimates would boot millions nationally from the rolls. 
In Missouri, work requirements alone could kick over 90,000 people off the rolls, many of whom would be working or eligible for an exception but get caught up in red tape. The changes taken together, including proposed increased eligibility checks and limitations on state-levied provider taxes, could remove around 166,000 people from the rolls in Missouri, a KFF analysis found. 
U.S. Sen. Josh Hawley has been a rare Republican voice against Medicaid cuts, calling them morally and politically wrong.
“Far be it for me to agree with Senator Hawley, but his point is well taken,” Bell said. “This is a slap in the face. It is an attack on working class families.”
The bill is still being hashed out. It would also cut billions from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, which provides food aid to low-income people and families.
“We all know what’s at stake,” Bell said. “We all know the folks who are at stake are some of our most vulnerable folks, seniors, children, working families. So we hope and expect that our colleagues on the other side of the aisle do the right thing.”

(Aaron Sanderford/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — The Nebraska Republican Party has decided not to pursue any post-trial motions or appeals of a civil defamation case that awarded a former GOP legislative candidate $500,000 in damages.
The state party lost a lawsuit that awarded former candidate Janet Palmtag of Nebraska City damages for the impact on her business and personal life from mailers a jury determined had crossed the line. The mailers had claimed she “broke the law” and “lost” her real estate license and was unfit to become a state senator.
“Although neither my immediate predecessor, Chairman Eric Underwood, nor I was involved in the 2020 actions that led to Janet Palmtag’s civil lawsuit and subsequent judgment,” Nebraska GOP Chair Mary Jane Truemper said. “We are both, nonetheless, sympathetic to the harm it caused her.” 
The decision effectively ended neatly a decade-long legal battle between the state GOP and Palmtag, a long-time GOP volunteer. The former party leadership has said it based the mailer’s claims on a 2017 case before the Iowa Real Estate Commission in which Palmtag, the owner of a real estate firm operating in Nebraska, Missouri, and Iowa, agreed to pay a $500 fine on behalf of her firm to resolve a mistake made by one of its agents. At the time, as Palmtag testified, the agent was gravely ill and had failed to obtain all the signatures necessary to transfer an earnest deposit for the sale of a home in Iowa.
Jury awards $500,000 to legislative candidate defamed by Nebraska GOP mailers

Truemper recently became state GOP chair after Underwood decided not to seek reelection. Underwood and a group of populist Republicans, with old-guard help, took over in 2022 from a party leadership team loyal to then-Gov. Pete Ricketts. 
It was the Ricketts-favored team who made the decision to attack Palmtag, who in 2020 ran against a Ricketts appointee, former State Sen. Julie Slama of Dunbar. Palmtag was backed by former Gov. Dave Heineman and other prominent members of the party, including former U.S. Rep. Jeff Fortenberry, R-Neb.
Palmtag lost to Slama in the GOP-on-GOP race. But the party’s decision to take sides in the race upset some Republicans.
After the verdict, Palmtag’s attorney said he hoped the decision would serve as a warning to political consultants, professionals and candidates about the claims they make in campaigns.
“We cannot have ‘our facts.’ Facts are facts — not yours or mine,” Palmtag’s attorney David Domina said, “It is long past time for our discourse to return to this essential home base.”
Truemper said the party’s apology may not be satisfactory to Palmtag, but she hopes she knows the party wishes “for her healing and peace as she moves forward.”

Meerman is the sponsor of legislation to get rid of Michigan's one-man grand jury process.  | Photo: Anna Liz NicholsA Republican lawmaker is trying to strike the state’s one-man grand jury process from law, a move that would prevent local prosecutors and the Department of Attorney General from bringing criminal charges against defendants with just one judge as the sole juror.
The bill, sponsored by Rep. Luke Meerman (R-Coopersville), would repeal several sections of the Code of Criminal Procedure allowing just one judge to review evidence and greenlight charges as a grand juror.
The process was ruled unconstitutional by the Michigan Supreme Court during the failed Flint water criminal prosecution against former Governor Rick Snyder and several other members of his administration. 
The court specifically called out the prosecutorial team – led by Wayne County Prosecutor Kym Worthy and former Michigan Solicitor General Fadwa Hammoud – for engaging in a type of “Star Chamber,” a reference to the corrupt backroom English courts of the late 15th Century. That doomed the prosecution and the court eventually dismissed the charges. SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Meerman’s bill was up for testimony on Wednesday before the House Judiciary Committee. He said the grand jury was a hallmark of the judicial process, one that helps decide probable cause of a crime, but the difference with a one-man grand jury is that it is not composed of several citizens or local officials, but rather one judge.
“A one-man grand jury violates due process, as evidence in these proceedings is not made available to the defense,” Meerman said, who also claimed that Michigan was one of the only states that maintains a one-man grand jury process under law. “The use of this legal maneuver erodes public trust and confidence in the impartiality of the justice system.”
Touching on the Supreme Court’s 2022 ruling, Meerman said the main takeaway was that a single judge cannot currently issue an indictment authorizing charges against a defendant. His bill would remove the portion of the criminal code that allows for a one-man grand jury, preventing it from being reactivated if the high court somehow overturns its precedent founded in the Flint water cases. Laws that remain on the books even though there is a court precedent deeming them unconstitutional or void are sometimes referred to as zombie laws.
Rep. Brian BeGole (R-Perry) and Rep. Kelly Breen (D-Novi) both asked how often this process was used and in what kinds of cases, and how widely it was utilized by prosecutors across the state.
Meerman indicated that it happens infrequently. Although prosecutors did not give testimony before the committee on Wednesday, Meerman said it was his understanding through conversations with prosecutors that they would still like to keep it in their tool box, even though those prosecutors couldn’t use it anyway, given the Supreme Court’s ruling in 2022.
Rep. Sarah Lightner (R-Springport), chair of the House Judiciary Committee, said it was her understanding that the process was mostly used in sensitive felony cases.
Criminal Defense Attorneys of Michigan said it supported the bill but did not wish to speak during committee.
A spokesperson for the Prosecuting Attorneys Association of Michigan told Michigan Advance that it does not have a stance on the bill, and that the only county that had been using the law in any capacity was Wayne County.
As it stands, it does not appear that the bill is a priority for PAAM to weigh in on, support or oppose.
A spokesperson with Worthy’s office deferred comment on the bill to PAAM. The office did not respond to additional questions posed by Michigan Advance regarding how often the county used the process prior to the Supreme Court’s ruling or how difficult it is for the county to navigate complex cases without the use of a one-man grand jury.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Facetune_11-12-2024-06-07-25-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-05-21 14:11:36.981093

Brad Little is among 20 Republican governors who have sent a letter to President Donald Trump expressing support for his “big, beautiful” tax and spending bill that’s been held up as U.S. House Republicans continue to fight over it.
“As Republican Governors, we stand UNITED in strong support of your One, Big, Beautiful Bill,” the governors wrote in the letter dated Tuesday. “This landmark piece of legislation embodies your powerful vision to bring about the next great American revival.”
They added that the bill “truly delivers on the bold promises all Republicans made to the American people to restore the security, prosperity, and fiscal sanity for our nation.”

The massive, 1,116-page bill package includes sweeping tax breaks and controversial cuts of more than $600 billion over the next decade from Medicaid, the government health program for low-income individuals and those with disabilities. However, negotiations continue over the bill and it’s not yet clear whether it has the support it needs from the U.S. House Republicans’ slim majority.
Earlier Tuesday, Republicans who have yet to rally behind the bill huddled in Speaker Mike Johnson’s office to hash out agreements on Medicaid and other outstanding issues. Johnson said he hopes to pass the legislation this week, though he didn’t appear to have the votes as of Tuesday afternoon.
Even as the bill remains snagged, Republican governors signaled to the president that he has their support, writing “after four long years of tremendous hardship under President Joe Biden and (Vice President) Kamala Harris, the American people cannot wait any longer for Congress to enact the One, Big, Beautiful Bill.”
“The American people have witnessed the tireless work undertaken by you and your administration to reverse the disastrous consequences of President Biden’s failed and often illegal policies,” the governors’ letter says. “You have demonstrated a commitment to using every ounce of Executive authority available to reinstitute fiscal sanity, fight the deep state, secure our borders, and achieve energy dominance.”
Little and other governors also called on Congress to act to “fully and permanently implement” Trump’s “America First agenda.”
“Thankfully, your One, Big, Beautiful Bill would accomplish this,” their letter continues. “It would provide you with the resources you need to permanently secure the border, remove barriers needed to truly unleash American energy production, protect Americans by making a once-in-a-lifetime investment in military technology that once seemed like science fiction, give working class families tax cuts worth thousands of dollars each, and ensure your administration has the tools needed to deport illegal alien murders (sic) and rapists.”
They concluded their letter saying they agree that Republicans must “UNIFY around this unprecedented piece of conservative legislation.” They added that “we cannot miss this chance to save taxpayers $1.6 trillion over the next 10 years.”
“We stand by your side and will support you in any way to ensure this necessary piece of legislation is enacted,” the governors wrote.
The 20 governors who signed the letter include:

(Photo provided by ND Game and Fish Department)A North Dakota wildlife group is worried federal funding cuts could affect a renowned wildlife research center at Jamestown and is urging people to contact Congress.
The Northern Prairie Wildlife Research Center is part of the U.S. Geological Survey, which is facing a recommended $564 million budget cut proposed by the Trump administration. A May 2 letter from Russell Vought, director of the federal Office of Management and Budget, says some cuts are aimed at programs that “focus on social agendas (e.g., climate change).”
John Bradley, executive director of the North Dakota Wildlife Federation, said with those cuts, it would be “miraculous” if the center was able to stay open. 
Bradley put out a call last week for conservation groups to contact members of Congress to maintain funding for the research center. 
“There’s probably cuts that do need to happen to rein in the federal budget, but doing so with kind of a shotgun approach isn’t the best way forward,” Bradley said. 
Gary Krapu, a retired researcher who still has an office at the research center, said the downsizing has already started. 
“A number of people have already left,” Krapu said. 
Krapu said the Trump administration had offered research center staff an incentive to leave and administrators have warned of layoffs.

The U.S. Geological Survey falls under the Department of the Interior. A U.S. House Appropriations subcommittee on Tuesday questioned the deep cuts proposed for the Interior department and told Interior Secretary Doug Burgum that Congress would likely provide more funding than the Trump administration requested.
Rep. Chellie Pingree, D-Maine, said the proposed budget cut “eviscerates” the U.S. Geological Survey. 
“Without these programs at USGS, our communities will be left vulnerable to natural disasters and deprived of the scientific data that guides responsible land management,” Pingree said.
A statement from the office of Sen. John Hoeven, R-N.D., said the Department of the Interior, “is evaluating their facility options and no budget decisions have been made at this point regarding staffing or funding.”
The Northern Prairie Wildlife Research Center first opened in 1965, focusing mainly on migratory waterfowl. 
Its research has helped set hunting regulations, helped guide conservation groups on where to focus their efforts and protected habitat for bird species such as the sandhill crane. 
Krapu said federal funding has ranged between $7 million and $10 million in recent years, with partner organizations such as conservation groups also funding projects. 
While its staff of about 40 employees is based in Jamestown, its research has stretched from Mexico into the Arctic. 
The center’s early research focused on migratory waterfowl, but it diversified over the years to studying wolves, pollinators and invasive species. 
The Northern Prairie Wildlife Research Center referred questions to the Geological Survey, which said questions about the center’s budget would have to be answered by the Office of Management and Budget. The OMB did not reply to an emailed request for budget information. 
U.S. House spending panel indicates it will boost Interior funding above Trump request

Dave Brandt is a North Dakota Wildlife Federation board member who retired from the research center last year. 
Brandt said Jamestown would feel the impact of closing the research center. 
“It’s a huge economic driver for the community there,” Brandt said.
Brandt started at Northern Prairie by taking a seasonal position in 1990.
“Northern Prairie was world renowned for its waterfowl biology,” Brandt said.
Krapu is holding out hope for Northern Prairie, where he worked for more than 40 years before retiring in 2012. He said he still has data to enter on sandhill crane research in Russia. 
If the center does close, it’s Krapu’s hope that it is only temporary. 
“It’s a very unfortunate situation that’s developed, but there’s a lot of other federal workers in the country that are facing the same kinds of problems,” he said.

School of Social Work Director Johanna Thomas will lead a team of UA experts who will create the hub, which will serve Arkansans with behavioral health needs. 
“Currently, Arkansas does not have a coordinated statewide system of crisis care to address behavioral health needs for children and adults to this extent,” Thomas said. “What we’re creating together begins with prevention and early intervention, and then focuses on crisis intervention and guidance to follow up with treatment available for those who need it.”

Thomas and her team will partner with DHS to coordinate the program and determine subgrants. They’ll also implement DHS’ strategic plan for statewide prevention, early intervention and crisis services, with an emphasis on infant mental health, school-based behavioral health and mental health, and substance abuse treatment for adults, with a focus on pregnant and postpartum women, according to the release. 
The UA team will also design a “unified crisis hub model” for the state in collaboration with DHS, schools, community stakeholders and partner agencies.
“Mental health and addiction are statewide issues — so our response has to be statewide too,” Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders said. “Through programs like the new crisis hub, we can address both adults’ and children’s needs early and often. These challenges aren’t unique to Arkansas, but we do have a unique opportunity to address them collaboratively to prevent and treat all Arkansans.”
Seven areas of the state will serve as pilot sites for the crisis care continuum, which officials expect will allow for unique specializations within each region, the release states.
“This work will address gaps in our system and ensure that services are available both to prevent situations from escalating to crisis level and to support Arkansans in need in times of crisis,” said Paula Stone, director of the DHS Office of Substance Abuse and Mental Health.

(Getty Images)I don’t spend a lot of time thinking about why Democratic politicians struggle so much to connect with working-class voters. That’s for the party leaders and candidates to figure out. But it’s entirely possible that Fyodor Dostoyevsky partially diagnosed the problem almost 150 years ago, when he wrote in “The Brothers Karamazov”: “The more I love humanity in general, the less I love man in particular.”
Recent Republican success winning over the working class is a little easier to understand considering America’s Puritan roots. The right has long made political hay by convincing millions of voters that the degradation of society is most evident not in corrupt fiscal policies but in expressions of human sexuality. Every legislative session has its examples, and this year one of them is a book banning bill now headed to the governor’s desk.
House Bill 324 is touted by conservatives as “parental rights” legislation meant to keep certain books out of the hands of impressionable young people. It reads: “This bill prohibits material that is obscene or harmful to minors in schools and creates a procedure for removal and cause of action.”
“Obscene,” of course, always refers to sexuality and not the cherished Americana of extreme violence. And, importantly, it does not encompass the most glaring national obscenity: economic inequality. 
Whether or not you buy the Republican argument that HB 324 targets only “flat-out pornography” in schools — which seems unlikely because that’s already covered under New Hampshire’s existing obscenity laws — author Jodi Picoult is correct in her assessment of the bill’s true intent and the price we all pay for censorship: “These parents will tell you that the books are exposing kids to topics that are salacious or revolutionary. What kids are really being exposed to are lives and mindsets different from their own, which creates compassion and empathy.”
The bottom line is that what Republican New Hampshire lawmakers — and many conservative parents — don’t like is LGBTQ themes in literature. Why? Because they are convinced that the four horsemen of the American apocalypse will ride into town dressed in drag. But the riders they should worry about have always been with us, gulping the rarefied air of Pullman palace cars and private jet cabins.
The American right’s fixation on sexuality is bad enough on its own, but it is downright confounding when coupled with Republican-backed efforts that exacerbate economic inequality. Only one of those things is an existential threat to the American experiment, and I promise you it’s not Picoult’s “Nineteen Minutes.”
HB 324 is an unnecessary bill that exists only to scratch the Republican itch to crush content it deems symbolic of Western decline. But the real threats to society are found elsewhere.
For example, consider New Hampshire Republicans’ myopic repeal of the Interest and Dividends Tax, an action undertaken in service to the state’s economic elite. That move should be constantly discussed and dissected in this state, especially now as lawmakers work at cutting hundreds of millions from the next state budget. But conservatives would rather fish in libraries for words and themes to be offended by. Meanwhile, those with the least in New Hampshire are on the threshold of fresh harm from the right’s cold budget priorities.
If you want more evidence of this dynamic, consider the “big beautiful bill” now in the works in Washington, D.C. Once again, a few will win and the struggling many will lose. But the trick to sneaking garbage like that through is to make people look for threats in the wrong places. Immigrants, diversity programs, books with titles like “Gender Queer.” Republican voters are made to believe that those are the issues pulling at America’s seams and not the obvious culprit: the 1 percent’s scorched-earth pursuit of limitless wealth. 
Riding shotgun with all of this is the rot of hypocrisy. The far right now dominating the American Republican Party is selling an idea of liberty that in practice amounts to unfettered freedom but only for the like-minded. That is why the party so consistently defends bigots and punches down on the vulnerable. You can see evidence of this in the always-uneven Republican application of “local control.” How is HB 324 in alignment with local control? How are any of the laws targeting transgender rights in alignment?
Well, they’re not, because “local control” isn’t a Republican principle. It’s a label applied or removed as a matter of philosophical convenience.
The New Hampshire Legislature’s latest go at book banning is unsurprising, considering the puritanical forces as old as the nation itself that continue to influence conservative ideology. But if they’re as concerned about the degradation of society as they say, one can only hope that they’ll realize before it’s too late that the call is coming from inside their house.
Because sexual content in a novel isn’t going to be America’s undoing, but the continuation of policies that increase the nation’s already obscene levels of economic inequality almost certainly will.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/bookladder-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-21 14:11:36.981093

U.S. District Judge Susan P. Watters presided over both cases.
Renee Esperanza Arambula, 27, of Billings pleaded guilty in November to possession with intent to distribute fentanyl and brandishing a firearm in furtherance of a drug trafficking offense.
According to a Tuesday U.S Attorney’s office press release, the federal Drug Enforcement Agency began investigating Arambula for suspected drug trafficking in 2023. Agents discovered through financial documents that between May 2020 and January 2023, Arambula deposited more than $230,000 of cash into a bank and received thousands more through electronic payments, but was making only a fraction of that through formal employment income.
Based on financial analysis, witness interview, surveillance and other investigations, the DEA learned Arambula was trafficking fentanyl and other drugs around Billings, with several individuals admitting to purchasing drugs from her.
According to statements made at the sentencing hearing and in court documents, in January 2023, Arambula used a firearm to shoot two unarmed men while trafficking, shooting one in the neck and leaving him a partially paralyzed, and shooting the second in the abdomen. Law enforcement recovered fentanyl pills and a firearm in Arambula’s possession.
The investigation was conducted by the DEA and Billings Police Department.
Livingston resident Jennifer Michelle Hall, 44, pleaded guilty in January 2025 to possession with intent to distribute meth and prohibited possession of a firearm.
The government alleged in court documents that Montana law enforcement had identified Hall as someone selling methamphetamine for “more serious distributors” in the Livingston area.
In December 2021, law enforcement executed a search warrant at Hall’s residence and recovered methamphetamine, fentanyl pills and a semi-automatic pistol. Agents with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives also recovered Halls’ phone and iPad.
In an interview with law enforcement, Hall admitted to possessing the meth and firearm, but denied she was selling drugs.
However, text messages on Hall’s electronics, obtained through search warrants, showed Hall was both using and selling drugs.
Assistant U.S. Attorney Tom Godfrey prosecuted the case. The investigation was conducted by the ATF and Park County Sheriff’s Office.

Delaware hunters achieved a historic milestone during the 2024-25 hunting season, setting new state records for both wild turkey and white-tailed deer harvests, the Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control (DNREC) announced Tuesday.
This marks the first time in state history that record harvests for both species have been recorded in the same season — a reflection, officials say, of both strong wildlife populations and the popularity of hunting throughout the state.
During the spring wild turkey season, which ran from April 12 to May 10, hunters harvested 800 birds, breaking the previous record of 723 set in 2024.
That’s an 11% increase and a significant milestone for a species that only saw its first regulated hunting season in Delaware in 1991, following a restoration effort.

“Delaware’s turkey hunters continue to play a vital role in wildlife conservation,” said Joe Rogerson, DNREC Wildlife Section administrator. “This season’s record numbers reflect not only favorable habitat conditions but also the commitment of hunters and landowners to sustainable game management.”
Sussex County led the state’s turkey harvest with 369 birds, followed by Kent County with 338 and New Castle County with 93.
Most turkeys — 630 — were taken on private land, but hunters also set a record on public land, bagging 170 birds.
Meanwhile, the state’s white-tailed deer season, which ran from Sept. 1 through Feb. 2, saw hunters harvest 18,823 deer — shattering the previous record of 17,265 set during the 2020-21 season.
The new record represents a 29.4% jump from the 2023-24 season, when 14,451 deer were harvested — the lowest total in recent years.
“The historic deer harvest also highlights continued success in wildlife conservation and management efforts across the state,” Rogerson said. “Indicative of both the resilience of Delaware’s deer population and the dedication of our hunters at pursuing our state’s big game animal, it also highlights the success of ongoing management strategies aimed at maintaining a healthy and balanced deer herd in Delaware.”
Sussex County again led the deer harvest with 9,628 deer. Kent and New Castle counties followed with 6,140 and 3,055, respectively.
The top-producing wildlife management zone was Zone 7 in southwestern Kent County, where hunters harvested 1,609 deer.
Among the season’s highlights was the harvest of a doe estimated to be 14.5 years old — likely one of the oldest deer ever recorded in the state.
The DNREC cited ongoing programs, including its deer damage assistance partnership with the Delaware Department of Agriculture, as instrumental in balancing herd management with agricultural needs.
The department also credited extended seasons and increased public land access for expanding hunting opportunities.",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Deer-Turkey-Main.jpg,,,2025-05-21 13:13:45.013260

The House aid package, announced Wednesday, comes one day after Gov. Josh Stein asked for $891 million in new relief. He warned of slow and dwindling federal aid, saying the state would likely have to shoulder more of the burden going forward.
Inside the $450 million House plan is $60 million to send disaster grants to small businesses in western North Carolina. Businesses could see up to 25% of their economic loss or $75,000, whichever is less, according to the bill.
A grant program has been the number one request of the business community since Helene hit last fall. Lawmakers have previously opted to create loans, but many regional business owners have said they could not take on any more debt.
Local governments would also see $50 million in grant money to help repair and replace infrastructure. That could help offset mounting costs for those governments as they face looming budget shortfalls, driven by both damages and lost tourism revenue.
The money for the new aid package would come in part from the private nonprofit NC Innovation. Republican lawmakers have for months said they plan to claw back public dollars from the group to fund other priorities.
Also included in the House’s aid package:

$70 million to qualify for continued reimbursement from the feds.
$30 million to continue repairing private roads and bridges.
$30 million for debris removal, including on farms.
$25 million for construction on destroyed schools.
$25 million to “improve airport infrastructure” for the region to better respond to disaster.
$25 million to rebuild farm infrastructure.
$20 million for volunteer organizations aiding in recovery.
$18 million for grants to fire stations and EMS.
$15 million for firefighting equipment and Forest Service contract workers.
$8 million to repair damaged schools.




Lawmakers have thus far spent $1.4 billion total on relief for Hurricane Helene. Their last aid package, passed in March, laid out $524 million. That package prioritized aid for farmers and spinning up a state homebuilding program.
The House plan is set to be considered by the appropriations committee Wednesday afternoon. Lawmakers in the chamber are also advancing their proposal for the state budget this week.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/dji_fly_2-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-05-21 13:13:45.013260

(Photo by Corrie Boudreaux for Source NM)Attorneys for unaccompanied migrant children in New Mexico say a federal judge’s order keeps in place money for their legal representation for now — or at least until the Trump administration appeals to the nation’s highest court.
For decades, Congress has required the federal government to ensure that children who cross the border without a parent or legal guardian have legal representation in immigration proceedings. The government has done this by paying immigration lawyers through federal grants.
However, on Feb. 18, the U.S. government ordered Acacia, the primary grant recipient, to stop working on the cases, according to court records.
The government rescinded the stop-work order a week later, but on March 21 terminated the contract altogether, which stopped all funding for legal representation going to the organizations.
Any child who was not already represented prior to the termination could not be represented in court, said Imelda Maynard, legal director at Estrella del Paso, which works with children released to their guardians in Doña Ana County and west Texas. This impacted a couple dozen children’s cases that Estrella would have handled, she said.
“During that time, we had kids who definitely needed legal representation, but because we couldn’t do it, some of them ended up with removal orders,” Maynard said. “There were children going to court that we could not represent, so they were sitting through their hearings by themselves.”
After the legal organizations sued, a federal judge in the Northern District of California issued a temporary restraining order at the beginning of April and, at the end of that month, the government provided instructions to the legal organizations about how to continue to pay for the representation.
U.S. District Judge Araceli Martínez-Olguín then issued a preliminary injunction on April 29, ruling that the government cannot depart from its prior policy without a good reason, and they haven’t shown that good reason in this case.
“The Government offers no evidence that it found pro bono counsel or even sought out alternative representation for the unaccompanied children,” Martínez-Olguín wrote.
“There’s no substitution for having legal representation,” Andres Santiago, managing attorney for the New Mexico Immigrant Law Center’s children’s team, said. “To expect a kid to navigate the system on their own is absolutely crazy.” NMILC works with children released to their guardians in every county in New Mexico.
The government appealed the judge’s order to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, which denied its request. Maynard said the government might appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court but, as of Tuesday, they had not done so.
The injunction bars the government from withholding the funds until Sept. 29.
NMILC is not a named plaintiff in the case but is affected as one of the legal service providers under the grant.
“We’ve seen things go up to the Supreme Court, so right now, it’s a tenuous situation where we have funding for now,” Santiago said.
Someone on their side
Some unaccompanied children are eligible for asylum, Santiago said, while others are eligible for other kinds of immigration relief. Some are also victims of commercial sex trafficking or labor trafficking, he said.
A lot of the children had very traumatic experiences that caused them to flee their countries, Maynard said, and a lot of them experienced further trauma on their journey here to the United States.
While every now and then some very bold children are able to advocate for themselves, most are very disoriented and scared, she said.
Federal law requires the U.S. Department of Homeland Security to transfer unaccompanied children to the Department of Health and Human Services and release them to juvenile shelters.
Attorneys connect the children to services, help them apply for visas, navigate their immigration cases, conduct know-your-rights training and represent them in immigration court.
“Their counsel, essentially, it’s the only time that they’re really hearing, ‘Hey, someone’s on your side, and someone’s here to look out for you and your interests, and listen to you,’” Maynard said.
As a result of the disruption in funding, Santiago said some NMILC staff are considering whether this kind of work makes sense for them in the long-term, though as of yet they haven’t yet lost any staff members. The children’s team has six attorneys, one legal representative and then four support staff.
The team is representing more than 200 children through the program, Santiago said. Last year, 235 children were released to sponsors in New Mexico, he said. But so far this year, there have been only 73 children released, he said.
The gap could be explained by the stop-start nature of the funding, or constraints on shelters’ ability to refer children to the attorneys, he said.
Estrella del Paso had to furlough about 18 of its staff because the flow of children coming into the shelters was so low, Maynard said.
The government argued in the case that it needed to cut the funding because of “fiscal constraints” and concerns about the “sustainability” of the program. Santiago said the funding is still needed.
“There are children that are continuing to be released to family in New Mexico, and they’re going to continue to need legal representation,” Santiago said.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/CB_FamiliesShelter-9441-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-21 13:13:45.013260

(Photo by Mitch Perry/Florida Phoenix)Aspiring statewide 2026 Democratic candidates David Jolly and Josh Weil addressed approximately 200 people Monday night in Pinellas County — just weeks before both say they will formally open campaigns, respectively, for governor and U. S. Senate.
Jolly, the former Republican turned independent who became a registered Democrat less than a month ago, said he likely will announce his candidacy for governor in mid-June.
“I anticipate I will be getting into the governor’s race, and that announcement will be coming very soon,” he said at the conclusion of his 4o-minute appearance as the headliner of the event, sponsored by the Largo Mid-Pinellas County Democratic Club.
One thing the former congressman and longtime MSNBC political analyst (whose contract with the cable network as an analyst has been paused, according to an MSNBC spokesperson) says he will bring to the race is a dash of enthusiasm — which has been lacking in Florida Democratic circles since last fall.
That’s when their top-of-ticket candidates (Kamala Harris for president and Debbie Mucarsel-Powell for Senate) both lost by 13 percentage points. In that same election, Democrats lost seats in the Florida House of Representatives and then two party members bolted to join the majority Republicans in the state House in December.
And with the Democrats’ popularity nationally hovering in some polls in the upper 20s, these haven’t been the best of times for the party. Still, Jolly insists there is a growing national revulsion to the actions the second Trump administration has undertaken during its first four months in office, and he believes it will bolster the party’s chances next year.
“There’s movement going on. A rare time in American political history where there is a movement, a coalition that is growing, that is saying, ‘We are concerned about the direction of the country and about the direction of our state,'” he said. 
“People who have never been involved in politics, who are no longer worrying about their partisan registration or political identity, they just know we’re going in the wrong direction and they want to stand up and fix it.”
The country, in fact, is going through a “constitutional crisis.” Jolly said.
“When the president of the United States looks at Congress and says, ‘I don’t care about the budget you passed. I’m not going to spend the money as directed by law,’ that’s a crisis. When he looks at the courts and he says, ‘I’m not going to follow your orders,’ that’s a crisis. We cannot normalize that. It’s right that that we stand up at that moment, stand in the gap and say, ‘We’re going to do our part to stop this.'”
Crises
Jolly, 52, cautioned that Democrats shouldn’t be all about bashing Trump — and even mentioned at about 20 minutes into his speech that he hadn’t uttered the president’s name once.
(Which was not exactly accurate — he used the president’s name when he said that Trump had elevated Elon Musk and U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, and mentioned “the president” when discussing the “constitutional crisis.”)
Jolly talks often about the “affordability crisis” in Florida, and on Monday night referred to the GOP-controlled Legislature’s proclivities toward preemption of local governments on a variety of issues as a persistent problem. He also discussed expanding Medicaid, investing in affordable, renewable, clean energy, and being tough on crime.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX“Whether you’re a native-born citizen, whether you came here, or whether you’re a Republican politician, if you break the law, you should be prosecuted,” Jolly said, eliciting one of the loudest cheers of the evening.
Gun safety is another major issue in Jolly’s platform — he advocated for universal background checks, including for transfers of guns between family members.
The Democratic Party needs to go to places where their candidates haven’t ventured in a long time, Jolly said, “and speak the language on the ground of a community just looking for answers.”
Close to his home in Pinellas County, Jolly didn’t encounter any dissenting voices when he took questions. But that won’t be the case once the self-described “Bush 41 Republican” gets called to account for some of his former more conservative political positions, such as opposition to abortion rights.
In retrospect, Jolly says, he wrongly conflated the idea of being “pro-life” with being “anti-Roe” in 2012. He reminded the audience that even when he had a different stance on abortion rights, he was the only Republican in the House who voted against a proposal to investigate Planned Parenthood (a statement verified by PolitFact).
And he says that post the 2022 U.S.Supreme Court Dobbs decision, which overturned a federal right to an abortion, he is now a “full proponent of codifying the Roe-Casey framework at the national and state level.” (“Casey” being the Supreme Court’s 1992 ruling Planned Parenthood V. Casey affirming a constitutional right to an abortion but allowing states more leeway to regulate abortion).
Unlike other famous party-switchers like Ronald Reagan or Charlie Crist, however, he’s not claiming that his former party left him.
“Folks, David Jolly left the Republican Party,” he declared, generating another healthy cheer from the partisan audience.
Now representing a party that lags more than 1 million voters behind the GOP in registrations across the state, Jolly said he hopes to build a coalition extending to independent voters and “common-sense Republican friends” who want reform, particularly of the property insurance situation.
At this early stage, no major Democrats have entered the gubernatorial contest for 2026. One Democrat who was expected to run for governor, state Sen. Jason Pizzo, recently announced that he will do so as a non-party-affiliated candidate, declaring the Florida Democratic Party “dead” in a speech on the Senate floor late last month.
Gov. Ron DeSantis, who is term-limited and thus will not be back on the ballot last year, said in Tampa on Tuesday that Pizzo is running as an independent “because people know if you have a ‘D’ next to your name in this state you are dead meat. Because this party is a disaster.”
“You’re seeing an effort for people to try to think that if they move the albatross around their neck, that somehow they’re going to be viable,” DeSantis said. “But here’s the thing: You can dress it up anyway that you want. If you put lipstick on a donkey, guess what? It’s still a donkey.”

Young voters
Jolly’s opening act, as it were, on Monday was Josh Weil, the 40-year-old Central Florida public middle school instructor who was the Democratic nominee in the Congressional District 6 special election in Northeast Florida that became vacant after Trump selected GOP incumbent Mike Waltz as his National Security Adviser.
(Waltz subsequently has been transferred to serve as ambassador to the United Nations, pending Senate confirmation).
Although Weil lost to Republican Randy Fine by 14 percentage points in the April 1 special election, 57%-43%, the margin was 18 points closer than the previous Democratic candidate received in losing to Waltz in the same district just five months earlier.
Weil said the experience showed him that Democrats have too often written off congressional districts that they don’t believe they can win. And with Republicans holding 20 of the state’s 28 seats, that’s roughly 70% of the state that the party hasn’t competed for in recent election cycles.
That’s particularly hurt them with young voters, Weil said.
“That means that if you’re 25 or under, living in that 70% of the state, you have never had a Democrat knock on your door,” he said. “We have to get out there. We have to re-engage them, to go to where they are. They’re not coming to us. We have to get out to where they are.”
Weil was able to raise considerably more cash than Fine in that race, and he now appears emboldened to help fundraising efforts around the state. He said Monday that he and his “team” have a plan to raise $10 million for voter registration efforts across the state over the next 16 months, with a particular interest in Miami-Dade and Pinellas counties.
“We are committing to invest $1 million in the field, for every congressional district in this state, to make sure that we carry the message to voters where they are, in every district in every county, in ways that our party has been unable to cycle after cycle,” he said, adding that CD-13 is “up for grabs.”
That remains to be seen. Despite a focus by Democrats on flipping the seat last fall, Republican Anna Paulina Luna cruised to more than 9-point victory in November.
Regarding his own candidacy, Weil said he will announce on June 21.

Sussex County officials on Tuesday introduced a proposed $285.1 million budget for Fiscal Year 2026, a plan that increases overall spending while significantly lowering the property tax rate, the first such adjustment in more than three decades.
Driven largely by capital investments in wastewater infrastructure and supported by increased assessed property values, the proposed budget reflects a 7.3% increase — or nearly $20 million — over the current year’s spending. Still, the County is aiming to keep operations modest, with the general fund growing just 4.4%.
The most notable change in the plan is a major cut to the property tax rate, which would drop from 44.5 cents to 2.14 cents per $100 of assessed value — the result of a recent court-ordered property reassessment. The lower rate is designed to keep overall property tax collections “revenue neutral,” despite new construction adding to the tax base.

“There’s a lot to take in with this year’s budget, but the bottom line is Sussex County continues to deliver the best services at the best possible value,” said County Administrator Todd F. Lawson, who presented to County Council the proposed budget for the fiscal year that begins July 1. “Through all the change, that’s the one constant our constituents can count on.”
Key Investments in Budget
The budget proposal includes substantial investments in infrastructure, public safety, and community development:

$76.7 million for wastewater system upgrades, including treatment plant expansions and new service areas.
$7.4 million for farmland and open space preservation.
$5.8 million to fund 25 supplemental state police troopers — up from $4.6 million last year.
$2.4 million for planning and construction of paramedic stations in Dewey Beach, Lincoln, and Milton.
$6 million to support local fire companies and ambulance squads.
$1.25 million for affordable housing initiatives, including home rehab and settlement assistance.
Increased municipal law enforcement support, growing from $920,000 to $1 million.

Some modest fee increases are also proposed, including a $12 annual hike for sewer services and a $33 increase for unmetered water users. Fees for services from the Sheriff’s Office, GIS, and Engineering departments are also slated for adjustment.
Council President Doug Hudson commended the budget team, calling the plan a “balanced” and “team-driven” effort.
“That’s no easy feat, trying to satisfy a lot of competing interests, but this team always seems to pull it off,” President Hudson said. “It’s not magic. Just good teamwork and expertise. We appreciate it, and I know the taxpayers do, too.”
Public Input Invited
A public hearing on the proposed budget will be held at 10 a.m. on Tuesday, June 17, in the County Administrative Offices at 2 The Circle, Georgetown.
Residents can also submit feedback via email to budget@sussexcountyde.gov.

(Matthew Perschall/Louisiana Illuminator)A Louisiana lawmaker faces charges for driving while intoxicated and child endangerment after police said he was involved in a single-car wreck early Wednesday morning with his three children.
Louisiana State Police arrived on the accident scene at 2:30 a.m. Wednesday, according to a news release. State Rep. Kyle Green Jr., D-Marrero, reportedly veered off U.S. Highway 90 Business in West Jefferson near Ames Boulevard and struck a concrete barrier with his 2023 Honda Accord. 
Green and the children were uninjured, according to police. The children were released to a relative.  
“Troopers noticed signs of impairment and conducted a series of standardized field sobriety tests. Green was subsequently placed under arrest,” the State Police release said.
Green was taken to the Jefferson Parish Correctional Center, where troopers said he refused to take a breath test. A judge’s warrant allowed investigators to obtain blood samples and, based on the results, Green was booked for first offense DWI, three counts of DWI with child endangerment, careless operation, improper lane use and a traffic attachment from Jefferson Parish.
State Police did not disclose Green’s blood alcohol level.
Green did not respond immediately to attempts to reach him Wednesday morning.
Records from the Jefferson Parish jail show Green’s total bond was $2,800.
Green has represented Louisiana House District 83 since 2019. His committee assignments in the legislature include Commerce, Insurance and Judiciary.

House Bill 819, brought by Flathead Republican Rep. Braxton Mitchell, puts strict stipulations on what flags can be displayed at schools and other government buildings.
Gov. Greg Gianforte signed the legislation late last week. It’s unclear what penalties, if any, there will be for violation of the law.
“Allowing nongovernmental or politically charged symbols on state property creates inconsistency in enforcement, legal challenges, and public divisiveness, undermining the neutrality and inclusivity of government spaces,” the law reads.
The bill passed along party lines in both the House and Senate. During his testimony for the bill, Mitchell said it was about fairness and neutrality in government.
“I don’t think in Flathead County they should be flying a Trump flag,” Mitchell said. “I don’t think in Missoula County they should be flying a Kamala Harris flag.”
The flags that are now allowed include the United States flag, as well as Montana’s, and any other state, city, tribal, and military flag.
There’s also a specific stipulation which states: “Flags honoring law enforcement officers, military service members, and public service organizations provide appropriate, nonpolitical recognition of their contributions to public safety and national defense.”
It’s unclear if that includes the Thin Blue Line flag, which honors law enforcement but can be viewed as political. That flag wasn’t brought up in either hearing.
The flag law also says any “federally recognized” nation’s flag can be flown as well as school mascots. So while Taiwan’s flag could not be flown, a high school football team is protected if they run onto the field before a game with their flag. And, since Iran and North Korea are recognized as nations by the federal government, those flags technically could be displayed under the new law.

It is, however, unclear if a Confederate flag would be protected as it is both politically charged, and a flag of historical significance, for which the law has a stipulation. The Gadsden flag — or the “Don’t Tread on Me” flag — is specifically protected under the law. 
Other questions, such as if a flag in support of a labor group would be allowed, are unanswered in the new law. Opponents of the bill, which included ACLU Montana and the Montana Gender Alliance, pointed to some of the questions the bill left open.
“It’s broad and contradictory, which means that certain beliefs are able to be promoted over others,” said Henry Seaton, an ACLU lobbyist who testified against the bill. “It eliminates the ability for people to show support for particular, marginalized communities.”
Other states, including Idaho and Utah, have passed similar legislation. Some cities in those states have pushed back, with Salt Lake City adopting three new city flags to circumvent the law: One in support of the city’s Black and African American residents, a trans flag rights and a Pride flag.
Classrooms were also a target, something Mitchell had on his mind during the hearings for HB 819. He said that teachers were acting as “state officials” in the classroom and pointed to his experience.
“I know when I went to school in 2018 they had Black Lives Matter flags,” Mitchell testified to the Senate State Administration Committee on April 2. “I don’t think that’s something that should be something that should be pushed in a school. There were some teachers that had pride flags.”
While Mitchell says court cases back up the state’s ability to regulate speech in public buildings, students, at least, don’t lose their rights at the schoolhouse gate, which the U.S. Supreme Court found in Tinker vs. Des Moines.
The bill says it does “not infringe on private speech or individual expression, as they apply solely to government-controlled displays, ensuring personal freedoms remain intact while maintaining a neutral public environment.”

It’s unclear how this law will be enacted in schools. Missoula County Public Schools Superintendent Micah Hill said his district will follow the law. In an email, he said no flags have been taken down.
He added he assumed “that if we’re out of compliance, we would request that any flag as defined by the new law be taken down.”
The state’s public universities and colleges could also be impacted by the law, though they’re not specifically mentioned in the legislation. Montana State University school officials referred questions on the law to the Office of the Commissioner of Higher Education.
In Montana, the state Constitution gives the Board of Regents the authority to supervise the Montana University System, but the Commissioner’s Office did not respond to a question Tuesday seeking comment on the legislation.
Flags have been a topic of conversation in Bozeman before. In 2021, an MSU student living in university housing displayed a Black Lives Matter flag in plain view outside of a window. The student was told to take it down because it was a “fire hazard” and briefly did, before putting it back up.
It’s likely not to impact the University of Montana, UM spokesperson Dave Kuntz said, who added they’d been in contact with the Commissioner’s Office about the new law. The flags UM flies are already on the list outlined in the new law. He said the university does not plan to regulate flags in offices or in dorm rooms.
“That’s just an area of personal privacy,” Kuntz said. “As the law is passed right now, it just doesn’t have a large impact on the campus.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/GettyImages-1753030050-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-21 12:23:53.624235

(File photo by Bryan P. Sears/Maryland Matters).A financial agency that recently downgraded Maryland’s bond rating drew sharp words Wednesday from Treasurer Dereck Davis (D) and a suggestion that Maryland might break from the company.
The state’s decades-long string of holding AAA ratings from all three bond-rating agencies ended a week ago when Moody’s, one of the three top rating agencies, downgraded Maryland to Aa1. Davis, whose office is responsible for issuing the bonds that help pay for major projects, including schools and infrastructure, said he takes the downgrade personally.
“So, you know, to hell with Moody’s,” Davis said at the outset of Wednesday’s Board of Public Works meeting with Gov. Wes Moore (D) and Comptroller Brooke Lierman (D).
Davis also suggested the agency had other considerations as it issued its report last week.
“I know in the case of Maryland, when you’re paying $229,000 they got to give you something. They’re not going to just hand out, as we say in school, A’s for nothing,” Davis said, adding that the company was selling subscriptions to investors and “you know, you got to give people a reason to buy it.”
Davis’ comments underscore a deep frustration and concern about how transparent the Moody’s review process has been.
The downgrade by Moody’s was the first from that agency since it gave Maryland a AAA rating in 1973. The change meant the state lost its treasured triple, triple-A creditworthiness rating — Standard & Poor’s has given Maryland an AAA rating since 1961, while Fitch Ratings has graded Maryland’s bonds AAA since 1993.
Fitch last week reaffirmed the state’s AAA rating, just one day after the Moody’s downgrade. Standard & Poor’s, is expected to release its newest rating before the state’s scheduled June 11 bond sale.
Maryland uses the three agencies to annually assess the state’s creditworthiness. The ratings determine how much interest the state — and taxpayers — will pay for the money it borrows through annual bond issuances. Each of those agencies is paid by the state to do the ratings.
Officials have not expressed concerns that the Standard & Poor’s report will come with a credit downgrade for Maryland.
Davis, however, strongly implied Moody’s services may no longer be needed.
“Now you’re seeing why, if you also do some research, more and more states are also moving away from Moody’s,” Davis said. “They’re not the standard-bearer” they once were.

One of the bugs is shown in some bedding. (Stock photo by John Downer/Getty Images)LINCOLN — Nebraska Gov. Jim Pillen has squashed, at least for now, a legislative effort to help Omaha public housing residents get rid of a persistent bed bug problem, vetoing an Urban Affairs Committee bill pushed by a North Omaha lawmaker.
Legislative Bill 287 sought quicker and better remedies to bedbug infestations and other concerns voiced by low-income residents of the Omaha Housing Authority, primarily those who live in publicly subsidized apartment towers.
The proposed intervention followed public outcry by OHA residents and advocates, including a class-action lawsuit led by a group of current or former residents of 10 public housing high-rise apartments and represented by attorney and former State Sen. Justin Wayne of Omaha and two Iowa lawyers that specialize in bedbug cases.
State Sen. Terrell McKinney, who has pushed the legislative effort, said Wednesday that he was disappointed by Pillen’s veto — and is submitting a motion to override it.

McKinney, chair of the Urban Affairs Committee, said that he resorted to legislation because residents were not seeing relief they wanted through any other level of government.
“This bill was introduced in response to the complete lack of accountability regarding the Omaha Housing Authority both from HUD and the City of Omaha,” he said Wednesday, referring to the federal U.S. Housing and Urban Development, which is the primary funder of OHA. “It was meant to assist and help people who have been living through horrible conditions.”
State Sen. Machaela Cavanaugh of Omaha remarked from the legislative floor Wednesday that it “should not go unnoticed” that the two bills vetoed in recent days by the governor were championed by Black men.
Last week, the governor vetoed a bill by State Sen. Victor Rountee of Bellevue on expanding SNAP benefits to people with certain drug pasts. The Legislature upheld the veto Monday.
In a letter laying out his objection to the bedbug bill, Pillen said it created “needless duplicative government mandates and regulatory bureaucracy where none is needed.”
Pillen said he believed local governments should possess the authority to enforce basic sanitation and anti-infestation standards for dwellings within their jurisdiction. He said that the City of Omaha already possessed that authority.

He also said the legislation imposes “a redundant solution in pursuit of a problem” that federal oversight is legally equipped to address. He said OHA, which manages the units that residents say are infested, is subject to “rigorous federal oversight.”
OHA tower residents and their advocates have said in court documents and media events that the infestation dates back to 2016.
OHA officials have said that they have been working on the problem, and have implemented various measures. Omaha Mayor Jean Stothert and several city council members objected to the bedbug-focused legislation.
Among key elements of the bill is an option for the City of Omaha to step in and regulate OHA in areas such as providing for pest control, inspections, penalties for code violations and requiring monthly updates to the city council.
During legislative debate, State Sen. John Cavanaugh of Omaha, a member of the Urban Affairs Committee, told his colleagues that the option allows the city discretion to pass an ordinance to take more local control. There’s been “a lot of kicking back and forth of who’s responsible” and the option, he said, would eliminate the reason the city has given for not engaging more in an oversight role.
“They claim they don’t have the authority this bill would grant them,” Cavanaugh said. “It just takes away their opportunity to say, ‘We can’t do that.’”
City Attorney Matthew Kuhse previously wrote a two-page letter to lawmakers saying that the housing authority is a separate legal entity and that any additional oversight or regulations should be done by the Legislature, not the City of Omaha. Omaha’s mayor appoints OHA board members, and the city council confirms them.
McKinney on Wednesday reiterated that the bill gave the City of Omaha the option to take action if they chose it. “It does not mandate anything.”
He said, “The residents of OHA deserve better, and the governor chose not to support their right to safe, accountable housing.”

(Photo: Screenshot from event video stream)A panel of speakers at a Tuesday “Voices for Veterans” event in Fayetteville agreed that America has a moral obligation to care for members of the military after they have completed their service.
The panelists’ remarks were in response to a question by moderator Michael McElroy, a political correspondent at Cardinal & Pine, the online publication that hosted the event for the purpose of “supporting North Carolina’s veterans and military families.”
 Big VA cuts spark big worries
The comments come amid concerns about steep staffing cuts at Veterans Administration hospitals. VA staff and supporters contend proposed cuts will hinder the ability to adequately care for veterans. More than 80,000 positions — just over 17% of the roughly 470,000 people it employs — could be eliminated as part of a major restructuring of the federal government’s second largest department.
The Trump administration is thinking about numbers and not people when it proposes such deep cuts to the VA, said Ann Marie Patterson-Powell, a VA nurse.
“They’re not looking at the human side of it. Patterson-Powell said. “We promised those who signed up and left their families, their homes — everything behind — to serve the country. We said, ‘If you do this for me, we’re going to take care of you when you come back.’”
The nation must do for veterans what it said it would do with “no strings attached, with no arguments, with no pushback,” Patterson-Powell said.
Dr. Kyle Horton, founder of On Your Side Health, a nonprofit that addresses health care disparities and works to improve veterans’ health care, said the nation has a sacred obligation to protect those who serve.
“Those who wrote a blank check in service to this country with their lives do not deserve to be penny-pinched by Washington bureaucrats,” Horton said.
Horton added: “They don’t deserve to be penny-pinched by Captain Bone Spurs in the White House [a reference to President Donald Trump, who obtained a medical excuse from serving in the Vietnam War due to bone spurs] right now and they don’t deserve to be penny pinched by DOGE [the so-called Department of Government Efficiency] and  [Elon] Musk who don’t even know what they’re doing. Period.”
Patterson-Powell said there is a push by the Trump administration to privatize the VA. That could be harmful to veterans who wouldn’t receive the specialized care they now get at the VA, she said.

Scott Peoples, a retired Army captain, member of Veterans for Responsible Leadership (VFRL) and an advocate for free and fair elections, noted that America fights its wars with volunteers. The proposed budget VA budget cuts could make people think twice about making a commitment to serve, Peoples said.
“How we take care of them after service is kind of our Number One recruiting tool as well for future people who want to join the military,” Peoples said.
He said the Trump administration’s firing of VA staff members made him angry.
“Every single one of those people got into it for the right reasons; wants to serve their country by taking care of our veterans and the way they have so inhumanely shrugged off cutting people with no transparency, just people receiving emails, people having moved their families across country [to work at the VA], is just despicable,” Peoples said.   
  Grier Martin (Photo: Screenshot from event video stream)
Grier Martin, Secretary of the NC Department of Military and Veterans Affairs, said the cuts would have a devastating impact on rural communities.
“If these cuts go through, you’re going to see the VA’s presence in rural areas start to dry out,” Martin said. “These are areas that are already starting to see their civilian hospitals close also.”
The state’s decision to expand Medicaid has been helpful in helping some rural hospitals remain open, he said, but veterans will have difficulty finding care near home if the VA’s presence is diminished.
“If you live on the coast, you’re not going to drive to Durham and you’re probably not going to drive to Fayetteville to the VA hospital to get your care,” Grier said.
Rep. Eric Ager (D-Buncombe) said the outpouring of concern and support for veterans gives him cause for hope amid threats of major cuts to the VA.
“That is how change happens,” Ager said. “It may not be immediate. It may not always be completely satisfying. But the fact that veterans are coming together, that the community is coming together to support veterans, I think will eventually lead to change.”   
Threats to democracy
A second panel discussion moderated by Cardinal & Pine’s managing editor Billy Ball, focused on threats to democracy and the evolving role of veterans as defenders of democracy.
  Bobby Jones (Photo: Screenshot from event video stream)
Panelist Bobby Jones, president of VFRL and retired Navy commander, said he could see the cost of freedom in the faces of the veterans in the audience. Jones said the services the VA provides are essential to national security.
“I know this panel is about national security, but my thing is you cannot have one without the other,” Jones said. “The VA has to be sound in order for us to have a proper national security apparatus.”
Jones was critical of Trump and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth. He said neither man understands the concept of service to country.
“For the first time, I believe in American history, we have leadership that doesn’t get it, that thinks the Constitution is nothing more than a suggestion,” Jones said. “Hell, even the South for the Civil War had the good sense to defect and secede before going against the Constitution.”
America is in “unparalleled, unprecedented times” and veterans must step up to lead the country out the quagmire, Jones said.
Ball asked the panel to discuss the much-watched North Carolina Supreme Court race between Republican Jefferson Griffin and Allison Riggs, a Democrat. The outcome of the closely contested race wasn’t resolved until this month after nearly six months. Griffin conceded after a federal judge ordered the state to certify Riggs’ election victory.
Military and overseas votes were at the center of the election dispute. Griffin challenged the validity of some military and overseas absentee ballots in the 2024 contest.
“To protect military and veterans’ families’ votes, really has to come from the voters, really has to come from political pressure,” said Sean Wright, a former Army medic. “We have to make it, as voters, unacceptable to take away the right to vote.”
Rep. Terry Brown (D-Mecklenburg) said men and women who serve overseas have expectations that they will be treated with a certain amount of respect.
“This election really showed how little the powers that be cared about that,” Brown said. “I like to think about it in terms of people that talk a good game, but they don’t back it up.”
Brown said Americans can’t afford to take a day off defending democracy.
“We have to make sure that’s it’s not just doing election season, it’s not just when there are votes on the line, it’s not just when a bad thing happens,” Brown said. “It’s all the time that we’re making sure that y’all are laser-focused on protecting against threats to our democracy.”
Jay Carey, leader of Resist & Persist, a nonpartisan veterans advocacy organization, said the challenge to the state Supreme Court election was a test by the GOP to determine how much the judicial system and voters could stomach.
Carey, who garnered national attention after he was escorted out of U.S. Rep. Chuck Edwards’ townhall meeting in Asheville in March, said there will be more challenges to valid election victories.
“They’re [the challenges] are going to get more and more ridiculous,” Carey said. “It’s going to tie up time and waste more money Like I said, it was a test. They just wanted to see what they could do.”
The discussion turned to talk of Trump’s removing the military’s Judge Advocate Generals (JAG) and replacing them with what some panelists said are loyalists to the administration. JAGs advise commanders on legal matters and oversee the military judicial system.
Jones said the legal protections provided by JAGs are critical to defending the nation against internal threats he fears are coming from the Trump administration.
“I can’t stress the panic level enough on this,” Jones said. “All of the dominoes are falling. To those of us paying attention, it’s blatantly obvious. Any time there’s a voice of dissent, they shut it down.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Image-1024x694.png,,,2025-05-21 12:23:53.624235

Brendan Boyle, ranking member on the House Committee on the Budget, said in a statement late Tuesday that “Donald Trump and House Republicans are selling out the middle class to make the ultra-rich even richer.”“This is what Republicans are fighting for—lining the pockets of their billionaire donors while children go hungry and families get kicked off their health care,” said the Pennsylvania Democrat.The bill as written now would slash roughly $800 billion from Medicaid and Affordable Care Act provisions, and $300 billion from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, according to the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.Lawmakers on the House Committee on Rules — the final stop for the 1,116-page package bill before it reaches a House floor vote — have been debating the measure since 1 a.m. Eastern Wednesday, while House Speaker Mike Johnson huddled separately with far-right deficit hawks.Far-right members of the House Freedom Caucus remained skeptical the bill could reach the House floor by Johnson’s goal of Wednesday.The Louisiana Republican leader also faces opposition from GOP lawmakers who represent high-tax blue states who want an even higher ceiling for the amount of state and local taxes, or SALT, their constituents can deduct from federal taxable income.Lifting the ceiling, which lawmakers already proposed boosting from $10,000 to $30,000 for married couples filing jointly, will increase the cost of the bill.Johnson needs nearly every GOP lawmaker to support the bill once it hits the floor as House Republicans have an extremely thin 220-213 majority.",,,,2025-05-21 12:23:53.624235

Delaware has become the latest state to legalize medical aid in dying, following the signing of House Bill 140 on Wednesday.
The new law, titled the Ron Silverio/Heather Block End-of-Life Options Act, permits mentally capable, terminally ill adults with a prognosis of six months or less to request and self-administer life-ending medication. Named for two late advocates, the measure follows years of public debate and legislative effort.
“Today I’m going to sign a bill that speaks to compassion, dignity, and respect for personal choice,” said Governor Matt Meyer before signing the bill into law. 
“This signing today is about relieving suffering and giving families the comfort of knowing that their loved one was able to pass on their own terms, without unnecessary pain, and surrounded by the people they love most,” he said.

The legislation includes various safeguards, including confirmation of eligibility by two healthcare providers, mental health evaluations when needed, and multiple waiting periods. Patients must make a written request witnessed by two individuals, and providers must inform them of all other end-of-life care options, including palliative and hospice care.
“Thanks to this signing today, all Delawareans can now have merciful deaths and leave life-affirming legacies,” said longtime Wilmington advocate Judy Govatos, who has incurable lymphoma.
Participation by providers is voluntary, and healthcare institutions may prohibit the practice on their premises. The law protects patients and providers acting in good faith from legal liability and explicitly states that actions taken per the law do not constitute suicide, homicide, or euthanasia.
“There are no losers here with this bill. Delawareans with six months or less to live can choose to fight for their lives to their very last breath, and those of us who prefer a more peaceful death can request a prescription that will ease our last breath,” said Govatos. 
Set to take effect January 1, 2026 — or earlier if regulations are finalized — the law tasks the Delaware Department of Health and Social Services with implementation, including rulemaking, data collection, and annual reporting on use and compliance.

The measure has been a central focus of Compassion & Choices and its affiliate, the Compassion & Choices Action Network, which supports legislation that expands end-of-life options nationwide. The organizations provide legal, medical, and advocacy resources for patients, families, and lawmakers seeking to establish or implement medical aid-in-dying laws.

Jerome Zeringue, R-Houma, and Royce Duplessis, D-New Orleans, in the Louisiana House of Representative, Feb. 2, 2022. (Greg LaRose/Louisiana Illuminator) Legislation to convert Louisiana’s insurance commissioner from an elected office into an appointed one stalled on the state Senate floor Tuesday when the author of the proposal realized it was likely to fail. 
Senate Bill 214 would have let the next governor, subject to Senate approval, appoint the state’s next insurance commissioner to a six-year term, with a limit of two terms. Under current law, the commissioner is chosen every four years through the same statewide election when voters select a governor. It is one of only two statewide elected offices that can be changed into an appointed position without a constitutional amendment though still requires two-thirds support from lawmakers. The other is the commissioner of agriculture.
The proposal would have allowed current Insurance Commissioner Tim Temple to run for re-election before the move to an appointed office holder. 
Just a week ago, the bill cleared the Senate Committee on Insurance with unanimous support. On Tuesday, however, its author, Sen. Royce Duplessis, D-New Orleans, pulled the bill as opposition mounted from certain Republicans. In an interview, he said he started counting votes and decided it might be better to replace his bill with a resolution that would create a task force to study the issue. 
“It was never a bill that I thought would have unanimous support,” Duplessis said. “Some people want the status quo … I just don’t think I had the numbers. It would have been close.”
While presenting the bill on the floor, Duplessis told colleagues there’s good reason for certain state officials to be appointed rather than elected. He mentioned the secretaries of the health and environmental quality departments as important offices that should be insulated from the politics of elected office.
“I think that some roles are so specialized and technical that they shouldn’t be politicized,” he said.
Very few voters pay attention to the office of insurance commissioner, Duplessis said, pointing out that Temple ran for office unopposed. 
Republicans have generally been supportive of Temple, a former insurance executive who is opposed to Duplessis’ bill and has lobbied for legislation with the backing of insurance companies.
Democrats, on the other hand, have been critical of the commissioner’s cozy relationship with the industry he’s charged with regulating and believe Temple could do more to rein in high premiums. 
The one big exception to that partisan alignment is Gov. Jeff Landry, who has been publicly feuding with Temple over the causes of the insurance crisis in Louisiana. Even with his reelection bid still two years away, the governor has incentive to deflect any blame voters might lay at his feet for insurance costs even though the crisis began before he took office in 2024. 
Temple and the companies he regulates have long claimed personal injury lawsuits are driving the state’s high insurance premiums. He has advocated for so-called “tort reform” laws that give insurance companies certain protections or advantages in litigation. Tort reform efforts in previous years have failed to reduce insurance rates, though Temple and his supporters have said those measures were not strong enough. 
Gov. Landry’s approach to lower insurance rates could cast his political fate

Duplessis’ bill had the backing of some conservative Republicans, such as Sen. Stewart Cathey of Monroe. Cathey added the amendment to require Senate confirmation of the governor’s pick for commissioner. 
But as other Republicans lined up to speak against the bill, debate started to sour when Sen. Adam Bass of Bossier City accused Duplessis of trying to strip away voters’ rights. 
“What other voting rights are you interested in taking away from the citizens?” Bass asked Duplessis.
Duplessis rejected the characterization and said he only wants to address the state’s insurance crisis with novel proposals. He noted 39 other states have appointed, rather than elected, insurance commissioners. Among the 10 states with the lowest auto insurance rates in the country, nine of them have appointed commissioners, he added.
“I am someone who generally believes in the power of elections and the will of the people,” Duplessis said. “But when something isn’t working and the outcomes are consistently failing consumers and driving up costs, we have to be honest enough to say it’s time to do something different.”
Sen. Kirk Talbot, R-River Ridge, spoke against the bill, though he said he authored similar legislation years ago. He said he studied the issue and eventually concluded the elected system “was the better way to go.”
Talbot repeated a statistic that Temple often cites from the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, which indicates there were more bodily injury claims from auto accidents in Louisiana with a population of roughly 4.5 million, than there were in the state of New York with a population of over 19 million in 2021, which is the most recent data available. 
“That’s what needs to be addressed, not this,” Talbot said. “And that’s what we are addressing with this vast package of tort reform bills that the commissioner has supported.”
Still, that same source indicates the dollar value of the incurred losses of Louisiana’s claims was less than half that of New York’s and roughly equal to the losses in Arkansas where liability premiums were the lowest out of all the southern states. 
Other states with more injury claims than New York included North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Florida and California.
Louisiana’s insurance commissioner was originally an appointed position when the post was created in 1957. Gov. Earl K. Long supported the launch of a state insurance department, separating its functions from the office of one of his political adversaries, Secretary of State Wade O. Martin. The very first appointed commissioner, Rufus Hayes, became the first elected one for his second term.

Months of protests following her death in 2020 led to yesterday's U.S. Justice Department report exposing a culture of unconstitutional abuse in the Louisville police. (Photo by Jon Cherry/Getty Images)The U.S. Department of Justice is pulling back from a consent decree aimed at reforming the Louisville Metro Police Department, saying such actions are “handcuffing local leaders.” 
The consent decree — which was in response to the police killing of Breonna Taylor and an investigation that exposed a pattern of constitutional violations by Louisville police — was meant to last five years. It required the police department to focus on de-escalation, work to “reduce unlawful racial disparities in enforcement,” provide training and support to police officers and more.  
About six months after the DOJ announced the consent decree — under former Democratic President Joe Biden — the Justice Department under Republican President Donald Trump says it is “confident that the vast majority of police officers across the nation will continue to vigorously enforce the law and protect the public in full compliance with the Constitution and all applicable federal laws.”
The DOJ is also dropping a similar consent decree in Minneapolis, Minnesota, where white police officer Derek Chauvin killed George Floyd, a Black man, by kneeling on his neck for more than eight minutes. 
Louisville Police Department enters consent decree with the U.S. Department of Justice

“When bad actors in uniform fail to do so, the department stands ready to take all necessary action to address any resulting constitutional or civil-rights violations, including via criminal prosecution,” the DOJ said Wednesday. 
The DOJ’s Civil Rights Division is beginning the process of dismissing the lawsuits against the police departments in Louisville and Minneapolis, according to a news release.
Assistant Attorney General Harmeet K. Dhillon of the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division said in a statement that “overbroad police consent decrees divest local control of policing from communities where it belongs, turning that power over to unelected and unaccountable bureaucrats, often with an anti-police agenda.”
“Today, we are ending the Biden Civil Rights Division’s failed experiment of handcuffing local leaders and police departments with factually unjustified consent decrees,” Dhillon said. 
The Lantern has asked the Louisville Metro Police Department for comment. 
Why the Louisville consent decree? 
The consent decree came in December 2024 in response to a series of controversies — including the killing of Taylor, a 26-year-old Black woman who police fatally shot while serving a no-knock warrant in 2020. Her killing sparked months of protests. It late was revealed that police had used falsified information to obtain the warrant. 
 In 2022, two LMPD officers received federal prison sentences for throwing slushies and drinks from unmarked squad cars at residents in the predominantly Black West End, the Louisville Courier Journal reported. 
In August 2024, the DOJ released a separate report saying it had “reasonable cause” to believe Kentucky is violating the Americans with Disabilities Act in Jefferson County. That finding came after two years of investigation “focused on whether Kentucky subjects adults with serious mental illness to unnecessary segregation in psychiatric hospitals in Louisville.”
Kristen Clarke, then assistant attorney general for civil rights with the Justice Department, said at the time of the decree that police “used excessive force, unlawfully executed search warrants without knocking and announcing, carried out unlawful stops, searches and arrests, engaged in discriminatory policing with respect to low-level traffic stops and other offenses, violated the rights of people engaged in protected speech during demonstrations critical of policing and treated people with behavioral health disabilities unlawfully.”

While the federal government protects animals listed under the Endangered Species Act, states are tasked with keeping the vast majority of other species out of the “emergency room.” Habitat loss, pollution and climate change are making that job much more difficult.
At the same time, states are finding it harder to count on the hunting and fishing revenues that have long funded most of their work. Agencies say they have more challenges than ever before, and less money to take them on.
In many states, lawmakers are rethinking the long-standing model for wildlife management. They’re considering new funding sources to make the agencies less reliant on license fees. They’re asking wildlife managers to expand their work beyond traditional “game” species, adding protections for threatened insects and other animals. And some are scrutinizing the commissions that have long governed wildlife management.
Some of the proposals have seen broad support from outdoors lovers who want to strengthen their wildlife agencies. Others have drawn opposition from sporting groups, who fear the new focus will diminish hunting and fishing opportunities.
“We’re seeing quite a bit of action this year,” said Logan Christian, wildlife and habitat specialist with the National Caucus of Environmental Legislators, a forum for state lawmakers. “We definitely have noticed that states are working on strengthening their wildlife agencies.”
As Stateline previously reported, New Mexico enacted the most sweeping overhaul this year. It renamed the Department of Game & Fish as the Department of Wildlife, giving it a more explicit focus on non-game species. Budget writers provided $10.5 million in new funding over the next three years to help threatened species. And lawmakers created a new process for appointing the agency’s commissioners, with guidelines ensuring a diversity of expertise and experience.
Wildlife advocates in other states say the New Mexico overhaul was a game changer. But lawmakers elsewhere are taking a more piecemeal approach.
 Dollars

Numerous states are reconsidering their wildlife agencies’ funding model.
“There’s definitely a growing awareness that the current management system is outdated and really unfit for 21st century challenges,” said Michelle Lute, executive director of Wildlife for All, a nonprofit focused on overhauling state wildlife governance. “State wildlife agencies are seeing that they can’t rely on hunting and fishing license fees to be able to do this work.”
Earlier this year, lawmakers in Utah enacted a new tax on wind and solar projects that will help fund the state’s wildlife agency. The revenue could double the department’s funding to protect non-game species, from $5 million to $10 million.
“We have a funding model in place for game species,” said Paul Thompson, administrator of the Species Protection Account with the Utah Division of Wildlife Resources. “Funding to work on some of our native species programs has been really hard to come by.”
The new revenue could allow the agency to invest in more biologists, conservation easements, watershed restoration projects and native fish hatchery programs. State Rep. Casey Snider, the Republican who sponsored the bill, argued that the clean energy sector should pay because its development is harming Utah’s habitat.
“Wind and solar projects have an outsized impact on [non-game] species, and they have not been contributing financially,” he said.
But industry leaders said the law will threaten the state’s energy development.
“[The measure will] severely strain the economics of an existing project and send a negative message to developers and the financial institutions that provide capital for these projects,” said Theresa Foxley, chief of staff to rPlus Energies, a renewable developer, in testimony to lawmakers.
Lawmakers in Oregon are considering an increase to the state’s tax on hotel and short-term rental stays to help fund non-game wildlife work. The proposal would bring in about $30 million annually. State Rep. Ken Helm, the bill’s Democratic sponsor, said the state wildlife agency’s division to manage non-game species “has come and gone over the last 30 years as funding is available.”
Growing concerns about climate change and biodiversity have created urgency to find a stable funding source, he said. Helm said the lodging tax is a logical source, because the state’s tourism industry is centered on the outdoors. He noted that Oregon’s natural resources agencies receive only a tiny fraction of the state’s general revenue.
Travel and tourism groups oppose the bill, arguing it could drive visitors elsewhere. Helm has also proposed a bill that would bring in wildlife funding through an income tax increase.
He said his message to fellow lawmakers was: “I’ve given you two ways to get the money we need for this agency. Nobody’s been able to come up with a better idea. Just pick one.”
The bill was heard in committee earlier this month, but has not yet advanced.
Meanwhile, lawmakers in Hawaii approved a “green fee” — a lodging tax increase of 0.75% that Democratic Gov. Josh Green’s office estimates will bring in $100 million annually to help protect the state from climate change. While the fund is not explicitly focused on wildlife, it’s expected to contribute to efforts such as coral reef restoration and watershed protection that will benefit important habitats.
State Rep. Amy Perruso, a Democrat who was among the advocates for a green fee, said the COVID-19 pandemic was a wakeup call.
“With the absence of tourists, we saw a lot more fish in the ocean, everything about the environment was so much more healthy because we didn’t have 10 million extra people,” she said. “If we’re going to do something to protect the environment, [tourism] is a logical connection.”
Washington state was among the first to significantly invest in non-game conservation through state tax revenue, with legislation enacted two years ago. The budget passed by lawmakers this session continues that work, with $14 million set aside for biodiversity and species recovery each of the next two years.
Lawmakers in Kansas and North Carolina also proposed using more general fund revenue for wildlife work, although those measures have not advanced.
 Mission

In other states, lawmakers are focused on expanding their wildlife agencies’ mission to more non-game species. Last year, Colorado gave wildlife managers the authority to manage insects and other invertebrates, as well as rare plants.
“Invertebrates are wildlife, and their conservation benefits the entire ecosystem, including the species [state wildlife officials] traditionally managed,” said Richard Reading, vice chair of the Colorado Parks and Wildlife Commission. “They do everything from creating our soils to filtering our water to pollinating the food we eat.”
Reading also serves as vice president of science and conservation at the Butterfly Pavilion, an insect zoo. He noted that studies are showing that many invertebrate species are in rapid decline. In addition to expanding the agency’s authority, lawmakers provided funding for six staff members to take on the additional work.
A similar bill in Nevada, focused on invertebrates, advanced through the Assembly’s natural resources committee.
“There’s definitely concerns about declines in pollinator species,” said Assemblymember Howard Watts, a Democrat who sponsored the bill. “Our wildlife agency can and should take proactive action to do research, surveys and habitat improvement to keep these species off the [endangered species list].”
Watts said the bill would allow wildlife managers to consider insects in state plans to protect imperiled species. He said the Nevada Department of Wildlife has requested an entomologist position if it’s asked to take on the additional species. Beyond that, he said, the measure would not require additional money, as it’s focused on voluntary, proactive work, rather than additional regulations.
Another bill in Pennsylvania would expand wildlife managers’ authority to include insects. That measure has been approved by the House Environmental and Natural Resources Protection Committee.
Sporting groups have largely been supportive of efforts to provide new funding sources to manage non-game species. But some are skeptical of plans to expand agencies’ mission without an increase in revenue.
“Most hunters and anglers understand that healthy game populations are dependent on ecosystem integrity,” said Devin O’Dea, Western policy and conservation manager with Backcountry Hunters & Anglers, a nonprofit focused on public lands. “But when you take a model that’s been developed with the intent of enforcing regulations for fish and game species, expand that scope without funding and additional capacity, it’s a recipe for something to fall off the plate.”
 Governance

Meanwhile, some legislators want to rethink the commission model that oversees wildlife governance. Critics say that governors often select commissioners who are hunting guides, farmers and political donors. Once appointed, they enact wildlife policies to suit their economic interests.
Florida state Rep. Anna V. Eskamani, a Democrat, drafted a bill that would overhaul the state’s Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission. Her proposal would increase the board from seven to nine members. It would designate seats for scientists, conservationists, local officials, farmers, hunters and anglers.
“The commission has made decisions not based on science or conservation, but based on developers or landowners that engage in agricultural practices,” she said. “We tried to strike a balance to ensure there are voices with an environmental background, with a conservation and wildlife background, with an academic background.”
The bill did not advance, but Eskamani said grassroots support is building for systemic changes in wildlife management.
Some sporting groups are more wary of commission overhaul proposals.
“We have seen examples where proposed changes to commissions were politically motivated or motivated by anti-hunting and anti-angling interests,” said Kent Keene senior manager for Western states and agriculture policy with the Congressional Sportsmen’s Foundation, a group that promotes hunting and fishing priorities on Capitol Hill. “When those changes are focused on science-based needs, then the sportsmen’s community has a long history of supporting those steps to ensure we are protecting our heritage.”
Some hunting and fishing groups have emphasized that the expanded mission should come with additional funding, so agencies aren’t stretched thin. Keene noted that hunters and anglers pay an excise tax on the purchase of gear, which provides an important funding source for wildlife agencies. Some have proposed a similar “backpack tax” on gear for hikers, birdwatchers and others.
Another proposal in New Hampshire would give the wildlife agency’s executive director the authority to make policy decisions, relegating the Fish and Game Commission to an advisory body. That bill did not advance.

Home to the state capitol and fueled by renewed focus and strategic investment in economic development, Richland County is setting the tone as a rising hub where innovation, opportunity, and community converge to shape a vibrant economic future.
To meet the moment, Richland County is proudly embracing this next chapter by celebrating the creation of the Columbia Area Development Partnership.
This is a public-private partnership between Richland County government and private industry, a vision first approved by County Council in 2024.
The partnership will work collaboratively to strengthen Richland County’s competitive edge and open doors for a new generation of workers, entrepreneurs, and residents.
Backed by a skilled workforce and access top-tier universities and four major interstates, plus offering close proximity to both the ports of Charleston and Savannah, Richland County is well-equipped to meet the demands of a rapidly evolving economy. Overall, it is this access that enhances Richland County’s appeal as a logistics and distribution hub.
We’ve seen this public-private partnership model succeed in the Greenville and Charleston areas — and now, it’s Richland County’s turn to evolve.
Through the partnership’s efforts, the county is well-positioned to meet the needs of today’s businesses while building a foundation for the next decade, drawing on the proven successes of our neighbors.
To aid this new vision, the Columbia Area Development Partnership board is a private nonprofit composed of esteemed, forward-thinking business leaders across a broad spectrum of industries, including manufacturing, healthcare, higher education, tech, and financial services.
This partnership will serve as a catalyst for attracting businesses to the area by providing them with the infrastructure, resources, and support they need to thrive.
We’ve had incredible success in the past several years in the Midlands.
BlueCross BlueShield, Scout Motors, Mark Anthony Brewing, Ritedose Corp., US Brick, and Schneider Electric, to name a few, have already chosen our region to launch and expand their businesses.
The groundwork is set, but we are only scratching the surface of what is possible.
Richland County is truly an incredible family-friendly community with a host of offerings — from workforce housing, outdoor adventure, collegiate sports, and a thriving arts and culture scene.
It is an ideal county to live and grow. The partnership will propel Richland County forward, helping to build a resilient, future-ready region.
With our moment upon us, we are excited to continue to drive economic growth and ensure a high quality of life, not only for our residents who love calling Richland County home but also for those looking to build a life here.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/columbia-skyline-scaled-e1747840034615-1024x626.jpg,,,2025-05-21 11:07:25.203958

The scope of the story is massive, affecting the constitutional rights to educational opportunities for North Carolina’s 1.5 million public school students. And the story is juicy, rife with mystery, lawlessness, and government corruption. 
The lack of coverage is strange. Newspaper readers are more likely to have read about efforts to ban cellphones from classrooms or to name “Raise Up” as the state’s official hip-hop song.
If you haven’t guessed yet, the big, strangely unmentionable issue is Leandro. Leandro is the 31-year-old lawsuit about the state’s unwillingness to provide our public school students with the “sound basic” education that they’re guaranteed under our state constitution. Despite students’ multiple victories in state courts, state leaders have yet to provide students with the quality schools and educational opportunities they are owed.
From January 1 to May 1, the word “Leandro” has shown up in just one news story that ran in the state’s two largest newspapers serving Raleigh and Charlotte. The term has failed to appear in any news stories from the major newspapers serving Greensboro, Winston-Salem, Fayetteville, Wilmington, or Asheville.
It’s difficult to imagine an issue in state politics that is having a bigger impact on North Carolinians. There are currently 1.5 million children in our public schools who are having their constitutional rights violated. Millions more have had their rights violated since the case was originally filed in 1994.
Every court that’s weighed in on this question from 1997 to 2022, regardless of ideological makeup, has agreed that students’ constitutional rights are being violated by the state. When the nation’s leading nonpartisan education researchers completed a years’ long study of North Carolina’s education system in 2019, they reached the same conclusion, noting also that the state has been moving backwards. 
The General Assembly’s strategy of pairing austerity budgets with unregulated, low-quality privatization schemes has been making things worse. Test scores have fallen, particularly for students of color and students from families with low incomes. Teacher vacancies are at record levels.
The courts have tried to fix things. In 2020, they ordered the state to develop a detailed plan for the state to provide students with the types of schools promised under our state constitution. In November 2021, a Superior Court judge ordered the state to fully implement the Leandro Comprehensive Remedial Plan – a research-based blueprint for achieving constitutional compliance by the 2028 school year. 
The Leandro Plan makes several important steps to dramatically improve schools, including:

Expanding NC Pre-K so more students from families with lower incomes can enter kindergarten ready to succeed,
Investing in teacher training programs and improving teacher pay, training, and mentorships to address our record-high teacher vacancies,
Staffing nurses, psychologists, counselors, and social workers at recommended levels to manage students’ physical and mental health needs, and
Dramatically increasing supports for disadvantaged students, students with disabilities, and English language learners.

The Supreme Court reaffirmed the state’s responsibility to fully fund the eight-year Plan in November 2022.
That is where the story became particularly interesting.
First, the mystery. Why did a Roy Cooper appointee try to kill Leandro? Per the Supreme Court’s November 2022 court order, State Controller Nels Roseland was supposed to transfer money from state coffers to the schools for the first years of the Plan. He refused, citing “unresolved” legal issues. The Supreme Court cited Roseland’s motion in halting the transfer of funding and for re-hearing the case in February 2024.
There’s a juicy story in there for an enterprising investigative journalist. Until Roseland’s appointment, Governor Cooper had seemingly been a staunch advocate for Leandro. His staff created the Leandro Plan. Each of his budgets recommended full funding of the Plan. Yet his nominee for State Controller fought against the Plan. Roseland’s opposition was known prior to his nomination, having publicly indicated that he opposed Leandro and wouldn’t transfer the funding owed to students. It remains a mystery why Cooper didn’t pull Roseland’s nomination or remove him from office for his actions harming students.
While the Supreme Court halted the transfer of funds for years 1-3 of the Plan in early 2023, its order still requires the state to fund the Leandro Plan going forward. Rather than following the law and implementing the Leandro Plan, legislative leaders have simply ignored the court order. They don’t dispute that students’ rights are being violated. Nor have they put together an alternative plan to improve schools. They’ve simply said, “you can’t make us.” One would think that such wanton lawlessness would be a frequent subject of reporting from the capitol.
If that’s not juicy enough, there’s also blatant corruption. That corruption has taken two forms.
First, in early 2023, Senator Phil Berger and former Speaker of the House Tim Moore appealed to get the case back in front of the Supreme Court. Why did they want to do that? Well, that court now has a 5-2 Republican majority. One of those five justices is Senator Phil Berger’s son, Phil Berger, Jr. 
Junior, along with four of his hyper-partisan colleagues agreed to rehear the Leandro case mere months after the November 2022 ruling. In agreeing to rehear the case just months after a decision, the high court ignored foundational legal concepts such as respect for precedent and the rule of law. The facts of the case hadn’t changed. Only the partisan makeup of the court had changed, allowing Junior a second chance to rule on whether Daddy can continue to ignore students’ constitutional rights. This collusive, nepotistic relationship between the judicial and legislative branches has removed a foundational element of our system of checks and balances
The second form of corruption lies in how legislative leaders have spent the money that is supposed to be supporting public school students. They’re spending over $920 million this year for vouchers that mostly subsidize wealthy families who have their kids in private schools. They’ve also passed a series of tax cuts disproportionately benefiting corporations and wealthy North Carolinians. It’s no coincidence that these corporate and wealthy beneficiaries happen to be the same people who fund reelection campaigns. School children, alas, do not.
Given the above, it remains baffling why the press continues to ignore Leandro. The Leandro Plan would have a far greater impact on student achievement than any of the “big” issues being discussed this session such as cell phone bans or school calendar flexibility (which, incidentally, is part of the Leandro Plan, and was supposed to have been passed in 2021). The failure to fund the Plan is undoubtedly suppressing student achievement, particularly for historically underserved populations.
Meanwhile the lawlessness and corruption mirror what we’re seeing at the federal level from the Trump administration. It’s a major deal that General Assembly leadership believes they can simply ignore the parts of the state constitution that they don’t agree with or find inconvenient. That puts all of our basic rights as North Carolinians at risk. It’s also a big deal that the Supreme Court is likely to tarnish its legitimacy and credibility to rubber stamp the legislature’s absurd position. The decision from the re-heard case is expected any day now.
If you’re a journalist, please let me know, why aren’t you covering this issue? Is it not a big deal that 1.5 million children are having their basic rights violated? Is it not a major scandal that the General Assembly has been openly violating a court order for the past 1,283 days? Are we not in the midst of a constitutional crisis when legislators argue that they can simply ignore the parts of the constitution they disagree with?
If the answer to any of those questions is “yes” then I implore you to start centering Leandro in your reporting.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/News-300x218-1.jpeg,,,2025-05-21 11:07:25.203958

The post State board approves lottery admissions for vocational high schools  appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.","IN THE END, no one seems entirely happy with the outcome, and in the messy give and take of democratic decision-making that’s often hailed as a sign that the system is working.  Eight years after a contentious debate over admission policies governing the state’s vocational-technical high schools first kicked into gear, it ended on Tuesday with an 8-2 vote of the state Board of Elementary and Secondary Education to have seats at the schools awarded through a lottery system.  Vocational high schools have become increasingly popular choices, but that has put a spotlight on their competitive admissions process. With demand far outstripping supply, more than 40 percent of the roughly 20,000 eighth grade students who applied to a vocational high school in 2023 were turned down under a system that lets schools rank applicants by middle school grades, attendance records, and discipline history. Tuesday’s vote to switch to a lottery system came after years of complaint from civil rights and education advocates that the use of selective criteria was disproportionately denying seats to low-income students, students of color, English language learners, and students with special needs.  State admissions data show those students, on average, receive offers of admission at lower rates than their peers. Critics argued that by locking out students who struggled with traditional academics in middle school or had poor attendance or discipline records, the entry standards were denying vocational seats to some of the very students who might benefit most from the hands-on learning at vocational schools.  The changes approved by the education board will replace the current ranking system with a lottery that gives extra weight to students with better attendance records, no history of major disciplinary infractions, and a strong demonstration of interest in attending a vocational high school.  Education Secretary Patrick Tutwiler, who led the push for the changes on the board, said they reflect “a set of core values” centered on “the belief that every student deserves a fair shot at exploring their passions and building a future that they’re excited about.”  Board member Ericka Fisher, who voted for the changes, said she would have preferred a “blind” lottery in which all students have an equal chance at a seat. “I feel strongly that this proposal doesn’t go far enough,” she said. “I’d prefer an unweighted lottery. However, that being said, this is great progress.”  Another board member who also supported the change, Marty West, said “it is not exactly where I would have landed on my own, and probably from a different side than member Fisher.”  West suggested such differences, and the criticism the proposal received in public comments submitted from those on both sides of the debate, are to be expected when the proposed resolution to an issue involves a compromise.  While several board members suggested the change was a positive –, if imperfect –, reform, leaders and staff at the state’s vocational schools slammed the move as a misguided effort that will set back schools that have been acclaimed nationally for their success in combining high-quality academic study with vocational instruction.  Steve Sharek, executive director of the Massachusetts Association of Vocational Administrators, voiced disappointment in the board vote and said, in a statement, that it was a mistake to “diminish the role of merit and student effort in the admissions process.”  Scott Keeler, an instructor at Nashoba Valley Technical High School in Westford, testifying at the meeting prior to the board vote, decried the fact the proposal would give students who had missed weeks of school the same chance at a seat as students with perfect attendance. Meanwhile, he said, eliminating middle school grades as an entry factor “tells students they do not need to try, and as a teacher and as a parent this is deeply concerning.” While the vote marked the end of a drawn-out review of vocational school admission policies by the education board, it may not be the last word on the issue.  The House version of the 2026 state budget includes a provision halting changes to vocational admission policies and establishing a new task force to review the issue. A similar amendment has been filed to the Senate budget, which is being debated this week. If it’s not adopted, the issue will still be among those that House and Senate leaders will have to hash out in a conference committee that will be charged with resolving differences in their spending plans.  Gov. Maura Healey seems likely to veto any effort to upend the changes her administration has backed, so the bar is set high to reverse the changes to vocational admissions that the state education board finally agreed to nearly a decade after the debate began.  The post State board approves lottery admissions for vocational high schools  appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/SERSD-e1606928390644.jpg?fit=768%2C1024&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-05-21 11:07:25.203958

(Michael Loccisano/Getty Images)As another school year ends, superintendents across the United States are staring down an autumn staffing crisis, with 1 in 8 teaching positions either vacant or filled by an underqualified educator.
States that are struggling with post-pandemic teacher shortages have spent millions to lure replacements and retain veterans with hiring bonuses and bumps in salaries. But hiring gaps remain, so some states also are trying another tactic: changing their standards.
The changes in teacher training and licensing come amid widespread turmoil in public schools: Tax revenue is being siphoned toward private school vouchers in many states; some classrooms are being scrutinized for banned books, displays or teaching lessons that trip into diversity, equity and inclusion territory; and students who went through pandemic-era shutdowns are struggling both with sitting still and with learning the material.
Some surveys show that fewer than a fifth of teachers are happy in their jobs.
“Teaching is not seen as an attractive profession right now,” said Drew Gitomer, an expert on teaching assessment at Rutgers Graduate School of Education.
“COVID exacerbated things, and teachers are caught in the middle of political battles — over curriculum, book bans, even personal attacks,” he said. “It’s not a healthy work environment, and that drives people away.”










Teaching is not seen as an attractive profession right now.


– Drew Gitomer, Rutgers Graduate School of Education


Last year, Illinois enacted a law allowing teacher candidates to begin student teaching before passing content-area exams. It was an effort to reduce barriers for underrepresented groups, the measure’s sponsor said.
A bill under consideration this year would give more districts discretion over whether to factor pupils’ test scores into teacher evaluations, a break from a 15-year-old mandate.
In New Jersey, a new law formally removes the Praxis Core exam — traditionally used as an entry-level screening tool for aspiring teachers — from certification requirements.
And in Nevada — one of the states hit hardest by teacher shortages — a bill would streamline licensure for incoming educators. The bill would allow teachers credentialed in other states to begin working in Nevada classrooms while awaiting formal approval.
It also would remove extra steps for teachers switching grade levels and would waive application fees for recent substitute teachers.
Linda Darling-Hammond, founding president and chief knowledge officer of the Learning Policy Institute, a nonpartisan think tank, said teacher shortages hit hardest in schools serving low-income students and students of color, where instability often leads to larger class sizes, canceled courses or a revolving door of substitute teachers.
“When you walk into a school facing shortages, you see instability,” she said. “Students may be taught by people who don’t know what to do, who leave quickly, and who often rely more on discipline than engagement.”
The root cause? Teacher attrition.

“Nine out of 10 vacancies every year are because of attrition — and two-thirds of that is not retirement,” Darling-Hammond said. “Support in the beginning matters. Teachers who come in and get a mentor stay longer. If you’re just thrown in to sink or swim, the odds of leaving are much greater.”
States have long struggled to attract teachers, and credentialing changes aren’t unusual. But some education advocates fear long-term repercussions.
Melissa Tooley, director of K-12 educator quality at the left-leaning think tank New America, said most states now offer alternative and fast-track teacher certification pathways, many of which allow candidates to start teaching with little or no pedagogical training in how to teach.
“We’re churning through people who might have potential, but we’re not setting them up for success,” she said. “A lot of what states are doing is short term. It’s about filling seats, not necessarily building a sustainable or high-quality workforce.”
More than 40 states require aspiring teachers to take the costly Praxis Subject test for the subject they want to teach, which some experts argue excludes strong candidates and duplicates other assessments.
“You were excluding people who might be good teachers but didn’t do well on that specific test,” said Rutgers’ Gitomer, who has researched the test’s effects on recruitment.
However, he added, dropping tests doesn’t necessarily help.
Several states — Georgia, New Jersey, New York, Washington and Wisconsin — have dropped a licensure requirement known as edTPA since 2022, but there’s little evidence the move has helped ease teacher shortages, Gitomer said. (The acronym stands for Educative Teacher Performance Assessment and involves a portfolio that includes testing and videos of classroom performance.)

“The state eliminated edTPA but didn’t replace it with a specific alternative,” he said.
“Instead, it gave full discretion back to individual institutions to develop or adopt their own performance assessments,” he said. “When we talked to institutions, it became pretty clear they didn’t think removing edTPA would be a major driver in addressing the shortage — and they haven’t seen evidence that it has been.”
How best to credential
Tooley said state credentialing systems must navigate a delicate balance: ensuring there are enough teachers, maintaining instructional quality and increasing workforce diversity.
“There’s this triangle — three pieces that need to be in place — and I think there are real tensions when it comes to how states are designing their certification policies,” she said.
And Gitomer described a fragmented national landscape, where some states are tightening teacher entry standards while others are dramatically loosening them — even allowing non-degreed individuals to teach.
“Some states are trying to raise standards; others are relaxing them to the point where you may not even need a college degree,” he said.
Indiana now requires all pre-K through grade 6 and special education teachers to complete 80 hours of training on the “science of reading,” a method that includes phonics, and pass an exam by 2027. State Sen. Jean Leising, a Republican, has proposed cutting the requirement in half, calling it “an excessive burden with little actual benefit” in a news release.
In Texas, a bill aims to reduce the use of uncertified teachers by the 2029-30 school year. The legislation would set a gradual cap on the percentage of uncertified teachers districts can employ in core curriculum classes — starting at 20% in 2026-27 and decreasing to 5% in 2029-30.
According to the Texas Education Agency, 31% of new hires in 2024-25 lacked a state teaching certificate or permit.
Yet some states stand out for how they’re changing their requirements, Tooley said.
She pointed to Washington, which has designed a recruitment strategy encouraging paraprofessionals, often known as teacher’s aides, to become classroom teachers. Also known as paraeducators, they’re a group with classroom experience, community ties and higher retention likelihood.
There, school districts are required to offer foundational training — ranging from 14 to 28 hours — directly to paraeducators.

In West Virginia, a new law now allows districts to count full-time behavior interventionists working in one or two classrooms toward meeting the required number of aides or paraprofessionals in K-3 classrooms.
Tooley noted that Pennsylvania and Alabama are experimenting with “menu-style” licensing flexibility — allowing candidates to demonstrate qualification through various combinations of GPA and test scores, rather than rigid cutoffs.
“These are people already in schools, often from the same cultural or linguistic backgrounds as students,” Tooley said. “They’re more likely to succeed and to stay.”
Low pay
A 2024 national survey by the EdWeek Research Center found that public school teachers are increasingly reporting declines in mental health, job satisfaction and classroom stability. Seventy percent of teachers recommended student mental health interventions, and nearly half said schools lack enough counselors, psychologists and social workers.
As mental well-being has worsened, the share of public school teachers who are very satisfied with their jobs has also declined by 2 percentage points from the previous year, to 18%, according to the survey, which was conducted by the EdWeek Research Center on behalf of Merrimack College.
While teacher wellness supports remain limited, educators say improvements in pay and student discipline are the most needed changes.
To entice passionate but burned out educators from leaving the workforce, several states have raised minimum teacher pay. Arkansas boosted salaries to $50,000 statewide, and South Carolina raised starting pay to $47,000. South Dakota enacted a $45,000 minimum with yearly increases, and penalties for districts that fail to comply by 2026. Connecticut advanced a bill setting a $63,450 salary floor, while Indiana and others are eyeing further increases.
At the federal level, the proposed American Teacher Act seeks to establish a national $60,000 minimum salary for teachers at a qualifying school to boost recruitment and retention across the country. The bill, sponsored by U.S. Rep. Frederica Wilson, a Florida Democrat, remains in committee.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-05-21 14:57:19+00:00,CT Mirror,The EPA is rolling back drinking water limits for 4 PFAS. Thousands more remain unregulated.,Joseph Winters | Grist,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/05/21/epa-pfas-drinking-water-limits/,"Environmental groups decried plans from the EPA to rescind and 'reconsider' drinking water limits for four PFAS, compounds linked to cancer.","This story was originally published by Grist. Sign up for Grist’s weekly newsletter here.

Last week, environmental groups decried plans from the Environmental Protection Agency to rescind and “reconsider” drinking water limits for four per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, or PFAS, compounds linked to cancer and damage to the immune and endocrine systems, among other health effects. 
The limits had been finalized by Joe Biden’s administration last April as part of an effort to limit people’s exposure to hazardous “forever chemicals.” Out of a total of more than 10,000 known PFAS, they targeted just six of the most concerning ones. The Trump administration’s EPA said it would retain the limits for two of the PFAS but give utilities more time to comply with them and scrap the others. One advocate called the EPA’s move a loss for public health and a “victory for chemical companies.” 
But how protective were the Biden regulations to begin with? And how much of a difference will it make to pare them back?
On the one hand, experts agree that backtracking is not in the public’s interest. Virtually everyone has PFAS coursing through their veins, and specific kinds like PFOS and PFOA are known or likely to contribute to kidney and testicular cancers. The other compounds originally regulated by the Biden administration have been linked to elevated cholesterol, heart disease, and an increased risk of diabetes.
The chemicals have become so ubiquitous in people and the environment because of their use in everything from outdoor clothing to cooking utensils and food packaging. Runoff from firefighting foam, infused with the chemicals, has contributed to widespread drinking water contamination, along with manufacturers’ deliberate dumping of the chemicals into rivers — despite knowing about their health risks. 
Once they’re created, PFAS don’t break down naturally; hence the moniker “forever chemicals.” Regulating them is an “important win,” experts have said, one that “allows the country to begin cleaning up the mess in its water.” 
But the fight over drinking water limits for individual PFAS distracts from the larger context that there are thousands of types, and scientists suspect they all have similar health effects. Even last year, when the Biden administration first announced its national drinking water standards, scientists criticized it for addressing PFAS on a chemical-by-chemical basis. “The EPA is trying to regulate six forever chemicals. Just 10,000 to go,” as the title of an op-ed by one Harvard researcher put it.
Erik Olson, a senior strategist for the nonprofit Natural Resources Defense Council, said the U.S. is “stuck in a Whac-a-Mole game” with PFAS, in which only the best researched compounds are regulated. Lesser-known compounds may be just as toxic — thanks to their similar chemical structures — but escape regulations just because they haven’t been studied, he added. “What we need to do is control PFAS as a class.”
Of the six forever chemicals targeted by the Biden administration’s original policy, PFOA and PFOS are the most prevalent and, consequently, they’ve been researched the most extensively. Those compounds got the strictest drinking water limits of 4 parts per trillion, the lowest level at which they can be detected, reflecting scientists’ understanding that there is no safe exposure level for them. Three additional compounds — PFNA, PFHxS, and GenX — were given a contamination limit of 10 parts per trillion. Water utilities were instructed to use a “hazard index” to monitor a sixth chemical, called PFBS, as well as mixtures of the chemicals.
The Trump EPA said it would keep the PFOA and PFOS drinking water limits but give utilities until 2031 to comply with them, instead of 2029. The rules for the other four compounds will be scrapped and reevaluated. The EPA said it intends to finalize its replacement regulations by next spring.
A statement from EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin said the extended timeline for PFOA and PFOS would provide “common-sense flexibility” to utilities, some of which sued the EPA over its regulations last year. The utilities said the EPA’s new rule was too strict and would cause unreasonable compliance costs. 
A spokesperson for the EPA told Grist that the process by which the agency had “promulgated the preliminary regulatory determinations simultaneously with the proposed regulation” for PFNA, PFHxS, GenX, and PFBS under the Biden administration “was inappropriate and may not comply with the statutory requirements of [the] Safe Drinking Water Act.” With regard to the rescissions, they said that “while EPA cannot predetermine the outcome, it is possible” that the agency will issue more stringent requirements this spring.
Daniel Jones, an emeritus professor of molecular biology at Michigan State University, said the impacts of the Trump administration’s reversal will depend on geography. Communities primarily affected by PFOS and PFOA may not be greatly affected, since the standards for those chemicals remain in place — albeit with an extended timeline for compliance. To meet the standards, water utilities will likely have to install something like an activated carbon filtration system, he said, which is effective at removing “long-chain” PFAS like PFOA and PFOS, which have a larger chemical structure than compounds like GenX.
Putting these filtration systems into place will thankfully sweep up more PFAS than just PFOA and PFOS, Jones said.
States like North Carolina, Ohio, and West Virginia, however, face disproportionate contamination from GenX due to production facilities concentrated there. This contamination could continue unabated if the standard for the compound is eliminated. According to Olson, some of the technologies that remove PFOS and PFOA are not as effective at attracting GenX. “To really control the full suite of PFAS, we need to go to more advanced technologies like tight membranes, like reverse osmosis,” he said.
Some water utilities may opt for these more advanced — and expensive — technologies if they believe that they will eventually be required to test for and limit a much larger number of PFAS, Olson added.
Although Jones is disappointed that the EPA intends to drop regulations for the four PFAS, he said he is more concerned about a single clause in the EPA’s press release, about the EPA’s intent to establish a “federal exemption framework” for the PFOS and PFOA limits. The release contains no further information about what this would entail, but Jones worries it could allow water utilities to circumvent the federal government’s water quality requirements altogether. “It seems that an exemption framework is likely to open the door to say, ‘This is going to cost too much, you don’t have to do it,’” he said.
The EPA spokesperson said exemptions would not allow utilities to violate regulations: “Rather, they allow additional time to find a compliance solution.”
Jones also raised concerns about funding for further PFAS research, including investigations on how exposure to mixtures of the chemicals may impact human health. One of his federal grants for PFAS research was recently cut by the Trump administration, he said, and a colleague at Michigan State University studying PFAS on farms has also had his funding rescinded.
In addition to regulating PFAS by groups or as a class, Jones said the EPA should set pollution standards using what’s known as the “precautionary principle,” which doesn’t require definitive evidence about a chemical’s harms before it can be regulated. “In some countries, if you want to release a chemical into the environment you have to show it’s safe,” he said. “The U.S. usually takes the opposite approach and says, ‘You can use these chemicals … and if we find that there’s a problem, then we’ll come up and regulate [them].’”
Olson believes the EPA’s alterations to the PFAS rules are in violation of the Safe Drinking Water Act’s “anti-backsliding provision,” which says any revision the EPA proposes to a drinking water standard must be at least as protective of public health as the previous one. The law also caps compliance timelines at five years, whereas postponing the PFOS and PFOA compliance deadline to 2031 would give water utilities seven years. 
“Ultimately, we need to be phasing these chemicals out,” Olson added. “We have to turn off the spigot and stop using these things so that five generations from now, our great-great-great grandchildren won’t be dealing with them.”

The Senate Ways and Means Committee proposed an underlying budget that started at $61.32 billion, as Democrats forge ahead with their spending appetite despite modest state tax revenues and federal funding uncertainty.
The post Senators get “enough yeses” to add $43.5 mil to budget appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.","SENATORS PLOWED through more than half of their 1,000+ budget amendments during their first full day of deliberations Tuesday and recessed just before 8 p.m.The additions tacked on roughly $43.5 million onto the budget’s bottom line, according to Senate President Karen Spilka’s spokesperson Gray Milkowski. The Senate Ways and Means Committee proposed an underlying budget that started at $61.32 billion, as Democrats forge ahead with their spending appetite despite modest state tax revenues and federal funding uncertainty.The branch tackled 671 amendments Tuesday, adopting 301 proposals while rejecting 208 others, Spilka’s office said. Successful amendments included ones directing the Department of Public Health to create a task force focused on the continuity of abortion and abortion-related care in “the event of a loss of federal funding,” $150,000 for the Reproductive Equity Now Foundation to operate its free abortion legal hotline, and $220,000 for new perinatal mental health support programs for new parents, the office said in its end-of-day recap.Senators will resume deliberations Wednesday, with a new bundle of amendments available for review at 9 a.m. to address the remaining four budget categories, Majority Leader Cindy Creem said from the rostrum. Those topics include transportation, judiciary, public safety and local matters. Debate is planned to resume at 10 a.m.When senators recessed for their dinner break just after 5:30 p.m., Sen. Will Brownsberger told his colleagues they were at “mile 13” of budget deliberations. Leaning into his Boston Marathon reference, the Belmont Democrat said they had made it to the Scream Tunnel in Wellesley.The Senate had handled 530 out of 1,058 amendments before dinner, budget chief Sen. Michael Rodrigues told the News Service around 6:20 p.m.“So, it’s going very smoothly,” Rodrigues said. “Of course we can’t say yes to everything, but we say enough yeses that members are happy, and we’re accomplishing some great things.”Senators installed some guardrails around Department of Mental Health case managers without directly protecting endangered jobs. Gov. Maura Healey wants to slash that workforce in half to save money, and DMH is also eyeing a more flexible, open-access care model in which case managers are no longer paired up with specific clients.Under Sen. Cindy Friedman’s successful budget amendment (#536), DMH must submit monthly reports to the Legislature on the number of active and inactive client cases; the active and inactive caseload among workers; the number of case manager positions that are filled, vacant or on extended-leave status; target caseloads and encounters to meet client needs; the waitlist for case management services; and the number of applications that are accepted or denied for services, among other information. DMH must also notify the Legislature 90 days before changing its care delivery model and submit a “report and a catalogue of best practices for publicly-operated case management services.”Friedman, co-chair of the Joint Committee on Health Care Financing, told the News Service her amendment would not block the 170 case managers from being laid off.“Look, if they’re going to cut case managers, they’re going to cut,” Friedman said. “There’s not a whole lot — I mean, we could pass an amendment, but I think the Senate feels that there’s a labor dispute going on. But I’m much more focused on what they’re doing, and what they’re trying to do, and why they’re cutting caseworkers.”She called DMH’s open-access care model “absurd.”“The people that are DMH clients are the people who are the most vulnerable and have the most serious needs. It’s very hard to become a DMH client — they don’t make it easy,” Friedman continued. “So if you’re in that cohort of people, you are there because there is a crisis. And if you help people by giving crisis management and then you take it away, they’re going to go back to being in crisis.”Ahead of the debate, Sen. John Keenan withdrew his budget amendment (#433) that would have prevented DMH from reducing the workforce “below fiscal year 2025 case manager staffing levels.” The House had adopted that language in a consolidated budget amendment.“It was clear that there wasn’t enough support for that,” Keenan told the News Service. “So what we heard was that Sen. Friedman’s amendment would most likely pass.”The Senate Ways and Means Committee budget already allocated money to maintain operations at two health care facilities that Healey initially proposed closing: Pappas Rehabilitation Hospital for Children in Canton and Pocasset Mental Health Center on Cape Cod. But senators more explicitly pledged state funding support Tuesday, as they unanimously voted for a Sen. Dylan Fernandes amendment (#543) to dedicate $31 million to Pappas and $4.8 million to Pocasset.Rodrigues said the amendment will not increase the budget’s bottom line, though the language clarifies the funding levels for the facilities in the budget.“We have really dire need for mental health resources,” Fernandes of Falmouth said on the Senate floor. “The Cape and Islands has one of the highest suicide rates in the commonwealth, 50 percent higher than the state average. In Plymouth County, we continue to see incidents of suicide above the state average, and people struggling with substance misuse disorder.”Working groups are also navigating the future of Pappas and Pocasset. Fernandes said stakeholders may evaluate how to handle the partial hospital program — which functioned similar to an outpatient program — that the state closed at Pocasset last year.“Does that mean expanding services? Around a third to a half of the Pocasset site was closed,” Fernandes told the News Service. “Does that mean that we can expand services there that have higher reimbursements to help sustain this facility in the long-term? What does it mean for interconnection with Cape Cod Hospital and other inpatient beds in the region?”Through a series of amendment bundles Tuesday, the Senate also added:$50,000 for the Massachusetts Coalition to Prevent Gun Violence for “comprehensive educational programming”;
$250,000 for the Brookline Community Mental Health Center;
$300,000 for the International Institute of New England for “culturally and linguistically appropriate mental health services”;
An infectious disease elevated risk community outreach pilot program at the Department of Public Health for schools or early education programs that have not reached herd immunity against one or more “vaccine-preventable infectious diseases”;
$330,000 for a pilot program at Community Services to provide “medically-tailored” meals for veterans;
$25,000 for North Suffolk Community Services to coordinate and implement eviction sealing outreach;
$150,000 for a Greater New Bedford Community Health Center program to treat patients with “co-occurring mental health disorders by a nurse practitioner”;
$75,000 for Labouré College of Healthcare in Milton for an advanced Vocational Nursing English for Speakers of Other Languages program to boost the nursing pipeline;
$150,000 for the Southcoast Health New Beginnings Moms Do Care Program in New Bedford, which supports mothers and infants affected by perinatal substance exposure;
$75,000 to OpenCape Corporation to support “high-speed internet access” in Plymouth and Falmouth;

Glenn Youngkin speaks with reporters in Richmond on May 2, 2025. (Photo By Charlotte Rene Woods/Virginia Mercury)Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin signed onto a joint letter with other Republican governors in support of a “big beautiful bill” backed by President Donald Trump that is currently advancing through Congress and would cut $625 billion from Medicaid over the next decade if passed. 
The federal program helps states provide health care coverage to low-income people and those with disabilities. Democratic lawmakers, advocacy groups, Medicaid beneficiaries and some Republicans have cautioned against the proposal for months. 
“As Republican governors we stand UNITED in strong support of your One, Big, Beautiful Bill,” they wrote to Trump on May 20, with capitalization for emphasis. “This landmark piece of legislation embodies your powerful vision to bring about the next great American revival. It truly delivers on the bold promises all Republicans made to the American people to restore the security, prosperity and fiscal sanity for our nation.”
With billions in cuts to Medicaid, food assistance, education and clean energy programs funding potentially on the chopping block, the huge bill aims to bolster funding for border security efforts and military spending and support tax cuts elsewhere. 
While political opponents of Trump have lambasted his proposal for its tax cuts for the country’s highest earners, Youngkin and other governors in their letter state that “we cannot miss this chance to save taxpayers $1.6 trillion over the next ten years.”
They stressed in their letter how the overall package can “give working class families tax cuts worth thousands of dollars each.”
Those cuts could be achieved by expanding the standard deduction and the fulfillment of Trump’s campaign goals to eliminate taxes on tips or overtime pay for hourly and tipped workers. 
While eliminating taxes on tips has been hailed as a clear win for workers, the policy’s broader impact remains uncertain. Economists have raised concerns that employers would exploit the measure by shifting more of workers’ compensation to tips than wages. Late last year Youngkin announced plans to mirror Trump’s proposal in the state budget, but it didn’t prevail.
McClellan, Virginia Democrats warn of dire impact to state if proposed Medicaid cuts materialize

U.S. Rep. Jennifer McClellan, D-Richmond, has been a staunch critic of the cuts to Medicaid. She warned in a press call last week, after the proposal advanced through a committee she serves on, that “when you kick people off of their health insurance, that raises the cost for everybody else.”
She’d noted how uninsured people are more likely to avoid regular doctor appointments for checkups or to treat chronic conditions — resulting in emergency room visits when dire situations arise. As emergency rooms are federally-required to treat all patients, care for uninsured patients who cannot pay can become a shared financial burden on taxpayers.
Shortly after Youngkin’s joint letter was published, Democratic gubernatorial candidate Abigail Spanberger weighed in on social media Tuesday night. In a post to X, she emphasized that thousands of Virginians “will lose their healthcare because of this bill.”
“Virginians deserve a Governor who will stand up for their access to affordable healthcare,” she wrote. 
A spokesperson for Republican governor nominee and current lieutenant governor Winsome Earle-Sears declined the Mercury’s request to weigh in on the letter. 
Either Spanberger or Earle-Sears will become governor and each woman could play a role in shaping Virignia’s future state budget, which would likely need to address federal funding cuts to Medicaid if the bill succeeds this year.

Ainsworth, who is term-limited in his current office, said he would campaign for GOP candidates next year. 
“I will be on the campaign trail working alongside President Trump to help elect a strong, conservative governor and other Republican elected officials who will keep Alabama moving in the right direction,” he wrote. 
Though the lieutenant governor’s office is relatively powerless, Ainsworth had managed to raise large sums of money over the years from the Big Mules on Goat Hill, taking in $4.8 million between 2017 and today. 
According to campaign finance records, Progress PAC, the fundraising arm of the Business Council of Alabama, gave Ainsworth over $170,000 from 2017 to 2022. Alabama Forestry PAC gave Ainsworth just over $186,000 during that time; Alabama Power’s Employee PAC had given him $152,000. The Alabama Builders Association gave him $150,000.
Ainsworth had $1.3 million in his campaign account at the end of January, according to campaign finance records.
Ainsworth, 44, was first elected as lieutenant governor in 2018 after serving in the Alabama House of Representatives and re-elected in 2022. His term is set to end on Jan. 18, 2027. The Guntersville resident served one term in the Alabama House before becoming lieutenant governor.
Gov. Kay Ivey, who has served in the office since 2017, is term-limited.

The state sees lower use each time it increases tobacco taxes. (Alvaro Medina Jurado/Getty Images)There’s no debate that significant price increases on tobacco products reduce smoking among adults and children.
A 2014 report by the Office of the Surgeon General called raising prices on cigarettes “one of the most effective tobacco control interventions” — especially among kids. Every 10% increase in the price of cigarettes reduces consumption by about 4% among adults and about 7% among youth, according to the American Lung Association.
But Nebraska hasn’t raised our cigarette tax since 2002, and this failure to act is costing Nebraska lives. At 64 cents per pack, Nebraska’s tobacco tax remains one of the lowest in the nation. We’re well behind peer states like Iowa, Kansas, South Dakota and Colorado and far behind the national average of $1.97 per pack. When considering inflation, Nebraska’s tobacco tax has actually decreased.
This is concerning because data show fewer adult tobacco users are seriously considering quitting, according to the 2023 Nebraska Adult Tobacco Survey. One of the key findings of the 2020 Smoking Cessation: A Report of the Surgeon General was that adult smoking cessation can be increased by raising the price of cigarettes.
While overall youth tobacco use in Nebraska has continued to decline, according to results of the 2023 Nebraska Youth Tobacco Survey, we at the Metro Omaha Tobacco Action Coalition (MOTAC) know that vapes and nicotine pouches in particular are designed to appeal to young people. Nebraska must remain vigilant to continue our momentum.
Tobacco’s impact on the health and well-being of Nebraskans is dire. In Nebraska, an estimated 2,500 people die prematurely as a result of tobacco use each year, resulting in an average loss of 10 years off their lives, according to the Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services. At least 75,000 Nebraskans are suffering from at least one serious smoking-related illness.
Even people who do not use tobacco experience health effects. Secondhand smoke, which contains more than 7,000 chemicals and chemical compounds, is a proven cause of lung cancer, heart disease, serious respiratory illnesses such as bronchitis and asthma, low birth weight and sudden infant death syndrome. The U.S. Surgeon General has found that secondhand smoke is responsible for tens of thousands of U.S. deaths each year.
These health consequences extend to young Nebraskans, too. E-cigarettes, the most commonly used tobacco product among Nebraska middle and high school students, contain a high amount of nicotine, which is highly addictive. Nicotine harms the parts of an adolescent’s brain that control attention, learning, mood and impulse control, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Aerosol from e-cigarettes can also contain harmful, potentially cancer-causing chemicals and tiny particles that can be inhaled deep into lungs.
These health effects cost Nebraska taxpayers. Every year, Nebraska spends $900 in taxes per household for smoking-related costs, such as health care and loss of productivity. Smoking-related health care costs about $924 million in Nebraska each year.
Thus, significant increases in tobacco taxes not only save lives — they can help address Nebraska’s persistent property tax crisis, bringing in tens of millions in dollars in the coming years. Tobacco tax increases are a reliable, predictable source of substantial new revenue. And for current tobacco users who are impacted by increased taxes, it is imperative that the state continue the current state funding level to help Nebraskans quit and keep young people from starting.
Current proposals in the Nebraska Legislature to increase taxes on cigarettes, vapes and cigars are a clear win-win for public health and the public pocketbook. Raising the tax on a pack of cigarettes by $1 is projected to result in a 7.5% decrease in youth smoking. About 4,000 adults would quit smoking, and roughly 1,300 premature smoking-caused deaths would be prevented. Nebraska should keep taking proactive steps to prevent tobacco use, save lives and protect the health of our communities.

However, the end of the program does not mean the city’s pipes are lead free, and with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s Monday decision lifting the emergency order placed on the city’s drinking water, Pastor Allen Overton of Concerned Pastors for Social Action said the hosts were conscious of how they used the word celebrate. 
“We’re here today to celebrate a huge milestone in the case that we brought back in 2016 against the city of Flint and the state of Michigan officials. After more than eight years, the court ordered lead pipe replacement program has been completed, with nearly 11,000 lead pipes removed. That should be the point,” Overton said.

While this milestone is not all of the justice the community deserves, it is a huge achievement, he said. 
“This community has been through so much. We were misled by our leaders. We had to take matters into our own hands by collecting water samples, educating ourselves about lead contamination and ultimately suing to force the government to fix the problem that they created. Thanks to the persistence of the people of Flint and our partners, the Natural Resource Defense Council and the ACLU, we are finally at the end of this project,” Overton said. 
In April of 2014, the City of Flint switched its water source from Detroit-supplied Lake Huron water to the Flint River but failed to properly treat the water with corrosion control, corroding the pipes and leaching lead into the city’s water. Failure to treat the water with proper levels of chlorine also led to outbreaks of Legionnaires’ Disease, killing 12 and sickening at least 87 people between June 2014 and October 2015. 
In March 2016, Flint resident Melissa Mays, alongside the NRDC, the ACLU of Michigan, the NRDC and Concerned Pastors for Social Action filed a suit in federal court to compel the city and the state to comply with federal testing and treatment requirements for lead and to replace all lead pipes within the city. That November, federal judge David M. Lawson ordered city and state officials to provide residents with either a faucet filter or regular door-to-door deliveries of bottled water. 
In March 2017, residents secured a settlement agreement with Flint and the state of Michigan, promising to replace all lead lines within the city. While the initial deadline for replacing the lines was set for early 2020, residents repeatedly found themselves back in court, with Lawson in 2024 finding the city in contempt of a previous court order requiring the city to meet certain milestones in replacing lead pipes. 
After replacing nearly 11,000 lead lines, ACLU of Michigan Acting Legal Director Bonsitu Kitaba said the city has nearly completed its obligations for the settlement. However, it has not replaced every lead line in the city, with several hundreds of pipes left to replace in vacant homes and some residents declining to have their home checked or their pipes replaced, Kitaba said.

The city is required by law to replace all lead lines in the coming years, with the city committing to replacing any remaining lead lines this year, Kitaba said, encouraging any residents who need their lead lines replaced to call 810-410-1133, or email GetTheLeadOut@cityofflint.com.nrdc
Addie Rolnick, an attorney with the NRDC noted that the settlement requirements will remain until March 2026, meaning the city must continue providing filter cartridges and water test kits until then. After the settlement concludes, the city will still be required to replace all lead pipes and must monitor lead levels in the water and keep them below the state’s 12 part per billion threshold under the Michigan Lead and Copper rule. 
While taking questions from community members, Rolnick emphasized that there is no safe level of lead in the drinking water, encouraging residents to continue using EPA-certified filters. 
As long as there is lead attached to the system, it will continue to impact pipes throughout the city, Mays said.

EPA announcement leaves residents seeking answers
While Mays, Overton and members of the NRDC and ACLU answered resident’s questions, Aonie Gilcreast, 74, said residents were getting mixed messages about their water with the EPA’s latest announcement. 
 “Collectively, we don’t really know what to believe. We don’t trust the system,” he said. 
While Overton clarified that the agency still held some concerns, that issue was a fight for the next day. 
“If there’s a problem with the EPA and the decision that the EPA has made, then we need to have a conversation with them offline to find out what it is that we can do, if there’s something that we can do,” Overton later told attendees, emphasizing that that work would be driven by community members and their relationship with the attorneys. 
Overton later told the Michigan Advance that they had some concerns about the EPA’s decision, agreeing with the NRDC that residents should continue to use filters as long as there’s any level of lead in the system. 
“Because we do have lead that still remains in our system, it would be destructive to tell people that we don’t need the filters anymore. So we’re going to begin that fight to find out exactly what is going on with that, to make sure that we keep things above board, that our residents are protected [and] taken care of,” Overton said.

“We’ve been bamboozled by the EPA as well as EGLE. So we want to make sure that what they’re saying are the facts, they have the documentation that they’ve done, all the checklists are checked off, everything’s been checked off to make sure that what they’re saying is correct and it’s best for this community,” he said. 
Mays additionally raised concerns about President Donald Trump and his administration’s efforts to roll back environmental regulations, including a potential roll back of requirements for all the lead pipes in the nation to be replaced over the next 13 years, accompanied by lower limits for lead in drinking water.
“Flint is an example of right now what’s happening in the country. We have people trying to run government as a business, and who are appointing unelected, uneducated people like Elon Musk and [the Department of Government Efficiency] to go in and gut all these regulations,” said Mays, who likened the government initiative’s cost-based decision making to the decisions made by Flint’s emergency manager, ultimately sparking the water crisis.

Bill Lee is declining to give death row inmates a reprieve as they challenge the state’s new protocol for lethal injections.
Attorneys for Oscar Smith, who is to be put to death Thursday for the 1989 murders of his estranged wife and her two sons, said the governor denied the request this week of death row prisoners even though a trial on the execution process won’t be held until January 2026. Inmates are raising questions about the protocol’s constitutionality and say “serious questions” remain about the safety and efficacy of the lethal chemicals and the execution team’s qualifications.
Lee put a hold on executions in 2022, just minutes before Smith was to be executed, because of errors in the Tennessee Department of Correction protocol. 
“Gov. Lee, has in the past, used his power to prevent Tennesseans from making irreparable mistakes. We had hoped he would do it again. There is no principled reason to allow the state to resume executions before the court has an opportunity to hear all the evidence about whether TDOC is sourcing its lethal chemicals legally, whether those chemicals are contaminated, unexpired, and undiluted, and whether the execution team is capable of carrying out its duties competently and constitutionally. Tennessee can do better than this,” said Kelley Henry, an attorney for the prisoners.
A Davidson County chancellor turned down the state’s request May 15 to dismiss most of the prisoners’ claims, including a constitutional challenge to the lethal injection protocol. A court order also is pending on a state request for a protective order that would shield the identity of the supplier of lethal drugs and execution team members.

Gerry Connolly, D-Va., has died, after an extended battle with cancer that weeks ago prompted him to not seek reelection to Congress. He was 75 and “passed away peacefully at his home” Wednesday morning, according to a statement from his family. 
Connolly was elected to Congress in 2008, representing Virginia’s 11th District, anchored in Fairfax County. He had previously served on the Fairfax Board of Supervisors from 1995 to 2008, spending the last five years of his term as chairman. He leaves a 30-plus-year legacy as an advocate of progressive legislation, and served as ranking member of the U.S. House Oversight Committee until weeks before his death.
Longtime NoVa congressman Gerry Connolly will not seek reelection after cancer resurgence

Democratic Party of Virginia Chairman Lamont Bagby joined a chorus of state and federal lawmakers expressing condolences over Connolly’s death Wednesday morning. 
“Congressman Gerry Connolly embodied what it means to be a public servant. Over decades of leadership — first as Chairman of the Fairfax County Board of Supervisors and then as a Congressman for 16 years — he demonstrated an unwavering commitment to the people of Fairfax County, Northern Virginia, and beyond,” Bagby wrote.
U.S. Sen. Mark R. Warner, D-Va., said in a statement he was “heartbroken” over Connolly’s death.
“I’ve known Gerry for more than 35 years. To me, he exemplified the very best of public service. Just this past Sunday, I was honored to join his wife Smitty, daughter Caitlin, and the Fairfax community in celebrating his decades of service. While Gerry couldn’t be there in person, his presence was felt throughout the room. He was there in spirit, as he always is when people come together in the name of service and progress.”
Despite his declining health, in his last months Connolly pushed to maximize public access to information that impacts the average American’s life. 
Less than a month ago, Connolly sharply questioned the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention after thousands of the public health agency’s staff was terminated, including the entirety of personnel responsible for responding to Freedom of Information Act requests. The layoffs were part of President Donald Trump’s administration’s massive slate of federal spending cuts, facilitated by Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency. 
“The elimination of staff responsible for facilitating FOIA strongly implies an effort by the Administration to prevent the public from obtaining information about their government that they are entitled to request. I urge you to provide detailed information responsive to the requests included in this letter to bring transparency to the FOIA operations within the CDC,” Connolly wrote.  
U.S. Rep. Jennifer McClellan, D-Va., who represents the state’s 4th District, called Connolly a “servant leader” who “fought for pragmatic policies that would improve the lives of his constituents.”
“Throughout my time in elected office, Gerry has been a defining and passionate voice in Virginia politics. I am grateful to have been able to call him a friend, mentor, and colleague. I will always treasure our talks on the House floor and will miss him greatly,” McClellan wrote in a statement.
Connolly’s time in federal office was defined by his focus on government reform, technology and international affairs. He served as the Ranking Member of the Subcommittee on Cybersecurity, Information Technology, and Government Innovation in previous years, helping to craft legislation on cyber security, digital privacy and government-wide federal information technology management and innovation.
Many of the political leaders commenting on Connolly’s death Wednesday said although his federal service and policies helped improve public life nationwide, his service to the state of Virginia remains preeminent in his legacy. 
“From transforming Northern Virginia’s transportation infrastructure – making transit more accessible for all – to shaping America’s role on the global stage, Gerry’s legacy reaches from local neighborhoods to the halls of Congress and across the world,” Virginia House Speaker Don Scott wrote in a statement. “It is with profound sadness that I mourn the passing of one of Virginia’s most dedicated public servants.”
Connolly, who lived in Fairfax, is survived by his wife Smitty and daughter Caitlin.

Shigellosis is a highly infectious gastrointestinal infection caused by a type of bacteria called Shigella. New Mexico recorded more 202 cases during the outbreak, including more than half in people experiencing homelessness, while others included daycare workers and attending children.
Nearly 70% of people with the infection were hospitalized, and there was one death. Research published Tuesday found the infection spread into the zoo, causing six primate deaths.
The outbreak is the first to be caused by drug-resistant bacteria and was the largest in the state.
The study’s researchers urge further surveillance due to the “threat of antimicrobial resistant organisms to vulnerable human and [non-human primate] populations.”
The infection is passed through contact with the bacteria — found in feces —including contact with other surfaces; contaminated food or water; or person-to-person contact. Antibiotics are commonly prescribed to treat severe cases, but growing drug resistance is limiting treatment options.
Anti-microbial resistance is growing in the U.S. Shigella populations. In 2023, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warned  that about 5% of Shigella infections resisted antibiotic treatments compared to 0% in 2015.
That figure included the New Mexico outbreak, from which researchers found that the bacterial infections were resistant to multiple drugs including the “first line treatment option which led to treatment failures in human and [non-human primate] populations.”
Researchers studied the genetic makeup of the Shigella strain in the New Mexico outbreak, which included the 202 New Mexico cases, 15 out of state cases and four non-human primates, to help understand how the outbreak spread.
Shortly after human cases were identified in May of 2021, 15 primates at the zoo displayed shigellosis. Four primates —  a gorilla and three siamangs, including a mother and her 2-month old baby — died of Shigella infection. Almost a year later in July 2022, a chimpanzee tested positive and also died.
The only surviving siamang was transferred to another zoo, but despite testing negative, infected others there with shigella, was transferred back and ultimately euthanized.
Researchers don’t have an answer for how the infection spread from humans to primates in the zoo, hypothesizing it could have spread through objects or from houseflies as a vector. Further tests ruled out municipal water and zoo staff did not report Shigellosis-like illness.
“It may have been introduced, indirectly, when a zoo visitor threw a contaminated item into the enclosure,” researchers wrote. “It may also have been introduced on cardboard tubes used as enrichment items, although this common zoo practice was discontinued as part of the initial response to the 2021 primate infections, and cannot explain the 2022 chimpanzee infection.”
The latest update in the outbreak was in September 2024, when the the New Mexico Department of Health reported four additional Shigella cases, mostly impacting people experiencing homelessness. The study’s authors included researchers from the state Department of Health, the University of New Mexico, Los Alamos National Laboratory, New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology and the City of Albuquerque.

They have different ideas about how to do so.,"Federal lawmakers from New York and Connecticut want to regulate the cryptocurrency stablecoin. They have different ideas about what that should look like.
On Monday, the U.S. Senate advanced legislation to create the country’s first regulatory framework for stablecoins, which are digital currencies pegged to the value of a stable currency, like the U.S. dollar. The legislation is supported by the crypto industry.
Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY), a former securities lawyer, is the lead Democratic co-sponsor of the bill.
“A product of months of bipartisan negotiations, the GENIUS Act will protect consumers, enable responsible innovation, and safeguard the dominance of the U.S. dollar,” Gillibrand said in a statement. “The bill takes aim at illicit finance, places limitations on Big Tech, puts in place ethical guardrails and defends national security.”
Monday’s vote was for cloture, which doesn’t pass the legislation out of the Senate. It limits debate on the bill and makes way for it to go to a final vote.
Sen. Chris Murphy (D-CT) voted against the bill, citing that it didn’t do anything to prevent President Donald Trump from profiting off his stablecoin, USD1. Murphy wants to add amendments to that extent, but Republicans control the Senate and are unlikely to advance them.
“The GENIUS Act exempts President Trump from the ethics laws on stablecoin. It allows him to continue his corruption,” Murphy posted on X. “Some of the Democrats who voted to advance the bill tonight want this changed before the final vote. So there is still time to fix this – if we speak up.”
U.S. Senators Chuck Schumer (D-NY) and Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) also voted against the legislation.

Jerry Moran, R-Kansas, pointedly shares budget insights on agriculture and law enforcement budget priorities with Trump administration officials.","U.S. Sen. Jerry Moran, a Kansas Republican, pressed U.S. Department of Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins and Federal Bureau of Investigation Director Kash Patel to consider implications of Trump administration budget decisions on the future of the state's agriculture economy and the necessity of emphasizing collaboration among federal, state and local law enforcement agencies. (Tim Carpenter/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Republican U.S. Sen. Jerry Moran pressed Trump administration officials on federal budget and personnel decisions by framing inquiries in terms of potential threats to the farm economy and public safety in Kansas.
Federal Bureau of Investigation Director Kash Patel and U.S. Department of Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins were on the receiving end of Moran’s questions during recent Senate hearings.
Moran inquired during an appropriations subcommittee hearing about implications of a recommended $545 million cut in expenditures that could eliminate 1,300 FBI jobs. The GOP senator said lawmakers were told reductions would be accomplished by ending duplicative intelligence gathering, initiatives tied to diversity, equity and inclusion, and projects championed by Democratic President Joe Biden.
“Is that accurate?” Moran said. “Is that capable of being done? We can find this in what I suppose most people around here call waste, fraud and abuse? Or, does it have real consequences to the level of personnel and the capabilities of meeting the mission of the FBI?”
Patel said the objective of reorganization at the FBI was to “make the mission work on whatever budget we’re given.”
Moran said an overall force reduction at the federal law enforcement agency could weaken public safety in Kansas.
“Fewer FBI special agents, intelligence analysts and professional staff could hinder the bureau in executing the president’s commitment to making our communities safe,” Moran said. “Our law enforcement, whether state, local or federal, keep our nation safe and carry out justice.”
 
‘Is that true?’
Moran, chairperson of the Senate’s commerce, justice and science appropriations subcommittee, asked about Patel’s initiative to move FBI positions out of Washington, D.C. The senator said the FBI might shift up to 40 agents to Kansas.
Moran urged Patel to not concentrate new personnel in FBI offices in Garden City, Manhattan, Wichita and Topeka or to curtail collaboration with local law enforcement.
“While your decentralizing Washington, I don’t want to shortchange the field office, but I want to make sure the field office doesn’t then shortchange the other aspects of law enforcement in our state,” Moran said. “We should see an increase in FBI participation, in partnership, with local law enforcement as a result of this change in policy? Is that true?”
Patel said the FBI didn’t intend to transfer agents by “throwing darts on a map.” The FBI would concentrate staff transfers in areas with higher incidence of violent crime, he said. The director said geography of sparsely populated states would be a factor in assignment of agents.
“We aren’t sending more agents to LA just because it’s LA,” Patel said.
 
Insufficient USDA personnel
In terms of agriculture policy, Moran shared with USDA Secretary Rollins a perspective on President Donald Trump’s decision to terminate thousands of probationary federal employees. The senator emphasized the detrimental result of personnel cuts designed to “right-size, downsize, whatever the right words are” the Farm Service Agency and other USDA offices in the state.
“We love the circumstance when a young man or woman out of college returns home and goes to work for USDA in the county office,” Moran said. “We do not have sufficient personnel in those county offices today. Secretary Rollins, will you pay particular attention to making certain that county offices, where farmers sit across the table from USDA employees, are sufficiently staffed?”
Hollins said it was important to keep in mind USDA was formed to serve interests of farmers and ranchers. The Trump administration was focused on delivering economic prosperity to agriculture, she said.
“As President Trump is working to make America great again and restore prosperity across the country, my role in that is to ensure that rural America sees a level of prosperity that perhaps we haven’t seen in our lifetimes,” she said.
Moran asked Hollins to outline USDA’s vision for the National Bio and Agro-Defense Facility in Manhattan. The $1.2 billion federal laboratory was built to research biological threats transmitted from animals to humans, including foot-and-mouth disease and swine fever.
“Tell me or get me a report on NBAF’s operational status,” Moran said.
Hollins said the Trump administration was committed to moving NBAF forward “in a way that serves all of America.”
 
Mission ‘more urgent’
Moran, who co-chairs the Senate Hunger Caucus, asked Hollis to provide assurances USDA was interested in preserving the U.S. Food for Peace program and the McGovern-Dole Food for Education program in wake of the Trump administration’s dismantling of the U.S. Agency for International Development.
Hollis said she’d spoken with U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio about the programs, which had for decades relied on surplus U.S.-grown food to save lives abroad. She said USDA would comply if Congress passed and Trump signed a bill authorizing the transfer.
“No surprisingly,” she said, “I don’t want to get ahead of my boss.”
Moran said the U.S. food programs were “the difference between life and death for millions of people around the world and has made circumstances better for farmers here at home.”
He argued the mission of international food distribution was increasingly urgent with more than 730 million people facing chronic hunger.
“It was Kansas farmers who came up with the idea for Food for Peace as a moral and commonsense solution to prevent excess American food from going to waste and using it to feed the hungry across the globe,” he said.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Jerry-Moran-at-KU2-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-05-21 10:06:27.646028

(By Emma Davis/ Maine Morning Star)The only Maine police department that has contracted with federal authorities to assist with immigration enforcement is pausing its agreement to see if the Maine Legislature votes to ban such contracts.
Wells Police Chief Jo-Ann Putnam announced Tuesday night during a Select Board meeting that her department is adopting a “wait-and-see approach” to credentialing its officers under U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s 287(g) program.
“This decision reflects the need to see how the legislation ends up playing out in Augusta,” Putnam said, referencing LD 1259, which had a public hearing on Monday. 
Two bills, LD 1259 and LD 1971, would prohibit state and local law enforcement agencies from carrying out the work of federal immigration authorities. LD 1259 would do so by explicitly prohibiting contracts with such authorities, while LD 1971 would place restrictions on enforcement activities absent formal agreements.
Based on Putnam’s brief comments at the meeting, it is unclear exactly what the pause means. Putnam could not be reached by the time of publication. In early May, she told Maine Morning Star that Wells officers had begun the training for the program, which is online.
After the 287(g) program was discontinued in 2012 due to the discovery of discriminatory practices such as racial profiling, President Donald Trump revived it to bolster ICE’s capacity by deputizing local police officers to detain immigrants, an authority otherwise generally reserved to federal authorities. 
Immigration enforcement hearing highlights lack of protocol for local, federal collaboration

Putnam and Police Capt. Kevin Chabot previously told Maine Morning Star that they entered into the agreement to take advantage of a training opportunity and streamline work.
On Tuesday night, Putnam said, “I would like to reiterate one more time that at no point was there ever any intent on doing proactive immigration enforcement.”
Wells remains the only local agency to have entered the program in Maine. Monmouth Winthrop Police Department, a combination of departments that serve central Maine communities, applied for the program but withdrew its application after community pushback.
Community pushback in Wells is continuing in light of the pause.
“Our group, although appreciative of a pause, really is looking for Wells Police to withdraw from the contract,” Wells resident Peg Duddy told Maine Morning Star Wednesday morning. 
Duddy and other residents have been calling for termination of the agreement during Select Board meetings, including Tuesday night after Putnam announced the pause. The group has also been collecting signatures from Wells residents in favor of withdrawing and had more than 350 as of Wednesday morning, Duddy said.  
These residents have said they don’t want their local force collaborating with an agency that has been accused of disregarding due process, for local police funding to go toward federal enforcement and possibly litigation, or for Wells to be known as an unwelcoming place for immigrants. 
However, other residents have commended local police for entering the federal partnership, showing that the matter has divided the community. 
The two bills heard on Monday come after Republican legislators presented a conflicting bill last month that would prevent local agencies from adopting any policies that restrict them from assisting in the enforcement of federal immigration law. 
None of these bills have received votes yet and there is only a month left until lawmakers are expected to conclude their work for the first year of Maine’s two-year legislative session. One of the bill sponsors, Rep. Ambureen Rana (D-Bangor), told Maine Morning Star that the intention is for the Legislature to make its decisions on the issue this year.

Calvin Schrage, I-Anchorage, speaks to the Alaska House of Representatives on Friday, April 25, 2025. (Photo by James Brooks/Alaska Beacon)The Alaska Legislature adjourned its regular session on Tuesday without finishing work on a major elections bill or a bill reimposing limits on cash donations to election candidates.
House Bill 16, the campaign finance bill, and Senate Bill 64, the elections reform legislation, are expected to return when the Legislature resumes work in January, and they could be part of a wave of major legislation that advances through the Capitol early next year.
“We got really close with the election bill, and I think the prospects for passing next year are good,” said Speaker of the House Bryce Edgmon, I-Dillingham.
“I expect that we may have a legitimate shot at passing that bill early next session,” he said.
Sen. Bill Wielechowski, D-Anchorage, said that both bills could have gotten legislative approval, but they would have been vetoed by Gov. Mike Dunleavy.
“We were told flat out, the governor would veto it, by someone in the governor’s office,” Wielechowski said.
The governor’s communications office did not respond to an email asking whether Wielechowski’s statement was accurate.
If enacted, HB 16 would, among other things, limit Alaskans to $2,000 in donations per candidate in each two-year election cycle. Alaska currently has no limit on the amount of money a person can donate to a candidate. A ballot measure is slated for the 2026 election, but the restrictions could come into place earlier, if the Legislature approves.
SB 64, as currently written, is a broad election reform bill that includes significant changes to the way the state deals with absentee voting.
“I think we are poised and in a position where there will be a number of pieces of significant legislation passed next year, probably early on in the session, and we will be dealing with a number of veto overrides during the session,” Wielechowski said. 
Wielechowski said the possibilities include an elections bill, a campaign finance bill, the long-awaited pension restoration bill and a bill taxing businesses whose owners are taxed separately from the businesses, known as C-corporations.
To avoid a veto, Wielechowski and others said they intend to work with Republicans in the House and Senate minorities to try to garner support for a compromise that could win a veto-proof majority of votes in the Legislature.
It takes 40 votes to override a policy veto; the coalition majorities in the House and Senate have a combined 35 members, meaning that additional Republican support would be needed.
House Minority Leader Mia Costello, R-Anchorage, said she thinks changes to Senate Bill 64 are needed for any compromise.
“I was really proud of our finance team for helping stop that version of the bill, because it really had some things in there that were not productive and were not representative of our values and what we think should be in an elections bill,” she said. 
“I do think there is room to make it better. I just think we weren’t a part of that discussion (on advancing the bill), but I think they realized that we have to be, moving forward.”
On the campaign finance bill, getting a veto-proof majority is “possible,” said Rep. Calvin Schrage, I-Anchorage and the bill’s sponsor. 
“I’ve personally spoken to a number of minority members who recognize the need for limits. They were disappointed as well that the bill wasn’t taken up. We do have a very high veto threshold, so it’ll be a challenge,” Schrage said. “But as I remind legislators all the time around here, this is going to happen one way or another when this goes to the ballot, so I think we have an opportunity to save the time and expense and put this in place ourselves. If we don’t, Alaskans will take action.”

State legislators are clashing with Gov. Gavin Newsom and his call to speed up a $20 billion state water project. 
During the unveiling of his updated state budget plan last week, Newsom called for legislation that would accelerate the Delta Conveyance Project, which aims to reroute more water from Northern California southward. That water would bypass the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta and reach about 30 million people living mostly in Southern California, as well as farmland. 
Because the immense project faces several legal, environmental and permitting hurdles, the governor wants the Legislature to pass a bill that would, among other things, simplify the permitting process and expedite judicial reviews of lawsuits challenging the project.
But legislators whose districts would be affected by the proposed tunnel object because they say it is too costly and would have devastating effects on the environment and nearby communities without providing more water storage.
On Tuesday a handful of lawmakers from the 15-member bipartisan Legislative Delta Caucus, as well as environmental advocates and tribal leaders from the Delta, gathered at the state Capitol to denounce Newsom’s directive. 

Assemblymember Lori Wilson, a Suisun City Democrat and co-chairperson of the Delta Caucus: “Shifting water from one farming region to benefit another farming region doesn’t solve our water crisis. It only makes it worse.”

The caucus also sent a letter last week to the governor and other legislative leaders pushing back against the bill proposal.
But some do support the governor’s call to action, writes CalMatters’ Rachel Becker. Though they were outnumbered at an Assembly budget hearing Tuesday by those who opposed the project, proponents include water agencies in the Bay Area and Southern California, which argue that the Delta Tunnel would make their water supplies more reliable.

Study finds ‘forever chemicals’ in SF Bay fish

The next time you eat fish caught in the San Francisco Bay, you could also be consuming a mouthful of harmful contaminants.
Striped bass, white sturgeon and other fish collected throughout the San Francisco Bay between 2009 and 2019 contained potentially harmful levels of “forever chemicals,” according to a report published Tuesday by the scientific journal ES&T Water.
As Rachel explains, these chemicals — which seep into the soil from landfills, airports, sewage treatment plants and other industrial sites, and then wash into waterways — are linked to various health risks such as cancer and heart disease.
Many people fish in the bay, including Asian immigrants, other people of color and low-income people. Though they do not sell the fish commercially, some rely on the fish for subsistence.
State officials have established health advisories for other contaminants in fish, such as mercury, but not for forever chemicals.

Religious exceptions show limits of state abortion protections

Though California officials often tout the state as a “safe haven” for reproductive rights — especially after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned federal abortion protections in 2022 — a legal battle involving a Catholic hospital underscores the limits of California’s abortion rights, writes CalMatter’ Kristen Hwang.
Providence St. Joseph Hospital refused to provide an abortion last year after Anna Nusslock arrived at the Eureka hospital bleeding and in pain, according to lawsuits filed by Nusslock and California Attorney General Rob Bonta. Doctors said Nusslock needed immediate treatment for her miscarriage, but Providence refused to intervene because her twins still had “fetal heart tones.”
Providence argues that it provided appropriate care and that its actions are protected by the U.S. Constitution. Catholic hospitals operate 1 in 5 maternity wards in California. While they aren’t required to provide abortions if they morally object to them, they must provide emergency services, under state law, to patients who request help whose life may be in danger.

Their policies generally prohibit abortion, even in miscarriage, as long as a heartbeat can be detected.","In summary
Catholic hospitals run 20% of California’s maternity wards. Their policies generally prohibit abortion, even in miscarriage, as long as a heartbeat can be detected. 


Anna Nusslock never wanted to be the face of a new kind of reproductive rights battle in California, but when a small Catholic hospital refused to provide an abortion that would end her miscarriage, Nusslock girded herself for a long and difficult conflict.
Nusslock felt her civil rights were being violated, she said, even as she lay in the hospital bed curled in on herself, bleeding and mourning the loss of her twin girls. The doctor had said that her pregnancy needed to be terminated immediately to protect her from infection and other serious complications but hospital policy prohibited it, according to two lawsuits filed by Nusslock and California Attorney General Rob Bonta.
“I am planning to fight this for the rest of my life,” Nusslock said in an interview with CalMatters.
Both complaints allege that Providence, the Catholic health system that owns St. Joseph Hospital in Eureka, illegally denied Nusslock emergency abortion care and discharged her instead. They also allege that multiple pregnant women have been denied abortions at St. Joseph Hospital during medical emergencies.
The disputes playing out in a small courtroom in Eureka highlight the limits of California’s efforts to protect abortion rights since the Supreme Court in 2022 repealed federal protections granted under Roe vs. Wade. They also reveal geographic disparities in patients’ access to reproductive health care after dozens of California hospitals shuttered their maternity wards over the past decade. 
Providence has denied the state’s allegations and argued that it provided appropriate care to Nusslock. It contends that its actions are protected by religious liberties that are enshrined in the U.S. Constitution. Humboldt County Superior Court Judge Timothy Canning earlier this month rejected a bid by Providence to dismiss the state’s lawsuit. Providence has filed a request to dismiss Nusslock’s civil suit, which is ongoing.
Catholic companies own about 13% of hospitals in California, but operate 20% of the state’s maternity wards, according to a CalMatters analysis of state data. In the rural northern counties, they represent an even greater share at 35%. 
Large corporations such as CommonSpirit (Dignity), Providence, Trinity and Scripps are the most prominent Catholic health care systems in the state.

In Humboldt County where Nusslock lives, Providence now owns the only hospital with an obstetrics department. The next closest maternity ward is 86 miles north along a winding, mostly two-lane stretch of Highway 1.
Last year, Nusslock arrived at Providence St. Joseph Hospital bleeding and in pain but still hopeful her pregnancy could be saved, according to the state’s complaint. Her water had broken at 15 weeks – too early for the twins to survive on their own – and tests indicated Nusslock had an infection and high blood pressure, the complaint says. 
Multiple doctors said her condition was dangerous and she needed immediate treatment but Providence refused to intervene because her twins still had fetal heart tones, according to the complaint. Nusslock was discharged with a bucket and towels “in case something happens in the car,” according to the complaint and a declaration filed by Nusslock.
Nusslock’s husband drove her to another hospital about 20 minutes away where she began hemorrhaging and underwent immediate surgery, according to court documents. That hospital, Mad River Community Hospital in Arcata, has since permanently closed its labor and delivery ward, leaving St. Joseph alone in the county. 
California’s constitution protects abortion rights, but religiously affiliated hospitals, clinics and individual providers are not required to provide them if they have moral objections. State law, however, requires hospitals to provide emergency services to any person who requests help whose life may be in danger or at risk of “serious injury or illness.”

In an unsigned statement, a Providence spokesperson said the hospital is clear about not performing elective abortions but does allow “medically necessary interventions to protect pregnant patients who are miscarrying or facing serious life-threatening conditions” in an emergency. 
“This is consistent with the California Emergency Services Law and the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act. It is also consistent with the Catholic Ethical and Religious Directives, which include discussion of the importance of the physician-patient relationship as well as the circumstances in which certain medical procedures that could result in fetal death may be allowed in a Catholic hospital,” according to the statement provided to CalMatters.
The Catholic Health Association, a trade group representing Catholic health facilities, did not respond to repeated questions about personal belief protections and the expansion of Catholic hospitals.
Religious liberty at heart of hospital’s defense
On a rainy day in February, Harvey Rochman, lead attorney for Providence, argued that religious freedoms protect Providence’s alleged actions.
“The elephant in the room so to speak on this case is there is no court that has ordered a Catholic hospital to perform an abortion under circumstances that the hospital has determined is contrary to the hospital’s faith,” Rochman said during the hearing in Eureka.
The hospital denies that it discriminated against Nusslock or improperly denied care to her. Rochman argued that federal law allows secular hospitals to transfer patients if they do not have the expertise or technical ability to perform a procedure, which is no different from a faith-based hospital saying it cannot perform a procedure that “contravenes” its beliefs.
“The current jurisprudence of the U.S. Supreme Court…is the religious rights have the same significance as the secular,” Rochman said during the hearing.
Catholic hospitals nationwide must adhere to the “Ethical and Religious Directives for Catholic Health Care Services” developed by the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops. The directives prohibit abortion in almost all circumstances.

Martine D’Agostino, a deputy attorney general representing the state, argued that the case was about Providence St. Joseph Hospital denying women emergency health care “at great risk to their lives.”
State law prohibits hospitals from transferring patients for non-medical reasons, such as lack of insurance. D’Agostino argued that St. Joseph Hospital did not stabilize Nusslock and illegally discharged her.
“The record details harrowing experiences of several women who were turned away from St. Joseph’s emergency department,” D’Agostino said. “The attorney general brought this case to ensure that St. Joseph Hospital follows the law that emergency health care must be provided to women of this county.”
In declarations filed with the court, multiple doctors allege that other St. Joseph patients have experienced close calls similar to Nusslock’s miscarriage. 
One doctor who delivers babies at Providence St. Joseph Hospital said in a declaration that he has had three patients other than Nusslock who needed emergency pregnancy terminations during miscarriages that he was not able to carry out. The declaration states “…the Chaplain told me, that under no circumstances was I to terminate a pregnancy at Providence Hospital.”
Another doctor who later treated Nusslock at Mad River Community Hospital said one to two patients each year would come to the hospital’s now-closed obstetrics department having been turned away from Providence in the midst of a miscarriage.
Another woman has anonymously filed a civil lawsuit in Humboldt Superior Court against Providence alleging similar circumstances to Nusslock. In February, lawyers for Providence filed papers asking a judge to dismiss the case.
Differences in how hospitals treat miscarriage
Although Nusslock’s case is not unique, experts say patient experiences at Catholic hospitals vary widely. 
“People always ask me ‘Why are people not dying all over the place?’ And it’s because it’s not exactly that extreme,” said Lori Freedman, a sociologist and bioethicist at UC San Francisco who has extensively researched patient and doctor experiences at Catholic health systems.
Frequently, doctors at Catholic institutions, many of whom are not Catholic, find workarounds to prevent patients from dying, Freedman said. An ethics committee headed by a priest or other religious figure at each hospital decides in the moment whether doctors can intervene. They may wait until the woman develops a fever (a sign of infection), until her bleeding increases or until the fetus dies, Freedman said. 
The Ethical and Religious Directives at Catholic hospitals allow pregnancy termination for a “proportionately serious pathological condition of a pregnant woman,” but ethics committees at each hospital can have different interpretations of where to draw the line, Freedman said.
This approach, however, is often shocking to obstetricians in non-religious hospitals, Freedman said.
“When you talk to someone in a really high-quality obstetric service, their jaw drops because they’re like, ‘Well it’s not just die or not die,’” Freedman said. “What kind of level of suffering and risk are you going to require, before the intervention you know is going to happen is allowed to happen?”

The Catholic Health Association states in a policy brief that “Our deeply held religious and moral convictions are the source of both the work we do and the limits on what we will do.” 
Those religious and moral convictions include a mandate to continue the “healing ministry of Christ,” to care for the poor, and to advocate for marginalized groups like immigrants, according to the Ethical and Religious Directives. 
They also state that the “Catholic health care ministry is rooted in a commitment to promote and defend human dignity; this is the foundation of its concern to respect the sacredness of every human life from the moment of conception until death.”
Maryam Guiahi, an obstetrician in Santa Barbara who has previously worked in Catholic institutions in Chicago, said that’s where Catholic policies begin to conflict with modern secular medical ethics that place different emphasis on patient autonomy and avoiding harm.
In cases like Nusslock’s, in which the amniotic fluid sac breaks before the fetus is viable, terminating the pregnancy is typically the safest option and the standard of care, Guiahi said.
Guiahi said Catholic hospitals sometimes don’t allow doctors to tell patients that an abortion is an option.
“I’ve been in secular institutions and we can give that information. We can let people decide what they want, and some people will choose to continue and hope and see what happens, but other women don’t want to go through that,” Guiahi said.
Not telling patients all of the risks and options compromises their ability to consent and can lead to avoidable complications like infection and hemorrhaging, Guiahi said.
Guiahi said she never saw a patient die after being denied an emergency abortion at the Catholic hospital she worked at, but sometimes patients would come back septic and require care in the intensive care unit. 
“To me, medicine is about ‘to do no harm.’ I don’t know many medical situations where we wait till people get sick in order to intervene,” Guiahi said.
Moving to have a baby
Nusslock is making plans to leave Eureka during her next pregnancy. She and her husband still desperately want to start a family, but she can’t drive past Providence St. Joseph Hospital without getting dizzy. She said she has been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder. 
“I still have that voice in the back of my head just screaming, ‘you’re bleeding to death,’” Nusslock said.
Most likely Nusslock said she’ll find a place in the Bay Area to live during her pregnancy.
Having few options to give birth reflects a larger loss of maternity services in California. The northern counties, including where Nusslock lives, have lost a third of their birthing hospitals since 2012, according to a CalMatters database on maternity care.
Statewide, 59 hospitals have stopped delivering babies in the same time period, creating broad swaths of maternity deserts particularly in rural and low-income communities. 
Nearly 80% of those closures have been secular hospitals, increasing the influence of Catholic health care.

During the February court hearing, Providence lawyer Rochman said that a core mission of the Eureka hospital is to keep labor and delivery services available “when it may not be financially sensible to do so.”
In a statement, a Providence spokesperson said “providing high-quality labor and delivery services” is a “top priority” for the organization in Humboldt County and throughout the nation.
But having an operating maternity ward doesn’t mean all services are available. The Ethical and Religious Directives also prohibit the use of contraceptives to prevent pregnancy, including sterilization for both males and females, and in vitro fertilization.
Josie Urbina, an obstetrician with UC San Francisco Health who specializes in complex family planning, said this creates an unequal patchwork of services in the state.
“It’s unfortunate that in rural parts of California, which happen to be dominated by religious hospitals, that the standard of care is not being followed,” Urbina said. “It’s really just detrimental to patient care.”
For Nusslock, who moved to Eureka 10 years ago and quickly fell in love with the towering redwoods and small-town feel, the lawsuits are about ensuring her experience doesn’t happen to anyone else, she said in an interview with CalMatters.
“These are good people. These are people worth protecting,” Nusslock said. “If they’re going to give me an opportunity to speak for them and fight for them, I’m going to take every opportunity I can.”

Both Democrat and Republican lawmakers representing the Delta say Newsom is trying to upend existing water rights and land acquisition laws, while the governor says “we’re done with barriers.”


Fifteen California lawmakers from both parties are up in arms over Gov. Gavin Newsom’s latest proposal to to use the budget process to fast-track the Delta tunnel — a deeply controversial, $20 billion plan to replumb the estuary and funnel more water south. 
With the clock ticking for the Legislature to pass a budget bill tackling the state’s $12 billion deficit, Newsom dropped a spending plan last week that would add sweeping changes to permitting, litigation, financing, and eminent domain and land acquisition issues aimed at speeding approval of the massive project. 
“We’re done with barriers  — our state needs to complete this project as soon as possible, so that we can better store and manage water to prepare for a hotter, drier future,” Newsom said in a statement last week. “Let’s get this built.” 
Assembly and Senate Democrats and Republicans representing Delta counties, including Sacramento, Yolo, Contra Costa and San Joaquin, fired back in a letter last week, saying it would “change several, separate parts of state law to benefit only a portion of California, to the detriment of Californians north of the Delta.”
In a hearing and press briefing on Tuesday, several warned Newsom and legislative leaders that the tunnel’s water supply benefits would not outweigh its financial costs nor its toll on communities, farms and the environment in the Delta region. 
“Shifting water from one farming region to benefit another farming region doesn’t solve our water crisis, it only makes it worse,” Assemblymember Lori Wilson, a Democrat from Suisun City and co-chair of the Delta Caucus, said Tuesday. 
“Our state needs to complete this project as soon as possible, so that we can better store and manage water to prepare for a hotter, drier future.”GOV. GAVIN NEWSOM
The Delta Conveyance Project, the official name of the tunnel, would stretch 45 miles from the Sacramento River to a reservoir near Livermore, diverting water around the Delta. The state’s original tunnel proposal dates back more than 60 years.
The project’s goal is to increase exports of Northern California water south — much of it to cities in Southern California and farms in the San Joaquin Valley — during wet years. It’s also supposed to shore up the supply against earthquakes or other disasters that could swamp the estuary in salt water, tainting or even cutting off State Water Project supplies that 27 million people and 750,000 acres of farmland rely on. 
“It does feel like drought’s coming back for us, and it will in all likelihood be deeper and longer,” Karla Nemeth, director of the California Department of Water Resources and Newsom’s senior water advisor, told lawmakers of the Assembly Budget Subcommittee on Climate Crisis, Resources, Energy and Transportation. 
Being able to move water when it’s wet into reservoirs or thirsty aquifers, Nemeth said, “has never been more important.” 
Water agencies in the Bay Area and Southern California applauded Newsom’s proposals, saying they would cut costs and shorten the timeline for the project and make their water supply more reliable in a time of climate change.  
But Delta counties warned Newsom and legislative leaders in a letter that “every city and county affected by this project in the Delta region opposes the tunnel.”

In the packed hearing room on Tuesday, opposition outweighed support. Many raised concerns that they might lose their power to fight a project that they fear could scour the Delta landscape with construction and staunch freshwater flows already insufficient to keep harmful algal blooms at bay or support the state’s collapsing salmon fishery.
“This project will damage the Delta in countless ways and pass on the costs to my generation of Californians,” Wesley Motlow, a resident of the small Delta community of Locke, told committee members. “I’ve always been proud to be a member of the state, but if this project is seen to fruition, I will not feel that way.” 
A state analysis warned in 2022 that a Delta tunnel would put salmon at risk. This past spring, salmon fishing was cancelled for an unprecedented third year in a row. 
“Drying out the North just to water the South doesn’t make it better at all, and it doesn’t make it fair,” said Assemblymember Stephanie Nguyen, a Democrat from Elk Grove who pushed instead for more recycled water and other local strategies.

Newsom’s streamlining proposals take aim at an array of hurdles the tunnel project would have to clear, as well as recent court decisions that could set it back. 
One change would codify the state’s authority to issue revenue bonds to fund the project — which participating water agencies would have to pay back. A court ruled last year that the state water agency “exceeded its delegated authority” for the bonds.
Newsom’s proposal would shorten the timeline to resolve challenges in court, limit injunctions against construction activities unless they present “an imminent threat to public health and safety” and alter some procedures and oversight for acquiring properties under eminent domain. It would also eliminate certain deadlines related to water rights for the State Water Project, according to a Senate analysis, and limit the ability of others to file protests against the state.   
“It creates a separate water rights system for the State Water Project that upends over a century of water rights law,” said Osha Meserve, counsel for various local water agencies and other opponents of the Delta tunnel.

Also, Senate analysts said, the proposal “does not contain language that would allow a court to stay or enjoin a project to protect native American artifacts or historical resources.”
Malissa Tayaba, vice chair of the Shingle Springs Band of Miwok Indians and director of traditional knowledge, said the tunnel threatens their homelands and desecrate the resting place of their ancestors. 
“It seems that, to Governor Newsom, our culture, our ancestors and the environment that sustains us is worth less than the ability to over-divert water from our rivers to send more water and money to commercial water interests,” Tayaba said. 
Environmental advocates say the governor’s proposal is an end run around laws and court decisions that could affect environmental protections beyond the Delta.
“What the governor calls barriers, we call laws,” Jon Rosenfield, science director with the San Francisco Baykeeper, said at the press conference Tuesday.

Many legislators took issue with Newsom’s strategy of using add-ons to the budget — called trailer bills — to rush through complex policy proposals that they fear would limit the public’s power to challenge the massive project. 
The normally circumspect, nonpartisan Legislative Analyst’s Office agreed. 
“These are issues that have been debated and discussed for years and even decades, and the Legislature simply does not have much time … to consider all of the potential implications,” Sonja Petek, principal fiscal and policy analyst with the Legislative Analyst’s Office, told lawmakers.  With such a challenging budget ahead and decisions looming to cut services that Californians rely on, Petek said, these proposals “serve as a distraction.” 
It’s not the first time Newsom has taken this tact. In 2023, he proposed overhauling permitting and litigation for the Delta tunnel under the California Environmental Quality Act as part of a broader infrastructure package. Lawmakers were outraged and rejected that part of the proposal.
Tara Gallegos, Newsom’s deputy director of communications, said in an email that the statements from legislators and environmentalists at the press conference Tuesday “demonstrated why this fast track is necessary, as it is clear that misinformation will continue to delay and obfuscate this critical project.” She said solutions such as more recycled water are “simplistic” and “ignore the practical realities” of providing sufficient and reliable supplies.
Assemblymember Steve Bennett, a Democrat from Oxnard and chair of the  budget subcommittee, said debate about the tunnel will likely be deferred until after the budget vote in June.
“These conversations take time. There’s a lot of fear. There’s palpable frustration,” he said. “I know that going through policy committees is not considered fun, but given the magnitude of this issue, it may be the only way you can actually get enough information out there, in a steady enough format, to be able to make this move.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/022525-DeltaTunnelHood-FG-05.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-05-21 09:05:25.180065
,California,2025-05-21 12:30:00+00:00,CalMatters,Los Angeles has a Donald Trump problem. It’s making the city’s bad budget even worse,Jim Newton,,,,,https://calmatters.org/commentary/2025/05/los-angeles-donald-trump-budget/,"As Los Angeles confronts a major budget deficit, President Donald Trump's economic policies and abrupt actions are making it even harder to dig out of the hole.","Los Angeles city government did plenty to create its billion-dollar budget problem. 
Its elected leaders are so in thrall to public employee unions that departments grew too big and often paid too much in salaries and pensions. That’s smart politics but bad policy. The reckoning, now upon a city with an $800 million shortfall, will be painful.
But the city is not fully to blame. Indeed, much of Los Angeles’ current budget struggle is being inflicted by Washington, where a vain, incoherent president recklessly moves markets and economies with his public musings and punitive policies. His actions are dramatically compounding the burdens on local coffers statewide, and Los Angeles, where tourism and trade are major generators of economic life, is being hit especially hard.
Take the Port of Los Angeles, the main port of entry for trade with Asia. Some 40% of all imported goods pass through the L.A. and Long Beach complex. When the U.S. president launches a trade war with China and the rest of the world, the port feels the impact, especially when the president’s China tariffs bounce from 10% to 20% to 25% to 104% to 145% to 30% — as they did over just the past three months. 
That introduces chaos into the trade network as manufacturers and importers are left to wonder how prices today might be different tomorrow. Many elect to freeze and wait for signals of what the future may bring. Predictably, port traffic has plummeted, and officials expect a 30% dropoff this year.
For Los Angeles, that means a sharp decline in port revenue, as well as the broader effects of decreased business: dockworkers who see their pay decline, truckers with fewer goods to haul, maintenance crews with fewer ships and trucks to service. As their salaries drop, they buy less and the effects ripple outward. Toymakers feel the pinch, along with accountants and car dealers and barbershops and everyone else.
“The tariff may be aimed at China,” Los Angeles City Councilmember Katy Yaroslavsky explained to me, “but it hits in San Pedro.”
And the effect of those tariffs has struck both the port and Los Angeles International Airport. While cargo at the port has declined, tourism has plummeted as well — the result of uncertainty about costs as well as simple hostility toward the United States, which is suddenly demonizing longtime allies and partners.
Passenger traffic at LAX fell 7% in February compared to the same period a year prior, and fell again in March, off 5% from 2024. LAX revenues are predicted to rise modestly this year, but that’s only because it’s charging more in landing fees and building rents.
Trump’s bluster has affected foreign tourism across the United States, but it has had especially tough implications for Los Angeles. The three nations that provide the most tourists to Los Angeles are Mexico, Canada and China. Visits from all three have dropped in 2025, with Mexican tourism off 24% and Canadian visits down a whopping 74%, plunging in the face of President Trump’s repeated and condescending demand that our northern neighbor join the United States as its 51st state.
Overall, Yaroslavsky said the city of Los Angeles now projects a 25-30% decline in tourism for 2025. That means comparable reductions in the city’s share of hotel occupancy taxes. Restaurants, car services and tourist attractions all are braced for hits, too.
With Trump, the unpredictability of policy stems from the fact that he often seems driven by whatever is on his mind or whatever he most recently watched on television. That, too, complicates the lives of local leaders. 
“The tariff may be aimed at China, but it hits in San Pedro.”Katy Yaroslavsky, Los Angeles City Councilmember
Earlier this month, Trump announced on social media that he was “authorizing the Department of Commerce, and the United States Trade Representative, to immediately begin the process of instituting a 100% Tariff on any and all Movies coming into our Country that are produced in Foreign Lands.” 
That was news to Hollywood, and baffling news at that. What would it mean to impose such a tariff in a city where thousands of jobs depend on the movie industry? Would it protect American jobs or discourage movie production? Who knows? Certainly not Trump. And certainly not local officials trying to imagine how it might implicate their fiscal planning.
And that’s just the beginning of the Trump administration’s gifts to the city of Los Angeles and its residents. If his mass deportation plan ever kicked in at the level he promised (for all his bluster, Trump is deporting people at roughly the same rate as President Obama), it could, for example, ripple through the construction industry and significantly increase the cost and time required to build homes in a city facing fire recovery and the state’s worst homelessness crisis.

The plight of Pacific Palisades hinges on Trump in yet another way, too, as the administration continues to block disaster relief unless the city knuckles under to Trump’s insistence that it adopt new Voter ID laws in exchange. That has some impact on the city’s budget — city buildings and property were among the thousands of structures destroyed by the fire — but its greater effect is on residents, who are being held hostage in a way that victims of no other natural disaster in American history have ever faced. 
Finally, there is the Trump budget. The administration’s “skinny” budget, a rough outline of its spending plan for the coming fiscal year that was released earlier this month, includes dozens of cuts that could affect city services. An analysis prepared by Yaroslavsky’s office identified 19 city programs that could face cuts, from support for homeless services to elimination of renewable energy credits. Dozens of more cuts could affect residents, her office found, just not through the budget.
All told, the effect of Trump’s actions has been to add tens of millions of dollars to the city’s shortfall, along with untold millions lost to uncertainty and confusion. It is, to say the least, discouraging, if not entirely surprising.
“For a guy who bankrupted four businesses,” Yaroslavsky said, “it’s very on-brand.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/102021_Port-of-Los-Angeles_AP_CM_01.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-05-21 09:05:25.180065

Only a few job categories showed gains.","In summary
Unemployment in the Inland Empire ticked up to 4.9% last month, with lost jobs in trade and transportation. Only a few job categories showed gains.


Trade and transportation jobs dropped in the Inland Empire between March and April, while employment in other sectors such as hospitality and construction declined over the past year, according to a jobs report the California Employment Development Department released Friday.
However government jobs added 8,800 slots over last year while employment in schools and healthcare grew by 16,800 positions.
Overall, the unemployment rate ticked up from 4.6% last April to 4.9% last month. That’s a little lower than the statewide average of 5% but higher than the national 3.9% rate. 
Taking a longer view, the region’s job growth and labor force have held strong over the past five years compared to the rest of the state, said Christopher Thornberg, an economist with Los Angeles-based Beacon Economics.
“You’re talking about an economy that is one of the few bright spots in a flat California economy,” he said of the Inland Empire.
Trade, transportation and utilities sectors in the Inland Empire lost 1,400 jobs last month after gaining 1,300 positions over the previous year. That’s key for the Inland Empire, where more than 4,000 warehouses cover about 40 square miles of space and accounted for nearly 10% of jobs in Riverside County and more than 16% in San Bernardino County in 2021-22, according to a report by UC Riverside last year.
California business leaders are closely watching the distribution sector, wondering how well ports and warehouses will hold up as President Donald Trump’s on-again, off-again tariffs roil retail markets.
Thornberg said it’s too early to make that call. In the first quarter of the year, businesses tried to get ahead of the tariffs by stocking up, he said. In the second quarter tariffs were imposed and then lifted, triggering uncertainty, but probably not layoffs.
“Supply chains are long, complicated, and you don’t lay people off on the basis of a one-month disruption,” he said. “So, honestly, you’re not just going to see any of the data, not yet. And of course, we’re still wondering where this trade war goes. There’s a lot of volatility in this supply chain.”
That can make it hard to tease out the effects of national trade policy from consumer trends and regional economic factors. 
“With all that being said, it’s not like logistics is doing well,” Thornberg said. “Logistics saw a huge upsurge in 2022 because of spending, supply chains and the pandemic. Now people are spending more on restaurants and travel than campers and PlayStations.”
Hospitality also took a hit in the Inland Empire, losing 9,600 jobs between April 2024 and last month, although the sector added 2,200 positions between March and April of this year. 
Construction declined by 6,000 jobs year over year but gained 2,100 positions last month.
Alex Fernando, a labor market researcher at the Employment Development Department, said the agency doesn’t analyze the reasons for changes in job numbers, but national political policy could contribute to declining tourism, while seasonal factors also make a difference. 
With summer approaching, he said, “we start to notice that industries like construction go up, while local government and schools will be out of service during the summer months.”
Overall, Thornberg said, the Inland Empire is doing well. His data show that the region’s labor force — the number of people working or looking for jobs —  grew by 6.7% between 2020 and 2025, and jobs increased by 7.3% during that time. 
By comparison, Los Angeles and the Bay Area both lost jobs and workers in that five-year span.
”Now people are spending more on restaurants and travel than campers and PlayStations.”Christopher Thornberg, economist at Beacon Economics
The Inland Empire Economic Partnership released a report Tuesday that shows stable unemployment rates in the region. But it warned that might not last. 
“The outlook is worrisome: the Inland Empire’s job creation ability hangs on the contribution of three sectors: Health Services, Local Government Educational Services, and Logistics,” the report stated. “All other sectors are reducing employment.”
Tariffs could slash business to distribution centers, while California’s budget shortfall could cut money to schools and local governments, the report stated. 
Thornberg thinks the logistics sector will remain stable, despite the looming trade war.
“Ultimately we need stuff from overseas,” he said. “Even with tariffs, we’re going to buy the stuff.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/031524-Warehouse-AN_01.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-05-21 09:05:25.180065

States that are struggling with post-pandemic teacher shortages have spent millions to lure replacements and retain veterans with hiring bonuses and bumps in salaries. But hiring gaps remain, so some states also are trying another tactic: changing their standards.
The changes in teacher training and licensing come amid widespread turmoil in public schools: Tax revenue is being siphoned toward private school vouchers in many states; some classrooms are being scrutinized for banned books, displays or teaching lessons that trip into diversity, equity and inclusion territory; and students who went through pandemic-era shutdowns are struggling both with sitting still and with learning the material.
Some surveys show that fewer than a fifth of teachers are happy in their jobs.
“Teaching is not seen as an attractive profession right now,” said Drew Gitomer, an expert on teaching assessment at Rutgers Graduate School of Education.
“COVID exacerbated things, and teachers are caught in the middle of political battles — over curriculum, book bans, even personal attacks,” he said. “It’s not a healthy work environment, and that drives people away.”










Teaching is not seen as an attractive profession right now.


– Drew Gitomer, an expert on teaching assessment at Rutgers Graduate School of Education


Last year, Illinois enacted a law allowing teacher candidates to begin student teaching before passing content-area exams. It was an effort to reduce barriers for underrepresented groups, the measure’s sponsor said.
A bill under consideration this year would give more districts discretion over whether to factor pupils’ test scores into teacher evaluations, a break from a 15-year-old mandate.
In New Jersey, a new law formally removes the Praxis Core exam — traditionally used as an entry-level screening tool for aspiring teachers — from certification requirements.
And in Nevada — one of the states hit hardest by teacher shortages — a bill would streamline licensure for incoming educators. The bill would allow teachers credentialed in other states to begin working in Nevada classrooms while awaiting formal approval.
It also would remove extra steps for teachers switching grade levels and would waive application fees for recent substitute teachers.
Linda Darling-Hammond, founding president and chief knowledge officer of the Learning Policy Institute, a nonpartisan think tank, said teacher shortages hit hardest in schools serving low-income students and students of color, where instability often leads to larger class sizes, canceled courses or a revolving door of substitute teachers.
“When you walk into a school facing shortages, you see instability,” she said. “Students may be taught by people who don’t know what to do, who leave quickly, and who often rely more on discipline than engagement.”
The root cause? Teacher attrition.
South Dakota turned to paraprofessionals to attack a teacher shortage, and hundreds responded

“Nine out of 10 vacancies every year are because of attrition — and two-thirds of that is not retirement,” Darling-Hammond said. “Support in the beginning matters. Teachers who come in and get a mentor stay longer. If you’re just thrown in to sink or swim, the odds of leaving are much greater.”
States have long struggled to attract teachers, and credentialing changes aren’t unusual. But some education advocates fear long-term repercussions.
Melissa Tooley, director of K-12 educator quality at the left-leaning think tank New America, said most states now offer alternative and fast-track teacher certification pathways, many of which allow candidates to start teaching with little or no pedagogical training in how to teach.
“We’re churning through people who might have potential, but we’re not setting them up for success,” she said. “A lot of what states are doing is short term. It’s about filling seats, not necessarily building a sustainable or high-quality workforce.”
More than 40 states require aspiring teachers to take the costly Praxis Subject test for the subject they want to teach, which some experts argue excludes strong candidates and duplicates other assessments.
“You were excluding people who might be good teachers but didn’t do well on that specific test,” said Rutgers’ Gitomer, who has researched the test’s effects on recruitment.
However, he added, dropping tests doesn’t necessarily help.
Several states — Georgia, New Jersey, New York, Washington and Wisconsin — have dropped a licensure requirement known as edTPA since 2022, but there’s little evidence the move has helped ease teacher shortages, Gitomer said. (The acronym stands for Educative Teacher Performance Assessment and involves a portfolio that includes testing and videos of classroom performance.)
“The state eliminated edTPA but didn’t replace it with a specific alternative,” he said.
“Instead, it gave full discretion back to individual institutions to develop or adopt their own performance assessments,” he said. “When we talked to institutions, it became pretty clear they didn’t think removing edTPA would be a major driver in addressing the shortage — and they haven’t seen evidence that it has been.”
How best to credential
Tooley said state credentialing systems must navigate a delicate balance: ensuring there are enough teachers, maintaining instructional quality and increasing workforce diversity.
“There’s this triangle — three pieces that need to be in place — and I think there are real tensions when it comes to how states are designing their certification policies,” she said.
State cancels teacher trainings for new social studies standards due to federal funding cuts

And Gitomer described a fragmented national landscape, where some states are tightening teacher entry standards while others are dramatically loosening them — even allowing non-degreed individuals to teach.
“Some states are trying to raise standards; others are relaxing them to the point where you may not even need a college degree,” he said.
Indiana now requires all pre-K through grade 6 and special education teachers to complete 80 hours of training on the “science of reading,” a method that includes phonics, and pass an exam by 2027. State Sen. Jean Leising, a Republican, has proposed cutting the requirement in half, calling it “an excessive burden with little actual benefit” in a news release.
In Texas, a bill aims to reduce the use of uncertified teachers by the 2029-30 school year. The legislation would set a gradual cap on the percentage of uncertified teachers districts can employ in core curriculum classes — starting at 20% in 2026-27 and decreasing to 5% in 2029-30.
According to the Texas Education Agency, 31% of new hires in 2024-25 lacked a state teaching certificate or permit.
Yet some states stand out for how they’re changing their requirements, Tooley said.
She pointed to Washington, which has designed a recruitment strategy encouraging paraprofessionals, often known as teacher’s aides, to become classroom teachers. Also known as paraeducators, they’re a group with classroom experience, community ties and higher retention likelihood.
There, school districts are required to offer foundational training — ranging from 14 to 28 hours — directly to paraeducators. South Dakota has a program offering deeply discounted tuition for paraprofessionals who want to earn a teaching degree.
In West Virginia, a new law now allows districts to count full-time behavior interventionists working in one or two classrooms toward meeting the required number of aides or paraprofessionals in K-3 classrooms.
Tooley noted that Pennsylvania and Alabama are experimenting with “menu-style” licensing flexibility — allowing candidates to demonstrate qualification through various combinations of GPA and test scores, rather than rigid cutoffs.
“These are people already in schools, often from the same cultural or linguistic backgrounds as students,” Tooley said. “They’re more likely to succeed and to stay.”
Low pay
A 2024 national survey by the EdWeek Research Center found that public school teachers are increasingly reporting declines in mental health, job satisfaction and classroom stability. Seventy percent of teachers recommended student mental health interventions, and nearly half said schools lack enough counselors, psychologists and social workers.
South Dakota rises to its highest-ever rank in teacher pay: 46th

As mental well-being has worsened, the share of public school teachers who are very satisfied with their jobs has also declined by 2 percentage points from the previous year, to 18%, according to the survey, which was conducted by the EdWeek Research Center on behalf of Merrimack College.
While teacher wellness supports remain limited, educators say improvements in pay and student discipline are the most needed changes.
To entice passionate but burned out educators from leaving the workforce, several states have raised minimum teacher pay. Arkansas boosted salaries to $50,000 statewide, and South Carolina raised starting pay to $47,000. South Dakota enacted a $45,000 minimum with yearly increases, and penalties for districts that fail to comply by 2026. Connecticut advanced a bill setting a $63,450 salary floor, while Indiana and others are eyeing further increases.
At the federal level, the proposed American Teacher Act seeks to establish a national $60,000 minimum salary for teachers at a qualifying school to boost recruitment and retention across the country. The bill, sponsored by U.S. Rep. Frederica Wilson, a Florida Democrat, remains in committee.

(Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)Ericka Helling is used to being attacked on the job. She’s been bitten, slapped, kicked.
“And that’s just a part of the day,” said Helling, a 27-year veteran nurse in the intensive care unit at M Health Fairview’s Southdale Hospital.
She considers herself lucky. Her coworker was punched in the face just a few weeks ago. More than one nurse she knows has had a traumatic brain injury from a workplace assault.
Often the violence comes from patients who are inebriated, delirious or in the midst of some other mental health crisis. Sometimes, it’s the patient’s family members. Last month, Helling’s hospital went on lockdown after a man visiting his mother pulled out a gun and struck his sister several times, according to court filings.
“We’re always concerned about what’s next, what’s coming, head on a swivel,” Helling said. “It’s not unique. Violence happens in every single hospital across this country.”
Health care workers are five times more likely to be seriously injured from an assault on the job than the U.S. workforce as a whole, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Nearly three-fourths of all nonfatal workplace violence is against health care workers.
The antidote, according to nurses, is more staffing. More eyes to spot problems before they escalate into violence, and more hands to respond when it does.
Union nurses with the Minnesota Nurses Association are intent on pressuring hospitals to commit to higher staffing levels as they negotiate labor contracts covering roughly 15,000 nurses at seven of the state’s largest hospital systems in the Twin Cities and Duluth areas: Allina, Children’s Minnesota, HealthPartners, M Health Fairview, North Memorial, Essentia and St. Luke’s.
The issue is so important to them, the union says, that nurses have ranked safe staffing above pay for the first time in their survey of members.
The union is becoming increasingly impatient and disillusioned with hospital leaders and the collaborative approaches like advisory committees they’ve won in past negotiations.
The contracts expire in May and June – and union president Chris Rubesch said a strike is on the table.
“We’ve been steamrolled. We’ve been ignored. So enough is enough,” Rubesch said, at a news conference earlier this month.
Ultimately they want strict nurse-to-patient staffing ratios to mandate a minimum number of nurses, which they argue will protect nurses as well as patients, who are facing rising rates of adverse events.
But staffing ratios have been a nonstarter for hospital leaders in negotiations. Hospital leaders argue staffing levels must remain a management decision because it allows them to respond to hour-to-hour changes in staffing needs. They say having to meet strict nurse staffing ratios would drive up the cost of care and force them to sideline lower paid workers like nursing assistants in order to meet quotas for registered nurses.
Looming over current negotiations are potential drastic federal funding cuts to Medicaid, which threaten to strain hospital finances, which leaders say are only just recovering from the COVID-19 pandemic.
Rubesch, the union president and a cardiac nurse at Essentia in Duluth, said his employer proposed stripping language from their contract that says staffing decisions cannot be based solely on budget concerns.
“Ask yourself why they are striking that language, if only so that they can staff to the budget and not to the patient’s needs,” Rubesch said.

Hospital leaders note that they’ve been able to hire many more nurses since the COVID-19 pandemic led to a wave of departures from the health care industry.
“Contrary to claims of a widespread nursing shortage and declining interest in hospital-based careers, the data tells a different story. Hospitals across the Twin Cities are seeing strong momentum in nursing workforce stabilization, with double-digit declines in RN vacancy rates over the past year,” wrote Paul Omodt, a spokesman for the hospitals in negotiations, in an email.
Nurse vacancies more than quadrupled during the COVID-19 pandemic — from 3% in 2020 to over 14% in 2022 — as burnout drove health care workers out of the industry. The vacancy rate is now down to 11%, according to the latest workforce survey by the Minnesota Hospital Association of most hospitals in the state.
The hospital association noted that just 2 in 5 registered nurses are working full time, a record low, which suggests the workforce shortage could be eased if nurses picked up more hours.
Nurses counter that the exhausting shifts with managers scheduling too few nurses on duty make a full-time schedule unsustainable. Plus, nurses say hospitals prefer to hire them part-time because managers can cancel their shifts when they believe the hospital is overstaffed without having to pay their wages.
“Hospitals aren’t hiring people at full time … because they want control over their staffing,” Helling said.
A recent search of open jobs for bedside registered nurses at M Health Fairview hospitals showed less than a third were for 0.8 full-time equivalent or greater. At Children’s Minnesota, only about a quarter were full time. At HealthPartners, just 1 in 5 open hospital nursing positions were full-time.

For over 30 years at the bargaining table and the state Capitol, the nurses union has been fighting for a greater say in hospital staffing levels. Over that time, staffing has only gotten worse, nurses say.
Three years ago, 15,000 nurses walked off the job for three days at 15 hospitals in what was then the largest private-sector nurses strike in U.S. history. The union won the highest pay increases in two decades – about 18% over three years — but negotiated only modest concessions from hospital leaders on staffing.
Minnesota nurses are the highest paid in the country after accounting for cost of living, earning about $94,830 per year on average. The union boasts that’s in large part their doing, and say those higher wages help attract and retain nurses who provide nation-leading care.
After the 2022 strike, the nurses union turned to the state Legislature and got as close as they’ve ever been to staffing ratios. In 2023, the DFL-controlled House and Senate passed a bill that would have required hospitals to create committees made up of nurses and management to set staffing levels. The bill was gutted in the final hours of the legislative session, however, after Mayo Clinic threatened to move billions in future investments out of state if it became law.
What was left of the bill included requirements that hospitals create procedures for health care workers to request additional staffing if they’re worried about safety, and to document those requests and submit them to the Department of Health along with written action plans on workplace violence. Beginning Jan. 1, 2026, the Department of Health must also publish an annual report on the state’s hospital nursing workforce.
Nurses struck out on staffing levels again at the Legislature again this year, having pushed for their ideal, no compromises proposal that would have set rigid nurse-to-patient ratios.
After their legislative defeat in 2023, nurses elected a new set of leaders that promised a more confrontational stance toward management and a strategy focused on organizing and public pressure campaigns rather than dueling with employers over grievances through legal briefs.
The current negotiations with 13 hospitals is the first major contract fight for the new leadership, who would seem to be at least as willing as their predecessors to lead their members to the picket line if they fail to win any concessions on staffing at the bargaining table. They’re also asking for increased security protections and more paid time off if they’re injured on the job.
Nurses opened negotiations seeking 18% pay raises over three years, while the hospitals started with 6%.
The nurses’ focus on staffing to improve patient outcomes and reduce the risk of violence is backed up by research.
Patient deaths and hospital readmissions were also found to be higher when fewer nurses were on duty, according to a study of New York hospitals by researches at the University of Pennsylvania. The researchers estimated that more than 4,000 lives and $720 million could have been saved over the two-year study period if hospitals were staffed with 1 nurse per 4 patients rather than the average of 1 to 6.
A study of Illinois hospitals similarly found patient deaths and hospital stays increased as nurses were given more patients to care for.
As for violence, OSHA lists understaffing, high turnover and long wait times as risk factors for violence, all of which are plaguing Minnesota hospitals, nurses say. OSHA also says working alone and in isolated areas contribute to the potential for violence.
“We deserve the right to go to work and be safe and return home in that same safe condition,” Helling said.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/NN250507_0058-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-05-21 09:05:25.180065

(Photo by Mitch Diamond/Getty Images)The Utah Department of Agriculture and Food announced it has up to $2 million in low-interest loans available to help farmers who are struggling due to drought. 
The department issued a news release on Tuesday to raise awareness of the availability of the loans through the Emergency Disaster Relief Loan program. 
State officials said loans are available to eligible agricultural producers in 17 counties named in an executive order Gov. Spencer Cox issued last month due to drought, including: Beaver, Carbon, Emery, Garfield, Grand, Iron, Juab, Kane, Millard, Piute, San Juan, Sanpete, Sevier, Tooele, Uintah, Washington and Wayne counties.

Eligible farmers can apply for seven-year loans of up to $100,000 each, with two years of no interest and 2.75% interest thereafter, according to the department. Applications for the loans will be accepted until Oct. 23. 
“Utah’s agricultural producers are on the front lines of drought impacts, facing difficult decisions as water scarcity threatens crops, livestock, and long-term viability,” Commissioner Kelly Pehrson said in a prepared statement. 
“We recognize the tremendous strain drought places on farm families and rural communities, and the Utah Department of Agriculture and Food is committed to doing everything we can to help,” Pehrson added. “This loan program is just one of the tools we’re using to support producers through this crisis and keep our agricultural economy strong.”
As of May 13, almost the entire state of Utah remains “abnormally dry,” according to the U.S. Drought Monitor. Areas in southern Utah including Washington County are in “extreme drought,” while other rural counties on the southern, eastern and western sides of the state face either severe or moderate drought.

State officials with the Utah Department of Agriculture and Food urged farmers to visit the state’s website to learn more about the program and how to apply. 
“These funds are only available for agricultural producers to address declared disaster-related losses and cannot be used for any value-added projects,” the website says. 
To be eligible, the department says:

All losses and expenses submitted for funding must be documented.
Loan funds may only be used to cover losses related to the official disaster declared. 
Loan funds may only be used to cover losses not already covered by indemnity, insurance, or other compensation.
Eligible losses and expenses will be further defined in application information provided specific to the declared disaster.

Additionally, state officials encouraged farmers to also contact their local USDA Farm Service Agency office to explore other available federal drought assistance options.
They also referred farmers to the state’s drought resources website, which provides updates on available financial resources and how to access them. 
“We understand the challenges that drought conditions present, and we are committed to providing the necessary resources to help Utahns navigate these difficult times,” the website says. It also encourages all Utahns to “focus on water conservation efforts to help mitigate the impacts of the drought.”

She made a name for herself nationally in 2014 when the Obergefell v. Hodges case – which eventually legalized same-sex marriage nationwide – was on appeal, and allowed a short window for states to recognize those marriages for the first time before the case was finalized. Byrum opened her office to those couples and performed one of the first same-sex marriage ceremonies in the state.
Byrum also served in the Michigan House of Representatives for six years before being elected to as the Ingham County clerk in 2012, and previously owned and operated an Ace Hardware store in Charlotte for nearly 20 years.
  Rep. Barb Byrum speaks on the House floor in 2012 | Facebook
“I’m running for Secretary of State because I believe elections should be fair, secure and accessible for voters today and in future generations, and that Michiganders deserve an exceptional customer service experience at every Secretary of State office,” Byrum said in a statement. “For more than 20 years, I’ve served the public as a state legislator and as a County Clerk, and I’d be honored to continue serving the people of Michigan as the next Secretary of State.”
Byrum is a longtime advocate for voters’ rights and routinely uses her social media pages to explain complex election matters, especially in the wake of the 2020 election, when Republicans refused to accept the results of the presidential contest and fomented numerous unfounded election conspiracies.
In a news release announcing her campaign, Byrum said election officials like herself take pride in ensuring Michigan’s elections are secure and that every qualified voter has a chance to have their voice heard.
“I fight back against those who would seek to make it harder to vote and those who attack our democratic process because our democracy is worth fighting for,” Byrum said. “As Michigan’s next Secretary of State, I will ensure that Michigan will continue to run free, fair and secure elections, as we have these many years.”
Her announcement also came with an endorsement from fellow Democratic Genesee County Clerk-Register Domonique Clemons, who called Byrum “a leader among the clerk community and knows elections backwards and forwards.”
“She is the go-to expert for new clerks when they need assistance, and is always ready to support,” Clemons said in a statement. “Barb is a vocal advocate for voter rights and election integrity. She is steadfast in defending democracy against those who try to undermine our election process.”
Michigan campaign finance reporting documents show Byrum formed her candidate committee on May 15 with a reporting waiver requested, which typically means candidates plan to raise and spend less than $1,000 in the election cycle.
At present, Deputy Secretary of State Aghogho Edevbie is the only other name in the race on the Democratic side.
Michigan’s political parties nominate candidates for secretary of state and attorney general and do not participate in the primary process. Michigan Democrats will nominate a candidate for secretary of state at their state party convention in the spring of 2026.

(Alex Cochran for Alabama Reflector)He said a group of correctional officers beat him in a prison barbershop. The officers said it never happened.
But despite continued denials the officers used excessive force, the state agreed to pay $140,000 to a man formerly incarcerated at Bibb Correctional Facility in Brent who sued the officers after he suffered a broken hip in 2018. The officer identified as the primary aggressor in the complaint has been named in half a dozen excessive force lawsuits filed by incarcerated men in Alabama.
The lawsuit over the broken hip, filed by Koty Williams, is one of 30 civil rights complaints settled by Alabama Department of Corrections (ADOC) in 2023 involving payments to plaintiffs totaling $929,110. The vast majority of the lawsuits, 26 out of 30, were filed over claims of excessive force by officers inside Alabama’s overcrowded and violent prisons.


May 19: The Alabama Department of Corrections has settled over 90 lawsuits alleging corrections officers used excessive force, costing the state millions of dollars.
May 20: Even as the prison population has declined, use of force incidents in Alabama’s prisons have soared, and some corrections officers named in lawsuits alleging excessive force have not only held onto jobs, but been promoted.
May 21: The anatomy of one inmate’s allegations against a corrections officer, and the aftermath.
May 22: Who’s paying for these settlements? You are. Who’s getting the most money from this litigation? Attorneys defending corrections officers.


The findings are the result of an extensive examination of accounting data obtained from the Alabama Department of Finance detailing all payments made from the General Liability Trust Fund since 2020, as well as court records connected to trust fund transactions.
Williams, who was released from prison in 2023, said the settlement money he received represented the only shred of accountability he could obtain from the system.
But it did nothing, Williams said, to heal his emotional scars. The assault and injuries he suffered at the hands of officers, Williams said, left him feeling completely violated and led him to use opioids to manage the pain.
“They took something away from me, like my manhood,” said Williams, speaking by phone from a drug rehabilitation facility in California, where he had admitted himself after his release from ADOC. “It really messed me up.”
The Alabama Department of Corrections declined to comment on the case, or provide details on how Koty Williams sustained his injury, citing department policy. “The ADOC does not comment on pending litigation or confidential settlement negotiations and any resulting agreements,” wrote ADOC’s communications director Kelly Betts in an email response to a list of submitted questions. She added that settling a case is not an admission of wrongdoing.
His lawsuit was just one of hundreds against ADOC officers winding its way through the courts when it settled in 2023. But the details of Williams’ ordeal and ADOC’s response reflect the issues that led the U.S. Department of Justice to sue the state in 2020 over unconstitutional prison conditions: understaffing, inadequate supervision and the failure to hold officers accountable for abuse.
‘Please don’t hit me no more’
On the morning of Nov. 27, 2018, Williams was 25 years old, serving a sentence for second-degree assault and receiving stolen property, both drug-related convictions, according to state court records.
That morning, Williams said, he left his assigned dorm to go to another one, where he planned to register for a Christian-based reentry program called “Jumpstart.” While he was inside the dorm, ADOC’s “Correctional Emergency Response Team,” or CERT, rushed in, shouting for men to go to their assigned beds.
According to a deposition with ADOC attorneys, Williams said he quickly went to the only vacant bunk he saw, while the CERT members began a shakedown, searching the men, their bunks and their boxes of belongings. An officer patted Williams down, then sent him to the bathroom for a strip search.
While waiting to be strip-searched, Williams said he overheard officers in the dorm asking who slept on bed 2-B, the vacant bunk he’d gone to when the shakedown began. At first he didn’t answer, because he didn’t actually sleep there. But then Williams heard an officer calling his name.
“I’m right here,” he said, walking out of the bathroom.
According to the statement Williams later gave to an ADOC investigator, officers had found contraband items on the bunk, including two cell phones, a phone charger, and two syringes, along with Williams’ prison ID. CERT officers asked him about the items. Williams said they did not belong to him, that he didn’t do IV drugs and that 2-B wasn’t his assigned bed. According to a deposition Williams later gave to ADOC attorneys, a CERT officer, Sgt. Akeem Edmonds, told him to step out into the hall, then led him into the prison barbershop.
Williams said he was scared and did what he was told.
“These dudes are like people you see in weightlifting contests,” Williams said. “They’re huge.”
The primary assailant listed in Williams’ complaint was Edmonds, who said in a deposition that he is 6 feet, 4 inches tall and weighs 295 pounds. Williams is 6 feet tall and weighs 155 pounds.
Williams said at least four officers filed into the barbershop behind them. The barbershop, he said, is a confined space, “about 12 paces in there,” with a long wooden bench along one wall where men sit to wait for haircuts.
Williams said Sgt. Edmonds held up the syringe and asked him why he wasn’t owning up to it. Again, Williams denied it was his. Williams said Edmonds then punched him in the face and he fell to the ground.
In the deposition with ADOC attorneys, Williams said he remembered blood pouring out of his nose while several officers hit and kicked him as he lay on the ground. The officers, Williams said, shouted for him to get up, and Edmonds grabbed him by his waistband and the back of his shirt, and slammed his body down on the wooden bench. Williams said he knew then that he’d been badly injured.
“I told them, ‘Please don’t hit me no more,’” Williams recalled in his deposition. “’My leg is broke.’”










“I told them, ‘Please don’t hit me no more. My leg is broke.'”

He was unable to stand. Williams said one officer suggested that he tell people he got hurt by falling out of his bunk.
“He said, ‘You’re going to have to quit jumping off them racks. It’s not good for you,’” Williams told ADOC attorneys. Then, he said, the group of officers left him bleeding on the floor of the barbershop.
Williams’ account of the assault in the Bibb barbershop has never been corroborated by an employee of ADOC, and an internal investigation failed to substantiate the claim. But the Department never challenged that Williams was injured, or explained how Williams sustained his injuries.
The officers named in Williams’ lawsuit all denied the beating occurred, both in statements to ADOC’s investigator and depositions with Hank Sherrod, Williams’ attorney.
Edmonds initially told the ADOC investigator that during the shakedown, he found two syringes and Williams dnied that they belonged to him. Edmonds said he noticed Williams was walking with a limp, so he asked Williams what happened, but Williams would only say he’d been “jumped,” and would not tell Edmonds who was involved. Edmonds said he called for a wheelchair and took Williams to the infirmary to be checked out.
In a later deposition, Edmonds didn’t mention finding the syringes, but relayed a similar account that he’d previously told ADOC’s investigator, that he noticed Williams was limping during the CERT shakedown, and Williams told Edmonds he’d been “jumped.”
Edmonds acknowledged that he took Williams outside the dorm into the hallway and later pushed him in a wheelchair to the infirmary to be checked out. But he denied ever beating Williams in the prison barbershop. And even though Edmonds recognized Williams’ injuries were serious enough to need a wheelchair, he said that he never filled out an internal “incident report” that’s required when an incarcerated person is injured.
“I probably reported it up the chain,” Edmonds told Williams’ attorney in a deposition. But the captain who supervised Edmonds said in a deposition that he didn’t file a report about Williams’ injury either.
Williams said Sgt. Edmonds did place him in a wheelchair and transported him to the prison infirmary, but only after Edmonds had assaulted him. Williams said he wasn’t limping before the assault and Edmonds didn’t pull him aside or suggest he get looked at in the infirmary.
When the infirmary nurse asked Williams what happened, he hesitated.
“I didn’t want to talk about it right then because the guy that done (it) – the reason why I was how I was is because (of) the man standing in the room with me,” Williams later told ADOC attorneys.

The nurse explained that Williams had to give her a reason he was there in order for her to order testing. Williams said he eventually told her that Sgt. Edmonds had beaten him in the barbershop. He also told her he was in severe pain and couldn’t walk.
According to Williams, the nurse ordered an X-ray, and after it was done, sent Williams back to his dorm. He said the nurse never offered him any medication for pain, and he spent the next 24 hours in agony.
“If it wouldn’t have been for other inmates, I wouldn’t have made it,” he said.
Williams said other men in the dorm helped him get in and out of bed, and gave him the only relief available, a dose of contraband fentanyl. He said this moment triggered years of self-medicating and addiction that he’s still working to recover from.
“I already had a past of using opiates,” Williams said. “After they broke my hip, I just went downhill.”
Williams said the evening following the assault, he was called back to the infirmary. By this time, the pain in his hip was so bad he had almost passed out. The same nurse who examined him a day earlier told Williams they were sending him to the hospital for surgery. The X-ray showed a fracture in his hip that needed immediate intervention.
The technical diagnosis was intertrochanteric fracture on left hip, a painful break in the bone located in the upper part of the thigh, just below the hip joint, according to Williams’ medical records. A person with this injury cannot stand or put weight on the injured side, and it can take months to heal, according to the Orthopaedic Trauma Association.
The surgeon who treated Williams at Brookwood Hospital said in a deposition that he didn’t recall having a specific conversation with Williams about how he got injured, other than being involved in an altercation. The surgeon assumed the fight was with other prisoners.
“I don’t try to ferret out exactly the mechanism of injury because it’s somewhat irrelevant at that point,” he said.
During surgery, the doctor inserted an implant, which acted like an internal splint, stabilizing and supporting the broken parts of Williams’ hip.
Williams was returned to Bibb Correctional Facility the following day and spent two weeks in the prison infirmary. It was during this first week back that another man incarcerated at the prison called Williams’ stepmother and told her he’d been injured. She then called ADOC, triggering an internal investigation.

An investigation and a missing video

Ten days after Williams was injured, an agent with ADOC’s Law Enforcement Services Division (LESD) came to Bibb Correctional Facility and interviewed him in the prison infirmary, according to a document obtained by the Reflector. Williams told the investigator about the incident and named the officers involved. He also encouraged the agent to talk to prisoners in the dorm to corroborate his removal from the dorm and his return in a wheelchair with serious injuries.
The agent later said in a deposition that he couldn’t verify when Williams was injured, and that he “had no witnesses.” He also said that he didn’t take photos of Williams’ injuries, or visit the prison barbershop where Williams said the attack took place.
Williams had suggested to the ADOC investigator that surveillance video would show officers removing him from the dorm and taking him into the prison barbershop on the day he was injured. This video, if recovered, could have been crucial in making or breaking the officers’ stories. If ADOC’s own investigation found evidence of a crime, in this case felony assault, the case would be turned over to the local district attorney for prosecution.
ADOC’s agent in charge of the internal investigation requested the video, but days later received an email from the prison’s warden informing him that no such video existed.
The captain in charge of maintaining video at Bibb and investigating use-of-force incidents said in a deposition that he checked the camera in the dorm’s cubicle but did not find any footage of officers taking Williams out of the dorm. There was a separate camera in the bay of the dorm which also could have captured Williams with officers from a different angle that the officer said he did not check.
“I should have, but I didn’t,” he said in his deposition.
The captain also said no officer or supervisor informed him of any incident. He only learned that Williams was injured, he said, when the prison sent Williams to the hospital for surgery. The captain said in his deposition that he called the shift office after Williams was hospitalized and asked if the injury involved officers. He was told no. He asked the lieutenant to “look into it,” but there was never any follow-up.
Williams’ attorney, Hank Sherrod, pressed the ADOC investigator about the scant internal investigation during the deposition, asking if the officer lifted “even your little pinky finger” to interview witnesses.
“No,” the investigator replied. “Because no video.”











Because no video.


– ADOC investigator on why he did not interview witnesses to Koty Williams incident



But the investigator also could not recall a reason for why there was no video, only that Bibb Warden Deborah Toney informed him of this via email and that was the end of the conversation.
Williams viewed the ADOC investigation as part of a culture inside the department, in which protecting the institution is the priority. He felt that acutely when he tried to tell multiple officers, health care staff and an ADOC investigator about what happened to him.
“They all looked at me like I was lying,” he recalled. “I’m an inmate. My word ain’t s— to them.”
In its 2020 findings of excessive force in Alabama prisons, the DOJ wrote that inconsistent video collection and lackluster investigations contributed to ADOC’s culture of systemic excessive force. DOJ recommended the department install cameras in all areas where uses of force occur, implement video recording capacity and retain video for 30 days.
ADOC’s spokesperson Kelly Betts did not send a response to a question submitted via email asking if the department had followed these recommendations from the DOJ.

A half-dozen lawsuits

Williams isn’t the only incarcerated person to sue Edmonds for excessive force. According to federal court records, Edmonds was a named defendant in a half dozen lawsuits involving allegations of excessive force. Between 2018 and 2024, ADOC paid over $198,000 in settlements to end five lawsuits against Edmonds.
A review of Edmonds’ personnel file showed that former ADOC Commissioner Jeff Dunn attempted to demote Edmonds and then fire him. Both attempts were unsuccessful after Edmonds appealed his case to the state personnel board.
In 2020, ADOC conducted an internal investigation of a suspected excessive force incident and recommended that Edmonds be demoted.
“ADOC asserts that the employee used his duty belt to beat an inmate in the Classification area of the Bibb Correctional Facility, after it was determined the inmate had taken food from the staff refrigerator,” the disciplinary paperwork stated.
But Edmonds requested a review by the state personnel board, which held a hearing in May 2020.
The personnel director issued written findings that the evidence indicated Edmonds did not use excessive force, citing a lack of eyewitnesses who would testify that they saw Edmonds beat the man with his duty belt, and the reliance on a confidential informant who reported the assault. Although the man’s medical record indicated bruises and abrasions, the prison medical staff characterized the injuries as old or in “multiple stages of healing.”
The findings also cited an administrative employee of the prison who saw Edmonds holding a brown belt, and a psychological associate stating that she heard the incarcerated man say “I can’t get up sir. They’ve been beating on my chest for two days.”
The personnel director found Commissioner Dunn’s recommended demotion was unwarranted, and affirmed Edmonds’ status as a correctional sergeant.
A message seeking comment from Dunn was not returned.
In June 2021, Edmonds was arrested and charged with assault connected to the same incident. ADOC responded by placing Edmonds on mandatory leave and began the process of terminating him. But after a “pre-dismissal conference” in September, the state personnel hearing officer found Edmonds not guilty of excessive force.
In November 2021, Bibb County Assistant District Attorney R. Bryan Jones recommended dropping the assault charge due to lack of evidence, and a judge agreed. Edmonds was permitted to return to work at ADOC in January 2022.
Eight months later, ADOC promoted him to correctional lieutenant.
ADOC would not comment on this specific case, but confirmed that Edmonds still works for the department. The Attorney General’s Office has represented Edmonds in six excessive force lawsuits, but the office did not respond to multiple requests for comment.
Messages were left with an attorney for Edmonds, and with a family member of Edmonds, but there was no response.
Williams completed drug rehab and has returned to Alabama. He said he walks with a limp and experiences numbness in his leg that he attributes to his broken hip. He didn’t know about the other lawsuits against Edmonds and wondered why they didn’t result in more action by ADOC to prevent future assaults.
“How is he not fired?” he asked. “Did my case not prove enough?”

Erik Perkett talk with citizens at community event Monday. (Photo: Michael Lyle/Nevada Current)Hours before Clark County began removing unhoused people from tunnels under the Flamingo Wash, Clark County Commission Chair Tick Segerblom told nearby residents they might see an influx of people experiencing homelessness in their neighborhoods.
Though Segerblom pledged to “protect you guys and keep them out of your neighborhood,” there are still lingering questions about how many beds and shelter options were available to unhoused people living in the tunnels ahead of the encampment being cleared. 
The number of people experiencing homelessness in Southern Nevada, like across the country, has grown in recent years and there aren’t enough adequate shelter options or housing to address the underlying crisis. 
Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department officials and Segerblom told residents arrests and citations could be an option for those who refuse to move when the encampment is being cleared out. 
County officials along with LVMPD and HELP of Southern Nevada homeless outreach workers said on Monday that an unknown number of people living in the tunnels beneath the wash would be evicted this week in order to begin a $15 million Regional Flood Control project. 
“We are not sure what is going to happen but the concern is a large number of people in the tunnels are going to be forced out” of the tunnels and into the neighborhood, Segerblom said during a town hall Monday night.
Officials began clearing out the wash at 5 a.m. Tuesday. 
In Monday night’s contentious hourlong meeting, community residents angrily questioned the county’s response to homelessness and worried about an influx of unhoused people coming into neighborhoods. 
“Here is the reality,” Segerblom said Monday night. “We don’t have enough manpower. We don’t have enough rooms. We don’t have enough of anything. But we do have a wash where a lot of people live who come out into the neighborhoods. We are committed to making sure no one can get into that wash and live in that wash. It’s not going to happen tomorrow. It’s a process.”
Southern Nevada’s 2024 Point-in-Time Count, an annual snapshot of homelessness on one particular night, identified 7,906 unhoused people — a number officials and homeless providers agree is an undercount. Data showed that the number of people experiencing homelessness grew 20% from the previous year. 
Addressing underlying causes of the rise of homelessness and housing instability in the state was not the focus of Monday’s community meeting. 
Residents, instead, voiced frustration at the prospect of seeing more unhoused people in their neighborhoods, assuming that once folks are asked to leave the tunnels they will migrate to other areas in town. 
Community members also pressed for stronger enforcement by LVMPD and more jail time. 
Criminalization has been criticized by social service providers and homeless outreach workers who warn citations and arrests not only don’t address the underlying reasons people are homeless but impede unhoused people from getting connected to services, including housing. 
Segerbloom said officials will attempt to refer those displaced from tunnels to the noncongregate shelters the county has opened, in particular the Navigation Center, a 70-bed facility that is designed to temporarily house homeless adults without children.
During an interview, Segerblom acknowledged that the Navigation Center is typically at capacity.
“Let’s see if there is someone who says they want services and I’ll find a place,” Segerblom said.
Despite not having enough beds or adequate programs to refer unhoused people to in general, Segerblom said the county was ready to deploy another tool on Tuesday: arrest and citation. 
Clark County’s anti-homeless camping ban, which allows a person to be jailed up to 10 days and fined up to $1,000 for camping and sleeping in a public right-of-way, went into effect in February. 
The county passed the ordinance in November, months after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that cities could criminalize those experiencing homelessness even if they didn’t have enough adequate shelter space. 
LVMPD Lt. Erik Perkett told the residents Monday that officers are “absolutely arresting people and citing” unhoused people for violating the citation. 
A night in jail is estimated to cost about $135, according to estimates from Southern Nevada Homelessness Continuum of Care.
“Nobody wants to pay that for 5,000 people,” Segerblom said. One resident quipped, “don’t be so sure.”
Toward the end of the town hall, Lou Lacey, the director of the homeless response teams with HELP of Southern Nevada, tried to explain to the crowd the process of connecting people with services ahead of the county clearing out encampments. 
The organization had already been into the wash ahead of Tuesday’s scheduled abatement to warn residents to be cleared out and offer to connect them to a variety of services, Lacey said.  
He added that despite early interactions, some residents likely wouldn’t take assistance until the morning of enforcement. 
But if people accept services, Lacey said HELP will “take them to any substance abuse or mental health service” they request.
“These are still human beings,” Lacey said. “You can’t say ‘you’re going to go.’ We have to reason with them.”",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_0419-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-05-21 08:03:16.680896

(File/Getty Images)COLUMBIA — An extra $1 billion fell into legislators’ laps as they started budget negotiations Tuesday, making a budget process with few sticking points potentially even smoother.
Following a stronger-than-anticipated tax season for the state, along with continued increases in corporate income tax and sales tax collections, legislators will have an additional $669 million for one-time expenses and $377 million in recurring revenue, the state Board of Economic Advisors announced Tuesday.
Normally, such mid-year hikes occur before the chambers approve their budget plans. But the state’s revenue forecasters declined to recognize any surplus at its meeting last month.
However, with just six weeks left in the fiscal year, the board decided to officially increase its revenue estimates: The $669 million is most, but not all, of what’s flowed into state coffers above expectations through April and $377 million is the boost in projections for the fiscal year starting July 1.
Those “surprisingly good numbers” will make “a lot of what we’d be fighting over a lot easier,” said House Ways and Means Chairman Bruce Bannister, R-Greenville.
A six-member committee — three each from the House and Senate — is tasked with hashing out the differences in their chambers’ $14.4 billion budget plans.
The panel met publicly for about an hour Tuesday before staff mentioned the $1 billion adjustment, and the meeting adjourned. Talks resume Wednesday.
Some major parts of the budget package were already locked in before negotiations began. That includes $1,500 raises in the state’s minimum pay for teachers and an accelerated income tax cut (which completes a 2022 law that phased in rate reductions).
Other items are still up for debate.
For instance, the Senate put an additional $100 million into updating aging bridges across the state, while the House provided $200 million as the second installment of a five-year, $1 billion commitment sought by the state Department of Transportation. The Senate sent the DOT $25 million to cover clean-up costs of Hurricane Helene not paid by the federal government, while the House provided $35 million.
There are a number of projects at the state’s universities that one chamber funded while the other didn’t.
Other differences are in how the money’s spent. Both chambers, for example, put an additional $112 million into “state aid to classrooms,” which is meant for teachers’ raises. So, that amount is set. However, an adjustment in the way the House proposes to fund virtual charter schools could shift more of that total to traditional K-12 schools.
How the compromise committee might spend the additional $1 billion is not yet clear. Bannister didn’t give any specifics. And the Greenville Republican declined to name any particular possible sticking points.
Legislators already expected smoother sailing during this year’s budget process than in recent years, when disagreements over how much to spend on Clemson’s new veterinary school either stalled the process or derailed it for weeks.
The committee expects to reach a compromise by the end of the week, sending the spending plan back to both chambers for final approval by next Wednesday, said Bannister, chief budget writer for the House.
That leaves more time than usual before the fiscal year begins July 1. Budget negotiations normally carry into June, sometimes with only days to spare.
Much of the newly recognized money could be put into savings, adding to the $1.2 billion already in reserves.
“There’s enough money to cover everything, and then we will have money left over that we will not allocate in this budget cycle,” Bannister said.
Despite more revenue than expected coming in this year, the state’s economic forecasters warned the growth might not last. Although the state’s population and income are expected to continue growing, proposed tariffs could cause some businesses “to take a more measured approach to activity,” potentially taking a hit to state revenue, according to a news release.
Putting aside part of this year’s extra revenue for next year’s budget process could help offset some of those impacts, should they come, Bannister said.
“Certainly, it’s nice to have growing revenues and one-time money that’s not going to be spent this year to have a cushion in case something does come up in the next 12 to 24 months,” Bannister said.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/money-1024x678.jpeg,,,2025-05-21 09:05:25.180065

Crusading journalist Ida B. Wells published a column exposing the lynchings of African-American men and denouncing claims that the lynchings were meant to protect white women. 
Her anti-lynching campaign came after a mob killed three of her friends, who had reportedly opened a grocery store that competed with a white-owned store in Memphis. 
Upset by Wells’ writings, a white mob destroyed her presses and threatened to kill her if she ever published again. She left Memphis for Chicago, but she continued to expose lynchings, calling for national legislation to make lynching a crime. 
In 1898, she took her protest to the White House. 
“Nowhere in the civilized world save the United States of America do men, possessing all civil and political power, go out in bands of 50 and 5,000 to hunt down, shoot, hang or burn to death a single individual, unarmed and absolutely powerless,” she wrote. “We refuse to believe this country, so powerful to defend its citizens abroad, is unable to protect its citizens at home.” 
The National Memorial for Peace and Justice in Montgomery, which opened in 2018, features a reflection space in honor of her.

BPD officials fear that could all go away if the Trump administration continues to make funding cuts to the National Library Service.
The ALBPD is part of the Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS). IMLS received federal funding, which is funded federally, meaning the state does not give any funds to the accessibility sect of APLS. In March, President Donald Trump signed an Executive Order in March to dissolve the small agency.

Kelyn Ralya, the interim director of the Alabama Public Library Service, told members of the BPD Consumer Advisory Committee Tuesday that the agency cut its staffing from 77 employees to 12 this spring.
“That’s quite a cut there,” Ralya said. “Some of the folks that we know are still there, and so we at least have a good contact there.”
Beyond national leadership changes, Rhonda Napier, the regional librarian, said she is most worried about federal funding cuts. Ralya told the committee that federal grants were split into two distributions this year. She said they received the first part and are supposed to receive the second half soon. 
Twenty-one states sued the Trump administration in March in an attempt to delay funding cuts to IMLS and other smaller agencies. A federal judge stalled the dismantling of the agencies through the lawsuit on May 7, according to NPR.
“I do believe that department has been dismantled, or that’s what they’re going for,” Ralya said. “I’m not sure if it’s like that, as in, the funding goes to another source. We just don’t know that yet.”
Without grants from IMLS, Napier said, the ALBPD would disappear.
“Which means all of this goes away,” Napier said in an interview after the meeting, gesturing to long rows of shelves that have books in braille and audiobook tapes.
Napier said the service sends out tapes and book readers to its patrons for free, just like going to an in-person library with physical books. Each tape can hold up to eight books and plugs into the readers via USB port, which she said is a more modern version of a cassette tape. 
The library has a diverse selection of genres, from children’s books to textbooks on statistics. She said there are services that will translate books into braille, but it isn’t free like the library. She said the same of audiobook services like Audible and Spotify.
“All of it is paid for. This is a completely free service,” she said. “Audible, obviously, you have to pay for it, you have to download their software and install it. None of that occurs here.”
Ralya also talked about the recent firing of the Librarian of Congress Carla Hayden, along with the assistant director and the director of the copyright office. Todd Blanche, who represented Donald Trump during his 2024 criminal trial, replaced Hayden.
“That is very disturbing,” Penny Moss, vice chair of the committee said.

The utility, as part of its general rate case request for a 9% rate increase, is asking the Public Utilities Commission of Nevada to allow it to base electricity rates on the maximum daily demand customers place on the electricity grid, rather than all of the energy used in a month. 
Under the proposal for daily maximum demand billing, in addition to the $18.50 monthly service charge, the utility would determine the amount of energy consumed during a 15-minute period of peak usage each day, multiply it by four to determine an hourly rate, and charge .19 cents per kilowatt hour (kWh) during that hour, compared to the .11 cents per kWh it currently charges. 
NV Energy CEO leaving amid utility overcharging episode

A customer using 3.5 kWh during the peak would pay an additional $19.95 per month, according to testimony from Janet Wells, a regulatory vice-president for NV Energy.  
A customer using 5 kWh would pay $27 more per month, while a customer using 6 kWh would pay $38 more per month, according to data provided by Advanced Energy United, a trade group that represents renewable energy providers. 
Total usage during the monthly billing period would be irrelevant.
Demand charges are designed to reduce the strain customers put on the grid at late afternoon and early evening hours.
“If you get home at 5 p.m. and turn your air conditioning on, and run your dishwasher and turn on your lights from 5 p.m. to 5:15 p.m., that is what they’ll multiply to create your usage,” says Sheila Hallstrom of Advanced Energy United. 
The utility currently offers demand pricing as an option for residential customers, but is seeking to make the charges mandatory.  
Proliferation of rooftop solar is among NV Energy’s reasons for pursuing the maximum demand charge. By law, solar rooftop customers are charged rates “far below cost-based levels,” Jeffrey Bohrman, director of Regulatory Pricing and Economic Analysis for NV Energy testified before the PUC. 
The utility contends the charge will help lessen the burden on full-service customers who subsidize costs for those with solar panels. 
“That’s not necessarily accurate,” says Hallstrom “I think it’s a way to raise rates on all customers and disincentivize customers from continuing to invest in solar and other distributed energy resources.” 
The move also “penalizes customers that have already taken advantage of the independent energy opportunities in Nevada,” Hallstrom said during an interview Tuesday. 
NV Energy contends its $18.50 monthly service charge for Southern Nevada customers is inadequate. Given its unsuccessful effort last year to triple the service charge in Northern Nevada to $45, the utility is proposing the demand charge for residential and small commercial customers in the south. 
The utility says the demand charges allow it to more accurately price its services, while offering consumers flexibility in controlling their use.  
“The better reflection of cost causation through effective price signals results not only in increased equity among customers, but also communication with customers about how their behavior affects costs,” Bohrman said.
“Not a single utility across the country is doing this,” says Hallstrom, adding that regulators in other states have rejected similar proposals from other investor-owned utilities. “Part of the reason is because it’s too complicated for people to really understand. NV Energy’s reasoning is that customers will be able to change their energy use, but they can’t necessarily do that if they don’t understand their bills.” 
The complexity of the rate is “very often relied on by opponents of residential demand charges,” Bohrman testified, adding the argument can “be misleading to decision makers.” 
Should the PUC turn down the proposal, NV Energy wants to increase the basic service charge in Southern Nevada from $18.50 to $24, far less than the projected increase of maximum demand charges. 
The PUC is holding the first of several consumer sessions on June 4. If approved, demand charges would go into effect April 1, 2026.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/GettyImages-1354801894-scaled-e1709075152312-1024x735.jpg,,,2025-05-21 09:05:25.180065

It's a corporate giveaway. (Photo: iStock/Getty Images)As a proud Nevadan and Lake Tahoe resident who cherishes our public lands and forests, I feel compelled to speak out against the so-called “Fix Our Forests Act” (FOFA). Don’t let the title fool you! This federal legislation is no fix. In fact, it’s a reckless attempt to hand over the keys to our national forests to corporate logging interests under the guise of wildfire prevention. If passed, FOFA would open the floodgates to massive, unchecked logging projects that threaten the very landscapes we hold dear in Nevada and across the country.
Let’s start with the most alarming piece: FOFA would enable a Trump executive order to ramp up commercial logging across nearly 60% of America’s national forests. This is not hyperbole. It’s a direct result of language in FOFA that weakens environmental protections and strips the public of its voice in managing these lands. The bill allows agencies to bypass crucial environmental laws like the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and the Endangered Species Act (ESA). Incredibly, it even permits NEPA reviews to happen after logging projects have already been completed, undermining the entire purpose of environmental oversight.
It gets worse. FOFA dramatically expands the size of “Categorical Exclusions” (CEs), administrative loopholes that allow certain forest projects to dodge public review and environmental study. Under FOFA, logging operations up to 10,000 acres (15 square miles) could move forward without any public input. To put that into perspective, that’s roughly the size of more than 7,500 football fields, cleared without so much as a town hall meeting. That’s not forest management, that’s a corporate giveaway.
The bill also advances a deeply flawed narrative: that commercial logging and grazing are effective wildfire mitigation strategies. The science says otherwise. Study after study has shown that the most effective ways to protect communities from wildfire involve local measures, like creating defensible space around homes, hardening buildings against fire, and developing emergency response plans. FOFA includes no funding for these proven strategies. Instead, it funnels energy and attention into large-scale commercial logging, which may actually increase fire risk by removing old-growth trees that are naturally more fire-resistant.
Here in Nevada, we understand the value of healthy, resilient ecosystems. Our forests aren’t just scenic backdrops. They’re critical to our water supplies, our recreation, and our identity. The Fix Our Forests Act threatens that balance. It’s a Trojan horse for deregulation, designed to sideline science, slash public involvement, and clear the way for extractive industries. Worse yet, it aligns directly with recent moves by the Trump administration to prioritize timber extraction over environmental stewardship. Just days before FOFA was introduced in the Senate, Trump’s Secretary of Agriculture released a memo implementing an executive order to massively expand logging across federal lands.
This is the same administration that has gutted staff at the U.S. Forest Service and slashed funding for wildfire prevention. If President Trump and the U.S. Congress truly cared about protecting communities, we’d see investments in firefighter support, forest restoration, and climate resilience, not just more clear-cutting. Instead, his executive order and FOFA combine to create a dangerous one-two punch: under-resourced forest agencies forced to chase arbitrary timber targets, at the expense of meaningful wildfire mitigation.
Let’s be clear: climate change, not tree density, is the root driver of the catastrophic wildfires we’ve seen across the West. Rising temperatures, prolonged drought, and increasingly erratic weather patterns are drying out our forests and setting the stage for firestorms. Logging our way out of this problem is not just shortsighted, it’s counterproductive. More logging won’t bring back the rain. What we need is bold, climate-smart leadership that prioritizes long-term forest health and community safety over short-term industry profits.
Unfortunately, Congresswoman Susie Lee (NV-03) and Congressman Mark Amodei (NV-02) cosponsored FOFA in the House, and Congressman Steven Horsford (NV-04) voted for the bill. Congresswoman Dina Titus (NV-01) was Nevada’s lone “nay.” The bill will now make its way through the U.S. Senate and Nevada’s senators haven’t yet revealed how they plan to vote.
Whether we’re talking about FOFA or Trump’s executive orders, the bottom line is the same: this is an attack on our public lands. These are lands that belong to all of us, not just the timber lobby or political donors. Nevada’s senators, and senators across the country for that matter, should reject FOFA in its current form. We need our representatives to stop looking at our public lands with dollar signs in their eyes. Instead, they should champion legislation that supports fire-resilient communities through real solutions: funding for home hardening, local emergency planning, defensible space projects, and prescribed fire treatments guided by science and Indigenous knowledge.
We need forest policy rooted in stewardship, not exploitation. Nevada deserves better, and so do the forests we all depend on.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/GettyImages-2165258599-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-21 08:03:16.680896

The 2025 Vermont Teacher of the Year, she teaches English and History at Winooski High School.As a teacher, I do everything in my power to uplift student voices. I publish student’s memoirs, I celebrate student’s writing of their own short stories, I listen to impassioned students’ speeches about racial injustice, I create showcases for students to share their poetry and I read countless original poems and narratives by my student authors. I do this because I believe in the transformative power of the arts. I have seen firsthand a shy, reluctant student blossom into a captivating poet; I have seen the ripple effect of a student who finds their voice as a writer and then does well in their other classes and beyond high school; I’ve seen students who struggle in some academic areas, but when given a paintbrush or a trombone, excel. This is what the arts do: they create moments for our students to find themselves and their voice. Isn’t this what we want out of a high school experience? There are few things better in life than watching a child recognize the power of their voice. The arts give students an opportunity to do that. It thus pains me that all local arts organizations that I work closely with are experiencing the loss of federal funding. Vermont Arts Council, The Flynn, Vermont Humanities, the Governor’s Institute for the Arts, and Vermont Folklife Center all are scrambling to make up for the loss of money that they depend upon. Each one of these organizations creates moments for my students to know that their voice and that their expression matters. From organizing student matinees of diverse performances, to funding poetry workshops and competitions, to providing teaching artists in classrooms, to working closely with students to tell their family’s stories, the work of these organizations in our classrooms is vital and essential. The arts are never an add-on to our curriculum; they are a central component of what an inclusive classroom is.READ MORE
It’s really hard to be a teacher right now. The mental health crisis among our teenagers following the pandemic is ongoing while mental health federal funding is threatened, our profession seems to be constantly attacked and our federal department of education has been slashed, and the constant attack on creating classrooms and schools that celebrate diversity, equity, and inclusion is relentless. Yet, the thing is, I never lose hope because of our kids. Teaching is an act of hope every single day. The kids give me hope: their creativity, their genius, their resilience, their ideas, their perseverance, and above all, their powerful voices. In early May, I had the honor to travel to Washington, DC for the National Poetry Out Loud finals, sponsored by the the National Endowment for the Arts and the Poetry Foundation. While I expected this to be an amazing experience for my student, Mapenzi Selemani, who represented Vermont as the state champion and became a regional finalist, I was struck by the impact the few days had on me as a teacher. My knowledge in the power of poetry to help us honor the human experience and the power of words to change lives was affirmed again and again. And this is why we need you: we need Vermonters to unequivocally stand in denial of the Trump administration and make it known loud and clear that you also believe in the power of the arts. In Vermont, we believe that the arts are integral to our success and we support the arts in our full capacity. As Elizabeth Fascoia, executive director of the Governor’s Institute of Vermont, said, we must make our voices loud in our belief in the power of the arts to transform lives and our knowledge in how vital they are for our state, our future leaders and our economy. Our students need you, as Elizabeth said, but our teachers need you, too. We need your support to do this important work with our students.Read the story on VTDigger here:  Caitlin MacLeod-Bluver: Amid funding cuts, Vermont needs to support the arts.",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Commentaries_featured-image-25.png,,,2025-05-21 07:03:33.642427

Food shelves alone cannot provide enough food for entire families 365 days per year.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Susan Stock: Proposed SNAP cuts would hit Vermont hard.","Dear Editor,I joined the Shelburne Food Shelf over ten years ago when there were about 30 families coming for help. Over time, that increased to 40 or 45 households per month. During the pandemic, the number of households served grew to between 90 and 100 families per month. Today, that peak has turned into a high plateau with 130 families served each month.The increase is due to Inflation and to wages that have not kept pace with costs. Please remember, this is Shelburne, a relatively affluent town in Vermont; the census in less affluent towns is higher.Right now, the Congress is getting ready to vote on huge cuts to food aid in order to give tax breaks to billionaires. These cuts will leave children and families hungry — not food insecure — hungry. Food shelves alone cannot provide enough food for entire families 365 days per year. SNAP benefits 66,500 Vermonters and the cuts considered will shift $38 million to the Vermont state budget if Vermont can maintain the benefit. Experts say this shift is not sustainable. Our state covering this entire additional cost seems unlikely, given the current budget. Yet Congress appears willing to make these cuts. They appear willing to force hungry people to prove they are working; this is when many people that use food shelves cannot do that. They work in our cash economy as housekeepers or day laborers and, therefore, cannot provide pay stubs. Families are getting by on a day-to-day and week-to week basis. Nearly 35,000 Vermont SNAP recipients live in households with a person who is disabled or an older adult. These households have already been devastated by inflation and are likely to be further hurt when tariffs (a regressive tax on lower income individuals and families) flow through the system. The cuts go beyond SNAP (supplemental nutrition assistance program) and include further cuts to farm to school programs and even to food inspection and safety standards. Remember that 2 months ago the USDA slashed $500 million from the Emergency Food Assistance Program which will hurt food banks, the main supplier of food to local food shelves. Congress is making a choice to give tax breaks to the wealthiest rather than provide food to hungry Americans. This is unconscionable — and we will not forget.Susan StockFormer Shelburne Food Shelf board chair and current volunteerRead the story on VTDigger here:  Susan Stock: Proposed SNAP cuts would hit Vermont hard.",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Letters-to-the-editor_featured-image-25.png,,,2025-05-21 07:03:33.642427

Detainees often complain of violence, inedible food, limited programming and subpar healthcare. Lack of sunlight may be an unexpected addition to the list. But sunlight deprivation causes a myriad of serious issues, including high blood pressure, osteoporosis, and an increased risk of diabetes, as well as a host of mental health problems such as depression and sleep disorders. 
Jails built in the last century often have few windows and little room for recreation and natural light, making them “obsolete” by today’s design standards, according to Kenneth Ricci, prison and jail architect with Nelson Worldwide, a design firm.

Bringing sunlight and fresh air into jails often takes a back seat to other pressing issues. But a lawsuit in San Francisco suggests forcing detainees to live in the dark could violate their constitutional rights. In 2021, a group of men awaiting trial at two California jails sued the city and county of San Francisco for being confined without fresh air and sunlight.
U.S. Magistrate Judge Sallie Kim ultimately agreed with the men. In 2023, she ruled that the jails had violated the Constitution’s due process clause. The officials “created the problem by building a jail without a secured outdoor exercise yard and then relies upon that problem to claim that it cannot provide a secure way for inmates to have access to direct sunlight,” she wrote. 
These issues are top of mind for residents who have followed the closure of a jail in St. Louis, where detainees can go years without seeing the sun. The jails in all three cities have requirements to provide sunlight and fresh air, either mandated by jail policy, or by the state or federal governments. Yet all three have consistently fallen short, according to jail officials and state and federal inspection reports. 
City officials in St. Louis closed their crumbling older jail in 2021, but shuffling detainees into the remaining, newer jail hasn’t solved the problems. 
 St. Louis City Justice Center

  A photo shows shadows falling on the outside walls of a St. Louis jail building (Julia Rendleman for The Marshall Project).
When Darnell Rusan saw the sun for the first time in over a year, during a transfer from the city jail to the courthouse, he later recalled, he gazed up at it and took a deep breath.
“I hadn’t seen it in so long, breathed fresh air in so long,” said Rusan, who was released from jail in March. “I’m going to make sure I never go back in there.”
The St. Louis Division of Corrections stipulates in its official policies and procedures that every jail in the city “will have an outside exercise/recreation area for inmate use or an area that provides natural light.” In addition, all facilities must provide “a wide range of recreational program[s]” that includes indoor and outdoor exercise and leisure-time activities.  
However, the city’s downtown jail – the maximum-security St. Louis City Justice Center – doesn’t meet these requirements, conceded Interim Jail Commissioner Doug Burris. There is no outdoor exercise area and no windows in the cells, just a pane of glass in the door that faces the dayroom. 
Burris said in an April interview with The Marshall Project – St. Louis that, even on a bright summer’s day, “not much” sunlight makes it to people inside. Only a paltry amount of light filters through thick frosted windows at the top of a small rec area where, on a good day, detainees may spend a few hours. What’s more, he said, some people go years without access to the outdoors. 
“We’ve got 50 to 75 people in here that have been here for at least two years, up to five years,” he said. “We’re taking an abundance off their life.” 
Instead of lobbying to improve outdoor access at the jail, Burris said he is in the process of updating the jail’s guidelines to remove this requirement. The City Justice Center was designed without an outdoor recreation area. Fixing it would require finding the space in downtown St. Louis to construct a secure outdoor yard, or building one on the roof – both extremely costly, said Ricci, the architect at Nelson Worldwide.  
Burris believes the lack of opportunities for recreation and exercise is harmful. “To house people at the facility in excess of a year likely exacerbates mental health issues for detained people already afflicted,” he wrote in a 2025 operational review of the jail. “It also could create mental health issues for those who previously had none.” 
Rusan was detained awaiting trial for more than four years. Over the course of his stay, Rusan said he was often unable to tell the difference between day and night. As a result, he suffered disruptions in his sleep that continued well after he returned home.
“That place is like a basement,” said Rusan, who was ultimately found not guilty. “Now that I’m home, [my family has] been asking me why I keep waking up at night.”
Understaffing also means sections of the jail are on lockdown for 23 hours a day, meaning that many detainees are “not even going to the indoor rec area,” said Khanika Harper, a member of the city’s detention facilities oversight board. “As far as actual sunlight, they don’t have access to that at all.” (Burris confirmed in April that roughly half of the pods in the jail are on 23-hour lockdown.)
With the demolition in March of the Workhouse, St. Louis’s former medium security jail, Burris said the city’s focus is on improving conditions at the Justice Center. But improving access to natural light and fresh air were not on Burris’s list of immediate action items, which includes redesigning the jail intake area, getting a tablet for every detainee and creating a mentorship program and retention plan for jail staff. 
However, he said he hopes increased staffing and a “rocket docket” (that allows people who have been detained longest to get their case quickly before a judge) will ameliorate the worst effects.
“I would like to get to a place where we could even get some vans and go pick up trash, just so they could be out in the sun,” he said. “But I’ve got more immediate needs right now.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/250520-SUNLIGHT-GKim-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-05-21 07:03:33.642427

(Madelyn Hanes/Indiana Capital Chronicle)The first five graduates from Purdue University Global Law School took their new attorney’s oath Tuesday morning, marking a milestone for both the school and Indiana’s legal system. 
At the ceremony held at the Indiana Roof Ballroom, the Indiana Supreme Court admitted 68 new attorneys, including the Purdue Global Law graduates. 
The ceremony was attended by all five justices of the Indiana Supreme Court, as well as judges from the U.S. District Courts for the Northern and Southern Districts, the Indiana Court of Appeals, and the Indiana Tax Court. 
The ceremony follows a July 2024 amendment to Indiana’s Rules of Admission and Discipline Rule 13 that allowed graduates of non-American Bar Association accredited, Indiana-based online law schools to sit for the Indiana bar exam. 
It was meant to address the state’s justice gap in rural or other underserved areas.
This amendment made Purdue Global Law graduates eligible to sit for the bar exam upon graduation. At the time, California was the only other state that allowed such eligibility.  
Indiana currently has a lawyer shortage. Indiana Court of Appeals Chief Judge Robert Altice told the graduates Tuesday that out of 6.8 million Hoosiers, only 19,055 are lawyers. 
“You are joining a very special group today,” Altice said. “As less than 1% of our total population, I encourage you to think about a small specialized group you are.” 
All five eligible Purdue Global Law graduates passed the February Indiana Bar Exam on their first attempt. According to Indiana Bar exam result data, Indiana’s overall pass rate for first time takers is 63%. The graduates are:  

Joud Elias
Lindley Jarrett
Jeff Kraft
Daniel Stahoviak
Abby Strehle

Strehle is a nurse practitioner, mother and now dual-licensed attorney in both Indiana and California. She attended Purdue for her undergraduate degree 26 years ago and received a Bachelor of Science in Nursing from the University of Indianapolis. Following that she completed her Master of Science and became a licensed Nurse Practitioner. 
Strehle said she always had an interest in law so she returned to Purdue Global Law’s fully online program. She completed her law degree in August 2023 while continuing to work in healthcare and raising her family in Bargersville, Indiana. 
“I wasn’t willing to give up my nights or time with my kids for a traditional law school,” she said.

Strehle, the owner and founder of Encompass Legal Services, now practices disability law in all 50 states. She said she wanted to take her experience in the medical field into the legal one. 
“I’ve seen the other side,” she said. “I know what people are going through when making either end-life decisions or something that disrupts their entire life.” 
She said that her online law school experience was far from easy but she was able to make connections and even some close friends online. She said the courses are set up in similar formats including course work, weekly zoom meetings and breakout sessions. 
Strehel said the Indiana Supreme Court amendment that created the path for Purdue Global Law graduates to become eligible for the bar exam means everything to her. 
“When I applied to Purdue Global, I only hoped that being licensed in Indiana would be a thing,” she said. “The fact that I can be licensed in Indiana allows me to really do what I want to do and the reason why I did what I wanted.”
Dean of Purdue Global Law School, Martin Pritikin called the moment “a turning point” for access to justice. Pritikin was a professor and administrator of a traditional law school for 12 years before he became interested in online education. 
Purdue Global Law — previously called Concord Law School — was founded in 1998 and was one of the nation’s first fully online law schools. Pritikin said the school operates at one-third of the cost of traditional programs and is designed for nontraditional students – working professionals or others who need flexibility. 
“Our typical student is not someone who went straight from high school to college to law school,” he said. “Even though they may be new lawyers they are not new to the workforce.”
Pritikin said the curriculum at Purdue Global is as “rigorous” as anything someone would get at a traditional law school. He said that people think the school is easy because it’s online, but that’s not the case. 
Pritikin said the Indiana Supreme Court “took a chance” on Purdue Global, and hopes the school is a big part of solving the access to justice crisis. He noted more than half of the students enrolling are not from Indianapolis — they are from rural, small and underserved areas. 
The school currently has 78 Indiana-based students enrolled — about 10% of total enrollment.
“It’s the best way to get more lawyers in underserved areas and to make it easier for people in those areas to stay where they are to attend law school.”

Just one year ago, JD Vance was a leading advocate of the Great Lakes and the efforts to restore the largest system of freshwater on the face of the planet.
As a U.S. senator from Ohio, Vance called the lakes “an invaluable asset” for his home state. He supported more funding for a program that delivers “the tools we need to fight invasive species, algal blooms, pollution, and other threats to the ecosystem” so that the Great Lakes would be protected “for generations to come.”
But times have changed.
This spring, Vance is vice president, and President Donald Trump’s administration is imposing deep cuts and new restrictions, upending the very restoration efforts that Vance once championed. With the peak summer season just around the corner, Great Lakes scientists are concerned that they have lost the ability to protect the public from toxic algal blooms, which can kill animals and sicken people.
Cutbacks have gutted the staff at the Great Lakes Environmental Research Laboratory, part of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Severe spending limits have made it difficult to purchase ordinary equipment for processing samples, such as filters and containers. Remaining staff plans to launch large data-collecting buoys into the water this week, but it’s late for a field season that typically runs from April to October.

In addition to a delayed launch, problems with personnel, supplies, vessel support and real-time data sharing have created doubts about the team’s ability to operate the buoys, said Gregory Dick, director of the NOAA cooperative institute at the University of Michigan that partners with the lab. Both the lab and institute operate out of a building in Ann Arbor, Michigan, that was custom built as NOAA’s hub in the Great Lakes region, and both provide staff to the algal blooms team.
“This has massive impacts on coastal communities,” Dick said.
Multiple people who have worked with the lab also told ProPublica that there are serious gaps in this year’s monitoring of algal blooms, which are often caused by excess nutrient runoff from farms. Data generated by the lab’s boats and buoys, and publicly shared, could be limited or interrupted, they said.
That data has helped to successfully avoid a repeat of a 2014 crisis in Toledo, Ohio, when nearly half a million people were warned to not drink the water or even touch it.
If the streams of information are cut off, “stakeholders will be very unhappy,” said Bret Collier, a branch chief at the lab who oversaw the federal scientists that run the harmful algal bloom program for the Great Lakes. He was fired in the purge of federal probationary workers in February.
The lab has lost about 35% of its 52-member workforce since February, according to the president of the lab’s union, and it was not allowed to fill several open positions. The White House released preliminary budget recommendations last week that would make significant cuts to NOAA. The budget didn’t provide details, but indicated the termination of “a variety of climate-dominated research, data, and grant programs, which are not aligned with Administration policy” of ending “‘Green New Deal’ initiatives.”
An earlier document obtained by ProPublica and reported widely proposed a 74% funding cut to NOAA’s research office, home of the Great Lakes lab.
Vance’s office didn’t respond to questions from ProPublica about how federal cuts have affected Great Lakes research. The White House also didn’t respond to messages.
Municipal water leaders in Cleveland and Toledo have written public letters of support on behalf of the lab, advocating for the continuation of its work because of how important its tools and resources are for drinking water management.
In a statement to ProPublica, staffers from Toledo’s water system credited the Great Lakes lab and NOAA for alerting it to potential blooms near its intake days ahead of time. This has saved the system significant costs, they said, and helped it avoid feeding excess chemicals into the water.
“The likelihood of another 2014 ‘don’t drink the water’ advisory has been minimized to almost nothing by additional vigilance” from both the lab and local officials, they said.
Remaining staff have had to contend with not only a lack of capacity but also tight limits on spending and travel.
Several people who have worked in or with the lab said that the staff was hampered by strict credit card limits imposed on government employees as part of the effort to reduce spending by the Department of Government Efficiency, which has been spearheaded by presidential adviser Elon Musk.
“The basic scientific supplies that we use to provide the local communities with information on algal bloom toxicity — our purchasing of them is being restricted based on the limitations currently being put in by the administration,” Collier said.
NOAA and the Department of Commerce, which oversees the agency, didn’t respond to messages from ProPublica. Neither did a DOGE official. Eight U.S. senators, including the minority leader, sent a letter in March to a top NOAA leader inquiring about many of the changes, but they never received a response.
The department described its approach to some of its cuts when it eliminated nearly $4 million in funding for the NOAA cooperative institute at Princeton University and emphasized the importance of avoiding wasteful government spending. ProPublica has reported on how the loss of research grants at Princeton and the more significant defunding of the NOAA lab it works with would be a serious setback for weather and climate preparedness.
A number of the staffing losses at the Great Lakes lab came when employees accepted offers of early retirement or voluntary separation; others were fired probationary workers targeted by DOGE across the government. That includes Collier, who had 24 years of professional experience, largely as a research professor, before he was hired last year into a position that, according to the lab’s former director, had been difficult to fill.
A scientist specializing in the toxic algal blooms was also fired. She worked on the team for 14 years through the cooperative institute before accepting a federal position last year, which made her probationary, too.
A computer scientist who got real-time data onto the lab’s website — and the only person who knew how to push out the weekly sampling data on harmful algal blooms — was also fired. She was probationary because she too was hired for a federal position after working with the institute.
And because of a planned retirement, no one holds the permanent position of lab director, though there is an acting director. The lab isn’t allowed to fill any positions due to a federal hiring freeze.
At the same time, expected funds for the lab’s cooperative institute are delayed, which means, Dick said, it may soon lay off staff, including people on the algal blooms team.
In March, Cleveland’s water commissioner wrote a letter calling for continued support for the Great Lakes lab and other NOAA-funded operations in the region, saying that access to real-time forecasts for Lake Erie are “critically important in making water treatment decisions” for more than 1.3 million citizens.
In 2006, there was a major outbreak of hypoxia, an issue worsened by algal blooms where oxygen-depleted water can become corrosive, discolored and full of excess manganese, which is a neurotoxin at high levels. Cleveland Water collaborated with the lab on developing a “groundbreaking” hypoxia forecast model, said Scott Moegling, who worked for both the Cleveland utility and Ohio’s drinking water regulatory agency.
“I knew which plants were going to get hit,” Moegling said. “I knew about when, and I knew what the treatment we would need would be, and we could staff accordingly.”
The American Meteorological Society, in partnership with the National Weather Association, spotlighted this warning system in its statement in support of NOAA research, saying that it helps “keep drinking water potable in the Great Lakes region.”
Collier, the former branch chief, said that quality data may be lacking this year, not just for drinking water suppliers, but also the U.S. Coast Guard, fisheries, shipping companies, recreational businesses and shoreline communities that rely on it to navigate risk. In response to a recent survey of stakeholders, the president of a trade organization serving Great Lakes cargo vessels said that access to NOAA’s real-time data “is critically important to the commercial shipping fleet when making navigation decisions.”
Because federal law requires NOAA to monitor harmful algal blooms, the cuts may run against legal obligations, several current and former workers told ProPublica. The blooms program was “federally mandated to be active every single day, without exception,” Collier said.
The 2024 bloom in Lake Erie was the earliest on record. At its peak, it covered 550 square miles. Warming temperatures worsen the size and frequency of algal blooms. While the field season was historically only about 90 days, Collier said, last year the team was deployed for 211 days.
As the shallowest of the Great Lakes, Lake Erie is typically first to show signs of problems. But it’s also an emblem of environmental stewardship, thanks to its striking recovery from unchecked industrial pollution. The lake was once popularly declared “dead.” A highly publicized fire inflamed a river that feeds into it. Even Dr. Seuss knocked it in the 1971 version of “The Lorax.” The book described fish leaving a polluted pond “in search of some water that isn’t so smeary. I hear things are just as bad up in Lake Erie.”
But the rise of agencies like the Environmental Protection Agency and NOAA, and labs like the one protecting the Great Lakes, along with legislation that protected water from pollution, led to noticeable changes. By 1986, two Ohio graduate students had succeeded in persuading Theodor Geisel, the author behind Dr. Seuss, to revise future editions of his classic book.
“I should no longer be saying bad things about a body of water that is now, due to great civic and scientific effort, the happy home of smiling fish,” Geisel wrote to them.
Early this year, headlines out of the Midwest suggested that “Vance could be a game-changing Great Lakes advocate” and that he might “save the Great Lakes from Trump.”
A 2023 report to Congress about the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative, a popular funding mechanism for projects that protect the lakes, including the research lab’s, described the lab’s work on harmful algal blooms as one of its “success stories.” Last year, with Vance as a co-sponsor, an act to extend support for the funding program passed the Senate, but stalled in the House. Another bipartisan effort to reauthorize it launched in January.
Project 2025, the plan produced by the Heritage Foundation for Trump’s second term, recommended that the president consider whether NOAA “should be dismantled and many of its functions eliminated, sent to other agencies, privatized, or placed under the control of states and territories.”
NOAA is “a colossal operation that has become one of the main drivers of the climate change alarm industry,” the plan said, and this industry’s mission “seems designed around the fatal conceit of planning for the unplannable.”
“That is not to say NOAA is useless,” it added, “but its current organization corrupts its useful functions. It should be broken up and downsized.”
When asked at his confirmation hearing in January if he agreed with Project 2025’s recommendation of dismantling NOAA, Howard Lutnick, head of the commerce department, said no.
One month later, the Great Lakes lab’s probationary staff got termination notices. That includes Nicole Rice, who spent a decade with NOAA. A promotion made her communications job vulnerable to the widespread firings of federal probationary workers.
In recent testimony to a Michigan Senate committee, Rice expressed deep concern about the future of the Great Lakes.
“It has taken over a century of bipartisan cooperation, investment and science to bring the Great Lakes back from the brink of ecological collapse,” Rice said. “But these reckless cuts could undo the progress in just a few short years, endangering the largest surface freshwater system in the world.”

It’s the shock and awe of Democrats and progressives that confuses me. 
Did anyone expect the Republican-controlled legislature would do anything other than undermine voters, criminalize reproductive health care and oppress workers? After all, these actions reflect their strong brand. 
What have progressives done to prevent the carnage unfolding yet again? Protesting in the statehouse, signing petitions and rallying in the streets only work if there is a strategy fueling those actions. 
As a long time left-flank campaign strategist, I’m here to tell you: strategy requires analysis. Analysis demands facts. And facts are hard to confront. But if there’s one thing I know about Missourians (I’m a born and bred one myself), it’s that we can do hard things.
So, what happened this year just months after abortion and workers’ rights sailed to voter-approved victories? 
Missouri ballot measures embody a tactics hungry progressive movement devoid of strategy. If the working class reality in our state is a wound, ballot measures are mere band-aids. What we need are antibiotics — strategies that target the systems that infect poor, working class and rural communities, and disproportionately the people of color among them. 
Now with the first legislative session after Amendment 3 and Prop A under our belts, this landscape has gone septic. An abortion and trans health care ban will be back on the ballot. At the stroke of the governor’s pen, paid sick leave that voters approved will be repealed and minimum wage could remain inadequately stagnant. 
The facts of how we got here so quickly after these November wins are hard to ignore and even harder to dispute. 
The campaign behind Amendment 3 in Missouri decided early on that the only path to success at the ballot was to prioritize GOP voters over their young, people of color base, as reported in The Nation just last week. Democrats across Missouri and nationwide took to the campaign trail selling a delusional promise — you can have your abortion and MAGA, too.
This single issue approach to bait MAGA voters into securing “reproductive freedom” also ushered in a new era of fascism.
Veteran polling firm Perry Undem released a post-election analysis that shows voters make decisions based on “who they believe sees them, understands them and represents their values — whether or not those values are expressed through specific policies.” 
A political strategy to win back progressive power in Missouri requires values that reflect progress — and trust that most Missourians, like all people, can move towards what is right and just if they have the information.
This means taking principled stances that help people navigate the complicated life challenges they face, and doing it radically, loudly and unapologetically. 
We have to educate people about how an abortion — sometimes later in pregnancy — can help a poor working class woman dig herself out of poverty and put food on the table for her existing kids. 
We need to defend the rights of transgender people and explain that if their marginalized identities can be targeted so, too, can yours.
You want affordable food? Then protect the immigrants who farm it. 
Worried your child won’t come home from school alive? Unseat the lawmaker who refuses to reform gun laws. 
And yes, that means primary the Democrats, too. 
Nationwide, nearly 90 million voters stayed home last year. Voter apathy is a real threat to democracy. If we want people to feel the ballot box is worth their time, they need to believe their votes matter. 
This requires electoral change.  
Direct democracy is a powerful tool, but as evidenced in Missouri, a useless one if we cannot elect lawmakers who will protect the change voters approve. Missourians deserve leaders who will implement radical strategies at the temperature needed to burn fascism to the ground. 
From one engaged Missouri voter to another: demand nothing less if you truly want your vote to stick.",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/051525_workersrally10-1024x614.jpg,,,2025-05-21 07:03:33.642427

 Health officials celebrated the progress in reducing opioid deaths and cited public health interventions. But a treatment recovery director warned the data could be misleading.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Vermont opioid overdoses fell in 2024 for the second year in a row.","Vermont’s opioid overdose deaths fell for the second year in a row in 2024, hitting their lowest annual tally in four years, according to the latest opioid annual report from the Vermont Department of Health. The department reported 183 Vermonters died of opioid-related overdoses in 2024, compared with 236 deaths in 2023. The drop was paralleled by falling deaths at a national level, according to data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.Deputy Health Commissioner Kelly Dougherty said her team was happy to see the decline in deaths, but noted they remain high — higher than pre-Covid-19 pandemic levels and higher than in 2015 when then-Gov. Peter Shumlin raised alarms about a rising rate of overdoses in the state.Health officials had been encouraged by a drop in overdoses in 2019, only for the trend to reverse during the pandemic, when Vermonters saw their lives upended in a variety of ways. Recent years have also seen a continued rise in potent opioids like fentanyl and xylazine, often in combination with non-opioid drugs like cocaine. The Vermont Health Department and substance use organizations across Vermont have fought back by aggressively expanding access to naloxone, a medication that can reverse opioid overdoses and prevent them from becoming fatal. Dougherty said the department has distributed naloxone throughout the state, making it available online, in schools, at job sites and even in a few vending machines. The department has also widely distributed fentanyl and xylazine test strips and co-created the VT Help Link, a “one-stop shop” to access services and treatment. Dougherty said these initiatives are reflective of a shift toward seeing opioid use and substance use disorder as a medical condition that can be targeted with harm reduction strategies. Vermont has a handful of community organizations that distribute clean syringes. The state legalized safe injection sites in 2024, but the first site in Burlington is still in the planning stage. READ MORE
There are limitations to the overdose data. Dougherty said deaths are falling, but little is known about whether fewer Vermonters are using opioids or have substance use disorders. Tracie Hauck, executive director of the drug recovery group Turning Point Center of Rutland, said focusing on death data alone could be misleading. “From what I see in our community, things aren’t any better,” she said. “Crime is picking up again. You’re seeing people that are struggling health wise and have no place to live and are using substances.”Hauck said a lack of supportive transitional housing for Vermonters in recovery is a gap that can make it hard for people to stay sober. “A lot of people we’ve sent to rehab are homeless to begin with,” she said. “So if they don’t go to a transitional living program after they complete rehab, they’re back out on the street and there’s no housing for them.”People without stable housing often find themselves in “survival mode,” leading them back toward substance use, Hauck said. “People don’t have phones. They don’t have reliable transportation. They don’t have stable housing, so they’re just in survival mode continuously,” she said. “And that doesn’t lead to real, good, solid recovery because their stress level continues to be so high.”Hauck said a more holistic approach to substance use disorder is needed that incorporates a person’s mental and physical health, housing, and interactions with the criminal justice system. Dougherty echoed the need for more transitional housing along with “step-down” facilities that can help rehabilitate people after their initial medical withdrawal. Both urged Vermonters to look past their assumptions and judgements about drug use and consider the human beings affected by the opioid crisis. “These are people — 183 people who were somebody’s loved one, somebody’s friend, somebody’s family member,” Dougherty said.Hauck said despite her reservations about focusing solely on deaths, she still favors harm reduction measures like naloxone that offer people more chances to seek help.“I am not anybody’s higher power to decide whether they should live or die, and I don’t think any other human being is, but I just know sometimes it takes a lot for someone to go through before they make that decision to get involved in recovery,” she said. Hauck said she has seen people on Facebook complain about the distribution of naloxone without considering the full implications of not having it available. Anyone can risk opioid overdose when drugs like cocaine are so frequently contaminated with them.“They’re not pausing and thinking about how tainted our supply is and how far that reaches, and to who that reaches to,” she said. “It’s not just people with substance use issues. It’s people that use recreationally.”Dougherty said she was concerned about potential changes to the health care system being discussed at the federal level. Congress and President Donald Trump are working on legislation that could lead to Medicaid cuts. The Trump administration has proposed cuts to the U.S. Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration. None of the Vermont Department of Health’s harm reduction services rely on federal funding, Dougherty said. But Medicaid pays for many substance use services in Vermont, so the department is worried about cuts overall, she said. “We’re just bracing generally at the health department, beyond substance use, because it’s like a full-out attack on public health,” she said. Read the story on VTDigger here:  Vermont opioid overdoses fell in 2024 for the second year in a row.",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/HUyTN-opioid-overdose-deaths-hit-four-year-low-1-1024x694.png,,,2025-05-21 07:03:33.642427

Would our next governor keep it or ax it?,"A New Jersey attorney general order bars local cops from cooperating with civil immigration enforcement. Would our next governor keep it or ax it? (Courtesy of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement)With Gov. Phil Murphy set to leave office in eight months, the future of his administration’s push to prevent local police from assisting with civil immigration enforcement is in doubt.
Since 2019, an Attorney General’s Office directive has prevented this kind of cooperation between New Jersey law enforcement and federal immigration agents. But Republicans running in June 10’s primaries want to ax that order, and at least one of the six Democrats in the race does, too.
This comes amid the backdrop of the second Trump administration, which has named detaining and deporting undocumented immigrants a chief priority and has targeted orders like New Jersey’s, called the Immigrant Trust Directive.
There are five Republicans vying for the party’s nomination to succeed Murphy, a Democrat, and the front-runners have the same position: repeal the directive and cooperate with the federal government when it comes to immigration enforcement.
There is more nuance on the Democratic side, where six are seeking the Dem nod for governor. Two want to keep the directive, one wants to lose it, and three want to give the order the force of law by passing a bill stalled in the Legislature called the Immigrant Trust Act. That measure would codify the directive and expand it to bar immigration enforcement activity at “sensitive locations” like schools and hospitals, and require public reporting on cooperation with federal agents.
Democrats
Newark Mayor Ras Baraka, Jersey City Mayor Steve Fulop, and teachers union chief Steve Spiller all support passage of the Immigrant Trust Act.
The immigration issue is close to home for Baraka, who has protested the opening of a new migrant jail in his city, Delaney Hall. Baraka, who alleges the building is operating without proper city permits, was arrested by federal agents at the facility on May 9 and accused of trespassing (the charge was dismissed Monday).
Baraka has fought back on what he says is criticism that he focuses too much time on protecting immigrants.
“You have people who say, ‘How is this our fight?’ And ask me, ‘Mayor, why are you protecting immigrants?’ Well, and I said it repeatedly over and over again, if you’re not from the Choctaw Nation, or the Lenni Lenape, if you’re not a Cherokee or Apache, then somebody in your family has come here undocumented,” he said during a courthouse rally last week.
Fulop said during an NJ Spotlight News debate last week that the time to pass the Immigrant Trust Act was when acting U.S. Attorney Alina Habba said she was investigating Murphy and Attorney General Matt Platkin over their support of the policy. Fulop said he’d sign the bill into law if elected governor.
“It speaks to the value of New Jersey. It speaks to how you view the immigrant community. It speaks to how they live their life in the community of Jersey City or Newark or wherever they reside, and that is an important starting point,” Fulop said.
Spiller, a former Montclair mayor, also supports codifying the directive and expanding its safeguards for undocumented residents. He has said he would appoint an attorney general who would protect immigrant communities.
He said he wants to “make sure our immigrants are not unfairly targeted through accessing data or locations where they should be in safe haven.”
Reps. Mikie Sherrill and Josh Gottheimer have expressed reservations about passing the Immigrant Trust Act, citing the potential for legal challenges.
At a recent event with Latino supporters at an Elizabeth supermarket, Gottheimer said he believes fighting for immigrants is “essential,” but the proposed legislation needs some “tweaks.”
“Right now, it doesn’t allow for violent criminals who are undocumented to not be here anymore, and I think not allowing for that is a huge mistake,” he said.
Sherrill, a former federal prosecutor, noted that the directive has already withstood judicial review (a federal appeals court rejected a challenge to it in 2021). She said she worries that taking additional action would allow for a new challenge that could make it to the U.S. Supreme Court.
“I also share concerns raised by a wide range of people that the bill must be clear about criminal consequences for those who commit violent offenses,” she said in a statement to the New Jersey Monitor.
Former state Sen. Steve Sweeney wants to repeal the directive altogether. He said it “doesn’t do anything but give false hope” to undocumented immigrants, and likened it to providing “sanctuary status.”
“If you came here as a criminal, you got to leave. If you break the law here, you got to leave. But Washington — and I’m sorry because this is where this lies — Washington has to come up with a pathway” to citizenship, he said during the NJ Spotlight debate.
Republicans
The Republican front-runners in the race clash plenty, but agree on repealing the directive. And none of them would sign the Immigrant Trust Act if passed by the state Legislature.
State Sen. Jon Bramnick (R-Union) said in an interview that he’d cooperate with the federal government, whether or not he likes the law. Bramnick added that he wouldn’t support any legislation that offers “sanctuary” protections.
Jack Ciattarelli, a former Assemblyman who is seeking the governor’s seat for the third time this year, said he’d repeal the directive on his first day in office.
“We are not going to have sanctuary cities and we’re not going to be a sanctuary state,” he told the New Jersey Monitor. “That only encourages illegal immigration. I said that in ‘21, we’re doing that again here in ‘25.”
Former radio talk show host Bill Spadea said he wants to repeal the directive and any other laws that protect undocumented immigrants, like the one that allows people without citizenship status to obtain driver’s licenses. Spadea said he’d declare a state of emergency for public safety on his first day in office to suspend these laws.
“We have the potential of criminal aliens who have been convicted in their home countries or accused of horrible crimes here lining up to get a New Jersey driver’s license. It’s not acceptable and it’s going to end by executive order,” he said following a campaign event in Seaside Heights. “And we’ll be happy to take that to court and fight it all the way.”
Mario Kranjac, the former mayor of Englewood Cliffs, said he doesn’t think it’s safe not to fully cooperate with federal agents, and said he’d “defund” municipalities that pass sanctuary ordinances.

(Kyle Pfannenstiel/Idaho Capital Sun)Southern Idaho’s water reservoirs are stocked up, signaling promise for this year’s irrigation prospects. 
But Idaho might need to rely on reservoirs more than usual this year, amid drier and warmer early spring months that have prompted faster snow melts with less streamflow runoff than expected, the Idaho Water Supply Committee heard from state water officials at its Tuesday meeting.
“My prediction is it’s gonna be a summer where we really dip into our reservoir system,” said Idaho Department of Water Resources Hydrologist David Hoekema, who chairs the committee.
About a quarter of the state is in moderate drought currently, he said, but officials might be underestimating drought conditions in some places.
Here’s how Idaho reservoir systems are fairing: 

The Owyhee River reservoir system is full.
Two other reservoir systems – along the Boise and Payette rivers – are expected to fill to 100%.
Officials expect the Upper Snake reservoir system to fill, or nearly fill, and it is now 88% full.
In eastern Idaho, the Henrys Fork system is 99% full, the Island Park Reservoir is 100% full, the Ririe Reservoir is 100% full and the American Falls Reservoir is 96% full.

Erin Whorton, a water supply specialist with the National Resources Conservation Service, said North Idaho’s mountain snowpack and runoff is in better shape than this time last year, when the region had one of its lowest snowpacks on record, the Idaho Capital Sun previously reported.
The Idaho Water Supply Committee is planning to meet again in early November.

(Leslie Bonilla Muñiz/Indiana Capital Chronicle)The Hoosier Lottery anticipates earning and spending slightly less than budgeted — but is still on track to deliver a hefty surplus payment to the state of Indiana. The five-member State Lottery Commission also easily approved its next business plan.
In a forecast revealed during a Tuesday commission meeting, revenues were expected to end the 2025 fiscal year on June 30 down by almost 4%.
But estimates for a trio of expenditures had decreased by even more: prize expenses by more than 4%, game and provider expenses by almost 5% and administrative expenses by a whopping 20%. The latter is due to how the lottery budgets for wages, plus “other savings,” Chief of Staff Carrie Stroud said.
The lottery’s contract operator, IGT Indiana, predicts it’ll still provide $352 million in net earnings to state coffers.

Because the incentive payment mark is set at $342 million, the lottery and its operator plan to split an anticipated $10 million in overflow instead of the $15 million budgeted. If the operator hadn’t cleared the $322 million minimum, it would’ve owed the lottery a shortfall payment.
In a year-to-date financial report for the 10 months ending April 30, surplus revenue to the state was on schedule — about $285 million.
Hoosier Lottery Executive Director Sarah Taylor said Powerball sales — “a huge favorite” in Indiana — were down here and nationwide.

“It’s just the nature of the game,” Taylor told reporters after the meeting. “You know, we have a year where it has huge jackpots and a year where it doesn’t. So nothing’s wrong with it.”
Worsening economic conditions may have contributed to scratch-offs’ almost $58 million underperformance when compared to the budget year-to-date.
“Folks may spend a little bit less on their entertainment dollars with us, and we respect and understand that and look forward to when they are returning to us,” Taylor said. “But we still offer a variety of price points. So even if they’d like to play at the $1 (price point), we’ve got some fun $1 (products).”
In its fiscal year 2026 business plan, the lottery hopes to net $352 million and gross about $1.6 billion — the same amounts it’s expecting to earn this fiscal year.
“We did take a cautious approach on, not only the draw games, but also on scratch,” Taylor said. “…  We want to make sure it’s the right fit for our players. We want to make sure the play style is fun and interesting, so we’ll be very flexible, like we were this year, into next year. And yes, we were cautious.”
Lawmakers recently killed a proposal that would’ve let the Hoosier Lottery establish interactive online gaming — likely raising overall sales.
“We’re 35 years old … And so, we’re selling the same product the same way,” Taylor told reporters.
“If the Legislature decides that it’s the right time to make that move, we’ll accept it and be happy to launch an iLottery program,” she continued. “In the meantime, we’ll do everything to bring home the monies that we’ve committed to bring to the state of Indiana, but look forward to maybe some additional modernization and innovation when it’s the appropriate time.”

(Photo by Michael Loccisano/Getty Images)As another school year ends, superintendents across the United States are staring down an autumn staffing crisis, with 1 in 8 teaching positions either vacant or filled by an underqualified educator.
States that are struggling with post-pandemic teacher shortages have spent millions to lure replacements and retain veterans with hiring bonuses and bumps in salaries. But hiring gaps remain, so some states also are trying another tactic: changing their standards.
The changes in teacher training and licensing come amid widespread turmoil in public schools: Tax revenue is being siphoned toward private school vouchers in many states; some classrooms are being scrutinized for banned books, displays or teaching lessons that trip into diversity, equity and inclusion territory; and students who went through pandemic-era shutdowns are struggling both with sitting still and with learning the material.
Some surveys show that fewer than a fifth of teachers are happy in their jobs.
“Teaching is not seen as an attractive profession right now,” said Drew Gitomer, an expert on teaching assessment at Rutgers Graduate School of Education.
“COVID exacerbated things, and teachers are caught in the middle of political battles — over curriculum, book bans, even personal attacks,” he said. “It’s not a healthy work environment, and that drives people away.”

Last year, Illinois enacted a law allowing teacher candidates to begin student teaching before passing content-area exams. It was an effort to reduce barriers for underrepresented groups, the measure’s sponsor said.
A bill under consideration this year would give more districts discretion over whether to factor pupils’ test scores into teacher evaluations, a break from a 15-year-old mandate.
In New Jersey, a new law formally removes the Praxis Core exam — traditionally used as an entry-level screening tool for aspiring teachers — from certification requirements.
And in Nevada — one of the states hit hardest by teacher shortages — a bill would streamline licensure for incoming educators. The bill would allow teachers credentialed in other states to begin working in Nevada classrooms while awaiting formal approval.
It also would remove extra steps for teachers switching grade levels and would waive application fees for recent substitute teachers.
Linda Darling-Hammond, founding president and chief knowledge officer of the Learning Policy Institute, a nonpartisan think tank, said teacher shortages hit hardest in schools serving low-income students and students of color, where instability often leads to larger class sizes, canceled courses or a revolving door of substitute teachers.
“When you walk into a school facing shortages, you see instability,” she said. “Students may be taught by people who don’t know what to do, who leave quickly, and who often rely more on discipline than engagement.”
The root cause? Teacher attrition.
“Nine out of 10 vacancies every year are because of attrition — and two-thirds of that is not retirement,” Darling-Hammond said. “Support in the beginning matters. Teachers who come in and get a mentor stay longer. If you’re just thrown in to sink or swim, the odds of leaving are much greater.”
States have long struggled to attract teachers, and credentialing changes aren’t unusual. But some education advocates fear long-term repercussions.
Melissa Tooley, director of K-12 educator quality at the left-leaning think tank New America, said most states now offer alternative and fast-track teacher certification pathways, many of which allow candidates to start teaching with little or no pedagogical training in how to teach.
“We’re churning through people who might have potential, but we’re not setting them up for success,” she said. “A lot of what states are doing is short term. It’s about filling seats, not necessarily building a sustainable or high-quality workforce.”
More than 40 states require aspiring teachers to take the costly Praxis Subject test for the subject they want to teach, which some experts argue excludes strong candidates and duplicates other assessments.
“You were excluding people who might be good teachers but didn’t do well on that specific test,” said Rutgers’ Gitomer, who has researched the test’s effects on recruitment.
However, he added, dropping tests doesn’t necessarily help.
Several states — Georgia, New Jersey, New York, Washington and Wisconsin — have dropped a licensure requirement known as edTPA since 2022, but there’s little evidence the move has helped ease teacher shortages, Gitomer said. (The acronym stands for Educative Teacher Performance Assessment and involves a portfolio that includes testing and videos of classroom performance.)
“The state eliminated edTPA but didn’t replace it with a specific alternative,” he said.
“Instead, it gave full discretion back to individual institutions to develop or adopt their own performance assessments,” he said. “When we talked to institutions, it became pretty clear they didn’t think removing edTPA would be a major driver in addressing the shortage — and they haven’t seen evidence that it has been.”
 How best to credential

Tooley said state credentialing systems must navigate a delicate balance: ensuring there are enough teachers, maintaining instructional quality and increasing workforce diversity.
“There’s this triangle — three pieces that need to be in place — and I think there are real tensions when it comes to how states are designing their certification policies,” she said.
And Gitomer described a fragmented national landscape, where some states are tightening teacher entry standards while others are dramatically loosening them — even allowing non-degreed individuals to teach.
“Some states are trying to raise standards; others are relaxing them to the point where you may not even need a college degree,” he said.
Indiana now requires all pre-K through grade 6 and special education teachers to complete 80 hours of training on the “science of reading,” a method that includes phonics, and pass an exam by 2027. State Sen. Jean Leising, a Republican, has proposed cutting the requirement in half, calling it “an excessive burden with little actual benefit” in a news release.
In Texas, a bill aims to reduce the use of uncertified teachers by the 2029-30 school year. The legislation would set a gradual cap on the percentage of uncertified teachers districts can employ in core curriculum classes — starting at 20% in 2026-27 and decreasing to 5% in 2029-30.
According to the Texas Education Agency, 31% of new hires in 2024-25 lacked a state teaching certificate or permit.
Yet some states stand out for how they’re changing their requirements, Tooley said.
She pointed to Washington, which has designed a recruitment strategy encouraging paraprofessionals, often known as teacher’s aides, to become classroom teachers. Also known as paraeducators, they’re a group with classroom experience, community ties and higher retention likelihood.
There, school districts are required to offer foundational training — ranging from 14 to 28 hours — directly to paraeducators.
In West Virginia, a new law now allows districts to count full-time behavior interventionists working in one or two classrooms toward meeting the required number of aides or paraprofessionals in K-3 classrooms.
Tooley noted that Pennsylvania and Alabama are experimenting with “menu-style” licensing flexibility — allowing candidates to demonstrate qualification through various combinations of GPA and test scores, rather than rigid cutoffs.
“These are people already in schools, often from the same cultural or linguistic backgrounds as students,” Tooley said. “They’re more likely to succeed and to stay.”
 Low pay

A 2024 national survey by the EdWeek Research Center found that public school teachers are increasingly reporting declines in mental health, job satisfaction and classroom stability. Seventy percent of teachers recommended student mental health interventions, and nearly half said schools lack enough counselors, psychologists and social workers.
As mental well-being has worsened, the share of public school teachers who are very satisfied with their jobs has also declined by 2 percentage points from the previous year, to 18%, according to the survey, which was conducted by the EdWeek Research Center on behalf of Merrimack College.
While teacher wellness supports remain limited, educators say improvements in pay and student discipline are the most needed changes.
To entice passionate but burned out educators from leaving the workforce, several states have raised minimum teacher pay. Arkansas boosted salaries to $50,000 statewide, and South Carolina raised starting pay to $47,000. South Dakota enacted a $45,000 minimum with yearly increases, and penalties for districts that fail to comply by 2026. Connecticut advanced a bill setting a $63,450 salary floor, while Indiana and others are eyeing further increases.
At the federal level, the proposed American Teacher Act seeks to establish a national $60,000 minimum salary for teachers at a qualifying school to boost recruitment and retention across the country. The bill, sponsored by U.S. Rep. Frederica Wilson, a Florida Democrat, remains in committee.

(Screenshot via WisEye) Wisconsin Republicans advocated on Tuesday for a bill to encourage filmmaking in Wisconsin through tax credits and a state film office. Another bill would declare that “gig workers” for app-based delivery services aren’t employees of a company.
During a Tuesday Senate Utilities and Tourism committee meeting, Sen. Julian Bradley (R-New Berlin) said SB 231 offers tax credits to encourage more films to be made in Wisconsin. Bradley described  a recent movie called “Green and Gold,” about a fourth-generation dairy farmer in Wisconsin who is on the verge of losing his farm and makes a bet on the Green Bay Packers to help save it. 
Bradley said the director of the film, Anders Lindwall, chose to make it in Wisconsin, but that decision meant a financial sacrifice as the director turned down a major studio offer to purchase his film. The studio wanted him to relocate production to Alabama — a state with film tax incentives.
“He turned down the offer to keep his project authentically Wisconsin,” Bradley said. 
Wisconsin had a film incentive for a brief time in 2010 under former Democratic Gov. Jim Doyle, though the Republican-led Legislature discontinued that program just a few years later. Now, Wisconsin is  one of only four states in the country without a film office and one of 13 without any film tax incentives. 
The bill would create new tax credits including one for 30% of the total cost of the salaries paid to employees who reside in Wisconsin and work in Wisconsin, one for 30% of acquiring or improving property and one for 30% production costs paid by a company to produce a film, video, broadcast advertisement or television production. A person’s total credits would be capped at $1 million for a fiscal year. The bill would also create a new State Film Office housed in the Department of Tourism that would implement the tax credits.
Rep. David Armstrong (R-Rice Lake) said having the rate at 30% would put Wisconsin in the top tier of states offering film incentives.
“How many of you like me flinch when you see the Georgia peach logo in the credits after a movie or TV show?” Armstrong asked at the hearing. “Do we want Illinois or Minnesota or Georgia to poach productions that could just as easily be shot in Wisconsin?”
Bradley said the bill “aims to make Wisconsin competitive by attracting filmmakers and productions through meaningful incentives, which in turn support local businesses, job creation, and increased tourism. Simply put, it would encourage filmmakers like Mr. Lindwall to choose Wisconsin, bringing their stories and economic activity to our state.” 
The bill has broad bipartisan support with cosponsors including Sens. Patrick Testin (R-Stevens Point), Chris Larson (D-Milwaukee), Romaine Quinn (R-Birchwood) and Brad Pfaff (D-Onalaska).
Sen. Melissa Ratcliff (D-Cottage Grove) expressed some concerns about whether the funding for the proposal would be included in the budget since it is not in the bill. Wisconsin lawmakers are in the progress of writing the next biennial budget and while Gov. Tony Evers included a similar proposal in his budget, it was pulled out along with more than 600 other items by Republican lawmakers on the committee.
“I have a motion to bring that back in,” Bradley told Ratcliff. 
“But if we pass this bill, it does not include the funding?” Ratcliff asked. 
“This bill does not have the funding. The funding would come through the budget… We’re going to fight real hard to try to get that funded,” Bradley said. 
According to fiscal estimates, the cost to state revenues would be at max $10 million. The new office would require three new positions in the tourism agency and would cost about $199,300 in 2026 and $254,000 in 2027. 
Film stakeholders testified in favor of the bill during the hearing. 
Paulina Lule, a Milwaukee native and an actress who recently starred in the MGM+ series Emperor of Ocean Park and has been in other shows including The Good Place and Scandal, told lawmakers that the bill would help people who want to showcase Wisconsin as it is in real life.
Lule said she has a film she has been working on called Sherman Park, which is about the neighborhood in Milwaukee. 
“I have had producers who have been interested in making this film as long as I make it not in Sherman [Park],” Lule said. “I don’t want to, and so this film has sat unfilmed for 10 years.” 
Lule said she recently began shooting a short film version in the Milwaukee park and was proud to be able to include a shot of the neighborhood’s name on a sign. She said that making films in Wisconsin would be a powerful way to promote the state and encourage people to visit. 
“Show off Racine. We can show off the real Green Bay, not just the Packers. There’s more to Green Bay than just the Packers as much as I love them,” Lule said. “You’re missing out on one of the broadest… ways of promoting the state is by having stories that are authentically about Wisconsin, made in Wisconsin… with actors in it that sound like they’re from Wisconsin.”
Michelle Maher, a River Falls movie theater owner, said that having movies filmed in the state would also provide an opportunity for local theaters. She noted that the movie Sinners, a vampire movie set in the Jim Crow South directed by Ryan Coogler and starring Michael B. Jordan, was filmed on-site in Clarksville, Mississippi.
“It was a town similar to the size of the town that I live in, River Falls,” Maher said. “Unfortunately, that town doesn’t have the movie theater that I have in my town… [Coogler and Jordan] got together and said, we are going to make sure this movie shows in this town, so they brought in a crew to be able to show that movie locally to the town that it was filmed at. What if there was a movie filmed in River Falls? Not only would I have a huge premiere for a regional area, I would have an annual event built in that would generate huge tourism opportunities and other ways to invent and reinvent that same wheel.”
Classifying ‘gig workers’ as non-employees
Lawmakers also considered SB 256, which would declare delivery drivers for app-based companies, including Uber and Doordash, are not employees of the company for the purposes of compensation insurance, minimum wage laws and unemployment insurance. The bill would allow “portable benefits” for those workers.
Bradley, the coauthor of the proposal, said the legislation is needed so that companies can provide benefits to workers without changing their “independent contractor” status. Under this type of benefit system, accounts are linked to a worker rather than the employer, meaning the benefits follow workers to other employment opportunities, and companies and workers would both be able to contribute.
“The gig economy is here to stay, and with it, the flexibility that many workers value and desire,” Bradley said. “Unfortunately, current laws prevent drivers from accessing crucial benefits. These include health care, paid leave and retirement savings. That’s the problem SB 256 aims to address. This legislation creates portable benefit accounts funded through contributions from the platforms based on drivers’ earnings. These accounts can be used by drivers to pay for a range of expenses, including health care, retirement, or coverage of loss of wages due to illness or an accident.” 
Lawmakers have considered the proposal before, including last session. The bill passed the Senate but never came up for a vote in the Assembly. 
The bill specifies that if an app-based delivery company doesn’t prescribe dates, times of day or a minimum number of hours during which someone must work; terminate the contract of the driver for not accepting a specific request for transportation or delivery service request; allow drivers to work for other companies; or restrict the driver from working in any other lawful occupation or business, then a driver is not considered an employee or agent of the company. 
“Previous versions of this legislation have garnered bipartisan support, and that support is only growing,” Bradley said. “It’s time we modernize our policies to meet the realities faced by thousands of Wisconsin workers.”
Sen. Jeff Smith (D-Brunswick) said he found it “embarrassing, disappointing” that the committee was considering the proposal. He said there is an “independent contractor travesty in this country.” 
“As an independent contractor, these workers know what they’re signing up for,” Rep. Alex Dallman (R-Markesan) said. “They understand that they’re on an independent contractor basis. They understand that they want to remain independent contractors.” 
Katie Franger, public affairs manager for Uber, told lawmakers that flexibility is the “fundamental reason” people choose the company’s platform for work. She said that the legislation would fit with this by allowing workers to have flexibility in benefits as well.
“Portable benefits allow each individual to choose what truly matters to them, ensuring resources are directed where they’re most needed,” Franger said. 
When Smith asked about why they couldn’t provide the benefits already, Addison DiSesa, legislative policy advisor for DoorDash, said “providing the benefits proactively jeopardizes the independence of these workers” and that the bill “empowers workers to get access to the benefits that they want while protecting their independence.” 
Maliki Krieski, a Ripon mother and Doordash worker, told lawmakers that she supports the bill because she wants to keep the flexibility that is part of the work currently. She said it allows her to take care of her child, who has diabetes.
“Our state system is outdated…,” Krieski said. “The one thing that stands between us and any form of health care incentive, retirement plan… The only thing that stands between us and that is the state law.”
Stephanie Bloomingdale, president for the Wisconsin AFL-CIO, cautioned that the bill seeks to create an exemption to current law and could be harmful to workers, who depending on the situation might qualify for certain benefits. She also pointed out that it doesn’t require companies to provide access to any benefits. 
“It exempts app-based delivery drivers from settled Wisconsin law concerning our workers compensation, minimum wage and unemployment insurance laws,” Bloomingdale said. 
Bloomingdale noted that to be considered an “independent contractor,” when it comes to worker’s compensation, workers have to meet a nine-part test, otherwise a worker is automatically considered an employee. The bill would replace this with the four-part test, which she said would be quite “minimal.” She noted that depending on the situation some workers could potentially qualify for worker’s compensation. 
A legislative council representative explained that “the default is that you’re an employee, and then there’s a nine factored test and that leads to a determination that you might be an independent contractor.” The bill, he said, would implement a “route that’s more streamlined for these app-based drivers.” 
“We oppose the bill because it does not guarantee any more or less flexibility for workers. It does not guarantee good wages and it does not guarantee benefits for workers in the gig economy. It does none of these things because the bill eliminates employee status for these workers and all the rights that come with that status,” Bloomingdale said. “The bill does not guarantee or require that these tech giants provide any benefits, portable or fixed.”
Bloomingdale said the bill would instead just “create special exemption for these powerful corporations at the expense of Wisconsin’s working men and women” and called the bill a “slippery slope.” 
“If this bill passes, we will be back here as those who do the bidding on international corporations come to this legislative body to similarly carve out a certain class of workers to evade state law and reclassify each group of workers one by one,” Bloomingdale said. “If these companies succeed in passing this bill, their low-pay, no-protection business model could expand in virtually every industry.”

(Photo courtesy of Raise the Wage Oklahoma)For more than two decades, I’ve worked in policy and advocacy in Oklahoma, standing alongside people from all walks of life to push for solutions when politicians have failed to act. 
I’ve seen a lot of change in our state — some for better, some for worse — but one thing that has remained consistent is this: when politicians ignore the will of the people, Oklahomans have always had a powerful tool to create change directly and solve the biggest problems in their lives — the right to the initiative petition process.
That right is enshrined in our state Constitution. Oklahomans believed then, as many still do now, that democracy should be more than just casting a vote every few years. It should be a living, breathing process where the people themselves can act when their elected officials won’t. And throughout the years both major political parties have relied on that principle.
Let’s not forget that it was Republicans who used the initiative petition process strategically to rewrite the political map — both in Oklahoma and across the country. In 2004, during President George W. Bush’s re-election campaign, Republican operatives pushed to put same-sex marriage bans on state ballots, including Oklahoma’s, to energize evangelical voters and give Bush a second term. 
It worked. The ban passed overwhelmingly, and Bush won reelection. It wasn’t just a political stunt — it was a calculated use of direct democracy to drive turnout and shape national outcomes at a time when his administration was under heavy fire over the Iraq War.
A decade earlier, when Democrats held firm control of the Oklahoma Legislature, Republicans turned to the initiative petition to bypass the majority. They led the charge to put legislative term limits on the ballot, and voters approved them. That single measure dramatically reshaped Oklahoma politics. Today, Republicans dominate both chambers and every statewide office. The very process some of them now seek to weaken is the same one that helped them gain power.
This is not a partisan issue. Initiative petitions have been used to address real problems ignored by politicians for years. Because of the Oklahoma people, we’ve expanded Medicaid, saving rural hospitals and increasing access to care for hundreds of thousands of Oklahomans. We’ve reformed our criminal justice system, pushed for school funding, and limited the growth of government.
That’s why efforts to cripple the initiative petition process, like Senate Bill 1027 are so dangerous. This bill would make it harder, if not impossible for everyday Oklahomans to bring forward and pass initiative petitions — adding red tape, impossible signature thresholds, and injecting partisan politics into the process.  It’s a direct attack on our constitutional right to govern ourselves when politicians won’t do their jobs.
Make no mistake: this isn’t about protecting the integrity of the process. It’s about protecting power — concentrating it among politicians and powerful special interests and keeping it out of the hands of the people.
Whether you’re a Republican, Democrat, or independent, this should concern you. Because once the door is closed to citizen-led change, we all lose. The issues we care about — health care, education, public safety, economic fairness — don’t belong to one party. And neither should political power.
For more than 100 years, Oklahoma has trusted its people with the power to act. Why now would we let short-sighted political maneuvering take our power away? Our future depends on protecting it.

Districts confront training decisions, costs, public sentiment as they set new policies for allowing firearms on school property.
The post As Wyoming gets rid of gun-free zones, schools wrestle with limited control appeared first on WyoFile .","In Campbell County, a place where nearly 90% of voters are registered Republicans, public schools already allow workers to carry concealed guns on school property. Still, the district found itself busy this spring revising those rules ahead of a new law poised to take effect July 1. Although Deputy Superintendent Kirby Eisenhauer described his district’s prior gun policy undertaking as a “good, healthy process,” he called the current situation a “serious matter” in “uncharted waters.”
Four hundred miles to the west, in Wyoming’s bluest community, the Teton County school district is also deep in writing a policy to allow civilians to carry guns — for the first time — in its schools. 
“I cannot vote for this item,” Teton County Trustee Kate Mead said at an April 16 school board meeting. “Some of this stuff calls for resistance, calls for us to say, ‘No. Here, we’re not going to let concealed carry in our schools. We’re not going to endanger our kids.’
“That’s our job,” Mead said. In addition to serving on her local school board, Mead is a rancher, attorney and the sister-in-law of former Gov. Matt Mead, a Republican who signed what had been the law of the land for guns in schools, until now.
The new law, enacted by the Wyoming Legislature this winter after multiple failed attempts in past sessions, does away with most gun-free zones in the state, including those in public schools. In preparation for it, school districts are now revising policies or drafting them for the first time, consulting lawyers and safety experts, calculating costs and seeking public feedback. While some school district boards propose adopting the state’s policy as is, others are working to beef up safety precautions related to the mandate as much as they legally can. 
The law punishes districts that don’t allow concealed carry. Teton County School District Superintendent Gillian Chapman called the penalties significant — a misdemeanor that carries a fine or jail time or both — for denying someone the right to concealed carry in a public school building. The district can’t ask visitors if they’re packing, she said. 
But the law does allow local school boards to develop rules and regulations dictating storage and training requirements for employees or volunteers possessing firearms on school property.
Chapman urged her board — despite Mead’s call to resist — to exercise that sliver of local control. The school board is considering three requirements for school staff and volunteers: possessing and maintaining a valid concealed-carry permit; following firearms training outlined by the district; and keeping firearms with them at all times or in concealed and locked containers.

Other districts are also setting their own training and storage requirements to enhance safety. While schools can’t ban concealed carry, the law does still allow districts to prohibit students from carrying guns and to ban open carry. 
Whether or not a district already allowed guns, school board members are critical of the Legislature for encroaching on local control. 
“I find it ironic that the Legislature took six pages of law to tell us how to use the right restroom when we don’t have a problem in using the right restroom, but they then took another 10 pages to tell us we can’t regulate guns on school grounds,” Campbell County Trustee Mark Christensen said. He referenced a new law that will require people to use the facility that corresponds to the sex they were assigned at birth, regardless of their gender identity, physical appearance or what appears on their legal documents. “The hypocrisy in that is next level.”
Targeting gun-free zones
Wyoming lawmakers have pushed for allowing firearms in schools since at least 2013. Bills to repeal some or most of Wyoming’s gun-free zones have been a mainstay in the Legislature, with new bills filed nearly every year over the past decade.
The first bill to become law in that vein came in 2017, when then-Gov. Mead signed a bill titled “School safety and security” into law. That bill authorized local school boards to adopt rules and regulations to allow school employees with concealed carry permits to possess a firearm on school property.
Over the last eight years, “only [a few] out of 48 districts have chosen to do that,” Wyoming Education Association President Kim Amen said. “So, we see that as an indication that there’s not a giant desire among school districts to bring guns into schools.” 
That bill’s passage was followed by pushes to repeal most or all of Wyoming’s gun-free zones from 2019 to 2021 and 2023 to 2025. This year, Gov. Mark Gordon allowed House Bill 172, “Repeal gun free zones and preemption amendments,” which does away with most of Wyoming’s gun-free zones, to go into law without his signature. 
Park County, home to the towns of Cody and Powell, sits midway between Teton and Campbell counties in northern Wyoming. Cody schools were among the first in Wyoming to give staff the option to carry concealed guns when the board approved a policy in 2018. Cody’s school leadership has been meeting with legal counsel to determine what changes are needed to align with the Wyoming Repeal Gun Free Zones Act, Superintendent Vernon Orndorff said.
Next door, Powell’s public schools considered giving staff the option to concealed carry in 2018, recalled Superintendent Jay Curtis. At that time, more than 100 people attended a forum at Powell High School and responses flooded in to surveys sent out by the district. Ultimately, the district decided against allowing concealed carry and instead opted for a comprehensive safety plan.
But the district took up the topic again last year, after Gordon vetoed a similar bill to repeal gun-free zones, warning that it would override historic norms of local control over firearms. Curtis advised his school board in March 2024 that it may be time to consider revisiting a concealed carry policy, honoring the governor’s veto message in favor of local board control.

Around that time the Powell board hired an Illinois-based safety and threat assessment team, West40, to audit the school’s safety plan, during which the consultant, a former school resource officer, said it would be more effective for schools to hire more school resource officers, if possible, than to arm staff. He said if schools do arm staff, policies and procedures need to be in place.
So far, public response to the new law has been muted at district meetings in Powell, although one community member spoke up at the safety audit presentation to urge a policy be adopted ahead of this year’s legislative session. The board is planning to discuss adopting a new policy at an upcoming work session. 
Limited control
In southern Wyoming, more than 50 community members, parents and educators attended an April 9 forum to discuss the new law in Albany County School District 1. 
“While I am happy to see the turnout that we have, I am disappointed with our reason for coming together,” said school board member Alex Krassin. “I personally do not feel like education settings with children need to have guns present outside of our highly-trained [school resource officers].” 
Krassin stressed that school board members are elected by Albany County residents, and the new law removes their authority to regulate guns on behalf of their voters. 
“Teachers should not have to be the law enforcement if an assault rifle is being used by an attacker,” said attendee Elise Hawk. “It’s difficult for even trained officers to make a difference.”
But school board member Nate Martin said that’s no longer the debate. 
“The conversation tonight is not whether or not guns in schools are a good or responsible thing. That ship sailed,” Martin said. “It is, what are we going to do now that the Legislature is forcing us to allow guns into schools under certain circumstances?”

But that didn’t stop Laramie High School freshman Faye Smith from expressing fear for her safety.
“I cannot fathom thinking that one day I might walk into school and be carried out in a body bag,” Smith said. “This is not a matter of left and right. It is for students. It is life and death, and I love my rights as an American, both the right to bear arms and the right to an education. And I know that you guys can’t do much about this, but I would really encourage using school resources such as double [metal] detectors at the entrances.”
Balancing safety and freedom
To the east of Albany County, neither Laramie County School District 1 or 2 currently allow concealed carry in their schools. While some parents seem excited to conceal carry in schools, several board members, teachers and community members are reluctant to develop a policy.
Laramie County School District 2 in Pine Bluffs is not pursuing its own policy, and does not anticipate any costs or community backlash. The law sets minimum requirements for firearm storage and training for school staff and volunteers if districts don’t adopt their own policies. 
Laramie County School District 1 trustees are split over how to safely allow guns in Cheyenne schools, and most see the new law as a government overstep. Trustee Barbara Cook, who said she is greatly opposed to guns in schools, sought increased training requirements for the district. But her attempt failed.
“To only require staff and volunteers to engage in the minimal training stated in the law is irresponsible,” Cook wrote in a letter that she described as her personal opinion and not a reflection of the board. Cook’s letter pointed to other districts that are requiring more rigorous training, including background checks and random drug tests.
“School shootings are chaotic, so to believe a minimally trained staff person can react in a tactical way while battling an armed intruder and keeping their students safe is ludicrous,” Cook wrote. 
Trustee Rene Hinkle also opposes guns in schools based on the hardship she’s witnessed as a doctor.
“As probably the only person up here on this dais who has been in an emergency room when a child has come in from an accidental shooting and died from a brother shooting them. It is devastating to a family. It is devastating to that child. It is devastating to the community,” Hinkle said. “It is unconscionable to think that there will be a gun in an elementary school, and that these kids, no matter how careful people are, can die.”
In Powell, Superintendent Curtis acknowledges that concealed carry in schools can conjure images of scary scenarios, which came up in discussions with his staff after the Legislature passed HB 172. But he points to a similar established law in Utah as an example. While there have been unattended firearms, there have been no shootings, Curtis said.
“You haven’t had instances where teachers are getting shot in parent-teacher conferences, and basketball coaches and players and parents and officials are not getting shot at basketball games,” Curtis said. “I don’t think we have a corner on the market for tense basketball games. And so all of these scenarios that we conjure up have not happened.”
Sheridan County School District 2 — covering 10 schools — is exploring its options and gearing up to answer the public’s questions during a June 9 board meeting. Board Chair Shane Rader — who also serves as the Wyoming School Boards Association Area 7 director and president-elect for the association — said the group recently sent a model policy to member districts. So, school boards are now able to look at the model policy and adapt it to meet their specific needs.
In Teton County, the district is considering partnering with the local sheriff’s office for firearms training. The sheriff signs off on all concealed carry permits issued in the county, Superintendent Chapman added. So the sheriff knows who is authorized, but he doesn’t know which residents from other counties have permits. 
The training would help identify which people will have a gun on school premises.
“We see this as an opportunity to ensure that individuals that do wish to concealed carry will have a highly skilled trainer from the sheriff’s department doing that training and supervising that training,” she said, which could also help mitigate insurance costs.
What are the costs?
Implementing the new policies will have costs. The Campbell County district’s insurance covers the public during an active shooter event, but doesn’t cover staff and volunteers with firearms. Adding that coverage will increase the insurance premium by an extra $20,000, trustees have been told. The district also will pay for training, psychological evaluations, background checks, drug testing and approved secure containers/lockboxes. Employees must pay for their own firearm and holster.
Likewise, Laramie County School District 1 is anticipating increased insurance premiums, according to Community Relations Director Mary Quast.
Cheyenne Teachers Education Association President Dylan Ford said the district is struggling to find insurance willing to cover gun-related injuries.
“Not just for staff, but for students,” Ford said. “In my eyes, we really need to make sure that our students are safe, that our staff is safe, and that if accidents do happen because of this law that they know that they’re covered for it.”
Laramie County School District 1 employees will be expected to fund their own training and purchase equipment to be compliant with the policy.
“There are very limited resources available from the state to support the implementation of this law,” Quast wrote in an email. “Without a clear and consistent funding source, the district cannot responsibly commit to covering these costs.”
Sheridan County School District 3 unanimously approved a training contract May 14 with Critical Training Concepts for $8,500 for staff firearms training. Board Chair Karis Prusak said the board thought it would be good for teachers and staff, who choose to carry, to have adequate training and feel comfortable.

Sheridan County School District 1 Business Manager Jeremy Smith said because the school district is a member of the Wyoming School Risk Retention Program, there will be zero effect on that district’s premiums or liabilities related to implementing a policy.
On Monday, the Wyoming Department of Education put out a statement indicating the agency can reimburse school districts for “expenses related to the possession of firearms on school property.”
A polarizing policy
In Casper, meetings about the policy have included hours of discussion and debate, followed by narrow 3-2 committee votes.
Natrona County School District 1 leaders have been focusing on establishing specific training and qualification requirements for employees and volunteers. So far, the district is proposing an initial course of not less than 40 hours of live-fire handgun training and 16 hours of scenario-based training, split between eight hours of scenario work and eight hours of medical training. Annual recurrent training would require at least eight hours of live-fire and eight hours of scenario-based training, incorporating elements like an active shooter drill and a law enforcement pistol course. Instructor qualifications require at least five years of relevant experience or documented certification.
Public feedback has varied, as seen in last Thursday’s comment on the proposed policy.
“This law is not about protecting children. It’s about taking away local control and turning our state into one where it is deemed normal for everyone to be armed,” said Melissa Behringer, who in February organized a protest against HB 172 as it headed to the governor’s desk and in April voiced her opposition to NCSD1 trustees.
“I hate it, and [I’m] totally against it, and I can’t believe we’re allowing guns in our schools,” said Nancy Allen, a grandmother and former Carbon County teacher of 40 years. Allen’s daughter is also a teacher. “Will the school be providing any liability insurance for teachers in case something would happen, like the gun falls out of your holster and it goes off and shoots the kid or shoots the principal or something?”
Two district employees, veteran Kip Marchant and self-described gun enthusiast Brad Cleverly, voiced support for the policy, although Cleverly found some of the training requirements “somewhat ambiguous,” and Marchant questioned the availability of local training options that provide the required 40 hours of training.
Amid the debate, district Board Policy Committee Chairman Michael Stedillie said that, whether the school board likes it or not, the issue is now “ours to face.”
“I wish we had not had to face this issue, but because we have no choice, you are the people that I want to face this issue with,” he said. “I know I just ended a sentence with a preposition, but thank you for your hard work.”

State’s top gas producer sees promise in data centers' insatiable energy needs and desire for low-emission power.
The post Digital gold rush could drive demand for Wyoming’s growing ‘low-carbon’ natural gas industry appeared first on WyoFile .","The data center boom continues in Wyoming, and the state’s natural gas industry may play an increasing role in powering the computing systems with electricity.
Wyoming’s largest natural gas producer, PureWest, says it’s getting into the data center power supply game and partnering with two other firms on a project near Evanston. For its part, PureWest must ensure its fossil fuel product will have minimal carbon emissions to meet data centers’ energy preferences. 
To do that, PureWest says it will obtain a globally recognized “low-carbon verification” certificate, which means the company has met the rigors of ensuring there are no rogue emissions in its natural gas supply chain, from its production wells south of Pinedale to the gas-fired power generators near Evanston.
The project will initially generate 150 megawatts of electricity, then scale up to 1,200 megawatts, delivering the power to at least one data center developed by Prometheus Hyperscale, according to the companies.

One megawatt is enough electricity to power about 750 homes.
Frontier Carbon Solutions, which is partnering with the U.S. Department Energy and the University of Wyoming on a “large-scale” commercial carbon storage hub near Granger, will capture and permanently store the natural gas generator carbon emissions.
“We’re very excited to help bootstrap these [data center] projects with verified low-carbon natural gas,” PureWest CEO Christopher Valdez told WyoFile.
Though the project partners are not required by state or federal law to certify the natural gas as low carbon, or to capture and store the gas-fired generator emissions, Valdez said, it’s what data center customers demand. And PureWest wants to be a player in the market.
“It’s going to be tied to the requirements of the ultimate consumers — the clients of this data center,” he said. “It’s a demand pool, and it’s specific to our local markets.”
Other companies
Anschutz Corporation, whose subsidiary is building the $5 billion Chokecherry Sierra Madre wind energy project in Carbon County and the $3 billion TransWest Express transmission line to connect it the Southwest, quietly rolled out a tentative plan in April to also add 3,200 megawatts of gas-fired generation and a 1,000 megawatt solar generation facility, according to a filing with the state.
The Seminoe Generating Station and the Walcott Generating Station would power “one or two” data center clients, and could include “on-site carbon capture and storage,” according to company statements and information on Anschutz subsidiary Power Company of Wyoming’s website. All of the facilities would be located in Carbon County. So far, there are no formal data center partners to announce, a company spokesperson told WyoFile.

Mark Gordon and Nevada Office of Energy Director Dwyane McClinton participate in a groundbreaking ceremony June 20, 2023 for the TransWest Express transmission line in Carbon County. (Dustin Bleizeffer/WyoFile)
Sierra Club Wyoming Chapter Director Rob Joyce estimates the natural gas plant would be among the largest in the U.S., and his organization is concerned about greenhouse gas emissions and other airborne pollutants.
“We don’t have assurances that they’re actually going to capture [and store] the emissions like they’re saying,” Joyce told WyoFile. “I’m always skeptical about that kind of thing.”
Not all environmental groups are skeptical of this market-driven trend. 
Jonah Energy, which also produces natural gas in the Pinedale Anticline in west-central Wyoming, was among the first in the state to gain a low-carbon verification for its natural gas. The Environmental Defense Fund has worked with Jonah and other oil and gas operators for years to support the installation of equipment and best practices that prevent leaks of methane — a potent greenhouse gas.
“Wyoming’s natural gas producers have a real opportunity to lead in a global market looking for lower-emissions energy,” EDF Regulatory and Legislative Manager John Rutecki told WyoFile via email. “If Wyoming wants to stay competitive in powering next-generation industries like data centers, those efforts must be backed by robust, transparent emissions measurement and verification and strong statewide standards.”

In a move that pokes holes in its ""we the people"" posture, the group of state elected officials is going after groups of local elected officials, columnist Rod Miller writes.
The post The Wyoming Freedom Caucus and its self-inflicted wounds appeared first on WyoFile .","The trigger-happy Wyoming Freedom Caucus has loaded its rusty six-gun once again, and once again is fixin’ to shoot holes in its own foot. With all its errant gunplay, the Freedom Caucus is putting at risk innocent bystanders in Wyoming’s communities, the very folks they pound their chest and purport to protect.

Opinion

As evidence, I offer Maggie Mullen’s recent article in WyoFile about the interim work of the Legislature’s Joint Corporations Committee. Freedom Caucus members, who preach “local control” out of one side of their mouths, told the committee that they are willing to sacrifice towns and counties in the Cowboy State as collateral damage in their war against folks who push back against Freedom Caucus looniness.
Let me say that again. The Wyoming Freedom Caucus is willing to throw local government in the Big Empty under the bus in the name of local control.
At issue are the several member associations, made up of local elected officials, that sometimes resist Freedom Caucus initiatives to replace local control with centralized legislative planning from Cheyenne. When these associations stand up for the rights of their local citizens, the Freedom Caucus snarls and says, “Not on our watch!”
The Freedom Caucus party line is always that it represents the “grassroots” in Wyoming, that it speaks for “we the people.” Horseshit! There ain’t nobody more grassroots or closer to the people than the mayor of a Wyoming town or a commissioner in a Wyoming county.
Yet when these same locally elected officials work together in their voluntary peer associations to better represent their constituents, the Freedom Caucus accuses them of ganging up on democracy and thwarting the will of the voters. That, friends and neighbors, borders on hypocrisy and puts a couple toes over the line.
Freedom Caucus members must think, somewhere in their narrow and fearful minds, that Wyoming’s mayors, county commissioners and other local officials undergo a sinister transformation when they join the Wyoming Association of Municipalities, the Wyoming County Commissioners Association or similar groups. The WFC must have nightmares about local officials suddenly becoming bomb-throwing Bolsheviks or Chinese spies instead of salt-of-the-earth elected public servants when they join an association of their peers.
So Freedom Caucus zealots pontificate about cutting off public funding to the associations and curtailing their work through tightening of the public purse. Here’s where the Freedom Caucus shoots itself in the foot.
Think about it. The Wyoming Freedom Caucus is an invitation-only association of folks with election certificates who band together to amplify their effectiveness and use public resources to further their aims. In this, it’s no different whatsoever from any other association of elected officials. It’s just oilier and more secretive.
If the state of Wyoming shouldn’t support the associations of other elected officials with tax dollars, it shouldn’t support the Wyoming Freedom Caucus, either. Sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander, and all that.
The Freedom Caucus should not be provided a fancy meeting room anywhere on state property. It can hold its secret meetings in a double-wide trailer somewhere on the outskirts of Cheyenne, and the members can pay the rent themselves.
Nor should Legislative Service Office staff waste a minute working on bills that emerge from Freedom Caucus meetings. State property, such as laptops, on which WFC members get their marching orders from their handlers in D.C., should be unavailable in secret Freedom Caucus meetings. If they need staff or machinery to do the work of their association, they can raise private funds.
If the good folks in Wyoming’s towns and counties don’t appreciate the Freedom Caucus trying to hamstring their local officials, they can write to the Joint Corporations Committee to express themselves. Or they can attend the next committee meeting in Casper on Aug. 14, either in person or remotely, and get their voices on the record.
Or I suppose they could say something else like, “Hell yeah, we want more Freedom Caucus control over our lives! We trust the Freedom Caucus in Cheyenne more than we trust the neighbors we elected here at home, so bring it on.”
Here endeth the lesson.

(Jacob Reeder/LSU Sports Information)  Most college athletic programs in Louisiana could soon each receive nearly $2 million in state tax revenue annually under a plan advancing in the legislature. 
House Bill 639 by Rep. Neil Riser, R-Columbia, cleared the House on a 74-15 vote. It would increase the tax on sports gambling from 15% to 21.5%. One-fourth of that revenue would go to the Supporting Programs, Opportunities, Resources and Teams (SPORT) Fund to benefit student-athletes at Louisiana’s public universities that compete at the NCAA Division I level – UL Lafayette, UL Monroe, Louisiana Tech, LSU, Grambling, McNeese, Nicholls, Northwestern State, Southeastern, Southern and the University of New Orleans.  
Under the new tax rate, Louisiana would receive about $77 million annually from sports gambling, with about $20 million dedicated to the new fund. Each school would get approximately $1.7 million annually. 
That’s a small drop in the bucket for LSU, which has an athletics budget of over $200 million. But it would be a significant lifeline for schools such as Southern, Nicholls and ULM, which each spend less than $20 million a year on their sports program. 
The proposed increase in sports gambling taxes has support from conservative and progressive corners, both saying the revenue should be used to offset the “social ills” of gambling. The higher rate would generate more money for addiction programs.
But the decision to dedicate some of that revenue to college athletics at a time when the state is under budget constraints troubles some progressives. 
“Legalized mobile gambling has created or exacerbated many social and cultural problems, including addiction, bankruptcies and even increases in domestic violence. New tax revenue should be used first and foremost to address some of those problems before we talk about spending more money on college sports,” said Peter Robins-Brown, executive director of Louisiana Progress, an advocacy group for marginalized communities. 
Presently, the state’s split for sports gambling tax revenue calls for 25% to go toward early childhood education, 10% to local governments, 3% to gambling addiction programs, and the rest to other priorities and the state general fund. 
Under Riser’s bill, childhood education, local governments and addiction recovery would retain their existing share of tax proceeds. In addition to the 25% for college athletics, another 3% would be dedicated to the Louisiana Postsecondary Inclusive Education Fund to finance programs for students with disabilities. The rest goes into the state general fund for a variety of government needs. 
Riser’s bill will next be discussed in a Senate committee.

The lawsuit, spearheaded by a national team of child welfare attorneys, is seeking court approval for class action status in order to represent all 9000 children in the state’s foster care system.
It alleges that the Department of Children’s Services (DCS) has persistently violated children’s constitutional rights and federal law, including Americans with Disabilities Act protections for kids with disabilities. The suit seeks a sweeping court order forcing the agency to comply.
“Tennessee’s foster care system is failing children it is intended to protect,” said the lawsuit, filed Monday in a Nashville federal court.
DCS “warehouses children in spaces which lack the basic necessities of life, including adequate food, bedding, soap and potable water,” the legal filings said. Kids fortunate enough to get a spot in a foster home, instead of an institution, are “moved from place to place without the opportunity for a stable childhood,” it said.
A DCS spokesperson referred a request for comment about the suit to the Tennessee Attorney General’s office, which declined to comment.
It is the second class action lawsuit filed in recent months against DCS alleging gross mistreatment of children the agency is mandated to protect.
Class action complaint accuses Tennessee Department of Children’s Services of abusing disabled kids

DCS operates with more than $1.2 billion in state and federal funding annually to oversee two main areas of responsibility.
The first focuses on child abuse and neglect. The agency investigates allegations of abuse, oversees the state’s foster care system and provides services that help keep struggling families together.
The second is juvenile justice programs. The agency houses youth who have gotten tangled up with the state’s juvenile justice system for offenses that range from missing school to committing crimes.
While Monday’s lawsuit focuses on the actions or inactions by DCS in caring for children who have been abused or neglected, a class action lawsuit filed last year alleges a series of failures that have harmed kids with disabilities tangled up in DCS’s juvenile justice system. That suit remains ongoing.
Both lawsuits seek court-ordered changes to the way DCS operates.
Monday’s 74-page lawsuit details the unstable lives of multiple children who have been in DCS custody for years. Among them is 15-year-old “Darnell,” a pseudonym used in court filings to protect the teen’s privacy.
At eight years old, Darnell made his way to a fire station for help after being struck in the face then abandoned on the side of a road by his mother. DCS took custody.
In the eight years since that day, Darnell has been placed in at least 14 different settings. Darnell has spent half of his childhood in institutions that his DCS caseworkers acknowledge were unsuitable for his needs. Those institutions fail to provide even basic necessities to children living under their roofs.
Living in limbo: DCS places kids indefinitely in group homes awaiting “evaluations”

“His (appointed legal advocate) offered to buy him a Christmas present and asked what he wanted. The only thing Darnell wanted was his ‘own deodorant stick,’” the lawsuit noted.
Darnell struggled academically, but DCS failed to get him educational testing or advocate for individualized education plans to provide him extra in-school help.
Instead, during one four-month stint outside of an institution, DCS falsely promised foster parents hoping to adopt Darnell that he was a “straight A student.” When Darnell instead struggled in school and acted out at home, the family cited a lack of information and support from DCS in ending the foster care arrangement.
Darnell’s former legal guardian continues to supply him with clothing and hygiene products inside the institution where he currently lives. The guardian has undergone all required training to become his foster parent. Despite her persistence in advocating Darnell come home with her, he remains in an institution where, he told juvenile court officials earlier this year, he feels unsafe.
The lives of other children in DCS custody detailed in the lawsuit include prolonged separation from siblings, sexual abuse, the use of inappropriate restraints and lengthy stays in temporary settings intended to house children for no more than 30 days.
Children in DCS care are “deteriorating physically, psychologically, emotionally and educationally,” the lawsuit said.
DCS seeks $189M in new funding with plans to target rural counties with high foster care rates

The agency has come under public scrutiny in recent years as reports emerged of children sleeping on state office floors due to a lack of a suitable foster home beds, allegations of sexual abuse in privately run institutions, caseworkers struggling with impossible caseloads and rampant turnover among disillusioned employees.
In response, Gov. Bill Lee and state lawmakers appropriated significant additional funding for the agency in 2023 to hire and train caseworkers, contract with private companies to provide institutional and foster care and create new temporary “assessment centers” and other facilities to house children.
The lawsuit alleges that, despite new funding, little has improved in the lives of children still in state custody.
Assessment centers are intended for a maximum of a 30-day stay in order to determine the best type of treatment and housing for children who have suffered abuse or neglect.
Kids in state custody forced to sleep on floors in state office building

Instead, most children are there for far longer, living in “draconian conditions more commonly found in adult prisons,” the suit claims.
The centers are frequently staffed by sheriff department personnel, not child welfare workers; DCS has authorized the use of shackles on children taken off site for doctors appointments and pepper spray to subdue them. Young victims of abuse are housed at the centers alongside teens accused of crimes, the suit noted.
“Children charged with violent criminal offenses are placed together with children removed from their homes due to the trauma of inflicted violence,” the suit said. “Boys with rape and assault charges are placed together with girls.”
The suit echoes similar claims made against the agency more than two decades ago, when a 2000 class action lawsuit alleged children in DCS custody were deprived of education, healthcare and other rights, and subjected to egregious living environments
That lawsuit, known as “Brian A.,” led to 17 years of federal court oversight requiring the agency to meet basic benchmarks in their treatment of children. The oversight formally ended in 2017.
“The system quickly declined to a point even worse than it was in 2000, and now subjects children to a wide range of harms,” a statement from attorneys filing suit this week said.
The law firms filing suit are Bass Berry & Sims, A Better Childhood, The Barbara McDowell Social Justice Center, Willkie Farr & Gallagher and Wang Hecker. The lawsuit names the Department of Children’s Services as defendant along with Commissioner Margie Quin, Deputy Commissioner Carla Aaron and Deputy Commissioner Karen Jointer Bryant.

(Photo by Isiah Holmes/Wisconsin Examiner)A Republican-sponsored bill that would have defined a riot as a gathering of at least three people that could pose a threat of property damage or injury has been removed from the Assembly Judiciary Committee’s executive session agenda. The bill has been criticized for being overly broad, and potentially chilling First Amendment protections of protest and free speech. Besides defining a riot, the bill also exposed accused rioters and riot organizers to felony charges and civil liability including restitution for attorneys’ fees and property damage, and carried a prohibition on government officials with authority over law enforcement from limiting an agency’s response to quell unrest. 
Rep. Andrew Hysell (D- Sun Prairie), a member of the Assembly Committee on Judiciary, said that he criticized the bill because it “actually weakens existing law for the very people it was supposed to help.” The committee held a public hearing on the bill on May 7, at which  a large number of Wisconsinites voiced opposition to the bill. Rep. Shae Sortwell (R- Two Rivers), one of the bill’s authors, testified in favor of the bill, saying that it’s needed to prevent protests from spinning out of control into riots, property destruction, and injury. Sortwell and other republican supporters of the bill referenced protests and unrest in 2020 in Kenosha and  Madison. 
Among those who testified against the bill was Rep. Ryan Clancy (D-Madison). Like other critics, Clancy said the bill was written vaguely in order to be applied broadly to crack down on protest movements. “While myself and many of my Democratic colleagues are tired of wasting our time and our constituents’ resources on badly written, unconstitutional bills like AB-88, I’m ecstatic that Republicans have abandoned this one for now,” Clancy said in a statement after the bill was shelved by the Assembly committee. “It’s clear that passionate, thoughtful testimony from the public, free speech advocates and civil rights experts – along with excellent technical critiques from Rep. Andrew Hysell – has stopped this so-called ‘anti-riot’ bill dead in its tracks.”
Clancy added that “in reality, however, this isn’t an ‘anti-riot’ bill: it’s a threat to free speech, expression and assembly disguised as a public safety measure. Thankfully, it’s now unlikely to move forward this session.” 
During the May 7 committee hearing where people spoke either in favor of or against the bill, one man wore a hat which used an expletive to denounce President Donald Trump. Committee Chair Ron Tulser (R- Harrison) demanded that the man remove the hat because it was offensive. Tulser threatened to have law enforcement remove the man, and called the hearing into recess. Later, when the hearing continued, the man was allowed to continue wearing the hat. Clancy told  Tulser his emotional reaction to the hat and his impulse to call for police was an example of how a broad, penalty-heavy bill for protests like AB-88 is a bad idea.
In his statement, Clancy urged his colleagues to spend “less time trying to dismantle our rights and getting angry at rude hats” and more time “addressing the actual needs of Wisconsin residents. Until that changes, we must all remain vigilant to fight back their next, terrible idea.”

(Tony Leys/KFF Health News)SPENCER, Iowa — This town’s hospital is a holdout on behalf of people going through mental health crises. The facility’s leaders have pledged not to shutter their inpatient psychiatric unit, as dozens of other U.S. hospitals have.
Keeping that promise could soon get tougher if Congress slashes Medicaid funding. The joint federal-state health program covers an unusually large share of mental health patients, and hospital industry leaders say spending cuts could accelerate a decades-long wave of psychiatric unit closures.
At least eight other Iowa hospitals have stopped offering inpatient mental health care since 2007, forcing people in crisis to seek help in distant facilities. Spencer Hospital is one of the smallest in Iowa still offering the service.
CEO Brenda Tiefenthaler said 40% of her hospital’s psychiatric inpatients are covered by Medicaid, compared with about 12% of all inpatients. An additional 10% of the hospital’s psychiatric inpatients are uninsured. National experts say such disparities are common.
Tiefenthaler vows to keep her nonprofit hospital’s 14-bed psychiatric unit open, even though it loses $2 million per year. That’s a significant loss for an organization with an overall annual budget of about $120 million. But the people who use the psychiatric unit need medical care, “just like people who have chest pains,” Tiefenthaler said.
Medicaid covers health care for about 72 million Americans with low incomes or disabilities. Tiefenthaler predicts that if some of them are kicked off the program and left without insurance coverage, more people would delay treatment for mental health problems until their lives spin out of control.
“Then they’re going to enter through the emergency room when they’re in a crisis,” she said. “That’s not really a solution to what we have going on in our country.”
Republican congressional leaders have vowed to protect Medicaid for people who need it, but they also have called for billions of dollars in cuts to areas of the federal budget that include the program.
The U.S. already faces a deep shortage of inpatient mental health services, many of which were reduced or eliminated by private hospitals and public institutions, said Jennifer Snow, director of government relations and policy for the National Alliance on Mental Illness. At the same time, the number of people experiencing mental problems has climbed.
“I don’t even want to think about how much worse it could get,” she said.
The American Hospital Association estimates nearly 100 U.S. hospitals have shuttered their inpatient mental health services in the past decade.
Such closures are often attributed to mental health services being more likely to lose money than many other types of health care. “I’m not blaming the hospitals,” Snow said. “They need to keep their doors open.”
Medicaid generally pays hospitals lower rates for services than they receive from private insurance or from Medicare, the federal program that mostly covers people 65 or older. And Medicaid recipients are particularly likely to need mental health care. More than a third of nonelderly Medicaid enrollees have some sort of mental illness, according to a report from KFF, a nonprofit health policy organization that includes KFF Health News. Iowa has the highest rate of mental illness among nonelderly Medicaid recipients, at 51%.
As of February, just 20 of Iowa’s 116 community hospitals had inpatient psychiatric units, according to a state registry. Iowa also has four freestanding mental hospitals, including two run by the state.
Iowa, with 3.2 million residents, has a total of about 760 inpatient mental health beds that are staffed to care for patients, the state reports. The Treatment Advocacy Center, a national group seeking improved mental health care, says the “absolute minimum” of such beds would translate to about 960 for Iowa’s population, and the optimal number would be about 1,920.
Most of Iowa’s psychiatric beds are in metro areas, and it can take several days for a slot to come open. In the meantime, patients routinely wait in emergency departments.
Sheriff’s deputies often are assigned to transport patients to available facilities when treatment is court-ordered.
“It’s not uncommon for us to drive five or six hours,” said Clay County Sheriff Chris Raveling, whose northwestern Iowa county includes Spencer, a city of 11,000 people.
He said Spencer Hospital’s mental health unit often is too full to accept new patients and, like many such facilities, it declines to take patients who are violent or charged with crimes.
The result is that people are held in jail on minor charges stemming from their mental illnesses or addictions, the sheriff said. “They really shouldn’t be in jail,” he said. “Did they commit a crime? Yes. But I don’t think they did it on purpose.”
Raveling said authorities in many cases decide to hold people in jail so they don’t hurt themselves or others while awaiting treatment. He has seen the problems worsen in his 25 years in law enforcement.
Most people with mental health issues can be treated as outpatients, but many of those services also depend heavily on Medicaid and could be vulnerable to budget cuts.
Jon Ulven, a psychologist who practices in Moorhead, Minnesota, and neighboring Fargo, North Dakota, said he’s particularly worried about patients who develop psychosis, which often begins in the teenage years or early adulthood. If they’re started right away on medication and therapy, “we can have a dramatic influence on that person for the rest of their life,” he said. But if treatment is delayed, their symptoms often become harder to reverse.
Ulven, who helps oversee mental health services in his region for the multistate Sanford Health system, said he’s also concerned about people with other mental health challenges, including depression. He noted a study published in 2022 that showed suicide rates rose faster in states that declined to expand their Medicaid programs than in states that agreed to expand their programs to cover more low-income adults. If Medicaid rolls are reduced again, he said, more people would be uninsured and fewer services would be available. That could lead to more suicides.
Nationally, Medicaid covered nearly 41% of psychiatric inpatients cared for in 2024 by a sample of 680 hospitals, according to an analysis done for KFF Health News by the financial consulting company Strata. In contrast, just 13% of inpatients in those hospitals’ cancer programs and 9% of inpatients in their cardiac programs were covered by Medicaid.
If Medicaid participants have mental crises after losing their coverage, hospitals or clinics would have to treat many of them for little or no payment. “These are not wealthy people. They don’t have a lot of assets,” said Steve Wasson, Strata’s chief data and intelligence officer. Even though Medicaid pays hospitals relatively low rates, he said, “it’s better than nothing.”
Birthing units, which also have been plagued by closures, face similar challenges. In the Strata sample, 37% of those units’ patients were on Medicaid in 2024.
Spencer Hospital, which has a total of 63 inpatient beds, has maintained both its birthing unit and its psychiatric unit, and its leaders plan to keep them open. Amid a critical shortage of mental health professionals, it employs two psychiatric nurse practitioners and two psychiatrists, including one providing care via video from North Carolina.
Local resident David Jacobsen appreciates the hospital’s efforts to preserve services. His son Alex was assisted by the facility’s mental health professionals during years of struggles before he died by suicide in 2020.
David Jacobsen knows how reliant such services are on Medicaid, and he worries that more hospitals will curtail mental health offerings if national leaders cut the program. “They’re hurting the people who need help the most,” he said.
People on Medicaid aren’t the only ones affected when hospitals reduce services or close treatment units. Everyone in the community loses access to care.
Alex Jacobsen’s family saw how common the need is. “If we can learn anything from my Alex,” one of his sisters wrote in his obituary, “it’s that mental illness is real, it doesn’t discriminate, and it takes some of the best people down in its ugly swirling drain.”

M.J. Kellner’s royal blue and golden yellow semi-trucks are a common sight throughout central Illinois. Every week, the wholesale food company delivers thousands of pounds of grocery items to state-owned facilities, including prisons, mental health centers, rehabilitation institutions and veterans homes. The company boasts that many of its customers are within a 100-mile radius of its Springfield headquarters.

But most of the food M.J. Kellner delivers comes from well beyond state lines.

In fact, of all the food consumed in Illinois, 95% of it comes from outside the state.

The Good Food Purchasing Program (GFPP), proposed during this year’s Illinois General Assembly, would have required food vendors like M.J. Kellner to provide more information about how and where they source their food.

House Bill B3701 and Senate Bill 2187 would have significantly changed state food procurement practices, which advocates say are outdated and divert millions of public dollars out of state each year, instead of going to local farmers. The bills would have also raised standards for food companies’ labor, environmental and animal welfare practices.

However, state lawmakers did not pass the bills before a key legislative deadline in April.

“That is what you call a missed opportunity,” said Sen. Willie Preston, D-Chicago, the Senate bill’s sponsor.

State institutions purchase and serve hundreds of thousands of meals daily, worth tens of millions of dollars in contracts. Advocates for the purchasing program want state agencies to send more public money to small local producers and distributors, especially those that provide fair wages and safe working conditions.

State agencies use dozens of private food distributors, but for the Department of Corrections, the state’s largest food buyer, nearly 70% goes to just two: M. J. Kellner and Advanced Commodities, Inc. The vast majority of those contracts, worth more than $156 million combined since 2021, supply food for the nearly 30,000 people incarcerated in Illinois.

M.J. Kellner did not respond to requests for comment.

Most of the companies are wholesale distributors. They buy large food quantities from producers, often at a large discount, and sell them to institutions, restaurants and other businesses.

Several state agencies opposed the bill, including the Illinois Department of Central Management Services, the agency responsible for most food purchases.

CMS, the Department of Agriculture and other agencies testified against the Good Food Purchasing Program at the House Agriculture Committee on March 18. Agency officials said at the hearing that the policy would add additional red tape to an already complex process.

State Rep. Sonya Harper, a Chicago Democrat and chair of the House Agriculture and Conservation Committee, said state officials had ample time to address issues with her and should not have waited until the eleventh hour to raise objections.

“This bill has been out there,” said Harper, who was a sponsor of the House bill. “If you had an issue with it, you guys know how it goes. Send me some language that would make it better. Let’s have that conversation before the day that I come to committee.”

With the bills dead, Harper filed a House joint resolution that, if passed, will extend the life of the task force and encourage, but not require, state agencies to share details about their food purchasing practices.

Harvesting expertise: Corporate logistics meets local foods

Clint Bland’s commercial organic family farm in central Illinois is just a 5-minute drive from Jacksonville Correctional Facility, one of the state’s 27 adult prisons. He also raises beef and poultry, and began selling to several local school districts around central Illinois in 2024 as part of various local and federal programs that help schools buy more locally produced food.

But when asked if he’d ever thought about trying to sell his products to Jacksonville Correctional Center, Bland said he didn’t know where to start.

“I don’t even know who to contact,” Bland said. “It’s been hard enough just figuring out who the buyers are in certain schools. It’s hard to get a seat at the table, you know.”

Bland spent nearly a decade working in upper management for a major corporate food redistributor called Dot Foods, a sort of middleman for the middleman in the food supply chain. The company buys truckloads of food from manufacturers and then sells smaller quantities to smaller distributors.

In 2016, he and his wife started farming in Jacksonville, and in 2022, he turned farming into a full-time job. Inspired to strengthen the local food scene in his area, Bland later started an aggregation and distribution company for local producers called Farmers Alliance for Regional Marketing and Sales, or The Farms of Illinois for short.

“Farmers are often not the best at customer service, they’re not the best at delivery and invoicing and billing. They’re not the best at all these things,” Bland said. “They just want their hands in the soil.”

State agencies are required to award food contracts to the lowest compliant bidder who also meets established specifications. But in 2022, lawmakers allowed public schools to hire vendors that source local food products, even if the cost was higher.

Going with just the lowest bid forced schools to accept meals of substandard quality, which resulted in garbage cans full of uneaten food and ultimately, wasted money, advocates of the change said.

In September 2023, Pawnee Community Unit School District No. 11 started buying and serving locally grown vegetables and locally raised beef and chicken.

State Rep. Wayne Rosenthal, R-Springfield, recently visited the school and said that the cost of purchasing local foods is often the same, if not cheaper, than the prior vendor.

“(There’s not) much difference (in price) one way or the other,” Rosenthal said. “The big difference is the kids are eating the food. They’re not throwing it away. And to me, that’s a big plus.”

Local food programs terminated: Farmers feel left in the dust

Advocates for the local purchasing program say state support is especially important following the Trump administration’s cuts to two key federal programs: IL-EATS and the Resilient Food Systems Infrastructure.

The IL-EATS program funneled $43 million in federal dollars last year to the state health department to contract with local farmers to supply food banks. The program represented around 30% of all sales for The Farms of Illinois, but was cut by Trump in March. Since then, Bland has laid off an employee with the potential for more cuts.

“All these farmers are depending on us, too,” he said. “I have a tremendous responsibility. I feel tremendous weight to make sure that I don’t fail them.”

Ed Dubrick, a small pasture poultry farmer in Cissna Park who also farms vegetables with his wife, said local farmers struggle to compete in a consolidated market where large distributors are able to sell products well below the price it takes to produce them.

“The (IL-EATS) program had really hit its stride and was making a difference in the lives of both farmers and the nutrition insecure in our state,” Dubrick said.

The Resilient Food Systems Infrastructure (RFSI) program provided federal funds for infrastructure, such as refrigerated trucks, walk-in coolers, wash stations and commercial dehydrators and dry racks — critical tools that help farmers access better market opportunities.

The Trump administration eliminated the $6.5 million program in March.

Critics of Trump’s actions argue the cuts also contradict his push for U.S. farmers to sell more of their products domestically, particularly as an escalating trade war threatens to disrupt the export market.

“Get ready to start making a lot of agricultural product to be sold INSIDE of the United States…Have fun!” Trump recently posted on social media.

Jackie de Bautista, executive director of Farmers Rising, a nonprofit agricultural education organization, was furious when she read the president’s post in March.

“The ridiculousness of this statement is that shifting an entire food industry production system from row crops to local food requires a transition period,” de Bautista said. “The irony in that statement is that this work was already happening and was finally being supported and incentivized by our federal government (before being abruptly cut).”

Bland still devotes a small portion of his farmland to commodity crops like corn and soybeans. So when the USDA pulled the plug on two programs that had helped him grow his local food business, he was surprised to find a check from the same agency in his mailbox.

This time, it was to compensate him for increased fertilizer and pesticide costs and falling commodity prices.

For Bland, it made one thing obvious: the system still props up commodity agriculture, but not local food.

He said the priorities of the USDA are out of balance.

“All of a sudden we got local food going away, and the government saying that that’s not important,” Bland said, “but prices got too low for you on your commodity, so we’re going to give you free money.”

Raising standards: Policy aims to elevate labor standards for all

The Good Food Purchasing Program prioritizes five values: supporting local economies, fair labor conditions and compensation, nutritious whole foods with minimal harmful ingredients, animal welfare standards, and environmental sustainability through ecological sourcing and menu planning.

Full transparency would be essential at every level of the supply chain, advocates said. Under the policy, suppliers would eventually be required to share sourcing data — tracing products from farm to plate — and make that data public.

The program would prioritize companies that pay their workers a “livable wage,” encouraging state agencies to grant contracts to companies with higher scores.

For example, Tyson Foods, which sells meat to M.J. Kellner, has repeatedly been cited for child labor violations, including some tied to fatal incidents. Smithfield, another M.J. Kellner supplier and the world’s largest pork producer, has faced multiple complaints that the company disproportionately exposes low-income, rural, military, and Black communities to air and water pollution from the company’s biogas operations.

The program would require full supply chain transparency from all suppliers, making middlemen like M.J. Kellner show where their food comes from, how it gets from the farm to the plate, how much the company spent on it and at what quantity.

This can be easier said than done. A 2023 report produced by Food Chain Workers Alliance and HEAL Food Alliance, two coalitional groups consisting of workers and producers, revealed that after 10 years of similar food purchasing programs operating in cities like Los Angeles and Chicago, institutions were only able to obtain a sliver of their supply chain sourcing data — and they rarely shared this limited information with the public.

Cook County adopted the GFPP in 2018. In theory, county procurement decision-makers should examine working conditions for food warehouse workers.

But a 2023 survey found that more than half of the food chain workers in the Chicagoland area still earned wages too low to feed their families, and three-quarters lacked employer-provided health care. Workers who spoke up about their rights were fired or suspended.

Roger Cooley, executive director of the Chicago Food Policy Action Council, which crafted and advocated for the state bill, said that the point isn’t necessarily to cancel or not renew contracts with existing vendors if they’re not doing a good job, but to raise standards when shortcomings are identified.

And if a food company has OSHA violations, a state department can “go back to that supplier and be like, ‘Look, either you address these OSHA violations and give us a clear plan for it, or we’re going to have to shift our purchasing to somebody else,’” Cooley said.

“It’s more of a carrot than a stick method,” said Cooley, referencing the fact that this is an incentive process, not a mandate. “This is a long process. It’s not going to happen overnight.”

State food contracts: A past source of controversy in Illinois politics

Food contracts have been a source of controversy in the state’s political history.

In April 2002, while Rod Blagojevich was campaigning for governor, Archer Daniels Midland executives gifted the 46-year-old Democrat candidate two seats on one of the company’s private jets. In October, they gave him use of a private plane. Both were listed as campaign donations on Secretary of State records.

After Blagojevich was elected, ADM executives continued to funnel money into his committee. In 2005, the company was awarded a lucrative contract to supply soy-based products to the Department of Corrections.

By 2009, dozens of people incarcerated in state prisons filed lawsuits against IDOC, alleging that soy was served in nearly every cooked item at every meal and was responsible for making the plaintiffs sick with gastrointestinal issues, allergic reactions, heart problems, and thyroid dysfunction.

The lawsuits were all dismissed.

In 2009, Blagojevich was impeached, removed from office and sentenced to 14 years in federal prison on federal corruption charges for various pay-to-play schemes, none of which involved ADM.

The company received nearly $5 million from the state to provide soy products from 2005 to 2013.

In 2019, IDOC dietary departments announced they planned to move away from soy-heavy menus, “which will save money on production and reduce lawsuits filed against the department,” according to a fiscal report that year.

Since the former governor’s arrest, Illinois’ procurement law has gone through a series of fine-tuning efforts to root out corruption and conflicts of interest, including a 2008 bill Blagojevich himself signed into law, prohibiting public officials from accepting contributions from contractors. Before it passed, his campaign committee collected between $50,000 and $100,000 from companies seeking state contracts in a blitz of fundraising.

In 2021, the Illinois Department of Corrections began purchasing commissary items in a more centralized way, which led to disruptions in the delivery of goods.

Commissary items are a critical lifeline for incarcerated people who don’t want to, or can’t, eat the meals.

According to a 2022 survey of people incarcerated at Illinois Department of Corrections facilities, 70% of respondents indicated that they relied on purchasing commissary items to supplement at least half of all of their food.

One respondent commented, “No one likes the food in prison. Some of these people have been locked up for 20 years or more. They never eat the state food.”

Gwyn Troyer, Associate Director from the John Howard Association, the not-for-profit prison watchdog organization that conducted the survey, said that food is an overlooked need in a system beleaguered with challenges like delayed maintenance, lockdowns, and medical and mental healthcare issues.

“There is no public accounting of how state funds are spent,” Troyer said, “or expertise provided regarding how Illinois might better invest in food in prisons to promote health and wellbeing.”

She said the organization calls for greater transparency and oversight regarding state spending for food in prisons.

Troyer said that the concerns she hears mostly relate to food portions, inadequate nutrition, particularly related to medical and religious diets.

The Illinois Department of Corrections spent over $56 million on food in 2024, according to an Investigate Midwest analysis of publicly available data, a 70% increase from 2021 to 2024.

A spokesperson for IDOC said in a written statement that the increase is due to inflation and improvements to meals, which include larger servings of fresh produce, whole muscle meat, and “revised meals” at Adult Transition Centers. An analysis of state records show that DOC spending on MJ Kellner contracts has increased more than tenfold since 2021, making up a significant share of DOC contracts overall.

“Since the 2022 survey,” the spokesperson wrote, “IDOC has added a Registered Dietitian to its team,” whose role is to improve the overall quality of meals.

The spokesperson said that the department’s master menu is being updated to emphasize nutrition, product availability, and general preferences.

Politics, procurement and price tags: What killed the food reform bill

The Good Food Purchasing Program not only stalled this year in committee, it lacked clear support from current Gov. JB Pritzker, who faces challenging budget constraints amid federal funding cuts.

When asked if he would support the bill at a farm event in Urbana, Pritzker said that with the state facing losses of approximately $11 billion due to federal cuts, there is a lot pulling on the state budget.

“In a world where we’ve got to worry about keeping our rural hospitals open when we lose what I think we may in Medicaid, it’s going to be triage,” he said. “Something is going to close.”

Cooley, of the Chicago Food Policy Action Council, doesn’t believe that the proposed program would raise costs.

[caption id=""attachment_67692"" align=""alignleft"" width=""283""] Rodger Cooley, executive director of the Chicago Food Policy Action Council. (photo provided)[/caption]

“We have seen over and over again, no matter what the year is, those budget concerns come up and are given as one of the main reasons for not moving forward on this policy,” Cooley said. “Oftentimes, departments and agencies feel like they’re under the gun, underfunded, and under-resourced, and adding anything new is a stretch for them.”

Scratch cooking, equipment upgrades and choosing local, seasonal ingredients can keep budgets down, Cooley added. School kitchens in Chicago and Pawnee conduct taste tests to figure out what the students’ preferences are, reducing waste. Beyond Green, a Chicago-based company, helps train institutional staff on how to cook large quantities from scratch without increasing costs.

The company even weighs the portions before it’s served to students and weighs the trash afterwards to see how much is thrown away.

“They’re super dialing it in,” Bland said.

A representative from the Illinois Department of Agriculture, which opposed the bill, testified at a March hearing that his agency doesn’t have the technical know-how to administer a formal food procurement process, and that the bill would significantly delay food procurement at state-operated facilities.

Tyler Bohannon, the legislative liaison for the Illinois Department of Agriculture, said that his department opposes the bill because his agency doesn’t have the technical know-how to administer a formal food procurement process, and it could significantly delay ordering food.

“Finally,” he said at the hearing, “the Department of Agriculture cannot support any proposal that would have a substantial fiscal impact on the FY 26 budget.”

Ron Wilson, deputy director of Central Management Services and head of the Bureau of Strategic Sourcing, said at the March 18 hearing that the bill failed to account for the additional red tape it would create.

“The opposition that CMS has to this bill has nothing to do with the fresh food. Everybody, I think, is on board with that’s the way to go. If we could do that, that would be fantastic,” Wilson said. “The issue the CMS currently has is the procurement aspect of this.”

In a written statement to Investigate Midwest, a spokesperson from CMS said that centralized purchasing has been the state’s approach since at least 2004.

“This is standard practice across most large-scale governmental units and is considered a best practice as it takes advantage of economies of scale and significantly reduces redundant work requirements,” the statement said.The post Lawmakers tried to reform Illinois’ food system.

But for many refugees, “waiting” depends on the whims of domestic politics, international relations, and a good dose of luck, magnifying their feeling of being stuck.
Immigration to the United States is a waiting game – it can take years, decades, even to receive immigration visas, to reunite with family, to receive asylum, to get green cards and then citizenship. More than 20,000 people had already been approved for refugee status when Trump took office, many of them with family already here in the U.S. and in Idaho. Now they too wait.
However, the Trump administration is resettling white South Africans now, just three months after floating the idea, essentially allowing them to jump the line in front of people already approved, thousands of whom had already booked their travel.
As a sociologist studying migration and refugee integration in the U.S., I have been conducting interviews on the impact of the 2021 Afghan evacuation – when tens of thousands of Afghan allies fled their country after the U.S. withdrawal and return of Taliban rule.
Many Afghans were able to resettle in the U.S., at first through humanitarian parole. Later, they had to apply for asylum to create a pathway to citizenship. However, due to the backlog with asylum cases, many were forced to apply for Temporary Protected Status to receive work permits. On the same day that a small group of white South Africans arrived, the administration canceled Temporary Protected Status for Afghan allies.
In my research, I have talked to many Afghan families and to people who work with the refugee community in Idaho. Many are still moving through pending asylum cases, years later, including one man I met named Muzar (a pseudonym).
Muzar came to the United States in November 2021 after former President Joe Biden  withdrew U.S. troops from Afghanistan. Thousands of Afghans stood in lines for hours at the Kabul International Airport, desperately waiting to be evacuated. Muzar worked for the U.S. military, cleaning a military base, a critical service that made him a target, but did not qualify him for a Special immigrant Visa for Afghans who were connected to the U.S. military.
Now, his asylum case is still pending, as he tries to prove his service, as is the case for many. “Lack of proof” is a common theme for many service workers, which I describe in my own work on low-wage immigrant workers in the U.S.
They had tickets. A flight number. An arrival time. Then Trump’s executive order changed everything.

There are many youth and elderly women whom I regularly meet at the legal clinics in Boise. One such elderly person is Nurma (a pseudonym). She has been in the U.S. for 25 years and is still waiting for her daughter to join her.
The daughter had to flee Afghanistan with the rise of the Taliban and has been stuck in Pakistan for the last seven years, waiting on the visa petition her mom submitted. The legal clinics in Boise are led by attorneys working around the clock to help people like Muzar and Nurma file their asylum claims and reunite with their families. Week after week, many Afghans come seeking answers, and often the answers are elusive.
The waiting within the refugee system has become even more arduous since the Trump administration suspended the U.S. Refugee Admission Program on Jan. 20, his first day in office. Currently, more than 10,000 Afghans abroad, all of whom went through years-long background checks and have been approved, are waiting to be relocated to the U.S. Many are stranded in neighboring countries — Pakistan, Turkey, and Iran.
Yes, the U.S. immigration system is broken, but not in the way you may think. It should not take decades to reunite these Afghan families, torn apart by U.S. policy in Afghanistan. And it should not take one day for a new president to tear apart five decades of U.S. resettlement policy and undermine the family-based immigration system that has been in place since the 1960s.
If resettling white South Africans demonstrates anything, it’s that the U.S. refugee resettlement system is indeed a proper function of government that is capable of operating in an efficient and humane manner when given the proper resources.
Local refugee agencies plan to do what they do best and welcome newcomers to Idaho, but that should not come at the expense of the tens of thousands of other deserving people around the world, including our Afghan friends to whom we owe a high debt of gratitude.

DemasSexual assault survivors gained support from the Michigan Senate on Tuesday with the passage of bills to allow more time in filing civil lawsuits against their assailants, but it remains unclear if the Republican-controlled House plans to take up the bills.
The upper chamber voted 25-9 to pass the five-bill package sponsored by Democratic Senators Kevin Hertel of Saint Clair Shores, Sam Singh of East Lansing, Mallory McMorrow of Royal Oak, Jeff Irwin of Ann Arbor, and Veronica Klinefelt of Eastpointe.
Together, the bills would give survivors of sexual assault or other criminal sexual conduct a 10-year window after a crime was committed, with a cutoff at the age of 42, or within seven years after discovering an injury or some other connection to the misconduct, or whichever is later.
Survivors can file lawsuits to recover damages sustained from the criminal sexual conduct, which could be brought in court at any time if there was also a criminal conviction involved with the assault.
Sexual abuse survivors again ask Michigan lawmakers for more time to sue perpetrators

Regardless of the limitations listed in the package, the bills would allow a survivor who was victimized before the package’s effective date to file a lawsuit for damages within one year after the effective date. In that case, a claimant could not recover more than $1.5 million.
Other bills in the package would remove the existing 10-year statute of limitations, exempt claims to recover damages for criminal sexual conduct from the existing permanent prohibition on bringing a claim against the state,  and would amend the state’s government immunity law in various ways – including removing the immunity from tort liability for a public university, college or school district whose employee engaged in the misconduct while working there if the institution was negligent in hiring, supervising or training that employee. 
The same is true if the institution knew about the abuse and failed to intervene.
In a statement, Hertel said survivors of sexual assault have for too long been denied their day in court and silenced by “arbitrary deadlines and a system that failed them.”

“No more,” Hertel said regarding the Justice for Survivors package. “At their core, these bills are about justice, accountability, and finally giving survivors the voice they deserve. With this legislation, we are shattering that silence and making it clear: Michigan will no longer be a place where assault is ignored and abusers get to walk free to continue their cycle of harm.”

Michigan over the last several years made national headlines due to high-profile sexual assault or abuse cases, including the abuse perpetrated by the Larry Nassar scandal at Michigan State University and Robert Anderson at the University of Michigan. Attorney General Dana Nessel also spearheaded investigations into the Catholic Church and the Boy Scouts of American in Michigan during her tenure, which exposed abuses across generations.
The making of a monster

McMorrow said in a statement that Michigan’s justice system needed to be reformed to a position of protecting survivors and not shielding abusers.
“With the passage of this legislation out of the Senate, we’re one step closer to securing the access to justice that survivors deserve,” McMorrow said.
Irwin in a statement touted the legislation’s removal of immunity for large institutions to empower survivors “to speak their truth and pursue justice that they deserve.”
Klinefelt in a statement also noted that power institutions have shielded perpetrators while abuses happened under their watch. The bills would no longer allow those institutions to hide behind legal immunity when survivors come forward.
“We’re ending that with this legislation and are restoring trust, delivering justice, and making sure survivors’ voices are not easily swept under the rug.”
The bills now move to the House, but it’s unclear if they’ll get traction in the Republican-controlled chamber.
In a Tuesday news briefing, Michigan House Speaker Matt Hall (R-Richland Township) appeared noncommittal on taking the bills up in the House. He also noted that his Democratic colleagues tried to pass similar legislation last session, but the effort died in a disastrous lame duck session that saw several key Democratic priorities grind to a halt.
“I haven’t looked at it, but I think the idea of extending statutes of limitations for decades, or whatever it is, that creates a lot of questions, a lot of legal problems,” Hall said. “We’ll look at it. I haven’t seen it, but you didn’t see the Democrats move it when they were there, so it must have a lot of problems.”

Costs are skyrocketing as states rapidly expand school voucher programs, which divert public funds to pay for private school tuition. (Gene J. Puskar | The Associated Press)In submitting her updated budget proposal in March, Arizona Gov. Katie Hobbs lamented the rising costs of the state’s school vouchers program that directs public dollars to pay private school tuition.
Characterizing vouchers as an “entitlement program,” Hobbs said the state could spend more than $1 billion subsidizing private education in the upcoming fiscal year. The Democratic governor said those expenses could crowd out other budget priorities, including disability programs and pay raises for firefighters and state troopers.
It’s a dilemma that some budget experts fear will become more common nationwide as the costs of school choice measures mount across the states, reaching billions of dollars each year.
“School vouchers are increasingly eating up state budgets in a way that I don’t think is sustainable long term,” said Whitney Tucker, director of state fiscal policy research at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a think tank that advocates for left-leaning tax policies.
Vouchers and scholarship programs, which use taxpayer money to cover private school tuition, are part of the wider school choice movement that also includes charter schools and other alternatives to public schools.
Opponents have long warned about vouchers draining resources from public education as students move from public schools to private ones. But research into several programs has shown many voucher recipients already were enrolled in private schools. That means universal vouchers could drive up costs by creating two parallel education systems — both funded by taxpayers.










School vouchers are increasingly eating up state budgets in a way that I don't think is sustainable long term.


– Whitney Tucker, director of state fiscal policy research at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities


In Arizona, state officials reported most private school students receiving vouchers in the first two years of the expanded program were not previously enrolled in public schools. In fiscal year 2024, more than half the state’s 75,000 voucher recipients were previously enrolled in private schools or were being homeschooled.
“Vouchers don’t shift costs — they add costs,” Joshua Cowen, a professor of education policy at Michigan State University who studies the issue, recently told Stateline. “Most voucher recipients were already in private schools, meaning states are paying for education they previously didn’t have to fund.”
Voucher proponents, though, say those figures can be misleading. Arizona, like other states with recent expansions, previously had more modest voucher programs. So some kids who were already enrolled in private schools could have already been receiving state subsidies.
In addition to increasing competition, supporters say the programs can actually save taxpayer dollars by delivering education at a lower overall cost than traditional public schools.
One thing is certain: With a record number of students receiving subsidies to attend private schools, vouchers are quickly creating budget concerns for some state leaders.
The rising costs of school choice measures come after years of deep cuts to income taxes in many states, leaving them with less money to spend. An end of pandemic-era aid and potential looming cuts to federal support also have created widespread uncertainty about state budgets.

“We’re seeing a number of things that are creating a sort of perfect storm from a fiscal perspective in the states,” said Tucker, of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.
Last year, Arizona leaders waded through an estimated $1.3 billion budget shortfall. Budget experts said the voucher program was responsible for hundreds of millions of that deficit.
A new universal voucher program in Texas is expected to cost $1 billion over its next two-year budget cycle — a figure that could balloon to nearly $5 billion by 2030, according to a legislative fiscal note.
Earlier this year, Wyoming Republican Gov. Mark Gordon signed a bill expanding the state’s voucher program. But last week, he acknowledged his own “substantial concerns” about the state’s ability to fund vouchers and its public education obligations under the constitution.
“I think the legislature’s got a very tall task to understand how they’re going to be able to fund all of these things,” he said in an interview with WyoFile.
Voucher proponents, who have been active at the state level for years, are gaining new momentum with support from President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans.
In January, Trump ordered federal agencies to allow states, tribes and military families to access federal money for private K-12 education through education savings accounts, voucher programs or tax credits.
Last week, Republicans on the House Ways and Means Committee voted in favor of making $20 billion available over the next four years for a federal school voucher program. Part of broader work on a bill to extend Trump’s 2017 tax cuts, the measure would need a simple majority in the House and the Senate to pass.
Hope Scholarship’s accelerating price tag sparks debate in WV House, $97M in funding approved

Martin Lueken, the director of the Fiscal Research and Education Center at EdChoice, a nonprofit that advocates for school choice measures, argues school choice measures can actually deliver savings to taxpayers.
Lueken said vouchers are not to blame for state budget woes. He said public school systems for years have increased spending faster than inflation. And he noted that school choice measures make up a small share of overall state spending — nationally about 0.3% of total state expenditures in states with school choice, he said.
“Public schooling remains one of the largest line items in state budgets,” he said in an interview. “They are still the dominant provider of K-12 education, and certainly looking at the education pie, they still receive the lion’s share.
“It’s not a choice problem. I would say that it’s a problem with the status quo and the public school system,” he said.
Washington, D.C., and 35 states offer some school choice programs, according to EdChoice. That includes 18 states with voucher programs so expansive that virtually all students can participate regardless of income.
But Lueken said framing vouchers as a new entitlement program is misleading. That’s because all students, even the wealthiest, have always been entitled to a public education — whether they’ve chosen to attend free public schools or private ones that charge tuition.
“At the end of the day, the thing that matters most above dollars are students and families,” he said. “Research is clear that competition works. Public schools have responded in very positive ways when they are faced with increased competitive pressure from choice programs.”
Public school advocates say funding both private and public schools is untenable.
In Wisconsin, Republican lawmakers are considering a major voucher expansion that would alter the funding structure for vouchers, potentially putting more strain on the state’s general fund.
The state spent about $629 million on its four voucher programs during the 2024-2025 school year, according to the Wisconsin Association of School Business Officials, which represents employees in school district finance, human resources and leadership.
The association warns proposed legislation could exacerbate problems with the “unaffordable parallel school systems” in place now by shifting more private schooling costs from parents of those students to state taxpayers at large.
Such expansion “could create the conditions for even greater funding challenges for Wisconsin’s traditional public schools and the state budget as a whole,” the association’s research director wrote in a paper on the issue.
In Arizona, Hobbs originally sought to eliminate the universal voucher program — a nonstarter in the Republican-controlled legislature. She has since proposed shrinking the program by placing income limits that would disqualify the state’s wealthiest families.
That idea also faced Republican opposition.
Legislators are now pushing to enshrine access to vouchers in the state constitution.
Marisol Garcia, president of the Arizona Education Association, the state’s 20,000-member teachers union, noted that vouchers and public education funds are both sourced from the general fund.
“So it almost immediately started to impact public services,” she said of the universal voucher program.
While the union says vouchers have led to cutbacks of important resources such as counselors in public schools, Garcia said the sweeping program also affects the state’s ability to fund other services like housing, transportation and health care.
“Every budget cycle becomes where can we cut in order to essentially feed this out-of-control program?” she said.

(Photo: Emily Siner for the Tennessee Lookout)When former attorney and civil rights pioneer Rita Geier received an honorary doctorate degree last week from the University of Tennessee, it was an odd sort of full-circle moment: The award recognized, in part, her role in suing the university more than half a century ago.
“Her courageous legal efforts not only transformed Tennessee’s educational system, but also paved the way for a better society,” said Donde Plowman, chancellor of UT-Knoxville. “She has left a lasting mark on our state and our country’s history.”
Geier was the lead plaintiff in a 1968 class action lawsuit against Tennessee’s governor and university systems, which alleged that the state was upholding an unconstitutional segregated system of public higher education. 
At the time, she was both a law student at Nashville’s Vanderbilt University and a part-time history instructor at Tennessee State University, then called Tennessee A&I. The university had been founded to provide higher education for Black students at a time when they weren’t allowed into any other public universities.

Technically, by the late 1960s, the University of Tennessee and other previously all-white universities had eliminated race-based admissions requirements. But they were still almost entirely white, and Tennessee A&I was still entirely Black.
Geier says the disparities were obvious in other ways, too: the dilapidated buildings, the low pay for professors.
“TSU was the stepchild of the state higher education system. There’s no denying that,” Geier said. 
She began clerking for a local white attorney, George Barrett, who was seen as a “troublemaker” in Tennessee for his willingness to take on “issues that made people uncomfortable,” Geier said. Together, Barrett and Geier crafted a legal theory that the state had an obligation to integrate its public universities. 
“I was learning all about civil rights and the legal remedies that were possible. It didn’t take long for us to see that there was a tool that could be used,” Geier said. “And I was the perfect plaintiff.”
Similar lawsuits were already in the works over segregated K-12 education, but the state’s obligation in desegregating higher education, where enrollment was voluntary, was largely untested legal ground. 
In their original complaint, Geier and Barrett argued that Tennessee failed to provide appropriate funding to TSU because of its predominantly Black enrollment. It also argued that the state was “seeking to perpetuate a policy of racial segregation” by expanding a UT extension in downtown Nashville.
In the late 1970s, the lawsuit led to the merger of UT-Nashville with TSU — one of the only examples in the nation’s history of a historically Black university acquiring a predominantly white campus.

But the state’s obligation to desegregate public universities continued to be debated in the courts for the next several decades. The final consent decree, in 2001, involved improving TSU’s facilities and increasing scholarship programs for Black students across the state.
When the Geier case officially ended in 2006 — capping off 38 years of litigation — a judge declared that “any remaining vestiges of segregation have been removed from the Tennessee system of public higher education.” 
But conversations over the state’s treatment and funding of TSU are ongoing. In 2021, a state report estimated that Tennessee failed to pay TSU at least $544 million in federally required funding in the decades following the end of segregation. 
Meanwhile, Geier went on to pursue a legal career in government: She became a regional director for the Legal Services Corporation, general counsel for the Appalachian Regional Commission and associate commissioner for the Social Security Administration. After her retirement, she took a position at UT-Knoxville as an associate to the chancellor and a senior fellow at the Howard Baker Center for Public Policy.

Vance.  
A high-ranking person on Trump’s political team told Mississippi Today that several major advisors within the president’s sphere of influence don’t hold White “in high regard” because of the auditor’s ongoing feud with former NFL athlete Brett Favre, who has been caught up in the state’s massive welfare scandal. 
The political official, who Mississippi Today agreed to quote anonymously so they could candidly discuss the sensitive political situation, compared White’s feud with Favre to Trump’s feud with New York Attorney General Letitia James over her civil prosecution of his business operations, which were found to have committed financial fraud.
“(White’s) fight with Brett Favre has not set right with us,” the political official said. 
The recent comments follow remarks from other Trump operatives and conservative influencers and come at a time when White casts himself as Mississippi’s version of a Make America Great Again candidate as he prepares to launch a gubernatorial bid. 
Navigating Favre and his connections to the Trump ecosystem is likely a political hurdle for the state auditor in his bid to become governor. Favre is a close friend of the president’s son, Donald Trump Jr., and an ally of Trump. Last year, the Hall of Fame athlete spoke at a rally for Trump’s reelection campaign in Green Bay in the crucial swing state of Wisconsin. 
White, in a statement to Mississippi Today, said: “I’ve supported the President for years, his team knows this, and I’m working nonstop to advance the America First agenda here in Mississippi against the establishment swamp that’s dead set on stopping our fight for hardworking Mississippians.” 
“These unsubstantiated lies you are printing about me won’t deter me or my team from finding waste and fraud and expose any abuse by politicians desperate to protect their power,” White added. 
The tension between White and Favre, one of Mississippi’s most prolific athletes, stems from the state’s sprawling welfare scandal that has seen multiple people plead guilty to federal and state charges. 
White said in 2020 that Favre received over $1 million in speaking fees from a nonprofit organization that spent welfare funds with approval from the Mississippi Department of Human Services, but that Favre never actually gave the speeches.
Favre has repaid the $1.1 million he received, but state officials argue he still owes about $730,000 in unpaid interest.
Neither state nor federal prosecutors have charged the former NFL athlete with a crime, but the state has civilly sued Favre, as well as roughly three dozen others, in an attempt to claw back welfare money through the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program, which they allege was misspent. 
Favre is also suing White for defamation, claiming that the auditor defamed him in media appearances. Specifically, the athlete is suing the statewide official for accusing Favre of “stealing taxpayer funds” and knowingly misusing funds “designed to serve poor folks.”
White has vigorously fought the litigation, argued that his statements about Favre were truthful and filed motions to dismiss the suit. Earlier this month, a three-judge panel of the Mississippi Supreme Court ruled against White in his attempt to dismiss the lawsuit and allowed the litigation in Hinds County Circuit Court to proceed. 
Obtaining a Trump endorsement in what may likely be a crowded Republican primary for governor would be a boon to a Republican candidate in ruby-red Mississippi. 
However, neither Trump himself nor his White House administration has said anything publicly about the state auditor. A White House official who was also granted anonymity told Mississippi Today that Trump has never said anything negative about White. 
“Shad’s been a great supporter of the president, and the president loves all of his supporters,” the White House official said. 
But other conservative media and political figures with ties to Trump have criticized White over his issues with Favre. 
Charlie Kirk, a prominent conservative media personality, dedicated a segment of his show last year to defending Favre against White’s accusations and drew a comparison between White and New York Attorney General James’ prosecution of Trump. 
“White knew that suing Brett would have widespread publicity, and it has,” Kirk said. “In fact, the suit has made Brett persona non grata in many circles and has damaged his ability to make a living in the state of Mississippi.”
White, at the time, responded to Kirk’s comments by saying the conservative influencer didn’t understand the basic facts of the welfare scandal.  
“If you think it’s politically convenient for me to take on a Hall of Fame quarterback in Mississippi, you are stupid, stupid, stupid,” White said. “I’m not here to do what’s convenient. I’m not trying to be buddies with a famous guy, like some others. I don’t care. I’m here to do my job and tell Mississippians what happened to our money.”  
Another jarring moment occurred when White was promoting his office’s efforts to find and reduce wasteful spending in state government, a move that some legislators have criticized. 
“And after we’re done, I’m volunteering for duty in the Trump-Musk Commission!” White wrote. 
Arthur Schwartz, a Washington political operative who’s close to the Trump family and has been an adviser to Donald Trump Jr. for years, replied to the post and said White was not “getting anywhere near a Trump admin” and that the “transition team has already been warned about you.” 
Favre replied to Schwartz’s comments with two laughing emojis, prompting further back-and-forth between White and Schwartz.
The political conundrum for White comes at a time when the Mississippi public official has informally started a Mississippi Office of Government Efficiency within the State Auditor’s Office to root out government waste, modeled after Trump and Elon Musk’s federal Department of Government Efficiency.
White, on Thursday morning, posted on X that “it’s been a great five months supporting President Trump’s America First agenda!” 
He’s also made social media posts suggesting there are JD Vance-equivalent nicknames for him such as “Great Value JD Vance” floating around the internet and proposed getting a “MS MUSK” car tag to show his support for Elon Musk.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/06085014/3X0A5636-scaled.jpg,,,2025-05-21 07:03:33.642427

This sensationalist framing is not only factually misleading — it’s politically loaded and dangerously reminiscent of the failed tough-on-crime tactics that have destabilized Black communities for generations. While headlines grab the public’s attention, they rarely tell the whole story. 
Memphis deserves better than soundbites, surveillance, and Silicon Valley saviors.
To understand why Patel’s approach is so problematic, we have to rewind to 2017. That year, then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions came to Memphis with the same drumbeat: increased crime, more federal help. Memphis was entered into the Department of Justice’s “Public Safety Partnership,” supposedly to offer tools, data, and strategy to reduce violence.
For a moment in 2018, there was a modest dip in violent crime. But by 2019 — before the pandemic — those numbers were climbing again. And by 2020, Memphis experienced one of its most violent years on record, with homicides jumping nearly 50%.



				FBI Director Kash Patel called Memphis the “homicide capital of America” and said he’s sending federal agents to the city. But this isn’t the first time the federal government has intervened with strategies to purportedly reduce violence, and there’s been no meaningful investments in the community.			


So what did that federal intervention actually achieve?
If we’re honest, not much. No meaningful investments in community infrastructure. No reform of policing practices. No shift in the culture of punishment that undergirds our public safety systems. Just more boots on the ground, more guns on the street, and more people funneled into an already-bloated criminal justice system.
We have more police per capita than cities like Nashville, and yet our violent crime rate remains higher. Why? Because it’s not just about the number of officers — it’s about what they do, how they’re trained and who they’re accountable to. The Memphis Police Department doesn’t need more officers — it needs better practices, more transparency and real accountability. But those conversations keep getting swept under the rug, even in the wake of one of the most horrifying public tragedies in recent memory: the murder of Tyre Nichols.
That trial, still fresh in our collective conscience, was another missed opportunity. While five officers stood accused of Nichols’s death, the case largely avoided a deeper examination of the systemic and cultural failures within MPD. 
The DOJ’s own report — released in December 2024 — confirmed what many of us already knew: Memphis police have engaged in unconstitutional, racially biased and violent practices for years. These patterns weren’t new; they were just well-documented for the first time by federal investigators.
And now, we’re expected to believe that sending more federal agents — this time from the FBI, under the guise of public safety — will solve what decades of over-policing have only exacerbated? We cannot ignore that this is happening at the same time that billion-dollar tech projects are rolling into town.

Elon Musk’s xAI supercomputer project and Google’s data center development are being touted as signs of economic progress for Memphis. And to be fair, the arrival of such large-scale, high-tech investments does represent an opportunity. But history reminds us that opportunity alone does not guarantee equity. These projects often consume massive tracts of land, place significant strain on community resources like water and electricity and promise jobs that never quite reach the neighborhoods most impacted by generational poverty and systemic neglect.
That’s why we must be vigilant — not just skeptical, but strategic.
As these projects break ground, it is our collective responsibility to ensure that they do not deepen the displacement and disenfranchisement of longtime residents — especially Black and working-class families in Westwood, Box Town and Whitehaven. Instead, we must leverage these developments to create environmental safeguards, sustainable job pipelines and enforceable community benefit agreements that protect the people, not just the profit margins of corporations.
When powerful institutions — federal agencies, multinational corporations and complicit local officials — collaborate without community input or accountability, we don’t get innovation. We get exploitation dressed up in progress. That’s how the tragic cycles of the past repeat themselves:under new names and slicker branding.
So what do we do?
We resist the temptation to let outsiders dictate our future. We interrogate the narratives sold to us by elected and appointed officials who stage ribbon-cuttings instead of enacting reforms. We advocate for violence prevention, not just response. We demand that corporate development be paired with ethical obligations: equitable hiring, environmental responsibility and public transparency. And we push back — forcefully and faithfully — against the idea that more federal law enforcement is the path to peace.
Let’s be clear: Memphis doesn’t need more surveillance and suppression. We need resources, repair, and a renewed social contract rooted in justice, dignity and self-determination.
Anything less is just “copaganda.”

In a statement released Tuesday, the university said the UW-Platteville Police Department had responded to a call at Wilgus Hall, a student residence hall, for a “disturbance.” When officers arrived, they found two individuals with gunshot wounds.
One of the individuals police found on the scene has been identified as 22-year-old Kelsie Martin, who was transported to Southwest Health and then med-flighted to UW Hospital, where she was pronounced dead. Martin was the Wilgus Hall Assistant Resident Director and a psychology major from Beloit, the university said in an update. 
The other individual was identified as Hallie Helms, also 22 years old. Helms died on the scene, and preliminary autopsy findings indicate that Helms may have died by a self-inflicted gunshot wound. Helms was a Wilgus Hall resident, and an elementary education major from Baraboo.
Final exams for the remainder of the week have been cancelled. Students with any questions are encouraged to reach out to the dean’s office for their individual college. Students are encouraged to reach out to counseling resources. University counseling will be offering walk-in urgent sessions Wednesday through Friday from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m., and toll free counseling can be reached at 844-602-6680 or 720-272-0004. 
University officials and law enforcement have been tight-lipped about the incident, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported. A shelter-in-place order was issued as a large police presence gathered on the campus Monday. The order lasted for about an hour until 5 p.m. Gov. Tony Evers said he was being briefed on the situation and will remain in close contact with university officials.
UW-Platteville enrolls around 5,800 students, with Wilgus Hall, one of 10 residence buildings, housing 230 students , according to the university’s website. Over 2,800 students live on campus. The shooting occurred at the end of the spring semester and on the first day of final exams.
Some students reported seeing ambulances on scene. One student, 24-year-old Amanda Sawatzki, reportedly heard the voices of two people arguing in the afternoon, and then later heard a loud bang while she was working on a senior seminar paper. 
At a 7 p.m. press conference on Monday, UW-Platteville Police Chief Joseph Hallman wouldn’t confirm whether a shooting had occurred, or whether there had been any injuries. Hallman and university officials called it an isolated incident, and said it is being actively investigated by police.

(Kentucky Lantern photo by Austin Anthony)This story is the second of four parts in a series about homelessness in Western Kentucky.
CENTRAL CITY  — When Courtney Phillips left her friend’s home in Muhlenberg County on Halloween last year, she took with her what she could fit into a backpack along with a leash for her dog Joker. The two of them walked roughly four miles to the county courthouse in Greenville.
The 32-year-old had been fired from her job at a nursing home in Madisonville, she said, because she didn’t have reliable transportation or a phone to let her employer know when she lacked a ride. She had been raised to be independent and take care of herself but had few options. A tornado in 2021 whose path stretched for over a hundred miles had wrecked her late father’s home in Bremen and left it uninhabitable.
A case manager she had worked with saw her on the side of the road, stopped and drove her to a church she had been attending for a couple of months. She said others with nowhere to go had slept in the parking lot of Abundant Life Church in Central City without fear of running into law enforcement.
Phillips found a corner and laid down two quilts and her sleeping bag and put her comforter on top. Her backpack served as a pillow and Joker as a source of warmth. She slept there for weeks, angry and hurt that circumstances had dropped her on cold concrete.
“If I’m out of sight, I’m out of mind,” Phillips told the Lantern. “I’m used to making things happen, and nothing was happening.”

As the nights grew colder, Jennifer Banks, one of the church’s pastors, watched Phillips and others sleeping outside through the church’s cameras. A van often parked there overnight. Police in late September had brought wheelchair-bound Mallie Luken to the parking lot and left her to sleep the night. Banks encouraged Phillips to stay in sight of the cameras so she could watch her for her safety.
After Thanksgiving, when overnight temperatures dropped into the teens, Jennifer’s husband Zachary brought blankets and hand warmers for Phillips and Joker, planning to place a small heater next to them. Phillips was unaware at the time, but Zachary saw that her lips were blue.
“We’re going to the church and letting her in. She’ll freeze to death,” Jennifer Banks recalls thinking. Her church hadn’t considered using their building as a shelter at that point.
Only four days after Phillips began staying at the church she landed a job at another nursing home, the pastor said. She’s still staying in a room at the church, walking and bicycling to work.
“All she needed to do is be able to sleep at night and get a shower, and she got a job,” Jennifer Banks said.
Phillips is grateful for the help she has received from the Bankses and others. As for some in the local community, she says, “They try to sweep us under the rug like we don’t exist.”
 A loose coalition emerges 
Zachary Banks and Jennifer Banks each had their own personal struggles before moving their family to Muhlenberg County in late 2023. The pastor of their “mother church” in Hardin County, also called Abundant Life, had called the couple to lead the new church in Central City. They bought a building that had been home to a Presbyterian congregation.
Zachary Banks had been in and out of prison while struggling with addiction, and Jennifer Banks had dealt with alcoholism. How their Christian faith helped them overcome those challenges informed how they wanted to build their new church community.
“If I can share my experience, if I can share my testimony with people like, ‘Listen, you don’t want to sit in a prison room for seven years,’” Zachary Banks said earlier this year. “I treat the people the way that I wish that somebody would have treated me.”

The two of them, with members of the previous congregation coming along, started talking about their vision and going out into the community, hosting picnics and weekly meals at the church and delivering food. One weekend they helped clean up trash at a local park. They saw people experiencing homelessness, some dealing with substance abuse, and invited them to come to church for food.
The church sought and received a grant from the Felix Martin Foundation, which funds initiatives in the county, to build a mobile shower outside the church.
The Bankses and their church aren’t the only ones who know people experiencing homelessness and want to do more.
Debra Gorham, the director of the Hope2All food pantry in Drakesboro in southern Muhlenberg County, distributes boxes of food to hundreds of families who line up in cars at her pantry. Some have unstable housing situations or live outside. Every Kentucky county is required to have an animal shelter, Gorham told the Lantern in April. But there is no such requirement for people.
“Something about that just doesn’t sit very well with me,” Gorham said.

Kelsey Rolley, a community services coordinator with the agency Pennyrile Allied Community Services, or PACS, in Greenville, fields requests for aid from people dealing with housing, utility bill assistance and more, relying on federal Community Services Block Grant funds to meet those needs. 
But the funding can run out quickly as people struggle to afford rents of $1,000 a month or more, she said, for houses that still need repairs or are not up to code. People are “having to take what they can get.” Emergency shelters in other nearby counties face high demand. The people she helps, whether they have a disability or other issues, often need recurring help.
“I don’t think it would ever be enough for just PACS alone to be able to carry the weight of the burden that we are seeing down here, whether it be the homeless, whether it be just resources in general — everybody’s having to spread them out thin, because the demand is so high,” Rolley said earlier this year.  “If we don’t have enough resources as a community to carry our own — if we can’t help our own, how are we supposed to grow as a population?”
 Putting her faith in ‘Beacon of Hope’
Gwen Clements, a Central City woman, started a Facebook group focused on homelessness and has worked with the Bankses, Rolley and others as a part of a loose coalition of the caring.
In the summer 2024, law enforcement officers serving a warrant came to a large encampment. Later, at the property owner’s request, police cleared the encampment, scattering the roughly dozen people who had been living there, some of whom Clements considers friends.

Clements took to Facebook angry at how the campers had been treated. 
“They’ve been living there for many months without ANY ISSUES!! The encampment is well hidden from public eye, so it’s not an eyesore for the city,” she wrote on Facebook in June 2024. “WHERE ARE THEY SUPPOSE TO GO??? Some of them work in town at local restaurants and walk to work…JUST WHAT ARE THEY SUPPOSE TO DO??”
She threatened to let the displaced campers pitch tents in her front yard “with a huge sign explaining why they are there” for people to see on their way to the dedication of statues of local musical heroes The Everly Brothers and John Prine in downtown Central City.
She said a Central City police officer came to her house shortly after her Facebook post to advise her against that, saying a city ordinance prohibited pitching tents in one’s yard.
With Clements’ help, some who had lived in the encampment rented rooms at the Central Inn, a motel at 300 East Everly Brothers Blvd. Clements’ Facebook group members sometimes send her money to put up people at the Central Inn to keep them out of dangerous cold.

Clements wants to do more. In her vision the county would have a shelter, community kitchen and space for people experiencing homelessness.
The Central Inn — and its possibilities — came into focus as a possible solution as support began to gather around an idea floated by Abundant Life Church: Buy the Central Inn and turn it into apartments where people without housing can stay, pay rent and build financial stability and a credit history, before moving on to another rental elsewhere in town. Other services would be provided by local agencies to help those dealing with mental illness and other issues. 
The church posted on Facebook about the proposal and Clements, a supporter of the idea, shared the post with her Facebook group.
The church called it the “Beacon of Hope.”
Next in the Lantern’s series: In a meeting with local officials and downtown business owners, the “Beacon of Hope” faces pushback.
  The Banks and others at Abundant Life Church dubbed their idea for buying the Central Inn and using it to ease the housing crisis the “Beacon of Hope.”(Austin Anthony for the Kentucky Lantern)

(Photo by Leigh Vogel/Getty Images for Caring Across Generations)During my 14 years in the Kentucky House of Representatives, I was deeply involved in overseeing Kentucky’s Medical Assistance Program better known as Medicaid. I co-chaired a committee that made an in-depth study of Medicaid that resulted in legislation that I sponsored to address waste, fraud and abuse.
Recently, Medicaid and its recipients have been misrepresented, resulting in divisive and misleading rhetoric. It is crucial that we examine the facts carefully and address the misinformation stemming from recent news reporting and pending legislative actions.
Medicaid funds do not go directly to recipients. Medicaid services prepay for medical care, such as doctor visits, procedures and medications to aid low-income families, children, parents, caregivers, pregnant women, seniors and people with disabilities.
The proposal in Congress to cut Medicaid by $625 billion over 10 years, leaving an estimated 7.6 million people without health insurance by 2034, along with the impending work requirements, suggests a lack of sensitivity or understanding regarding the nature of this program and the demographics of Medicaid recipients in Kentucky and nationwide.
History
Let’s begin with a quick overview: Medicaid, established in 1965, is a public insurance program that provides health coverage to low-income families and individuals, including children, parents, pregnant women, seniors, and people with disabilities. It is funded jointly by the federal government and the states. Funds allocated for Medicaid do not go directly to recipients but are used to pay health care providers on a fee-for-service basis or through prepayment arrangements for medical care.
This includes doctor visits, medical procedures, medications and more. In Kentucky, the federal government pays about 70% and the state 30% of traditional Medicaid reimbursements while the match is 90% federal-10% state for expanded Medicaid, allowing Kentucky to provide “significant health care services” at a good value.
Myth
Now let’s look at the myth surrounding work requirements for Medicaid care. As the chair of the 1993 Program Review and Investigations Committee and principal sponsor of House Bill 127, an act relating to waste, fraud and abuse, I have consistently kept up with the Kentucky Medicaid Program over the years. It appears a long-standing misconception has produced an effort to create a solution for a problem that does not exist.




Full-time and part-time workers must rely on Medicaid and SNAP, a nutrition assistance program, because they do not earn a living wage to support their families. Maybe addressing this issue would help find a solution to the real, underlying problem we are currently facing.			


Between 2015 and 2017, over 60% of Kentucky Medicaid recipients consistently held full-time or part-time employment. According to 2023 data from the Kaiser Foundation, Kentucky currently ranks 10th  in the nation for the number of “working Medicaid recipients.” There are 56.4% with full-time employment and 14.6% with part-time employment. Subsequently, 70.7% of Medicaid recipients are currently working, while 29.3% are not employed. 
The non-working group comprises elderly individuals, people with disabilities, children and caregivers who together account for approximately 19.8%. These individuals do not meet any of the work requirements currently being proposed. Consequently, the legislative proposals being considered would only affect 9.5% of the remaining Medicaid population here in Kentucky —  undoubtedly, a solution for a problem that does not exist.
The real, underlying problem
Work requirements put up barriers to Medicaid coverage. Changes to work and reporting requirements and eligibility criteria have been shown to cause confusion among Medicaid enrollees, leading to substantial coverage loss, even for those who are eligible.
 A 2022 Kaiser Family Foundation report revealed that nearly 70% of people who had been dropped from Medicaid lost coverage due to procedural reasons. This is just the latest evidence of the harmful impact on peoples’ access to health care caused by recent changes in Medicaid policy. During the time studied, Kentucky disenrolled 71,000 enrollees for missed paperwork and other procedural reasons. Of these, 74% (52,540) lost coverage attributed to barriers created by the beginnings of a state Medicaid work requirement that a court blocked from taking full effect, while 26% were found ineligible. As a result, 52,540 individuals lost access to health care services.
 Clearly, any barriers affecting Kentucky’s Medicaid recipients warrant reevaluation. Our diligent Medicaid recipients merit equitable treatment and consideration.
However, Houston, we do have a problem: Kentucky reported that in 2022, half of working Medicaid enrollees (50%) were employed by companies with over 100 employees and 42.8% worked in the agriculture/service sector. These full-time and part-time workers must rely on Medicaid and SNAP, a nutrition assistance program, because they do not earn a living wage to support their families. Maybe addressing this issue would help find a solution to the real, underlying problem we are currently facing.
The Congressional Budget Office’s analysis shows that this “one big, beautiful bill” will reduce expansion reimbursements, add additional cost to Medicaid recipients, add work requirements, increase coverage barriers, cut Medicaid spending by $625 billion over 10 years, and leave at least 7.6 million more people without health insurance by 2034.
True leadership involves building bridges, not barriers.

(Screenshot from livestream)The Arkansas PBS Commission named Sajni Kumpuris as the public television network’s interim director during a special meeting Tuesday. 
Kumpuris, who currently serves as Arkansas PBS’ education director and production director, will assume her new role on May 26. She replaces Courtney Pledger. The public media network announced in April that Pledger would leave her position in May.

In a statement issued Tuesday evening, Kumpuris said she was “honored” to step into the new role.
“This organization has long been a vital resource for our communities, and I’m committed to continuing our mission of providing high-quality educational content and programming that reflects the values and needs of all Arkansans,” she said. “I look forward to working with our incredible team as we build on our legacy of service and innovation.”
The majority of the eight-member board voted in favor of Kumpuris after meeting in executive section for nearly an hour. The voice vote included one audible dissent. Kumpuris will serve in an interim capacity while a national search for a permanent executive director is organized and conducted, Commission Chairman West Doss said during the virtual meeting.
“We’ve had a very good meeting of the commissioners and took the first step towards finding us a new executive director of Arkansas PBS,” Doss said. “We had three excellent candidates with excellent credentials, all internal, and we are all blessed to have them at Arkansas PBS.”
The other two internal candidates considered were Associate Executive Director and Chief Financial Officer Jason Kunau and Operations Director DeWayne Wilbur. All three candidates will be considered for the permanent position, Doss said. 
The permanent director will succeed Pledger, who joined Arkansas PBS in 2017 and also serves as vice chair of PBS’ 27-member national board of directors.
“It has been my great honor to lead Arkansas PBS through a transformative time that points to the limitless potential of our statewide public media network,” Pledger said in a statement issued last month.
Under Pledger’s leadership, Arkansas PBS expanded its K-12 educational programming, launching “Arkansas AMI” when schools closed during the pandemic. She also “significantly increased the reach and impact” of ArkansasIDEAS, the state’s most-used online professional development platform for teachers, according to an April press release. The network also started broadcasting state high school sports championships.
During her tenure at Arkansas PBS, Pledger also faced multiple conflicts with the state Legislature, including in 2023 when the organization’s regularly scheduled 2022 audit indicated that administrators might have sidestepped state laws related to contract bidding. 
Arkansas PBS announces executive director’s departure next month

Pledger told lawmakers the agency had no intention to break or circumvent state law and had learned from its “mistakes and errors.”
Arkansas PBS’ spending authority has repeatedly faced resistance in the Arkansas House. Appropriations need approval from three-fourths of lawmakers, and PBS’ fiscal year 2026 appropriation required five attempts to get 76 House members’ support.
Earlier this year, Republican Sen. Dan Sullivan of Jonesboro filed a bill to abolish the Arkansas Educational Television Commission, which oversees Arkansas PBS’ programs and finances, and transfer its powers and authorities to the state education department. 
After the bill to abolish the commission passed the Senate in February, Doss and Sullivan said they reached an agreement that led Sullivan to leave the commission alone.
Sullivan, the legislature’s most vocal critic of Arkansas PBS, unsuccessfully tried to reduce the public television station’s spending authority during the 2022 and 2024 fiscal sessions.
The governor appointed Sullivan’s wife, Maria Sullivan, to the commission last year. Doss previously said that Maria Sullivan will lead an Arkansas PBS task force aimed at better serving homeschoolers, which is a high priority for her husband.
The commission will next meet on June 5.

Hanna told the Michigan state House Families and Veterans Committee that has been the result for moms who’ve accessed cash payments through Rx Kids, which began as a program to address infant poverty in Flint, but has expanded to Kalamazoo and the Upper Peninsula, with other locations in Michigan to be served soon.
Hanna, a Flint-area physician who sounded alarm bells about the long-term health impacts of the Flint Water Crisis in 2014, said the number one thing moms buy with the $500 monthly cash payments the program gives moms after they give birth is diapers. And in Flint, Hanna said the program has distributed $10 million to more than 2,000 families and has seen reductions in smoking in mothers, increased birth weights and less reports of abuse or neglect.
The program is funded with money from the state government as well as local governments and private groups and also affords participants a one-time $1,500 cash payment during pregnancy.
“When we think about child welfare, it is one of the biggest cost items in our state budget and in our federal budget,” Hanna said. “The peak age of child welfare involvement is zero to one, that first year of life, more than double any other age of life and that’s largely because of poverty.”
And as Michigan officials on the local and statewide level seek solutions to grow the state’s population as it’s predicted to decline over the next few years, the Trump administration is looking to address declining birth rates.
A recent proposal by the Trump administration of a $5,000 “baby bonus” for moms after they give birth has made headlines around the country and is being matched by public discourse surrounding the high costs associated with pregnancy, giving birth and parenthood.
A group of Michigan Senate Democrats stood alongside Hanna at the state Capitol in march as they unveiled their plan to decrease the costs of parenthood in Michigan, which included interest in making Rx Kids a statewide program.
When asked if the Republican-led House would consider supporting Senate Democrats plan or propose their own population growth plan during an April 24 news conference, Michigan Speaker of the House Matt Hall (R-Richland Township) didn’t respond directly to questioning about the potential of “baby bonuses” from the Michigan Advance, but said the chamber is reviewing its options and is working on policies to make life more affordable for Michiganders across the board.
Discussions about the state budget are being had right now, but chair of the House Families and Veterans Committee, Kathy Schmaltz (R-Jackson), didn’t confirm with the Advance after the Tuesday committee meeting if a statewide expansion of baby cash payments is on the table.
“I think it’s important that we bring in organizations that are here to help families. It’s not that we agree with everything that goes on. It’s just that we need to hear from different agencies who are out there and what they’re doing for families and babies and what’s available,”  Schmaltz said. “We will take all the information and we’ll sift through it and find out what works, what doesn’t work and what should be funded and what shouldn’t be funded.”

(Photo by Charles Paullin/Inside Climate News)As Elena Schlossberg of Prince William County, Virginia sees it, the community effort to fight the richest companies in the world seeking to build data centers began about a decade ago when opposition coalesced in the early days of the industry’s development.
Then, a couple of years ago, when people began to learn much more about the warehouse-like server farms proliferating at double the earlier rate, the fight strengthened with a meeting in Warrenton.
“That was where we all just started saying, ‘OK, in order to fight this behemoth, we have to have some organizational process,’” Schlossberg said. “We have to be able to communicate. We have to be able to support each other. We have to have a clearinghouse for all the information.”
Schlossberg’s group, the Coalition to Protect Prince William County, about 35 miles southwest of the nation’s capital, teamed up with several other groups, including the Piedmont Environmental Council, the Sierra Club and the National Parks Conservation Association, and met in one of the areas facing development pressure that could now triple in the state. They formed the Virginia Data Center Reform Coalition.
Such community opposition is the focal point of a recent report by Data Center Watch, a research organization tracking data center opposition. A key finding: “$64 billion in U.S. data center projects have been blocked or delayed by a growing wave of local, bipartisan opposition.”
“What was once quiet infrastructure is now a national flashpoint — and communities are pushing back,” the report says. “This report highlights political risks and local opposition as frequent factors in data center project delays or cancellations, including community resistance, environmental concerns, and zoning issues.”
As data center development explodes, the industry has faced particular challenges in Virginia, its global epicenter. Some $900 million in projects in the state have been blocked, and $45.8 billion in projects have been delayed. Yet, environmental advocates say few protections have been put in place.
At the state level, dozens of bills were introduced in the Virginia General Assembly this year to enact development safeguards, but only a symbolic one about utility costs was signed into law by Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin.
Josh Levi, president of the Data Center Coalition, a trade group representing many of the tech companies developing projects in Virginia, said the group is “committed to working collaboratively with local officials, policymakers, and regulatory bodies at every level.
“Data center companies site projects where they are permitted under local zoning ordinances, rules, and regulations, which are developed by local leaders representing their communities,” Levi said. “The industry seeks to work collaboratively with local officials to minimize community impacts, which often includes participating in town halls and other community and public engagement opportunities.”
 Examples of pushback 

The locations of projects getting blocked or delayed are mostly centered in the Northern Virginia suburbs and exurbs of Washington, where the internet began. The region now serves a vast federal government, defense and intelligence complex.
A couple other projects highlighted in the report branch out into the Northern Neck, south of the Potomac River, and outside Richmond. Virginia is home to 13 percent of the world’s data center capacity, while 70 percent of the world’s internet traffic moves through computers in the state.
One case study in the report highlighted the effort by Schlossberg’s group, the Manassas Battlefield Trust and others to stop the $24.7 billion Digital Gateway development of a campus with 37 data centers in Prince William County near the Manassas National Battlefield Park. Another is the Bren Pointe residential community in Fairfax County, fighting a $165 million hyperscale project that would need transmission lines and a five-acre substation 60 feet from the boundary of a townhome complex.
In another project in Warrenton, proposed by Amazon with an undetermined development cost, hundreds of people, including actor Robert Duvall, attended and spoke in opposition, according to FauquierNow. Legal challenges have stalled the town council’s approval of the project, and during that period, council members who supported it have been voted out of office.
The report noted that Republican elected officials made up 55 percent of those critical of projects, expressing concerns over the use of tax incentives. Democrats made up 45 percent of those opposing projects, largely over environmental concerns.
But many elected officials are approving data centers.
“What will it take for people in positions of power to make different choices?” Schlossberg said. “As plain as the nose on my face, data centers are impacting the integrity of our water and our air and our communities and our reliable, affordable electricity.”
Ann Wheeler, former chair of the Board of Supervisors in Prince William County, declined to comment on why she lost her Democratic primary race for re-election, but stood by her choices to support the industry in today’s digitally driven society.
The environmental concerns used “misinformation” as part of a campaign of BANANA, or Build Absolutely Nothing Anywhere Near Anyone, she said, and supporting the facilities’ construction meant union jobs and hundreds of millions of dollars in local revenue to support social services her party has traditionally aligned with.
“They’ll go in somewhere,” Wheeler said, adding her county had resources for responsible planning. “I would rather have that tax revenue in Virginia.”
The report did not feature the opposition to a proposed data center in Pittsylvania County. There, community pushback and a report commissioned by the Southern Environmental Law Center, which highlighted the health effects from on-site, fossil fuel-powered generation equipment, led to the Board of Supervisors rejecting a needed rezoning application, effectively killing the project. The report included other case studies of successful data center opposition in Indiana, Texas and Arizona.
 Legislative failures

Virginia’s legislative research arm, the Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission, issued a report in December that comprehensively examined the costs of data center development. It found that data-center energy demand would roughly triple from 2023 to 2040 if development went unconstrained. Even so, the legislative protections proposed this year failed to make it across the finish line.
Youngkin vetoed a bill that would have had localities require a description of substation needs and a study on the noise the facilities close to homes and schools generate, which can come from their air conditioning units, and onsite power generators. House Democrats killed a requirement for state regulators to review data center power contractsto ensure that electricity generation and transmission lines could support the need.
One change that did pass requires the State Corporation Commission, which regulates utilities, to review cost allocations for data center projects between consumers and the center operators. The commission already had that authority.
One Republican lawmaker, Del. Ian Lovejoy of Prince William County, pushed for ways to have the industry pay for the electric grid upgrades it necessitates. But debate on the bills married business and labor union interests, which “usually are opposed to one another,” Lovejoy said. “When those two groups agree on something, [there are] very difficult headwinds.”
The General Assembly was also leery of interfering with local land use decisions in an election year, Lovejoy said.
All 100 delegates are up for election this year, along with the governor. Democrats control the chamber 51-49. The state Senate, also controlled by Democrats, 21-19, has elections in two years. A similar debate driven by community opposition to new solar projects also took place this year in the legislature.
Community opposition to data centers, Lovejoy said, “is going to affect more and more people when they build data centers directly next to houses. That’s the cautionary tale. Look at Loudoun [County], look at Prince William. Don’t build them next to schools, don’t build them next to houses. Make sure they’re set back properly, or you’re going to have the same issues that we’re having.”
Schlossberg said members of her group traveled a couple of hours down to Richmond one early morning during the legislative session earlier in the year. They were there to lobby for the swath of data-center bills as part of the group’s increasing battle at the local, state and federal level that is costing the industry money and creating a community of opponents.
“I think it’s important to really talk about the building of community,” Schlossberg said. “In a digital world, I think we have seen people who have never felt lonelier. And I think that’s been a really important positive outcome, is that people connect.”

As with federal educational policy generally, it is not likely to have a significant impact on K-12 education because education has always been a state and local matter. In fact, in 2024, Gov. Glenn Youngkin issued Executive Order 30 and an associated set of education guidelines that have already generated important action related to AI in education, including a summit this week that brings together educators in the K-12 and higher education systems to try to create alignment and educational pathways to best serve students in the commonwealth. 
Trump’s EO is a bit redundant to Youngkin’s EO, and both miss the forest for the trees. 
K-12 schools serve multiple purposes; two of the most important are to prepare young people to be productive members of a deliberative democracy and to prepare them for the workforce. To properly serve either of those roles has always meant ensuring that students are technologically literate, meaning not necessarily that they are adept at using technology, but rather that they make good choices about what, if any, technologies might be used in personal or professional situations. 
Today, artificial intelligence dominates the technology discourse, and the potential effects of AI on the workforce and civic life are significant. Concerning the workforce, the Brookings Institute’s late 2024 analysis concluded that “…more than 30% of all workers could see at least 50% of their occupation’s tasks disrupted by generative AI.” On democracy, the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace writes that “AI models enable malicious actors to manipulate information and disrupt electoral processes, threatening democracies.”  This research makes it clear: If public schools are to serve their highest purposes, it is incumbent upon educators to make sure students are AI literate.
Being AI literate, though, means much more than just learning to use AI; it also means being aware of the ethics and potential risks. We know, for example, that AI is hurting the environment and that AI companies are defending themselves against credible claims of intellectual property violations. Students need to know that, too. Additionally, integrating chatbots into the learning process potentially dehumanizes a necessarily human experience. Absent this knowledge and the right skills and dispositions around technology and AI, our young people are less likely to be able to successfully engage in an increasingly technological civic age and are less likely to be prepared to succeed in an increasingly technological workforce. 
However, even that broader, ethics-inclusive approach to AI literacy is too narrow. AI is the latest form of technology to capture our attention, but our society is increasingly dominated by other technologies, including technologies of surveillance (some of which are powered by AI). Nearly all aspects of our society, from schooling to law enforcement, are changing because of technological developments. Long ago, institutions of higher education developed whole interdisciplinary programs of study that consider the historical, cultural and social impacts of science and technology on society. This is the broader, more interdisciplinary approach that needs to be integrated into our K-12 schools. 
Interdisciplinary programming is challenging in our siloed K-12 system, but it is possible and worth trying. We could, for example, ensure that when students read novels in school, they read one or two books that force discussion about the role of technology in our society. There is no shortage of good books like that. When students learn about history, they should learn about the Luddites. They might learn, for instance, that to be a Luddite was not just to be anti-technology; rather, Luddites started a labor movement that pushed back against the sort of automation that AI could contribute to today. For math, students could study quantitative reasoning and learn about how much of AI and machine learning is based on inferential statistics. 
I am the parent of a public school student and a critical friend of technology who wants my child to be able to explore the affordances of technology for learning. However, I am not interested in my child engaging in the sort of AI integration that Trump’s EO speaks to. If my child struggles to grasp a concept, I want them to struggle through it with their classmates and teachers, not some AI chatbot tutor. 
And, as a taxpayer, I am not interested in supporting the integration of technology that comes from the “public-private partnerships” that are highlighted in the EO. That’s a not-so-subtle attempt to further enrich the technology leaders who sat on stage at Trump’s inauguration. Instead of teaching my child to use Adobe Firefly to make fancy reports, I want my child’s teachers to help them learn to navigate a world that is increasingly technological and morally complex. 
Among some members of society, there is a near-religious devotion to AI. And, coincidentally, how religion is handled in public schools (at least for now, as the Supreme Court newly considers the place of religion in public schools) may be instructive. The common saying has been that schools can teach about religion, but they cannot teach religion. I favor a similar approach to AI in education. We should teach about AI, not teach with or especially for AI. In fact, if our schools are to prepare students like my child for the world ahead, they must largely look away from the narrow and shiny new object of AI and meet the broader societal challenge this technology represents.

This story was originally published by PublicSource. 
Corey O’Connor, a longtime city and county elected official, East End resident and the son of Pittsburgh’s 58th mayor, has the inside track to be the city’s 62nd mayor after winning the Democratic primary Tuesday.
The Associated Press called the race at 10:05 p.m. on Tuesday evening, with O’Connor more than 4,000 votes ahead and 80% of the votes counted. By 11 p.m. O’Connor had 53% of the tally, with 96% of votes counted.
“Your voices and your call for accountable leadership and growth have been heard in this Democratic primary,” O’Connor told a crowd of supporters at Nova Place in Allegheny Center.
He pulled off a rare defeat of a sitting mayor, denying Ed Gainey a second term after pummeling him with more than $1 million worth of mostly negative advertisements leading up to the vote. “Pittsburgh deserves better,” O’Connor declared in December, and proceeded to scathe Gainey’s handling of city finances, police leadership and economic development during more than three years in the office.

Flanked by supporters chanting his name, O’Connor declared that “we are going to win in the fall.” He echoed his campaign promises of enhancing the city’s police force, delivering affordable housing for all and supporting businesses of “all sizes.”
At the center of his address was the idea of pushing Pittsburgh into an era of growth, via a strategy that would begin with families first. He also said a “neighborhood-oriented” approach was necessary. This would mean investing in the city’s small business district instead of “doing study after study.”
Despite his criticism of Gainey’s administration, he said the current mayor’s love for Pittsburgh was never in doubt. They simply had differing plans for the future of the city.
O’Connor called for unity in the Democratic Party during and after his speech. To those who didn’t vote for him, he said, “Let’s sit down [and] have the conversation.”
“To me, it starts fresh. Tomorrow starts a whole new election in the fall, and we’re going to need everybody to take that message of growth and opportunity to our fall election.”
“This has been a wonderful four years,” Gainey said in a concession speech at the Pittsburgh Federation of Teachers headquarters in South Side. “We didn’t put a crack in the glass ceiling. We shattered it.”
Gainey told his supporters that the coalition of voters that helped him prevail four years ago will remain “on the rise” despite the setback.
“Don’t be defeated,” Gainey said. “Don’t be sad. Be glad of the progress that we made. It would have been easy for me to bow to power but it was more exhilarating to fight them for you.”
Gainey congratulated O’Connor on running a “well-designed” campaign and, after some in the crowd jeered, said, “We’re not going to spread hate.”
2025 race a very different climate from 2021
“For me, Pittsburgh should be every family’s first choice,” O’Connor said after casting his vote Tuesday morning. “I think that’s the kind of administration we would build. And we’re excited to have that opportunity.”
O’Connor will be a heavy favorite in the general election due to the large Democratic majority that has picked all of Pittsburgh’s mayors since the 1930s.
O’Connor, 40, is just the second challenger to unseat a Pittsburgh mayor running for reelection in nearly a century. The other was Gainey, who beat then-Mayor Bill Peduto in 2021.
O’Connor’s win comes as the city and nation are in a very different place than they were when social justice activists and a restless electorate took down Peduto and swept Gainey into office.
Then, the nation was wobbling out of the pandemic’s economic shock and Joe Biden was beginning his presidency. Now, Donald Trump is back in the White House and city leaders are wondering how his push for massive spending cuts will reshape the city the next mayor will lead.
Then, Democratic politics was dominated by calls for police reform, with the protests following the murder of George Floyd fresh in the national mind. Now, neither candidate centered police accountability in their campaign, and both focused on economic and housing concerns after those issues were central to last year’s presidential race.

O’Connor could inherit Gainey’s struggles
O’Connor spent much of the campaign criticizing Gainey’s record, typical of a challenger, and would have his work cut out for him to make good on promises to build more affordable housing units than Gainey did, add officers to the police force and stabilize city finances that he has said are in disarray.
“I see a mayor that is managing decline instead of working to grow Pittsburgh,” O’Connor said when he launched his campaign in December.
His economic development platform includes a 90-neighborhood “cleanup program,” a promise to remediate blighted buildings and a pledge to invest $10 million in 10 business districts about the city — an idea similar to the Peduto-era program Avenues of Hope, which targeted investment at Pittsburgh’s Black business communities.
He faulted Gainey for not overseeing enough affordable housing construction and said he would alter the city’s permitting and zoning system to encourage development. PublicSource reported in March that the city’s real estate and development industries were donating largely to O’Connor, and some industry leaders said they did so because they found it too burdensome to navigate Pittsburgh’s zoning and permitting process under Gainey.
Finding a permanent police chief would be near the top of the next mayor’s to-do list. O’Connor blasted Gainey throughout the campaign for failing to secure a permanent one; Gainey’s first pick, Larry Scirotto, quit last year to referee college basketball and his pick to succeed Scirotto resigned before being confirmed by City Council.
Perhaps the most daunting challenge in 2026 and beyond lies in the city’s balance sheet, which O’Connor said contains a looming disaster.
Real estate tax revenue has been depressed by changes to the assessment process and post-pandemic teleworking trends. The city’s current five-year plan projects the rainy day fund to shrink from $208 million at the start of 2024 to $72 million at the end of 2029. Avoiding that fate would require cuts to staff or services, a revenue boost, or both.
O’Connor’s argument that Gainey has overseen decline in Pittsburgh was rebutted last week by new data from the U.S. Census Bureau, which estimated that Pittsburgh grew by more than 1% last year and sustained modest net growth across the first four years of this decade — a major development considering the city’s decades of mostly steady decline since the 1980s.
O’Connor follows father’s path
O’Connor grew up in Squirrel Hill and attended Central Catholic High School, where he later coached golf. His father, Bob O’Connor, became a City Council member when Corey was 7, became mayor when the son was 22 and died of brain cancer less than a year after that, in 2006.
Corey O’Connor rarely talked about his father on the campaign trail this year, but has spent decades following his example. After graduating from Duquesne University and working for a few years in the office of former U.S. Rep. Mike Doyle, he ran for his father’s old City Council seat in 2011 using money left over from his late father’s campaign account.
He stayed in the seat for a decade before being appointed Allegheny County controller, but soon turned his gaze on his father’s highest achievement, the mayor’s office that his father reached, but held so briefly.

His political foes debate how much he truly accomplished as a member of council, but he was doubtlessly present for significant moments in Pittsburgh’s history. He served alongside the mayor who succeeded his father, Luke Ravenstahl, through eight years of Peduto’s tenure and the progressive shift that brought Gainey into City Hall. The city emerged from state financial oversight during his decade on council, neighborhoods like Lawrenceville and the Strip District were transformed and unfathomable tragedy came to Pittsburgh with the Tree of Life shooting.
The city was finding its footing as a medical and educational hub when O’Connor entered public life, and it faces some comparable turbulence today. The local economy is still evolving to the post-pandemic reality, and the Trump administration’s proposed budget cuts would reshape numerous city institutions, including City Hall.
Moreno wins Republican primary
Tony Moreno, a retired police detective from Brighton Heights, is the Republican mayoral nominee for the second time. He was an unlikely GOP champion in 2021, first running in the Democratic primary and ultimately winning the Republican nod through write-in votes.
There was no write-in effort this time as city Republicans had a competitive mayoral primary for the first time since 2001. Moreno defeated Thomas West, a Lawrenceville clothing store owner.
Moreno stood from his chair, slowly, with a smile in the back room of Moonlit Cafe in Brookline when the first poll results showed him taking an early lead.
Moreno, who spent most of his day at the polls — even directing traffic following a minor crash on Route 51 near Carrick — said Pittsburgh’s move toward progressive leadership has gone “too far” for the historically blue-collar, Democratic city.
He said his campaign transcends party politics. “I believe the message is the win,” Moreno said.
For Cindy and Jerry Weisser, Moreno’s approachable demeanor attracts them to the Republican nominee.
“He’s like one of us,” Cindy said while wearing a black and gold “Tony Moreno for Mayor” T-shirt.

The couple said their North Side neighbors include several condemned properties, and they believe Moreno is best poised to improve struggling neighborhoods.
Moreno has campaigned heavily on public safety, calling for more support to the police force and better access to mental health services, such as having social workers on police calls, he said.
Moreno ran largely on his background as a police officer, saying the city administration has betrayed its officers and should invest more resources in the force.
Gainey defeated Moreno in the 2021 general election, 71% to 28%. Moreno reported raising $4,000 in the months leading up to the primary.
Looking forward to his general election campaign against O’Connor, Moreno said his team is celebrating now, but is ready to push his same campaign messages into the coming months.
“It’s just asking the questions the community is asking,” Moreno said.
Democrats prepare for new era
City Councilor Bobby Wilson, whose district includes parts of the North Side and the Strip District, said the primary result was “very promising for the future of Pittsburgh.” Speaking at the nominee’s party, he said O’Connor would be ready on day one to tackle issues facing the city including tax revenue from Downtown and an aging emergency services vehicle fleet.
“This is a correction from three years ago,” Wilson said. “It’s time to move on.”
“He and I could always have very honest and frank conversations together, even when we disagreed,” Lavelle added.
Councilor Khari Mosley, who represents Gainey’s neighborhood in the northeast of the city, said the mayor has been “a great partner.”
“I think his lived experience gave him a unique perspective on the challenges that are facing the city,” Mosley said. “He’s lived through a lot of challenges that so many Pittsburghers are living and experiencing.”

(Photo by Troy Bennett / Maine Morning Star)Krystal Emerson never imagined her son would spend his days at school being forcibly moved against his will by school staff and shut in an empty room. 
But during the 2023-24 school year at Ellsworth Elementary-Middle School, that’s what happened — at least 18 times, according to Emerson and school district incident reports reviewed by the Maine Morning Star. Staff members put the 7-year-old boy in holds, forced him into empty rooms and did not let him out until he calmed down or his parents picked him up. 


May 21: Restraint and seclusion are only supposed to be used on students in emergency situations. Accounts from families and educators show how districts’ interpretation of state law vary widely and how traumatic the experiences can be.
May 22: State data reveals only a fraction of Maine’s schools and districts are consistently reporting incidents of restraint and seclusion in violation of state law. Even with the underreporting, Maine schools are relying on these practices thousands of times per year.
May 23: How one district worked with researchers to change its approach to student behavior and significantly reduced the use of restraint and seclusion

“It broke him, and it broke me,” Emerson said.
The trauma became so severe that her son, now a third grader, no longer attends school in person, she said.
What happened to Emerson’s son is not an isolated case. Across Maine, schools use restraint and seclusion on students more than 10,000 times each year, according to Maine Department of Education data — with some districts resorting to the emergency tactics regularly while others have changed policies and taken other steps so that such interventions are only used as a last resort.
​In recent years, Maine as a whole has made an effort to reduce restraint and seclusion in schools, particularly for students with disabilities, with the U.S. Department of Education citing staff and student injuries and the resulting trauma for students as the reasons to curtail their use. The department has also condemned and discouraged these practices for years under multiple presidential administrations. Rare cases have resulted in serious injuries to students and even death.
A 2021 state law limits restraint and seclusion to emergencies. But as Maine educators report more challenging student behavior in the years since pandemic school closures, there have been calls to allow school staff to restrain and seclude children more often. A newly proposed bill would broaden the circumstances under which school staff could restrain or seclude students, igniting debate among educators, parents and lawmakers about how to manage student behavior without inflicting harm.
The Maine Education Association and the Maine School Management Association, representing teachers and administrators statewide, both support the proposal, citing increased reports of disruptive and violent student behavior — something educators nationwide have also reported in recent years.
The Gardiner-area school system, Maine School Administrative District (MSAD) 11, has led the push for that proposal. Victoria Duguay, principal of River View Community School in Gardiner, and MSAD 11 Superintendent Patricia Hopkins shared stories with lawmakers of students who hit and spit at adults, scream in hallways, throw chairs and destroy other students’ schoolwork.
Under the 2021 state law, school staff can only restrain students (immobilize them and move them against their will) or seclude them (isolate them in a room that they can’t leave) if their behavior “poses an imminent danger of serious physical injury” — requiring medical intervention beyond first aid, according to the Maine Department of Education regulations that govern restraint and seclusion.
“Staff are being hit, they’re being bit, but it doesn’t meet the threshold of serious imminent danger, because a 5-year-old isn’t going to [cause] an injury that requires medical care,” Hopkins said during an April 23 public hearing.
This extreme behavior, when it happens in a public place at school, traumatizes other students who witness it, Duguay said. The school sometimes has to close off access to common spaces — the gym or cafeteria — if a student acts out in a hallway through which students would need to pass. 
Under the legislation MSAD 11 is supporting, staff would be able to move students against their will to a seclusion room or another quiet space without it counting as a restraint, which districts have to record, document, and report to the state. 
But some educators who have pursued alternative training don’t agree that loosening restraint and seclusion requirements is the answer. 
“The consequences of passing this bill will only inflict more trauma on students,” said Audrey Bartholomew, associate professor and coordinator of special education programs at the University of New England, who trains special education teachers. “Additionally, the behavior will keep happening, because restraint and seclusion is not an appropriate response to challenging behavior, and it will in no way help students remediate their behavior. These should not be referred to as strategies, treatments or solutions.”
Inside the three-hour restraint and seclusion of a 7-year-old
In October 2023, Emerson’s son started a behavior plan to help with concentration and self-regulation. The plan, which Emerson shared with the Maine Morning Star, highlighted the mother’s concerns about her son’s anger, dysregulation, anxiety and ADHD, and noted Emerson’s finding that occupational therapy had helped her son better regulate. 
One week after the plan was put into place, the boy arrived at Ellsworth Elementary-Middle School already agitated, hit another student with a Pete the Cat stuffed animal and tried to leave the classroom, setting off a series of escalating interventions in which staff physically restrained him, relocated him against his will, and ultimately placed him in a small room where he stayed until his father arrived, according to incident reports shared with the Maine Morning Star.
The reports, which staff or administrators are required to write, offer an inside look at the behavior leading up to the restraint, how the situation escalated as staff restrained and secluded the boy, and how it continued for three hours, ending when Seth Emerson picked his son up from a seclusion room.
When the second grader initially tried to leave his classroom, two educators cornered the boy in a hallway nook, according to the report written by the school’s assistant principal. When he tried to push past them, they placed a mat between themselves and the child to block him from hitting them, and initiated the first of several physical holds. Each time he was released, he briefly calmed down but didn’t follow directions to sit still or stay in a designated spot, prompting a cycle: he would attempt to flee, staff would block him, the boy would resist, and staff would restrain him again, the report says.
About an hour in, while hiding in a locker, he asked to go home. A staff member moved him to a classroom, where he hid under a desk, retrieved rocks from his backpack, and threw them at staff, the report said. While the report described the projectiles as rocks, Emerson said her son had pebbles in his backpack. 
Two hours in, staff called his parents. Even after he calmed down, they placed him in a seclusion room — referred to as a “quiet room” in the report — where they continued telling him to sit in a specific spot. When his father arrived, the boy walked out on his own, calm and cooperative.
Incidents like that continued for several more months for reasons that Emerson said did not warrant these measures: After he pulled books off shelves, punched a door, or refused to accompany staff to a quiet room, staff would put him in a physical hold or placed him in a room alone, according to a complaint Emerson filed with the district.
“I never condoned any of the behavior, whether he was throwing a book or whether he was yelling or running out of the classroom,” she said. “But he was not getting any education whatsoever last year. He was literally just going to school and being restrained and secluded.”

Frequent seclusions push an educator to quit
It’s not only students and their families who feel the trauma from restraints and seclusion. The educators who are told to put their hands on children feel it, too, several current and former teachers and education technicians told the Maine Morning Star.
Ashley Rose took a job as an ed tech at SeDoMoCha Elementary School in Dover-Foxcroft in August while working toward a degree in special education. But after months of witnessing staff placing students in empty rooms as they screamed and cried to be let out, she changed course. 
In March, Rose switched her major, deciding she no longer wanted to become a teacher. On April 28, she resigned, writing to Superintendent Stacy Shorey that she had repeatedly raised concerns with supervisors about the school’s frequent use of seclusion, the lack of staff training on student behavior, and the absence of alternatives — without seeing meaningful change.
SeDoMoCha Elementary School has “quiet rooms” located within special education classrooms — which Rose described as 10-by-6-foot rooms with no windows. Some have benches and one light, while others are entirely empty, she said. All the doors have windows in them so staff can monitor students. 
In her 10 years of working in special education, she has never seen such frequent use of quiet rooms, Rose said. 
In December, Rose found herself participating in her first seclusion. The student she was working with wasn’t physically aggressive, just loud, and Rose’s plan had been to escort her into the special education classroom — not the quiet room — to help her calm down. 
The student went with her voluntarily but was crying, she said. When they got to the classroom, another staff member who had worked at the school longer said it was part of that student’s behavior plan to go to the quiet room.
“That wasn’t my plan,” Rose said. “That room scares me just looking at it as an adult.”
As the student became more agitated, Rose said her own anxiety rose. If the student didn’t calm down, the other employee told Rose she had to shut the door. Rose complied, and then her colleague told her to hold the door shut with her foot to keep the student inside, she said.
Inside the room, the student began having what appeared to be an anxiety attack and threatened to break the window. She calmed down after about 20 minutes, and Rose let her out. Rose said she was not directed to file an incident report, nor was she told if someone else in the district did, despite the requirement in state law that districts document every seclusion.
Over the holiday break that followed, Rose said she had trouble sleeping. “All I can think about is the student I put in that room,” she said. “School should be their safe place, and these students were not feeling safe.” 
Shorey, the superintendent, said staff members are required to report every incident, but she did not know about the particular incident Rose described. Special Education Director Sue Terrill said it’s possible that a staff member other than Rose wrote a report, but the district was unable to locate any documentation of that event.
The district trains employees in safety care — crisis management and prevention practices — Terrill said. It is open to other trainings, too, she said, including one that Rose brought to Terrill’s attention in February offered by the Maine nonprofit Lives in the Balance, which other districts have used to dramatically reduce their reliance on restraint and seclusion.
Quiet rooms present a gray area
Rose said she saw staff members keep students in seclusion rooms even when they were calm, using those same rooms for a variety of reasons beyond seclusion, which is banned or strictly regulated in at least seven states, according to the MOST Policy Initiative, a Missouri nonprofit. Maine came close to banning the rooms in 2021, but the final version of the law was amended to allow their use in emergencies.
Rose said she saw staff place students in quiet rooms to calm down after acting out, and then not allow them to exit for 20 minutes after they calmed down. If the seclusion happened at the end of the school day, sometimes the student would be expected to return to the quiet room the next day, she said. 
Terrill recalled Rose raising this as an issue but denied keeping students in the rooms after they calmed down and no longer met the legal threshold for confinement.
But the district does use these rooms as timeout spaces, either by student choice or by staff direction, Terrill confirmed. Often, Terrill said, staff members are positioned outside the rooms, as they would be in a seclusion incident, but the student is typically free to leave the room, which is not the case in a seclusion.
Sometimes, the door is open, or a student can choose to shut the door with a staff member standing outside, she said.
“It can be the same room used if the student was in seclusion,” she said. “But if they’re taking a break because of something that happened, and that’s being used as a break space, the student might continue to work in there until they’re ready to go back to the classroom.”
Like RSU 68 in Dover-Foxcroft, districts across Maine also use seclusion rooms as quiet spaces, according to Ben Jones, a former Disability Rights Maine attorney who now works for Lives in the Balance.
“I think it’s actually more the rare case that the school is like, ‘We’re going to build this room and we’re going to call it the seclusion room, and it’s going to be used just for seclusion,’” he said.
If a student has voluntarily shut themselves in the seclusion room with a staff member outside and is free to go at any time, it would not count as seclusion under Maine law, he said. But if staff members ask students to stay in there to complete their work, as Rose described, whether it would count as a seclusion that districts are required to report to the state is “open to interpretation,” Jones said.
“The overall thing is, the kid is not learning, not in the classroom, in something that could easily turn into seclusion,” he said. “It’s inappropriate at best and potentially illegal if it’s an unrecorded seclusion.”
When are students and staff in “imminent danger”?
Education technicians like Rose — aides who often work with students one-on-one or in small groups — are often the ones handling student outbursts or potential violence, said Greg Kavanaugh, who spent 13 years working as an ed tech and special education teacher in Biddeford, Portland, and Yarmouth.
Ed techs are among the lowest-paid professionals in education, and often the least trained — including on behavior management techniques.
“They’re having to make good decisions about when to restrain, when to seclude, and their judgment is going to be really hard because they’re so stressed, overwhelmed, underpaid,” Kavanaugh said. “That just leads to more mistakes, more lapses in judgment.”
In his experience, Kavanaugh said, restraint and seclusion were consistently treated as last-resort measures — used only in extreme situations.
Staff received training on managing student behavior, they debriefed after restraints and seclusions, and they held regular conversations with parents, he said, which disability rights advocates recommend as best practices.
But working in a functional life skills program with students with moderate to severe disabilities, Kavanaugh said, deciding whether to restrain or seclude a child was never easy despite clear protocols in place. Even when a student threw a laptop across the room or hit him, he had to determine whether the behavior posed an imminent danger of serious injury that would require medical intervention beyond first aid — the standard in Maine law — and only intervene physically if it did. He also had to keep calm if students hit him, he said, because that still did not meet the legal standard.
Every time he did restrain or seclude a child, it stayed with him long after. He said he often questioned whether it had been the right call, thought about how families would respond, and considered the lasting effects the practice might have on the student — and on himself. 
“Anytime there was a hold, a restraint or a seclusion, you’re taking that home, and you’re thinking about that kid when you’re at home, trying to move on with your day,” he said. “I’m a pretty strong-willed person, but there are plenty of times I would quietly be in tears, or going home and having an extra glass of wine, because I’m just not processing it well in the aftermath.”
Other students in the classroom witnessing these incidents are also traumatized, Kavanaugh said. 
“You see the terror on their classmates’ faces, and you feel bad for the kid in a certain way because this is going to hurt their relationships,” he said. 
But talking to parents afterward would always make him feel better, Kavanaugh said, because parents of students with disabilities are often dealing with similar behavior challenges at home.

District response to a parental complaint
Emerson, the parent in Ellsworth, complained to the school board, Superintendent Amy Boles, and the Maine Department of Education in August 2024, alleging that staff members had not met the legal threshold for using restraint and seclusion so often on her son. 
Boles wrote back in October, saying in cases where Emerson’s son was hitting, scratching, and kicking staff, “it is my conclusion that active behavior like this toward another person does create an ‘imminent danger’ that the other person could be sufficiently injured that he or she may need more than ‘routine first aid.’”
“The incident may not in fact have caused an injury requiring that level of care, but a reasonable and prudent person could reasonably conclude that this could occur,” Boles wrote in her letter, reviewed by Maine Morning Star.
But the investigation the district launched in response to Emerson’s complaint found that staff had improperly restrained and secluded her son in at least five of the 18 incidents to which his mother objected. Some incident reports were also vaguely written, Boles wrote, which was the case for the three-hour incident in October 2023 — making it difficult to determine whether restraints and seclusion were warranted. 
Nonetheless, Boles concluded in her letter to Emerson that all staff need training on the proper use of restraint and seclusion, and she agreed the district should rely on the practice less often.
Boles declined to comment on the investigation or specific incidents, but said district staff have undergone an initial training with Lives in the Balance, and followup trainings are planned. 
“Behavior is an issue across the board. I mean, it’s skyrocketing everywhere. It’s not just Ellsworth,” she said. “But we’re working really hard to try to be preventative before it gets to that extreme state, trying to teach staff day-to-day strategies to prevent the behavior before it escalates.”
Emerson said her son is still visibly shaken every time he passes by the school, or even when someone mentions the word “school” around him. 
On April 23, she testified at a public hearing, telling Maine lawmakers restraint and seclusion in public schools must stop. The day before, her son had said he was still afraid to go to school in person. 
“His world has become so small since these events, he rarely leaves our home,” she said. “Everyone continues about their day, and yet I’m left to pick up the pieces.”

(Photo by Andrew Harnik/Getty Images)Health care has proved a vulnerable target for the firehose of cuts and policy changes President Donald Trump ordered in the name of reducing waste and improving efficiency. But most of the impact isn’t as tangible as, say, higher egg prices at the grocery store.
One thing experts from a wide range of fields, from basic science to public health, agree on: The damage will be varied and immense. “It’s exceedingly foolish to cut funding in this way,” said Harold Varmus, a Nobel Prize-winning scientist and former director of both the National Institutes of Health and the National Cancer Institute.
The blaze of cuts have yielded nonsensical and perhaps unintended consequences. Consider instances in which grant funding gets canceled after two years of a three-year project. That means, for example, that $2 million has already been spent but there will be no return on that investment.
Some of the targeted areas are not administration priorities. That includes the abrupt termination of studies on long covid, which afflicts more than 100,000 Americans, and the interruption of work on mRNA vaccines, which hold promise not just in infectious disease but also in treating cancer.
While charitable dollars have flowed in to plug some gaps, “philanthropy cannot replace federal funding,” said Dustin Sposato, communications manager for the Science Philanthropy Alliance, a group that works to boost support from charities for basic science research.
Here are critical ways in which Trump administration cuts — proposed and actual — could affect American health care and, more important, the health of American patients.
Cuts to the National Institutes of Health: The Trump administration has cut $2.3 billion in new grant funding since its term began, as well as terminated existing grants on a wide range of topics — vaccine hesitancy, HIV/AIDS, and covid-19 — that do not align with its priorities. National Institutes of Health grants do have yearly renewal clauses, but it is rare for them to be terminated, experts say. The administration has also cut “training grants” for young scientists to join the NIH.
Why It Matters: The NIH has long been a crucible of basic science research — the kind of work that industry generally does not do. Most pharmaceutical patents have their roots in work done or supported by the NIH, and many scientists at pharmaceutical manufacturers learned their craft at institutions supported by the NIH or at the NIH itself. The termination of some grants will directly affect patients since they involved ongoing clinical studies on a range of conditions, including pediatric cancer, diabetes, and long covid. And, more broadly, cuts in public funding for research could be costly in the longer term as a paucity of new discoveries will mean fewer new products: A 25% cut to public research and development spending would reduce the nation’s economic output by an amount comparable to the decline in gross domestic product during the Great Recession, a new study found.
Cuts to Universities: The Trump administration also tried to deal a harrowing blow — currently blocked by the courts — to scientific research at universities by slashing extra money that accompanies research grants for “indirect costs,” like libraries, lab animal care, support staff, and computer systems.
Why It Matters: Wealthier universities may find the funds to make up for draconian indirect cost cuts. But poorer ones — and many state schools, many of them in red states — will simply stop doing research. A good number of crucial discoveries emerge from these labs. “Medical research is a money-losing proposition,” said one state school dean with former ties to the Ivies. (The dean requested anonymity because his current employer told him he could not speak on the record.) “If you want to shut down research, this will do it, and it will go first at places like the University of Tennessee and the University of Arkansas.” That also means fewer opportunities for students at state universities to become scientists.
Cuts to Public Health: These hits came in many forms. The administration has cut or threatened to cut long-standing block grants from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; covid-related grants; and grants related to diversity, equity, and inclusion activities — which often translated into grants to improve health care for the underserved. Though the covid pandemic has faded, those grants were being used by states to enhance lab capacity to improve detection and surveillance. And they were used to formally train the nation’s public health workforce, many of whom learn on the job.
Why It Matters: Public health officials and researchers were working hard to facilitate a quicker, more thoughtful response to future pandemics, of particular concern as bird flu looms and measles is having a resurgence. Mati Hlatshwayo Davis, the St. Louis health director, had four grants canceled, three in one day. One grant that fell under the covid rubric included programs to help community members make lifestyle changes to reduce the risk of hypertension and diabetes — the kind of chronic diseases that Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has said he will focus on fighting. Others paid the salaries of support staff for a wide variety of public health initiatives. “What has been disappointing is that decisions have been made without due diligence,” she said.
Health-Related Impact of Tariffs: Though Trump has exempted prescription drugs from his sweeping tariffs on most imports thus far, he has not ruled out the possibility of imposing such tariffs. “It’s a moving target,” said Michael Strain, an economist at the American Enterprise Institute, noting that since high drug prices are already a burden, adding any tax to them is problematic.
Why It Matters: That supposed exemption doesn’t fully insulate American patients from higher costs. About two-thirds of prescription drugs are already manufactured in the U.S. But their raw materials are often imported from China — and those enjoy no tariff exemption. Many basic supplies used in hospitals and doctors’ offices — syringes, surgical drapes, and personal protective equipment — are imported, too. Finally, even if the tariffs somehow don’t themselves magnify the price to purchase ingredients and medical supplies, Americans may suffer: Across-the-board tariffs on such a wide range of products, from steel to clothing, means fewer ships will be crossing the Pacific to make deliveries — and that means delays. “I think there’s an uncomfortably high probability that something breaks in the supply chain and we end up with shortages,” Strain said.
Changes to Medicaid: Trump has vowed to protect Medicaid, the state-federal health insurance program for Americans with low incomes and disabilities. But House Republicans have eyed the program as a possible source of offsets to help pay for what Trump calls “the big, beautiful bill” — a sweeping piece of budget legislation to extend his 2017 tax cuts. The amount of money GOP leaders have indicated they could squeeze from Medicaid, which now covers about 20% of Americans, has been in the hundreds of billions of dollars. But deep cuts are politically fraught.
To generate some savings, administration officials have at times indicated they are open to at least some tweaks to Medicaid. One idea on the table — work requirements — would require adults on Medicaid to be working or in some kind of job training. (Nearly two-thirds of Medicaid recipients ages 19-64 already work.)
Why It Matters: In 2024 the uninsured rate was 8.2%, near the all-time low, in large part because of the Medicaid expansion under the 2010 Affordable Care Act. Critics say work requirements are a backhanded way to slim down the Medicaid rolls, since the paperwork requirements of such programs have proved so onerous that eligible people drop out, causing the uninsured rate to rise. A Congressional Budget Office report estimates that the proposed change would reduce coverage by at least 7.7 million in a decade. This leads to higher rates of uncompensated care, putting vulnerable health care facilities — think rural hospitals — at risk.

(Photo by Michael Loccisano/Getty Images)As another school year ends, superintendents across the United States are staring down an autumn staffing crisis, with 1 in 8 teaching positions either vacant or filled by an underqualified educator.
States that are struggling with post-pandemic teacher shortages have spent millions to lure replacements and retain veterans with hiring bonuses and bumps in salaries. But hiring gaps remain, so some states also are trying another tactic: changing their standards.
The changes in teacher training and licensing come amid widespread turmoil in public schools: Tax revenue is being siphoned toward private school vouchers in many states; some classrooms are being scrutinized for banned books, displays or teaching lessons that trip into diversity, equity and inclusion territory; and students who went through pandemic-era shutdowns are struggling both with sitting still and with learning the material.
Some surveys show that fewer than a fifth of teachers are happy in their jobs.
“Teaching is not seen as an attractive profession right now,” said Drew Gitomer, an expert on teaching assessment at Rutgers Graduate School of Education.
“COVID exacerbated things, and teachers are caught in the middle of political battles — over curriculum, book bans, even personal attacks,” he said. “It’s not a healthy work environment, and that drives people away.”











Teaching is not seen as an attractive profession right now.


– Drew Gitomer, an expert on teaching assessment at Rutgers Graduate School of Education



Last year, Illinois enacted a law allowing teacher candidates to begin student teaching before passing content-area exams. It was an effort to reduce barriers for underrepresented groups, the measure’s sponsor said.
A bill under consideration this year would give more districts discretion over whether to factor pupils’ test scores into teacher evaluations, a break from a 15-year-old mandate.
In New Jersey, a new law formally removes the Praxis Core exam — traditionally used as an entry-level screening tool for aspiring teachers — from certification requirements.
And in Nevada — one of the states hit hardest by teacher shortages — a bill would streamline licensure for incoming educators. The bill would allow teachers credentialed in other states to begin working in Nevada classrooms while awaiting formal approval.
It also would remove extra steps for teachers switching grade levels and would waive application fees for recent substitute teachers.
Linda Darling-Hammond, founding president and chief knowledge officer of the Learning Policy Institute, a nonpartisan think tank, said teacher shortages hit hardest in schools serving low-income students and students of color, where instability often leads to larger class sizes, canceled courses or a revolving door of substitute teachers.
“When you walk into a school facing shortages, you see instability,” she said. “Students may be taught by people who don’t know what to do, who leave quickly, and who often rely more on discipline than engagement.”
The root cause? Teacher attrition.
Rapidly expanding school voucher programs pinch state budgets

“Nine out of 10 vacancies every year are because of attrition — and two-thirds of that is not retirement,” Darling-Hammond said. “Support in the beginning matters. Teachers who come in and get a mentor stay longer. If you’re just thrown in to sink or swim, the odds of leaving are much greater.”
States have long struggled to attract teachers, and credentialing changes aren’t unusual. But some education advocates fear long-term repercussions.
Melissa Tooley, director of K-12 educator quality at the left-leaning think tank New America, said most states now offer alternative and fast-track teacher certification pathways, many of which allow candidates to start teaching with little or no pedagogical training in how to teach.
“We’re churning through people who might have potential, but we’re not setting them up for success,” she said. “A lot of what states are doing is short term. It’s about filling seats, not necessarily building a sustainable or high-quality workforce.”
More than 40 states require aspiring teachers to take the costly Praxis Subject test for the subject they want to teach, which some experts argue excludes strong candidates and duplicates other assessments.
“You were excluding people who might be good teachers but didn’t do well on that specific test,” said Rutgers’ Gitomer, who has researched the test’s effects on recruitment.
However, he added, dropping tests doesn’t necessarily help.
Several states — Georgia, New Jersey, New York, Washington and Wisconsin — have dropped a licensure requirement known as edTPA since 2022, but there’s little evidence the move has helped ease teacher shortages, Gitomer said. (The acronym stands for Educative Teacher Performance Assessment and involves a portfolio that includes testing and videos of classroom performance.)
Some states reexamine school discipline as Trump order paves go-ahead

“The state eliminated edTPA but didn’t replace it with a specific alternative,” he said.
“Instead, it gave full discretion back to individual institutions to develop or adopt their own performance assessments,” he said. “When we talked to institutions, it became pretty clear they didn’t think removing edTPA would be a major driver in addressing the shortage — and they haven’t seen evidence that it has been.”
How best to credential
Tooley said state credentialing systems must navigate a delicate balance: ensuring there are enough teachers, maintaining instructional quality and increasing workforce diversity.
“There’s this triangle — three pieces that need to be in place — and I think there are real tensions when it comes to how states are designing their certification policies,” she said.
And Gitomer described a fragmented national landscape, where some states are tightening teacher entry standards while others are dramatically loosening them — even allowing non-degreed individuals to teach.
“Some states are trying to raise standards; others are relaxing them to the point where you may not even need a college degree,” he said.
Indiana now requires all pre-K through grade 6 and special education teachers to complete 80 hours of training on the “science of reading,” a method that includes phonics, and pass an exam by 2027. State Sen. Jean Leising, a Republican, has proposed cutting the requirement in half, calling it “an excessive burden with little actual benefit” in a news release.
In Texas, a bill aims to reduce the use of uncertified teachers by the 2029-30 school year. The legislation would set a gradual cap on the percentage of uncertified teachers districts can employ in core curriculum classes — starting at 20% in 2026-27 and decreasing to 5% in 2029-30.
According to the Texas Education Agency, 31% of new hires in 2024-25 lacked a state teaching certificate or permit.
Yet some states stand out for how they’re changing their requirements, Tooley said.
She pointed to Washington, which has designed a recruitment strategy encouraging paraprofessionals, often known as teacher’s aides, to become classroom teachers. Also known as paraeducators, they’re a group with classroom experience, community ties and higher retention likelihood.
There, school districts are required to offer foundational training — ranging from 14 to 28 hours — directly to paraeducators.
Plagued by teacher shortages, some states turn to fast-track credentialing

In West Virginia, a new law now allows districts to count full-time behavior interventionists working in one or two classrooms toward meeting the required number of aides or paraprofessionals in K-3 classrooms.
Tooley noted that Pennsylvania and Alabama are experimenting with “menu-style” licensing flexibility — allowing candidates to demonstrate qualification through various combinations of GPA and test scores, rather than rigid cutoffs.
“These are people already in schools, often from the same cultural or linguistic backgrounds as students,” Tooley said. “They’re more likely to succeed and to stay.”
Low pay
A 2024 national survey by the EdWeek Research Center found that public school teachers are increasingly reporting declines in mental health, job satisfaction and classroom stability. Seventy percent of teachers recommended student mental health interventions, and nearly half said schools lack enough counselors, psychologists and social workers.
As mental well-being has worsened, the share of public school teachers who are very satisfied with their jobs has also declined by 2 percentage points from the previous year, to 18%, according to the survey, which was conducted by the EdWeek Research Center on behalf of Merrimack College.
While teacher wellness supports remain limited, educators say improvements in pay and student discipline are the most needed changes.
To entice passionate but burned out educators from leaving the workforce, several states have raised minimum teacher pay. Arkansas boosted salaries to $50,000 statewide, and South Carolina raised starting pay to $47,000. South Dakota enacted a $45,000 minimum with yearly increases, and penalties for districts that fail to comply by 2026. Connecticut advanced a bill setting a $63,450 salary floor, while Indiana and others are eyeing further increases.
At the federal level, the proposed American Teacher Act seeks to establish a national $60,000 minimum salary for teachers at a qualifying school to boost recruitment and retention across the country. The bill, sponsored by U.S. Rep. Frederica Wilson, a Florida Democrat, remains in committee.

(Photo by Dana Wormald/New Hampshire Bulletin)If New Hampshire adopts a law to make it easier to remove books from school libraries, “Nineteen Minutes” by Jodi Picoult could be one of them.
The 2011 novel, set in the fictional Upper Valley New Hampshire town of Sterling, depicts a deadly school shooting committed by a student who was bullied for his sexual orientation. It has been banned in more than 50 school districts; many of those removals were driven by its inclusion of LGBTQ+ characters and themes.
This year, Picoult and other authors are warning that the proposed New Hampshire bill, which is heading to Gov. Kelly Ayotte’s desk, amounts to a book banning bill and should be vetoed. Those pushing for the bill say it is targeted only at obscene content with no educational value. 
“We know from history what the next chapter looks like when we don’t fight book bans, and we know that that is a story that does not end well,” said Picoult at a May 12 press conference hosted by the organization Authors Against Book Bans. On May 15, the Republican-led Senate voted on party lines to advance the bill, House Bill 324, to Ayotte. 
HB 324 would require all New Hampshire school boards to adopt a complaint process that parents could use to object to obscene materials — and potentially remove them. Currently, school districts can choose their own policies for how to allow parents to object to materials. 
Under the proposed law, parents may submit written complaints alleging that a book or other material is obscene. To qualify, the content must appeal “to the prurient, shameful or morbid interest of minors,” and depict nudity, sexual acts, or sadomasochistic abuse in a way that is “patently offensive to prevailing standards in the adult community with respect to what is suitable for minors.”
The material must also lack “serious literary, scientific, medical, artistic, or political value for minors,” and be inappropriate to the age group to which it is made available. If it doesn’t meet all four of those requirements, it cannot be removed.
Under the law, the school principal has 10 school days to review the material in the complaint and determine whether it violates the law; if a parent disagrees with that decision, they have 14 calendar days to appeal to the local school board. If the school board also deems the material to be appropriate, a parent can appeal one more time to the State Board of Education, a seven-member panel whose members are appointed by the governor and Executive Council; that board will have the final say on the material. 
The law carries consequences for school districts and teachers who don’t comply with it. School districts can be sued by the state’s attorney general, Department of Education, or any person “claiming to be aggrieved” by the district for not following the law, and educators can face discipline for violating the educator code of conduct.
Rep. Glenn Cordelli, the Tuftonboro Republican who proposed the bill, disagrees that it is meant to ban books. 
“I see it more as a parents’ rights bill for parents to object to materials in some schools,” Cordelli said in an interview Thursday, just before the Senate vote.
Cordelli has read on the House floor passages from some books he says should be removed, including “Here and Queer: A Queer Girl’s Guide to Life,” a 2022 advice book for teenagers, and Speak, an award-winning 1999 young adult book about a high school freshman who is raped.
Both books are present in New Hampshire school district libraries, Cordelli says.
But Picoult and a handful of other authors at the press conference said the excerpts are often taken out of the context of the bigger story that is being told. 
Picoult said she respects a parent’s right to read books themselves before reading them to their kids, something she did too when her children were growing up. 
“But there’s a colossal problem when that parent decides the book isn’t right for anyone’s child,” she said. “These parents will tell you that the books are exposing kids to topics that are salacious or revolutionary. What kids are really being exposed to are lives and mindsets different from their own, which creates compassion and empathy.”
Lara Prescott, the author of the 2019 novel “The Secrets We Kept,” about the CIA’s plot to smuggle Boris Pasternak’s “Dr. Zhivago” out of the U.S.S.R., noted that her book was banned from publication in China due to a love story between two women. 
“It’s hard to believe we’re seeing echoes of that in our own country today: teachers and librarians being criminalized for the books in their classrooms,” Picoult said at the press conference.
She added: “I want my son to grow up exposed to all kinds of stories, perspectives, and voices,” 
Picoult is a plaintiff in a 2024 lawsuit featuring authors challenging a similar law in Florida, and she said if HB 324 were signed in New Hampshire, the state could expect similar litigation. 
The bill touched off heated debate on the Senate floor Thursday. Democrats said the definition went too far and could be used to apply to classic works of literature, such as Shakespeare, which sometimes includes sexual content. And Democrats said the state already has obscenity laws that make it illegal to provide pornographic materials to students; HB 324 is aimed at broader books that feature LGBTQ characters, they alleged. 
Sen. David Watters, of Dover, argued the bill would allow parents who have particular beliefs about LGBTQ students or other political beliefs to remove materials that other parents might be OK with. 
“It violates free speech,” Watters said. “It violates the right of certain parents and their children to have access to materials.”
Republicans said concerns over banning Shakespeare were overblown, pointing to the four criteria that must be met, including that the material has no “literary” or “artistic” value. 
“Shakespeare is there to stay,” said Sen. Daryl Abbas of Salem. “I wasn’t always a fan of Shakespeare, but his books are staying.”
And they said the bill is aimed at obscene material. 
“We’re talking about flat-out pornography and things that if I, as just a regular citizen, handed to a child, I could be arrested for,” said Sen. Victoria Sullivan of Manchester. “And this is why it’s escalated to this point.” 
“All people should be represented. You know, if you want to have a book (with) two moms, two dads, great. But with ‘Gender Queer’ in a second grader school, and it’s got pornographic drawings, and the parents find that, and they go to their school board and they read excerpts from it, that’s a problem,” said Sen. Denise Ricciardi, of Bedford, referring to a book often removed from school libraries for sexual content. 
The bill will make its way to Ayotte’s desk in the coming weeks. At that point, she can sign it, veto it, or allow it to pass without her signature.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/booksbanningnh-1024x717.jpg,,,2025-05-21 05:03:26.897631

The efforts of North Carolina Republican lawmakers to transform the state Board of Elections into a partisan puppet show continue apace.
First, was the absurd move that placed MAGA state auditor Dave Boliek over the board instead of the Governor.
Then came Boliek’s appointment of a pair of ultra-partisan GOP politicians as board members.
And last week, Republican legislators slipped a provision into the state budget bill that would politicize the board’s professional staff.
The change would allot the board seven new staff positions – all of them political appointees. This represents a huge and troubling shift for an agency in which staff have long been nonpartisan civil servants.
Now, add that the budget gives the board 1.5 million dollars so it can hire private attorneys rather than rely on the state’s nonpartisan civil servant lawyers, and the blatant and disturbing partisanship of the move becomes even clearer.
The bottom line: there is no governmental function for which nonpartisanship is more vitally important than running elections. All North Carolinians should be outraged by these changes.

Ohio Senate Democrats have submitted 423 amendments to the two-year state operating budget — including one removing the $600 million bond package for a new Cleveland Browns stadium in Brook Park, and one to fully fund public schools. 
The Ohio House passed their version of the budget last month and the Senate is currently working on the budget, which Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine must sign into law by June 30.

“This budget steals from our children by defunding public schools, transfers money for health care and libraries to rich benefactors, all the while failing to address the needs of hard working everyday Ohioans,” Senate Minority Leader Nickie J. Antonio, D-Lakewood, said Tuesday during a press conference. 
“This Republican budget prioritizes partisan agendas and handouts to the wealthy and well-connected, also through vouchers, tax breaks, and a stadium giveaway to the tune of more than half a billion dollars, all paid for by the working class,” she said. 
The Senate Democrats had a few different ideas for how $600 million can be spent — a direct shot at how the Ohio House Republicans added a bond package for a new Cleveland Browns stadium for that same amount in their version of the budget.
Republicans hold a 24-9 supermajority in the Ohio Senate, giving Democrats very little power to enact any of their priorities. Nevertheless, Democratic lawmakers laid out their vision of what the state could be doing differently.
The Ohio legislature could restore H2Ohio funding for $121 million, increase library funding to 2.2% for $382 million, offer continuous Medicaid expansion enrollment for $40 million, fund child cancer research for $5 million, and increase funding for food banks for $10 million (which totals to $558 million), Antonio said. 
Or lawmakers could feed all Ohio school children for $574 million and restore mental health support for students for $20 million, Antonio said. 
The legislature could restore the Child Tax Credit for $450 million, increase the Local Government Fund by $598 million, and fairly fund public schools for almost a year for $790 million, Antonio said. 
“If I were queen of the world, all these things would be part of our general fund budget,” she said. 
If $600 million is bonded out for a sports franchise, “Ohioans are still on the hook for that money in the long run,” Antonio said. 
DeWine originally proposed doubling the tax on sports betting from 20% to 40% with proceeds going to fund professional sports stadiums and Ohio youth sports.
“I thought what the governor proposed originally was actually a better way to go because the funds were coming from outside entities,” Antonio said. “It has the whole state in mind, not just one group in one part of the state.” 
She said she would “be much more supportive” of an amendment along those lines. 
School funding 
To fully fund public schools based on statistics from the Fair School Funding Plan from 2021, schools would need an additional $666 million in funding (more now with inflation), but the proposed budget only gives them about $226 million.
“It breaks the promise we’ve made for our children in public schools by abandoning fully funding the Fair School Funding Plan,” Antonio said.
The Cupp-Paterson Fair School Funding Plan from 2021 was supposed to take six years and was meant to change how public dollars are provided to K-12 schools by giving additional support to local districts so they can rely less on property taxes. 
The first two years were partially fully funded and the second two years were fully funded. There are two more years left. 
“Our caucus has submitted amendments that would fully fund the fair school funding plan,”  Antonio said.
The Senate Democratic amendments would also increase the state minimum teacher salary from $35,000 to $50,000, she said. 
Additional amendments 
Ohio Senate Democrats added an amendment to restore DeWine’s proposed $1,000 child care tax credit and another that would remove the language the Ohio House added to the budget that would make changes to the Ohio Housing Trust Fund. 
The Housing Trust is funded by a portion of the fees collected by county recorders, with half of the fees staying with the county and the other half going back to the fund — which requires at least 50% of the funds be spent in non-urban areas. 
The House budget proposal would remove the requirement for county recorders to send the state Department of Development money to reallocate the funds — something housing advocates say make it less effective across the state.
“Rural areas would also be most impacted by the potential blocks of housing services as well, but all Ohio communities will see service disruption and increases in homelessness and decrease in access to affordable housing,” said Ohio state Sen. Paula Hicks-Hudson, D-Toledo.  
Ohioans deserve better from the state budget, Antonio said. 
“I think a whole lot of everyday Ohioans are going to be very surprised and have a whole lot of buyer’s remorse when they find out what it is that these people are doing on their behalf,”  Antonio said when asked about the Republican supermajority in the Statehouse.

(Photo by Klaus Vedfelt/Getty Images)There is much discussion in New Hampshire’s General Court regarding public school funding. 
Should the state increase or decrease public funds for education freedom accounts? What is considered an adequately funded education? What are the minimum academic standards of an appropriate public education? Is the current expansion of extended learning opportunities the best use of funds to provide students with career readiness skills?  
These questions deserve much debate at school board meetings and within the General Court. Each question seeks to ensure a strong return on taxpayer investment while equipping students with the skills needed to thrive in the future. A laudable approach for any debate about education. However, there is a flaw in the framework of these questions. Each question predicates its solution as a function of the budget process. It assumes that shifting funding from one solution to another will solve a given educational problem. 
This approach is unlikely to succeed. Regardless of whether funding is increased or reduced at the state and local levels, the deep-rooted generational and technological challenges impacting student learning outcomes will persist.
There are practical solutions that school districts can implement for the 2025-2026 school year to address these challenges and turn the tide on the concerning trends in student learning outcomes. 
Practical solutions for school districts
New Hampshire teachers are keenly aware of the state and nationwide student achievement data. There are downward trends in nearly all empirical categories. Setting aside the debate over whether these data truly reflect student achievement, teachers and parents have valid frustration and concerns about these trends. Much hand-wringing and finger pointing have resulted.
After all, these students are the future guardians of our democratic institutions and habits. We must do better by them. To accomplish this, everyone involved in the educational process has to examine the unique impediments to achievement Generations Z and Alpha (Zers and Alphas) are facing due to the very technology that has defined their generation.
Here are 4 practical, budget-neutral solutions school districts can swiftly implement for the 2025-2026 academic year to combat these impediments. 
1) Districtwide, bell-to-bell cellphone ban
The causal links between teen smartphone usage and higher rates of anxiety, depression, suicide, and the inability to focus have been demonstrated ad nauseam. Any district that truly values its role in nurturing developing minds and supporting youth mental health should implement a full ban from bell to bell — little else should be considered. 
Furthermore, school districts should rethink the amount of technology within the classroom. Zers and Alphas tend to engage with classroom technology — such as Chromebooks, tablets, and gamified tools — using the same unproductive habits they have developed on their personal devices. Consequently, school technology might be creating a similar impediment to learning. 
Consider that during the same period in which schools have rapidly integrated technology into mainstream classrooms, achievement scores have declined. This could be a false correlation, but it still deserves meaningful examination by school districts looking to adopt new technologies. 
2) Professional development examining the unique generational learning challenges of Generations Z and Alpha
When smartphones came on the scene in 2007, they were marketed as community connectors that would allow individuals to build and maintain relationships like never before. Nearly 20 years on we know that this is not the case, especially for developing minds. By offering unparalleled independence, smart technology has drastically isolated its users. 
Students raised in today’s tech-driven environment have missed out on the community-based learning experiences that previous generations once enjoyed. As a result, some have become dependent on screens, while struggling to develop social skills and the resilience needed to navigate challenges.
Resilience is the foundation of learning. To learn, a student must be able to endure the challenges of the unknown. The ease of retreating into a world of carefully curated, pleasurable content at the slightest difficulty has hindered students from building resilience. Every teacher, parent, and school administrator should read Jonathan Haidt’s “The Anxious Generation” to examine the causes of this technological rewiring of young minds in the face of challenges.
3) Committee to examine benefits of low-supervision, unstructured recess for all grades
Since the late 1990s there has been a precipitous drop in the amount of time children have spent at play. Specifically, low-supervision, risky, unstructured play. Think of the type of play seen in “The Sandlot.” In stark contrast, parents have opted for the more physically safe environment of indoor, tech-driven entertainment. 
In this environment, young minds are exposed to all of the negative effects of smart technology and social media. Moreover, they miss out on the developmentally necessary skills learned from play. Playing with peers in a low-supervision, knee-skinning fashion, is an evolutionary process by which developing minds learn resilience, independence, problem-solving, creativity, and peer-pruned habits. Play is the biological mechanism by which we learn to moderate our behaviors within a group.
Every New Hampshire school district should establish a committee to examine the behavioral benefits of student-led recess, where peers can moderate each other in an unstructured block of time. Developing children are more likely to follow and critique the behavioral examples of their peers instead of heeding the advice of an adult. Read any study on the intersection of conformity bias and prestige bias in adolescents and you will find this to be the case.
Perhaps the solution to the rise in conduct issues in schools lies not so much with adults implementing Social Emotional Learning programs, but in the natural habits formed and extinguished through peer interactions.
4) Immediately develop acceptable use policies for AI
Artificial intelligence — in the form of Large Language Models — is the single most significant development in education since the invention of the pencil. Over two years into this technological leap, less than half of teachers and schools have engaged in intensive AI training.
This lack of urgency to train teachers is shockingly inadequate. Shocking because school districts have failed to train teachers on a game-changing tech that could meet the needs of all learners. More shocking because it is a willful abdication of a school district’s responsibility to understand how AI will change the academic and behavioral habits of their students. 
There are an abundance of articles considering the pros and cons of AI within the classroom. School districts should carefully consider both sides of this argument to develop an acceptable use model that meets the needs of its learning community. 
Policies that permit excessive reliance on AI by students risk diminishing their capacity for independent and critical thinking. Conversely, school districts that adopt an abstinence-only approach to AI fail to recognize its growing significance in education and the social lives of their students. 
School districts must act swiftly to establish these policies in light of upcoming federal legislation that could impose a 10-year freeze on state-level AI regulation.
 The 2025-2026 school year

Writing about his trip to America in the early 1830s, Alexis de Tocqueville opined that “[a]mong democratic nations, each new generation is a new people.” Each generation in a democracy needs to take ownership of the development of its habits. Habits that will go on to inform the tone and tenor of democratic life. An entire generation is forming its habits around technology that could have devastating or beneficial consequences for American democracy. It is up to everyone within the public education community to help nudge them toward the beneficial outcome. 
If social psychologist Jean Twenge is correct about technology’s role in delineating generations, then a simple debate about educational funding is not enough to correct the problems facing education in New Hampshire. Practical solutions that address the habits being formed in Generations Z and Alpha by technology must lead the discussion of trends seen in student achievement.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/kidsbackpacks-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-05-21 05:03:26.897631

(Photo by Skylar Laird/SC Daily Gazette)More than a dozen members of Ohio’s state legislature signed on to a letter with 500 other lawmakers across the nation asking Congress to push back against efforts to reduce or eliminate budget funding that would go to Planned Parenthood health clinics.
The letter, sent to U.S. Senate Majority Leader John Thune, U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson and Senate and House Minority Leaders Chuck Schumer and Hakeem Jeffries, lays out support of Planned Parenthood specifically as a provider for 2 million patients per year of “essential, preventive, reproductive health care,” according to the letter.
“We write in support of the millions of patients who rely on Planned Parenthood health centers,” the letter states. “‘Defunding’ Planned Parenthood blocks patients from getting the care they need and increases health care costs for everyone.”
The letter, organized by the State Innovation Exchange’s Reproductive Freedom Leadership Council, comes as congressional budget reconciliation is ongoing, when U.S. legislators decide the funding priorities for the country, under which the Trump administration has attempted to push cuts to areas such as health care. This includes funding to Medicaid, the program that provides health care and services to low-income households, covering things like health screenings and vaccines.
U.S. House panel passes GOP plan that cuts Medicaid by $625B, adds work requirement

The state budget also stands to cut Medicaid funding, in a way that’s triggered by changes to funding at the federal level. The House proposal of the state operating budget would eliminate Group VIII, the state’s Medicaid expansion group, if federal funding for Medicaid dips below 90%. That would leave nearly 770,000 without medical coverage, forcing them to seek other options, like emergency rooms, for care, or even skip or delay care all together.
In the letter, the lawmakers state that a majority of Planned Parenthood patients “rely on Medicaid and other federal and state programs to access care,” and that 64% of the organization’s health centers are in rural of “medically underserved” communities.
“Without Planned Parenthood, many patients would have nowhere to turn for care,” according to the legislators.
Planned Parenthood of Greater Ohio has reported 43% of their patients are covered by Medicaid. Cuts are causing concern for many of the leaders of the organization’s regional arms, who are stressing the effects that funding cuts could have not only on abortion services, but also infant mortality and maternal mortality programs, and health care overall.
“The reality is that stripping Medicaid reimbursements from providers who also provide abortion will do very little to stop abortion services,” said Nan Whaley, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood Southwest Ohio Region, in a statement on Tuesday. “Medicaid does not fund abortion care. What it will impact is access to critical preventive services like birth control, cancer screenings, wellness exams, STI testing and treatment, and more, leaving millions of folks in need and at risk.”
Cuts on the federal side also include freezes to Title X funding, which is federal funding historically directed at clinics who “have played a critical role in ensuring access to a broad range of family planning and preventive health services,” according to the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services.
The Trump administration has frozen $65 million in grants to “family planning services” clinics in April as they look to broad cuts to federal spending overall.
In Ohio, Planned Parenthood of Greater Ohio received $1.98 million in grants in 2024 from the Title X pot. The Ohio Department of Health also received grant funding, obtaining $7 million that year. The department received similar amounts in the previous two years of grant funding as well.
The state legislators who signed on to the letter were:

While energy prices are set to jump this summer, Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine signed a bill into law that could provide some relief — eliminating a subsidy from the scandal-ridden Ohio House Bill 6 that requires ratepayers to fund unprofitable coal plants. As this happens, utility companies are moving to increase consumers’ bills.
Back in 2019, Former Ohio House Speaker Larry Householder took and funneled $61 million worth of bribes in exchange for legislation to give utility company FirstEnergy a $1 billion bailout, named H.B. 6, all at ratepayers’ expense.
In March 2023, a jury found that Householder and former GOP leader Matt Borges, beyond a reasonable doubt, participated in the racketeering scheme that left four men guilty and two dead.
In late June that year, federal judge Timothy Black sentenced Householder to 20 years in prison. Borges got five years for his role in the scheme, but most importantly, he attempted to bribe Tyler Fehrman, an FBI whistleblower, with $15,000 to help kill a repeal effort he was working on. On video, Borges told Fehrman that if he told anyone about the bribe, he would “blow up” his house.
While some of H.B. 6 was overturned already, ratepayers have been paying a subsidy that funds two Ohio Valley Electric Corporation coal plants — one in Southern Ohio and one in Indiana. The main beneficiaries for OVEC are American Electric Power Company (AEP), Duke Energy and AES Ohio. Still, FirstEnergy collects payment for it.
But with the swipe of a pen — consumers will likely see their bills go down. DeWine signed a massive energy overhaul bill, H.B. 15, on Friday. It repeals the OVEC charges.
A study commissioned by the Ohio Manufacturers’ Association found that in 2024 alone, these subsidies cost ratepayers roughly $200 million. The company lost more than $100 million the same year, so consumers are paying for plants that aren’t profitable.
Consumers can expect to save between $1.30 and $1.50 per month, depending on their utility provider, according to the Energy News Network.
The subsidies may not seem like a lot every month, but they add up when inflation is high and people struggle.
“It makes a difference, especially in today’s day and age with a kind of shaky economy and folks trying to just make ends meet,” Fehrman said.
While this will save citizens a bit of money, Householder attorney Scott Pullins argues that this will hurt the rural areas it serves.
“They are major high-paying jobs in the area, and the kind of area where there aren’t very many high-paying jobs,” Pullins said about the plant jobs. “They generate a whole boatload of taxes for schools in those areas. And if those plants get shut down, it’s going to be devastating for those communities.”
The Ohio plant employs many Ohioans, he added. But now, this may embolden utility companies to ask for more rate hikes, he said. This is already happening.
“Our electric grid needs to be modernized,” Pullins said. “I’m assuming that those are where those costs are going. I think we do need a robust regulatory scheme to make sure these companies aren’t wasting these funds.”
FirstEnergy is now petitioning the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio (PUCO) to raise its prices — a $190 million increase in its charges.
If approved, the Ohio Consumers’ Counsel estimated that Cleveland Illuminating Company consumers will see a $13 price increase per month, Ohio Edison will have a $3 spike, and Toledo Edison at $1.50.
On Monday, DeWine said he doesn’t have an opinion on the price increases.
“As far as the raising of bills, ultimately, as you know, this is up to the PUCO,” he said.
Fehrman said this shouldn’t be allowed.
“There is this massive scandal where these companies tried to put a larger burden on the backs of every single Ohioan,” he said. “And now, they’re asking for more money in a time when folks are already struggling.”
The bill will go into effect in 90 days.

URBANA, OHIO — Oaks and Sprouts, Tonni and Graham Oberly’s family farm, got the email from the Ohio Association of Foodbanks just after five o’clock on the first Friday in March.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture, or USDA, had notified the Ohio Department of Job and Family Services that it was ending a program that gave state, tribal and territorial governments federal dollars to stock food pantries from farms within a 400-mile radius. The Ohio Association of Foodbanks, in turn, shared the notice with the more than 150 farms that supplied the state’s food pantries with fresh produce, meat and dairy. One of them was Oaks and Sprouts, whose younger and diverse owners are just the type of growers the USDA’s Local Food Purchase Assistance program aimed to connect to food-insecure Americans.
Last growing season, Oaks and Sprouts had a contract worth up to $25,000 with the program, a significant amount for the small farm. The produce made its way to food pantries in nearby Springfield and Dayton and, from there, to the Ohioans who rely on them to feed themselves and their families. For Tonni Oberly, a trained doula with a background in public health, joining that distribution chain connected her work at the farm to the focus of the city and urban planning doctorate she had recently completed: how place impacts the health of Black mothers and children.
“Food is such an important part of that — access to food in your neighborhood, access to healthy food, the affordability of food — how food impacts our maternal and child health outcomes is really crucial,” Tonni explained on a crisp April day as she and Graham walked through the hoop house where they were germinating seeds for spring planting.


The federal program had also allowed the Oberlys to diversify their farm’s revenue stream beyond the traditional sales to restaurants and at farmer’s markets. It had given them a measure of predictability as they built a regenerative farm on land previously cultivated by Graham’s aunt and uncle and, before that, his grandparents.
“We can plant seeds and know that they’re sold, versus with the farmer’s markets, you plant and you hope people buy it — or even selling to restaurants, they don’t preorder months ahead of time,” Graham explained as he and Tonni stood on the  acre of land where they grow garlic, tomatoes, patty pan squash and lettuce varietals that include romaine, butterhead and salanova.
The Oberlys estimate that they were able to hire two of their four seasonal employees last year because of their contract with the Local Food Purchase Assistance program, known as LFPA. They try to pay a good wage for the work — $17 an hour. That’s a decent amount for a place like rural Champaign County, where the median household income is about $20,000 less than nationally and the poverty rate is just over 10 percent. The farm’s goal, they explained, was to grow food in a way that is good for the land, their employees and their customers. Tonni named Oaks and Sprouts for a passage of scripture in Isaiah: “They will be called oaks of righteousness, a planting of the Lord for the display of his splendor.” It is a metaphor for living a righteous life.

The email from the Ohio Association of Foodbanks landed as Oaks and Sprouts was in the thick of planning for its fifth growing season — the third in which the Oberlys planned on participating in the LFPA program. It attached a USDA notice saying that the Trump administration had “determined this agreement no longer effectuates agency priorities and that termination of the award is appropriate.” After the current contract year closes on June 30, the LFPA program, which authorized $900 million worth of locally raised healthy foods for anti-hunger organizations, would end.
Created by the Biden administration in 2021, the Local Food Purchase Assistance program was at once an attempt to support small local farms and an acknowledgement that one of the most direct ways to bring healthy food to hunger-vulnerable populations is to buy it from underserved farmers nearby.
But a USDA press release announcing its creation featured words like “equity” and “climate,” targets of President Donald Trump and his Department of Government Efficiency in their efforts to root out so-called “woke” federal programs. Even before Trump took office, the Oberlys’ program coordinator with Ohio CAN (Community + Agriculture + Nutrition), as LFPA is branded in this midwestern state, had warned them that its renewal could be in jeopardy.
Still, Oaks and Sprouts, like the vast majority of the farms participating in Ohio CAN, began planning for the 2025 growing season. There were reasons to be hopeful. For starters, while the Local Food Purchase Assistance program was part of the Biden administration’s broader COVID-19 relief effort, its funding stream was first used for direct food purchases during Trump’s first term. Ohio CAN, like many state-level local food purchase programs, is also widely popular. Independent experts who analyzed its first year in the Republican-led state concluded that it was a “success by any measure.”

Trump’s picks to lead key federal agencies in his current term also seemed to be working in the program’s favor. Take Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins. One of the first things she did upon confirmation was to send state, local and tribal governments a letter that outlined her “vision for the Department’s 16 nutrition programs,” including a commitment to “create new opportunities to connect America’s farmers to nutrition assistance programs.”
Then there’s Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a former environmental lawyer, the figurehead of the “Make America Healthy Again” movement and an outspoken critic of processed foods. One of his top priorities is encouraging states to prohibit the more than 40 million low-income Americans participating in the USDA’s Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, from using benefits to purchase soda and candy; so far this year, more than a dozen states have been considering such legislation. Many experts say a more effective way to encourage healthier eating is to improve access to fresh foods, exactly the type that LFPA farms were producing and selling to food pantries.
More than 1.3 million Ohioans participated in SNAP during fiscal year 2024, or about 12 percent of the state’s population, according to a Center of Budget and Policy Priorities analysis of USDA data. While the majority of SNAP recipients are White, Black Ohioans are overrepresented when compared to the overall state population. An anonymous survey by the Ohio Association of Foodbanks showed that more than 40 percent of people who visited emergency food distribution centers in 2023 had at least one household member under the age of 18 and nearly as many reported living in a household with someone who is disabled.

The country’s safety net to prevent hunger is a complicated web of federal programs. Most are housed within the USDA and many are jointly administered by federal and state governments. These include SNAP, previously known as food stamps; the Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children, known as WIC; school meal programs; Meals on Wheels, focused on seniors; commodities purchases for food banks; and the Local Food Purchase Assistance program that Tonni and Graham Oberly’s farm participated in.
Pulling on the thread of one program puts tension on the others. For example, once a family exhausts their SNAP benefits for the month, they may rely on one of the country’s more than 60,000 food pantries and emergency meal centers to feed themselves. As the USDA is ending programs like the LFPA, Congress is looking at other food assistance programs to find the $1.7 trillion in savings over the next decade needed to renew Trump’s 2017 tax package, which primarily benefited corporations and the wealthy.
The confluence of cuts and changes, coming as more Americans than ever rely on government help for food, has hunger-relief advocates worried the safety net will unravel.
Congress has proposed changes to SNAP that include recalibrating the formula used to calculate benefits, adding work requirements for some parents and forcing states to take on a larger portion of the funding. Rollins, for her part, sent a letter to states in April reminding them that it is ultimately the USDA that has the authority to grant their requests to waive the time limit on able-bodied adults receiving SNAP benefits unless they meet work requirements.
Earlier this month, the Trump administration also ordered states to hand over SNAP recipients’ personal data, including their Social Security numbers, addresses and, in at least one state, citizenship status, National Public Radio reported. The directive came amid the administration’s broader push to amass Americans’ personal data and target immigrants.
Though people in the country illegally are not eligible for SNAP benefits, their U.S. citizen children might be. Last month, USDA directed states to enhance identity and immigration status verification as part of Trump’s broader immigration crackdown, even though there is no evidence that immigrants are improperly participating in the program at significant levels. Advocates worry that in the current climate, using the SNAP program to collect participants’ data could have a chilling effect on seeking food assistance.
The USDA also recently paused $500 million from a separate program that buys large quantities of food from farmers for food pantries, with food banks in Ohio, Wisconsin, Massachusetts and elsewhere losing millions of dollars worth of shipments as a result. When the administration ended the LFPA, it also terminated a $660 million program that linked local farms to schools and child care centers.
The changes and uncertainty are coming at what Vince Hall, the head of government relations for Feeding America, the nationwide foodbank network, called an already “very precarious moment for food banks because there’s no resiliency left in the system.”
“They’re stretched to the breaking point. They are serving unprecedented high demand, the highest in over a decade. They are dealing with a decline in donation revenue from the pandemic highs that has been quite steep. The decline of financial donations from the pandemic highs, combined with some of the highest — in fact, record — levels of demand at food distributions has just stretched them to the breaking point,” Hall said.
“If we have policy adjustments that disqualify people from the SNAP program, or if we have a recession and unemployment goes up, or if we have a series of natural disasters, there are any number of things that can work to increase demand, and the food banks just aren’t ready,” he added.
In an emailed statement, a USDA spokesperson noted that as of mid-May, states still had $246 million in unspent LFPA funds. “The secretary encourages states to utilize these dollars for schools, charitable feeding organizations, and other programs that serve those in need,” the statement said.
Alabama has exhausted its funds; Ohio had about $435,000 left from $26.6 million allocated; just $1,500 remained in Tennessee’s coffers, according to an official tally.
The spokesperson added: “On any given day, the Department issues more than $405 million worth of nutrition benefits across its 16 nutrition programs. There is no need for new programs, but perhaps more efficient and effective use of current.” These are not reassuring words to many of the program’s participating farmers and food pantry operators, whose best-case-scenario path forward is for the program to be revived under the administration’s own branding.
Ohio food banks are serving more people than ever, budget would maintain funding at 2019 levels

Graham and Tonni Oberly had to pivot quickly.
After they received the email from the Ohio Association of Foodbanks, they secured a spot for this season in a farmer’s market in Dayton that is larger than the one where they used to sell their produce nearby. They are adding cut flowers to their lineup and growing Chinese Cabbage for the first time, while also trying to expand the number of local restaurants to which they sell what they grow.
But the modicum of predictability that the Local Food Purchase Assistance program gave this new farm for the past two seasons — the USDA considers farmers and ranchers “beginning” for their first decade and eligible for special assistance — will be gone this year. As will the direct line for Oaks and Sprouts to help address food insecurity in their own community.
Graham Oberly grew up on the Ohio-West Virginia border in a family that fought mountaintop removal mining in Appalachia, earned a degree in natural resources management and worked as a sustainability coordinator for The Ohio State University before moving into farming.
Oaks and Sprouts is a marriage of the Oberlys’ passions. The regenerative farm is a way for Graham to tend the land of his ancestors and preserve it for future generations. With the Local Food Purchase Assistance program, the farm was also a way that Tonni could expand her work caring for Black mothers and children.
More than 47 million Americans — including one in five children — are considered food insecure, meaning they do not have enough food to eat or access to healthy foods. Rural Americans are more likely to face hunger due to lack of transportation, lower wages and racial discrimination. The highest rates of food insecurity are among Indigenous and Black Americans, according to a Feeding America analysis, with Black children twice as likely as White children to face hunger. USDA research also shows that households with children headed by a single mother are more likely to be food insecure. And food-insecure women are more likely to be obese than food-insecure men or children, with all of the related health issues, in part because they prioritize providing healthy foods for their children instead of themselves, according to the Food Research & Action Center.
In Ohio, the food insecurity rate is slightly higher than the national average. In 2023, Ohioans visited the state’s food banks 14.7 million times, up more than a third over the year before. Ohioans are eligible for food bank use if their household is at or below 200 percent of the federal poverty level — and more than a quarter in the state qualify, or about 3.4 million people. Of the 43 percent who were also receiving SNAP benefits, nearly all of them — 93.4 percent — reported exhausting those benefits within the first three weeks of the month, according to the Ohio Association of Foodbanks.
Biden’s $1.9 trillion COVID-era stimulus package provided direct assistance to taxpayers, $350 billion for state and local governments, and $130 billion to help safely reopen schools, among other provisions. The plan also earmarked $1 billion for USDA programs to build capacity in the country’s food-banking system amid unprecedented need and global supply chain disruptions.
Half of that money went to additional purchases via The Emergency Food Assistance Program — and that is the $500 million canceled by Trump’s USDA in March. Another $400 million was slated for what became the Local Food Purchase Assistance program. Biden’s USDA renewed both pandemic-era programs due to their popularity.
While more than 90 percent of all U.S. farms qualify as “small,” with gross cash annual farm incomes of $250,000 or less, they account for just 17 percent of the total value of food produced in the country, according to USDA statistics. Still, they play a critical role in diversifying the overall food ecosystem by supplying produce, dairy and meat that are not available from large-scale agribusiness. Many grow a variety of crops instead of focusing on one or two. Since they are often serving their own communities, they are less vulnerable to disruptions to complex global supply chains.
In 1973, as global demand for U.S. farm exports exploded, Earl Butz, the agriculture secretary under Republican President Richard Nixon, told American farmers to “get big or get out.” Farmers mostly listened. In the years since, while the number of farm acres has remained roughly constant, the number of farms has continued to decline. When Tom Vilsack, the agriculture secretary under Biden, released data from the 2022 Census of Agriculture, he noted that in over five years, the country had lost 142,000 farms — a roughly 7 percent decline. “As a country, are we okay with losing that many farms? … Or is there a better way?” Vilsack asked.
The Local Food Purchase Assistance program was an acknowledgement that one of the most direct ways to bring healthy food to hunger-vulnerable populations was to buy it from underserved farmers nearby. More than 95 percent of American farmers are White. They are also older — the average age of a U.S. farmer is just over 58, according to USDA statistics — and predominantly male; women make up only 36 percent of farm operators. Under Vilsack, who also served for the entirety of Democratic President Barack Obama’s two terms, agriculture policy aimed to address the decline in small farms by extending credit and other types of support to people historically less likely to farm — namely women and people of color.
White men’s dominance over U.S. farming is not happenstance. It’s the result of more than 200 years of official government policy that reflects the fraught relationships the country has with race and land.
In the 1830s, the U.S. government forcibly relocated thousands of Indigenous Americans from their ancestral lands in the east, where they had cultivated for generations, to a different climate in the west. Thousands of them died from disease, starvation, exhaustion and exposure to the elements during a brutal journey that came to be known as the Trail of Tears. In the 1860s, in the waning months of the U.S. Civil War, General William Sherman pledged that when the Union won, formerly enslaved Black people, who had farmed for White enslavers, would be eligible to receive 40 acres and a mule to farm their own land. President Andrew Johnson reversed course after he took office, returning the land to White people.
People of color — and women — struggled to access credit, including via the USDA, to buy the land and equipment needed to start even a small farm in the decades of Reconstruction that followed the Civil War, throughout the Civil Rights and feminist movements, and into the 1990s. Between 1999 and 2010, the USDA paid settlements in three class actions brought on behalf of Black, Latinx and Indigenous peoples — Pigford v. Glickman, Garcia v. Vilsack and Keepseagle v. Vilsack — arguing that the agency had discriminated against them when they sought loans and other assistance. In 2022, Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act created a $2.2 billion fund to compensate farmers and ranchers who experienced past discrimination, including women.
The federal judge in the Pigford case, Paul L. Friedman, noted that “[a]s the Department of Agriculture has grown, the number of African American farmers has declined dramatically,” and the USDA and “the county commissioners to whom it has delegated so much power bear much of the responsibility for this dramatic decline.”
“The Department itself has recognized that there has always been a disconnect between what President Lincoln envisioned as ‘the people’s department,’ serving all of the people, and the widespread belief that the Department is ‘the last plantation,’ a department ‘perceived as playing a key role in what some see as a conspiracy to force minority and disadvantaged farmers off their land through discriminatory loan practices,’” Friedman wrote.
This history — and a tacit recognition of the role USDA played via its discriminatory practices — underpinned the ethos of the Local Food Purchase Assistance program.
In its first year in Ohio, the program bought from 164 growers. A majority of them were classified as “socially disadvantaged,” which for the LFPA, the USDA defined as women; Black, Indigenous and other people of color; LGBTQ+ people; veterans; and small, emerging and disabled farmers. That year, nearly 12,000 pounds of grains, 223,000 pounds of dairy and milk, 39,000 pounds of eggs and more than 2.5 million pounds of produce that these farmers produced went into the state’s food pantries. The more than $9 million worth of food was distributed via five hubs and 12 regional food banks, according to a report independent researchers produced for the Ohio Association of Foodbanks.
The researchers noted: “Overall, producers were drawn to participate in the Ohio CAN program because sharing high quality products with communities in need was often central to their core mission and personal values.” A farmer called the program a “godsend” and said they felt like they were on the “front lines of food insecurity and food instability.” One foodbank representative in a historically redlined area, where banks discriminated against residents of certain neighborhoods because of their race and ethnicity, said it was the first time a farmer had offered them okra and they hoped “we’ll be able to work more closely with her to get larger, larger quantities in next year.”
The USDA’s decisions to end the Local Food Purchase Assistance program and to cancel planned commodities purchases for food banks have not been popular. The Iowa Farmers Union helped small farms facing lost contracts send press releases about the impact. Singer-songwriter Willie Nelson, a founder of the annual Farm Aid concert, penned an open letter to farmers encouraging them to protest the cuts. Food bank administrators from Oregon to Maryland to Florida have warned it will stress their ability to meet still-historic demand that has not diminished since the pandemic.
There have also been public spats between Trump’s USDA and Democratic governors like Pennsylvania’s Josh Shapiro, who accused the agency of reneging on a three-year deal; Rollins said he didn’t have his facts right and was “trying to make this a political issue.”
For the Oberlys in Ohio, the politics are personal. Their five-year-old farm was just starting to be woven into the constellation of state and federal programs that fed food-insecure neighbors while giving Oaks and Sprouts a toehold in a precarious industry that employs one in eight Ohioans, either directly or indirectly, and generates billions in the state each year.
The end of the Local Food Purchase Assistance program severed the Oberlys’ direct path to care for the people in their community, along with their land. Or as Tonni Oberly put it: “Supporting the local food system is one of the best ways to support the local economy, it supports farmers and community members — it’s a win-win.”",https://ohiocapitaljournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Screenshot-2025-05-20-at-12.15.06 PM.png,,,2025-05-21 05:03:26.897631

I struggle daily to respond when my young clients ask how one person can use an entire country and its resources to punish people they do not like. Why isn’t someone doing something to stop them? In their minds, it’s as simple as saying no. But in reality, it is much more complicated, and I am ashamed to say that I have no answers.
“@realDonaldTrump
Happy Easter to all, including the Radical Left Lunatics who are fighting and scheming so hard to bring Murderers, Drug Lords, Dangerous Prisoners, the Mentally Insane, and well known MS-13 Gang Members and Wife Beaters, back into our Country.”
Just to be clear, for anyone who has been living in complete isolation, without any technology or access to the outside world, this represents bullying.
“Happy Easter also to the WEAK and INEFFECTIVE Judges and Law Enforcement Officials who are allowing this sinister attack on our Nation to continue, an attack so violent that it will never be forgotten! Sleepy Joe Biden purposefully allowed Millions of CRIMINALS to enter our Country, totally unvetted and unchecked, through an Open Borders Policy that will go down in history as the single most calamitous act ever perpetrated upon America.” 
This is known as fearmongering.
“He was, by far, our WORST and most Incompetent President, a man who had absolutely no idea what he was doing — But to him, and to the person that ran and manipulated the Auto Pen (perhaps our REAL President!), and to all of the people who CHEATED in the 2020 Presidential Election in order to get this highly destructive Moron Elected, I wish you, with great love, sincerity, and affection, a very Happy Easter!!!”
And this represents gaslighting — or lying, depending on your state of mind. Less in your face than fearmongering, but if you were to wager that mental or emotional harm was intentionally inflicted upon others, you would most definitely win.
Bullying can escalate to the point that others turn a blind eye, observe with indifference, or become willing participants to avoid becoming victims themselves. This psychological thriller style relationship has no scripted ending because only the bully knows his or her next move. So, everyone, regardless of their role as a bystander, participant, or a victim, walks on eggshells.
Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski was candid in her profession of fear of retaliation for criticizing the current administration. She added that many of her colleagues share her fears. When the legislative branch of the United States becomes ineffective due to threats of retaliation from the executive branch, and the judicial branch is targeted for fulfilling its duties, we are beyond a constitutional crisis. How did we get here?
As Americans, we are taught in elementary school that our democracy uses a system of checks and balances to prevent any one branch from taking over the country. For all intents and purposes, it has worked. Despite the differing beliefs of political leaders, protections afforded by the Constitution have held our rights as citizens firmly in place because that is what they were intended to do. Our judicial system has been the reinforcer, the logic standing firmly against one individual’s will becoming the law of the land. Until now.
Having worked with clients who feared reporting abusive and bullying behavior out of fear of retaliation, I have used my position as an advocate to right those wrongs. I did not use bullying or fearmongering to urge a response. Instead, I reminded them of others of their obligation to protect my clients, and the consequences for failing to follow through.
That conversation was enough to change the situation and my client to receive the response they needed.
I know, it sounded like bullying. It wasn’t. As a social worker, I have an ethical obligation “to promote the well-being of clients.” Promotion comes in the form of elevating the voice of the client while respecting the values, principles, and standards of my profession. In other words, not calling people out with aggressive words or threats. Rather, calling them into discussions by seeking understanding that holds people accountable and prevents “domination, exploitation, and discrimination.”
Yes, these conversations can be challenging, especially in the current political climate. To those on the other side of the facts, it can feel threatening. As I have said, words matter in how they are used. Let us be clear that asking for an understanding of the disconnect that exists between policy or rules, and the behavior of those bound by said policies or rules, is not bullying.
It is called accountability. And it is the responsibility of every individual in our state and this great country we call America.
Accountability has a way of pressing upon people to do the right thing when applied appropriately. Or not.
Righteous indignation, the far, far distant cousin of accountability, is often used to justify beliefs that harm basic human rights. The abuse of righteous indignation is what usurps the protections afforded by the Constitution through bullying, fearmongering and gaslighting. It has become second nature to many being held accountable for the current state of our country. We cannot and should not allow it to scare us into silence.
Zora Neale Hurston said: “If you are silent about your pain, they’ll kill you and say you enjoyed it.”
Several years ago, I witnessed a politician being questioned about his obligation to represent the best interests of Kansans who elected him, not ideology or ego. The politician attempted to distract from the question and was cut short by the constituent, who was there for something more substantial. A word salad would not suffice. The politician was reminded that Kansans have an obligation to respond when our political leaders choose not to operate with fairness and integrity.
The issues facing Kansans, and many other Americans, are not partisan. They are human issues. We must resist the temptation to label every demand for justice as an attack, every plea for accountability as aggression and every call for reform as a threat to tradition. The truth is, accountability is not partisan, it is patriotic. It affirms our shared belief that democracy only works when power is checked, voices are heard and leaders remember who they serve.
Kansans deserve more than manufactured outrage. We deserve action rooted in integrity, transparency and care for basic human rights. If speaking up for the vulnerable is seen as radical, then we will be radically committed to truth. If holding political leaders to their promises is seen as confrontational, then we will confront injustice with an unwavering resolve.
Our state, our communities, and our future depend on it.

Did it disappear or was it just tossed into the trash can of history?
We all might be asking these questions if a current ultra-right-wing movement to call a National Constitutional Convention succeeds.
A movement is afoot by organizations like the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC), the Convention of States and the Heritage Foundation — author of Project 2025, a sweeping proposal to remake the U.S. government in support of right-wing beliefs.
The concept is simple and scary. President Donald Trump and ultraconservative brain trusts want all of Project 2025 enacted into law or embedded in the U.S. Constitution. Whatever can’t be delivered by Trump, Congress or the U. S. Supreme Court, they believe, should be added to the constitution by a convention of the states dominated by MAGA delegates.
We have not had a constitutional convention since the original group met in 1787, but convention proponents say a new convention is long overdue.
Let’s say this is a back-up position for ultraconservatives if Trump doesn’t succeed, but a real possibility nonetheless.
The process to call a constitutional convention is outlined in Article V of the U.S. Constitution. It says that if two-thirds of the state legislatures request a convention Congress must create one. That means that 34 states must request the convention.
However, Article V does not specifically outline how a convention would work and what, if any limits, are placed on a convention once it begins. This means that there is potential for a convention to rewrite the whole constitution and to toss out current amendments that delegates may find repugnant — such as the First Amendment freedoms of speech, press, assembly, and religion.
The Fourth Amendment prohibition against unlawful search and seizure may also be on the chopping block along with Fifth Amendment rights against self-incrimination and due process, Sixth Amendment rights to a fair and public trial with a right to counsel, and Fourteenth Amendment rights to due process and equal protection under the law.
Strengthening presidential powers certainly would be a convention agenda item.
Many states are calling for a convention limited to certain issues like placing fiscal restraints on the federal government, limiting the powers and jurisdiction of the federal government, and imposing term limits on certain government officials and members of Congress.

However, constitutional experts say that once a convention is called, all bets are off. Delegates would not be limited to specific issues — the delegates could do whatever they wish and create whatever kind of constitution they desire.
Any new constitution or amendment would then need to be approved by three-quarters of the states, or 38.
Does all this sound farfetched and like the rantings of an alarmist?
It’s not.
Some 28 state legislatures are currently controlled by Republicans, 18 are headed by Democrats and four are split, according to the New York Times. In the 2024 presidential election, Trump won the popular vote in 31 states compared to 19 by Harris. That means more Republican state legislatures following the presidential vote.
“In all, Republicans have proven much more adept than Democrats at leveraging presidential vote patterns into even larger majorities in state legislative chambers. The GOP has achieved significant levels of excess seats in about three times as many states as the Democrats have,” according to a study by the Center for Politics at the University of Virginia.
 Is Ohio next?

So far, 19 states have called for a constitutional convention: Georgia, Alaska, Florida, Alabama, Tennessee, Indiana, Oklahoma, Louisiana, Arizona, North Dakota, Texas, Missouri, Arkansas, Utah, Mississippi, Wisconsin, Nebraska, West Virginia, and South Carolina.
Ohio is attempting to add to that total. In February 2025, joint resolution bills were introduced in both the Ohio House and the Ohio Senate calling for a national constitutional convention.
Ohio House Joint Resolution 2 is sponsored by state Reps. Riordan McClain, R-Upper Sandusky, and Bernie Willis, R-Springfield. The bill has been assigned to the House Government Oversight Committee and the Committee has already heard testimony from the resolution’s sponsors.
An accompanying bill, House Bill 67 also has been introduced setting the parameters of Ohio delegate actions at such a convention. If passed, the effectiveness of this bill would be questionable, given Article V’s open-ended approach to a convention.
Ohio Senate Joint Resolution 3 is sponsored by state Sens. Michele Reynolds, R-3, and George Lang, R-4, and has been assigned to the Senate General Government Committee.
To date, the committee has had two hearings: one for the sponsors and one for 11 proponents of the resolution. Many were from the Convention of States, including former Pennsylvania senator and presidential candidate Rick Santorum.
Sens. Theresa Gavarone, R–2, and Jane Timken, R–29, introduced Senate Joint Resolution 6, which restricts the call for a convention to discussion of term limits. That resolution also is assigned to the Senate’s General Government Committee.
The activist group Common Cause in Ohio is actively opposing the pending legislation.
“Delegates to the proposed Constitutional Convention will be approved by concurrent resolution of the state legislature or by a majority of those present and voting in a joint session of the Ohio General Assembly. Since the GOP has a supermajority in the state legislature, that means delegates would be chosen and approved by this single party,” Common Cause writes.
In a call to action, Common Cause warned: “If a Constitutional Convention were convened, unelected and unaccountable delegates would have the power to rewrite the U.S. Constitution with no checks or balances. This is an unprecedented risky endeavor that puts our democratic principles at great risk.”
 Lawsuit alternative

However, another line of thinking is that this kerfuffle over 34 states asking for a convention won’t be necessary.
In March, ProPublica’s Local Reporting Network teamed with Wisconsin Watch to uncover a “behind-the-scenes legal effort” to force Congress to call for a constitutional convention now, without further state action.
A draft lawsuit, being circulated among certain friendly state attorneys general, claims the 34-state threshold was, in fact, reached in 1979 and therefore, Congress must call for a convention.
The litigation proponents total state “calls for a convention” from before the Bill of Rights was passed to the present. They have stacked them all together and say that the magic number of 34 was reached 45 years ago.
The pro-litigants claim that once a state asks for a convention it cannot repeal the request. Several states have tried but not successfully, according to the proponents.
“The draft lawsuit says those actions don’t count because once the Article V bell has been rung, it cannot be unrung,” says the ProPublica article.
The Federal Fiscal Sustainability Foundation and ALEC support the draft litigation that is signed by Charles “Chuck” Cooper, a high-powered conservative attorney.
The lawsuit is being circulated among conservative state attorneys general; proponents hope that the litigation will be filed within a few months.
Meanwhile, other constitutional convention advocates are hoping the Trump and GOP congressional leaders will agree to call a constitutional convention without the litigation to promote Trump’s “Make America Great” agenda even further.
 Conclusion

None of this will happen overnight, but the movement for a national constitutional convention is advancing in state legislatures (like Ohio’s) with advocacy groups, and with far-right litigators at a speed greater than ever before.
It is worth understanding, watching, and monitoring.
Now is the perfect-storm moment for a convention, with Trump in the White House, a super-conservative majority on the U. S. Supreme Court, GOP in control of both houses of Congress and most state legislatures.
A convention is the backup plan for getting all of Project 2025 enacted and entrenched into the “new” constitution — but don’t believe for a second that the concept is on the back burner.

Katie Hobbs lamented the rising costs of the state’s school vouchers program that directs public dollars to pay private school tuition.
Characterizing vouchers as an “entitlement program,” Hobbs said the state could spend more than $1 billion subsidizing private education in the upcoming fiscal year. The Democratic governor said those expenses could crowd out other budget priorities, including disability programs and pay raises for firefighters and state troopers.
It’s a dilemma that some budget experts fear will become more common nationwide as the costs of school choice measures mount across the states, reaching billions of dollars each year.
“School vouchers are increasingly eating up state budgets in a way that I don’t think is sustainable long term,” said Whitney Tucker, director of state fiscal policy research at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a think tank that advocates for left-leaning tax policies.
Vouchers and scholarship programs, which use taxpayer money to cover private school tuition, are part of the wider school choice movement that also includes charter schools and other alternatives to public schools.
Opponents have long warned about vouchers draining resources from public education as students move from public schools to private ones. But research into several programs has shown many voucher recipients already were enrolled in private schools. That means universal vouchers could drive up costs by creating two parallel education systems — both funded by taxpayers.










School vouchers are increasingly eating up state budgets in a way that I don't think is sustainable long term.


– Whitney Tucker, director of state fiscal policy research at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities


In Arizona, state officials reported most private school students receiving vouchers in the first two years of the expanded program were not previously enrolled in public schools. In fiscal year 2024, more than half the state’s 75,000 voucher recipients were previously enrolled in private schools or were being homeschooled.
“Vouchers don’t shift costs — they add costs,” Joshua Cowen, a professor of education policy at Michigan State University who studies the issue, recently told Stateline. “Most voucher recipients were already in private schools, meaning states are paying for education they previously didn’t have to fund.”
Voucher proponents, though, say those figures can be misleading. Arizona, like other states with recent expansions, previously had more modest voucher programs. So some kids who were already enrolled in private schools could have already been receiving state subsidies.
In addition to increasing competition, supporters say the programs can actually save taxpayer dollars by delivering education at a lower overall cost than traditional public schools.
One thing is certain: With a record number of students receiving subsidies to attend private schools, vouchers are quickly creating budget concerns for some state leaders.
The rising costs of school choice measures come after years of deep cuts to income taxes in many states, leaving them with less money to spend. An end of pandemic-era aid and potential looming cuts to federal support also have created widespread uncertainty about state budgets.
Trump’s school choice push adds to momentum in statehouses

“We’re seeing a number of things that are creating a sort of perfect storm from a fiscal perspective in the states,” said Tucker, of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.
Last year, Arizona leaders waded through an estimated $1.3 billion budget shortfall. Budget experts said the voucher program was responsible for hundreds of millions of that deficit.
A new universal voucher program in Texas is expected to cost $1 billion over its next two-year budget cycle — a figure that could balloon to nearly $5 billion by 2030, according to a legislative fiscal note.
Earlier this year, Wyoming Republican Gov. Mark Gordon signed a bill expanding the state’s voucher program. But last week, he acknowledged his own “substantial concerns” about the state’s ability to fund vouchers and its public education obligations under the constitution.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
“I think the legislature’s got a very tall task to understand how they’re going to be able to fund all of these things,” he said in an interview with WyoFile.
Voucher proponents, who have been active at the state level for years, are gaining new momentum with support from President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans.
In January, Trump ordered federal agencies to allow states, tribes and military families to access federal money for private K-12 education through education savings accounts, voucher programs or tax credits.
Last week, Republicans on the House Ways and Means Committee voted in favor of making $20 billion available over the next four years for a federal school voucher program. Part of broader work on a bill to extend Trump’s 2017 tax cuts, the measure would need a simple majority in the House and the Senate to pass.
Sweeping private school voucher program tucked inside US House tax bill

Martin Lueken, the director of the Fiscal Research and Education Center at EdChoice, a nonprofit that advocates for school choice measures, argues school choice measures can actually deliver savings to taxpayers.
Lueken said vouchers are not to blame for state budget woes. He said public school systems for years have increased spending faster than inflation. And he noted that school choice measures make up a small share of overall state spending — nationally about 0.3% of total state expenditures in states with school choice, he said.
“Public schooling remains one of the largest line items in state budgets,” he said in an interview. “They are still the dominant provider of K-12 education, and certainly looking at the education pie, they still receive the lion’s share.
“It’s not a choice problem. I would say that it’s a problem with the status quo and the public school system,” he said.
Washington, D.C., and 35 states offer some school choice programs, according to EdChoice. That includes 18 states with voucher programs so expansive that virtually all students can participate regardless of income.
But Lueken said framing vouchers as a new entitlement program is misleading. That’s because all students, even the wealthiest, have always been entitled to a public education — whether they’ve chosen to attend free public schools or private ones that charge tuition.
“At the end of the day, the thing that matters most above dollars are students and families,” he said. “Research is clear that competition works. Public schools have responded in very positive ways when they are faced with increased competitive pressure from choice programs.”
Public school advocates say funding both private and public schools is untenable.
Some states reexamine school discipline as Trump order paves go-ahead

In Wisconsin, Republican lawmakers are considering a major voucher expansion that would alter the funding structure for vouchers, potentially putting more strain on the state’s general fund.
The state spent about $629 million on its four voucher programs during the 2024-2025 school year, according to the Wisconsin Association of School Business Officials, which represents employees in school district finance, human resources and leadership.
The association warns proposed legislation could exacerbate problems with the “unaffordable parallel school systems” in place now by shifting more private schooling costs from parents of those students to state taxpayers at large.
Such expansion “could create the conditions for even greater funding challenges for Wisconsin’s traditional public schools and the state budget as a whole,” the association’s research director wrote in a paper on the issue.
In Arizona, Hobbs originally sought to eliminate the universal voucher program — a nonstarter in the Republican-controlled legislature. She has since proposed shrinking the program by placing income limits that would disqualify the state’s wealthiest families.
That idea also faced Republican opposition.
Legislators are now pushing to enshrine access to vouchers in the state constitution.
Marisol Garcia, president of the Arizona Education Association, the state’s 20,000-member teachers union, noted that vouchers and public education funds are both sourced from the general fund.
“So it almost immediately started to impact public services,” she said of the universal voucher program.
While the union says vouchers have led to cutbacks of important resources such as counselors in public schools, Garcia said the sweeping program also affects the state’s ability to fund other services like housing, transportation and health care.
“Every budget cycle becomes where can we cut in order to essentially feed this out-of-control program?” she said.

John McCosh/Georgia RecorderBy most common measures, the life of Adriana Smith ended three months ago, when a tragic series of undiagnosed blood clots left her brain dead, with no hope of recovery. Yet today, in a hospital room in Midtown Atlanta, Adriana’s body is still being kept alive by machines, without regard to her family’s wishes.
As someone who has been there, I know how difficult and extremely personal that decision can be, but I can only imagine what it must be like to have that choice stripped away, as it has been stripped away from Adriana’s loved ones by people who don’t know them, who know little of their circumstances and deal with none of its consequences. 
In Adriana’s case, she was nine weeks pregnant at the time the blood clots hit, which under some readings of Georgia law has meant that what remains of Adriana’s body is now under government control under the fetus can be safely extracted.
“She’s been breathing through machines for more than 90 days,” April Newkirk, Adriana’s mother, told 11Alive News. “It’s torture for me. I see my daughter breathing, but she’s not there.”
Doctors and lawyers at Emory Healthcare – but mainly the lawyers, I suspect – say that under Georgia’s anti-abortion law, they are required to keep Adriana’s body functioning as the fetus inside her develops. They are erring on the side of caution – not medical caution, but legal caution. 
The law in question is the “Living Infants Fairness and Equality Act.” or the LIFE Act.
  Sen. Ed Setzler. Ross Williams/Georgia Recorder
The main sponsor of that law, state Sen. Ed Setzler, R-Acworth, says it’s working as intended in this case.
“I’m proud that the hospital recognizes the full value of the small human life living inside of this regrettably dying young mother,” Setzler told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. “Mindful of the agony of this young mother’s family, the wisdom of modern medical science to be able to save the life of a healthy unborn child is something that I trust in future years will lead to great joy, with this child having a chance to grow into vibrant adulthood.”
Proud as he might be, Setzler isn’t the one who has to watch what’s left of his daughter lay lifeless in that hospital room, not alive exactly, with machines performing basic life functions, week after week. He isn’t the one who has to explain what’s happening to his seven-year-old grandson, Adriana’s son. If the fetus survives, he also isn’t the one who will have to raise the child. Doctors have warned Adriana’s family that the fetus has fluid on its brain, with unknown consequences.
“She’s pregnant with my grandson,” Newkirk said. “But he may be blind, may not be able to walk, may not survive once he’s born,” she said. “This decision should’ve been left to us.”
According to Georgia Attorney General Chris Carr, however, Emory Healthcare and Setzler are misreading the legislation.
“There is nothing in the LIFE Act that requires medical professionals to keep a woman on life support after brain death,” his office said in a statement. “Removing life support is not an action ‘with the purpose to terminate a pregnancy’.”
Carr’s reading of the law seems to be correct. As his statement indicates, the law defines abortion as “the act of using, prescribing, or administering any instrument, substance, device, or other means with the purpose to terminate a pregnancy,” and the withdrawal of extraordinary life-maintenance measures on a brain-dead woman would not fall within its restrictions.
But this is the problem when you try to write a law into black and white, when you try to legislate what is right and what is wrong when dealing with decisions that are so personal, so intimate. Moral certainty sounds good, it may feel good, it may play well in a political campaign, but it cannot possibly make such hard choices from a distance. The law cannot act more wisely or with more love than would those who know the situation best.

,California,2025-05-21 07:01:00+00:00,CalMatters,Congress debates two issues with big implications for California: EVs and taxes,Dan Walters,,,,,https://calmatters.org/commentary/2025/05/electric-vehicle-waiver-taxes-congress/,Two of the most contentious issues awaiting votes in Congress would have particularly heavy impacts on California.,"Four months into Donald Trump’s second presidency, Republican legislative leaders are attempting to give him some major victories. Two of the most contentious issues now awaiting votes would have particularly heavy impacts on California.
One pending measure would cancel, or at least try to cancel, California’s long-standing waiver of federal clean air rules that allows the state to impose tighter restrictions on emissions. More specifically, legislation that passed the House of Representatives — with support from several dozen Democrats — is pending in the Senate and would undermine California’s decree that no new gasoline-powered cars could be sold in the state after 2035.
Another issue is whether a $10,000 cap on the deductibility of state and local taxes on federal tax returns, passed in 2017 during Trump’s first stint as president, will remain in force, be repealed or be altered.
It has the effect of raising federal levies on taxpayers in states with high income tax rates, such as California, and is seen by leaders of those states as punitive. When the cap was enacted, California tax authorities estimated that it would cost Californians another $12 billion a year.
When the House voted a few weeks ago to cancel California’s Clean Air Act waiver — and those of other states that have followed its lead — Gov. Gavin Newsom cried foul, contending that the action illegally invoked the Congressional Review Act.
“Trump Republicans are hellbent on making California smoggy again,” Newsom said in a statement. “Clean air didn’t used to be political. In fact, we can thank Ronald Reagan and Richard Nixon for our decades-old authority to clean our air.
“The only thing that’s changed is that big polluters and the right-wing propaganda machine have succeeded in buying off the Republican Party — and now the House is using a tactic that the Senate’s own parliamentarian has said is lawless.”
During his first presidency, Trump tried to cancel California’s waiver but failed. The nation’s automakers, although displeased by the 2035 decree, didn’t back Trump’s move.
That was then and this is now. Sales of zero emission vehicles, which were booming a few years ago, have flattened. California had contended that 35% of new vehicle sales in California would be zero emission cars by 2025, but purchases seem to be stuck at about 25%. Major automakers, such as General Motors, now contend that the 2035 mandate is unrealistic.
On Tuesday, U.S. Senate Majority Leader John Thune declared that the chamber would soon vote on the waiver, indicating that he has the votes, and it could garner support from some Democrats, as it did in the House. Its passage probably would touch off a legal battle.
The aforementioned deductibility of state and local taxes, dubbed SALT by the issue’s political warriors, is less settled.
“The SALT deduction has become an outsize stumbling block for Republicans trying to pass a $3.8 trillion tax proposal that would extend President Trump’s 2017 tax cuts and roll back subsidies for clean energy, among other things,” the New York Times reported last week.
“A group of Republican House members, mostly from New York, New Jersey and California, have vowed to vote no on the package unless the cap, which helped pay for the 2017 cuts and expires this year, is raised or abolished. And even among the holdouts, there is dissension — something that drew attention … during a Republican caucus meeting with Speaker Mike Johnson.”
The issue cuts across party lines, pitting legislators from the most affected states against mostly red states that are largely unaffected. While Trump apparently wants to keep the $10,000 cap, the possibility of raising it, perhaps to $30,000, is kicking around. The issue remains deadlocked.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/022724_EV-Chargers-LA_CC_CM_29.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-05-21 04:00:58.223911

Jill Nolin/Georgia RecorderAdvocates are bracing for potential cuts to Georgia’s safety net programs under the GOP’s “big, beautiful bill” moving through Congress, though it remains to be seen what changes to programs like Medicaid will end up in the final version. 
As is, the federal measure would cut more than $600 billion over the next decade from Medicaid, the government health insurance program for low-income Americans and people with disabilities. The savings would go toward extending President Donald Trump’s 2017 tax cuts. 
The U.S. House of Representatives could vote on the bill this week, though as of late Tuesday Republicans had not yet rallied behind the current version. 
Even though the bill appears to be designed to chip away at Medicaid’s expansion under the Affordable Care Act, advocates and others say states like Georgia that did not fully expand Medicaid could still feel the effects of the cuts.
In Georgia, the program covers about 2.2 million people, mostly providing health care coverage and services for children, older Georgians and people with disabilities. In recent years, the program was slightly expanded to include adults who complete 80 hours of work, job training, education or community service every month.
D’Arcy Robb, executive director of the Georgia Council on Developmental Disabilities, said Tuesday that she is not worried about funding for Medicaid-funded services that are considered mandatory, like for care in a nursing home.
But Robb said she is concerned about Medicaid services that are considered optional, such as funding for home and community based services that are designed to keep people with disabilities out of nursing homes. There are already about 8,000 people in Georgia waiting to receive those services, with state lawmakers funding 150 new waivers this year.
“We can’t afford to lose any money. We’re already scraping the bone, and we’re already seeing families that are going to extreme means to support their loved ones,” Robb said.
These waiver programs took a hit during the Great Recession, with Georgia joining all other states in scaling back services to help balance their budgets. Robb is fearing a repeat if a big cut to Medicaid makes it into the final bill.
“I’m not trying to imply that states are going to cut services to people with developmental disabilities because they want to. I don’t think anybody wants that,” Robb said.
“But the reality is the states have to balance their budgets, and history has shown us that when Medicaid takes a big cut on the national level, states have to cut somewhere. One of the places they can cut is waivers,” she said.
As proposed, the bill also includes provisions that would hurt children who are covered by Medicaid, says Callan Wells, senior health policy manager with GEEARS: Georgia Early Education Alliance for Ready Students. About 42% of Georgia children are enrolled in Medicaid.
One proposed change in the bill that has flown under the radar would scale back “retroactive coverage” from three months to one, Wells said.
“This could lead to significant medical debt, especially for families of children with disabilities,” she said. “These children often receive costly care for months before their families learn about and apply for Medicaid. Without full retroactive coverage, families may be left responsible for those early expenses. For many, this coverage is a crucial financial safeguard.”
‘I want to work’
The proposed cuts come at a time when some Georgia GOP leaders had begun to soften their staunch resistance to full Medicaid expansion, though a measure floated this year that had support from a few rural Republicans quickly fizzled.
Natalie Crawford, executive director of Georgia First, a bipartisan advocacy group, urged congressional leaders to rethink sweeping changes that would reduce federal investment in Medicaid. 
Georgia First held a press conference this week with the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network to push back against the bill’s reductions to Medicaid spending.
“These proposals could limit access to care and roll back the progress we’ve made in reducing cancer disparities,” said Fabienne Antoine-Nasser, the society’s Georgia government relations director.
Crawford said the bill would also likely worsen the state’s already high uninsured rate. Georgia is tied with Oklahoma for the second highest uninsured rate in the country.
“Fueling the momentum behind such reforms is a trap of divisive rhetoric, misinformation and fear mongering that clouds the understanding of what this program is really delivering for states and who is really benefiting from the safety net,” Crawford said. 
“Despite what influential voices may try to convince you is true, Medicaid is not covering mostly able-bodied men who don’t want to work,” she said. 
Instead, Crawford said the program should be there to help people like Alton Fry, a Franklin County stone mason who was diagnosed with prostate cancer last year. Fry is caught in what is known as the coverage gap, meaning he makes too much for Medicaid and but too little to afford private health insurance.
Fry said he racked up about $37,000 in medical debt in just about half a year before he started receiving donations through a GoFundMe page. He said he is undergoing radiation treatment, which he says is not the most effective treatment for him but it is more affordable than surgery. 
“I want to work. I don’t want to live off the government,” Fry said. “All I’m asking for is temporary help to get me over this hump in life, and it wasn’t there, and it’s not there.” 
The GOP measure would impose a work requirement on Medicaid recipients starting in 2029. The 90% federal match for states that expand Medicaid, though, would remain intact.
Some far-right Republicans, including Georgia Congressman Andrew Clyde of Athens, are pushing for deeper cuts to Medicaid.
Georgia Congressman Buddy Carter, a Pooler Republican, recently defended the proposed changes to Medicaid while on the Atlanta Journal-Constitution’s Politically Georgia podcast. Carter argued the proposals would help stabilize the program for the most vulnerable.
“You shouldn’t have an able-bodied person who could be doing some type of work – it even includes volunteer work – that is on that program,” said Carter, who is a U.S. Senate candidate. “That’s not who it was intended for, and that’s not who we should be using it for. So, there are all kinds of things that we can do to find savings without kicking anyone off.”

Wes Moore (D) signed 181 bills into law Tuesday, including two that one supporter called “the most substantive energy affordability package that Maryland has seen in several decades.” It came just days before steep rate hikes are set to take effect. (Photo by Bryan P. Sears/Maryland Matters.)Days after vetoing an energy-focused bill backed by General Assembly leadership, Gov. Wes Moore (D) signed two others into law Tuesday.
The larger of the two bills, called the Next Generation Energy Act, aims to increase in-state power generation and battery energy storage, while curtailing costs for consumers by limiting how utilities can spend ratepayer dollars.
The second bill, the Renewable Energy Certainty Act, creates uniform siting standards for commercial solar farms in Maryland, in some cases overruling local jurisdictions that had sought to restrict the farms with zoning rules.
Senate President Bill Ferguson (D-Baltimore City) said the bills make up “the most substantive energy affordability package that Maryland has seen in several decades.” But the new measures come less than two weeks before an expected June rate hike hits.
Prices for Baltimore Gas and Electric customers are estimated to jump $16 per month, and customers of other utilities could see similar increases, according to a report from the Maryland Office of People’s Counsel, which represents ratepayers in the state.
The People’s Counsel in April asked the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to intervene, an appeal echoed in a letter Tuesday signed by 87 Maryland legislators. Their letter argued that the energy auction last year that sparked this summer’s rate hike was flawed.
Ferguson, for whom energy policy was a focus this past session, said that sky-high energy bills over the winter months were a “wake-up call” that spurred the legislature to action.
“We know that older coal plants and oil plants are being retired based on private action, and we have not built up enough alternative energy to fill it fast enough. And so the General Assembly had to act this year,” Ferguson said.

He sponsored the Next Generation Energy Act, which was focused on power generation but became the vehicle for a number of energy proposals, on everything from trash incineration to natural gas infrastructure spending.
The law also pulls about $200 million from a state fund that collects payments from electricity suppliers who cannot meet the state’s renewable energy mandates and redirects the money to refunds for ratepayers. The rebate will average about $80 per household, split between two payments: one this summer and the second in the winter months.
Legislators push back against June rate hike
Some officials, including Maryland People’s Counsel David Lapp, blame multi-state electric grid operator PJM Interconnection for the coming rate hikes. They say that when PJM held a capacity auction last year, it did not include the power expected to be generated by two fossil fuel powered plants it was requiring to stay open, driving prices at auction higher.
Not only will ratepayers pay the high auction prices for power, they will also pay a premium to keep the two Talen Energy plants — Brandon Shores and H.A. Wagner — operating. PJM has already pledged to change its auction policies to prevent a similar situation in the future.
In the meantime, Lapp in April petitioned FERC to reject the cost increases for ratepayers.  On Tuesday, the 87  legislators joined the chorus, urging FERC to reject the costs as “unjust and unreasonable.” The Maryland Public Service Commission also backed Lapp, filing its own comments with FERC on Tuesday.
“Without Commission action, customers still will be stuck paying ‘twice’ as a result of last summer’s auction,” the lawmakers’ letter said. “The Commission must act expeditiously to acknowledge and remedy the problems.”
Lawmakers also called on FERC to “protect Maryland customers from having to pay for windfall profits — far above the costs of service — to Talen to keep its Baltimore-area plants online.” Their letter said the two plants could keep running at a cost of $97 million, but consumers will be charged $180 million.
Ballot referendum campaign is a question mark
Last week, a group calling itself the Maryland Environment Labor and Industry Coalition filed as a ballot issue committee with the state, indicating it intended to challenge the Next Generation bill via referendum. But a representative for the group said that was looking unlikely after Tuesday’s signing ceremony.

“I would bet that they will not go forward with the referendum, and instead work closely with the governor and legislature to promote responsible environmental and labor-friendly laws,” said Doug Gansler, the state’s Maryland attorney general.
He said the group is still reviewing its options. But with no public outreach campaign, and just 11 days to collect the first 20,000 petition signatures from verified Maryland voters, he said the challenge may just be too great.
The group, which has Montgomery County ties, seemed poised to focus on part of the Next Generation Act that would end a “renewable energy” subsidy for trash incinerators that produce power. The state’s two such incinerators are in Baltimore City and Montgomery County.
The solar energy bill signed Tuesday by Moore has also garnered criticism, particularly from Republican legislators representing the rural Eastern Shore, who argued that the policy would make it easier for solar companies to gobble up productive farmland.
But it was perhaps the least controversial bill of the package that found itself the target of a Moore veto Friday: A bill creating a “Strategic Energy Planning Office,” funded by an existing process that also fuels the Public Service Commission and Office of People’s Counsel.
Moore’s veto, citing the cost of establishing the office, surprised sponsor Sen. Katie Fry Hester (D-Howard and Montgomery).
“I look forward to better understanding his rationale and will work with leadership in the Legislature to determine next steps,” Hester said in a statement to Maryland Matters Friday.
Next Generation bill gets praise amid controversy
In a statement Tuesday, Emily Scarr, a senior adviser at the consumer advocacy group Maryland PIRG, said the bill made “groundbreaking pro-consumer changes to utility regulation.”
“By prioritizing safety over gas system expansion and reining in wasteful spending by BGE and other Maryland utilities, this new law can save Marylanders hundreds of millions of dollars,” Scarr wrote.
Lapp agreed.

“Maximizing the legislation’s potential benefits will depend on lots of work at the Public Service Commission,” Lapp said. “We look forward to using the new tools to slow or prevent further rate increases.”
Environmental groups were more mixed in their responses to the Next Generation bill. Many were troubled by its potential to expedite a new natural gas power plant in Maryland, including by fast-tracking new facilities on the site of retired power plants. But amendments lessened the blow, and added environmental priorities — like beefing up energy storage and cutting funding for incineration.
The Mid-Atlantic Renewable Energy Coalition, now known as MAREC Action, an industry group representing utility-scale developers of wind and solar, as well as battery energy storage, applauded the bill’s power storage provisions in a statement Tuesday.
“With this legislation, our industry will invest in Maryland, deliver reliable energy resources needed to keep the lights on, and stabilize prices for Maryland ratepayers,” said Evan Vaughan, executive director of MAREC Action.
The bill calls for two procurement periods, beginning in 2026, when the Maryland Public Service Commission will seek to bring  800 megawatts of energy storage in each period to the state.
Currently, the multistate electric grid that includes Maryland only hosts 375 megawatts of storage, which MAREC said “pales in comparison” to other states such as California and Texas. If Maryland follows through with the procurements, it would be positioned as an “energy storage leader” within the 13-state PJM region, according to the industry group’s news release.
The purchases could work quickly to fill gaps in Maryland’s electric grid, by storing energy for use during peak times, Vaughan said.
“Governor Moore and legislative leaders acted quickly and decisively to ensure Maryland maximizes its energy storage resources,” Vaughan wrote. “These resources meet energy reliability needs more quickly than any other resource.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/DSC_0147-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-05-21 03:01:15.440471

(Photo by Bryan P. Sears/Maryland Matters)Family, loved ones and colleagues of Davis Martinez gathered in Annapolis Tuesday for a bittersweet occasion – to witness the signing of a law named to honor the slain parole agent’s memory by boosting protections for state workers.
“His family and his loved ones turned that pain into purpose,” Gov. Wes Moore (D) said before signing the Davis Martinez Public Employee Safety and Health Act. “They came to Annapolis to advocate the legislation that would help ensure what happened [to Martinez] would never happen again.”
It was just one of 181 bill signed into law Tuesday in the final bill signing session after a challenging 2025 legislative session. The measures ranged from the mundane to the major — the fiscal 2026 budget — and included moments of personal reflection from House Speaker Adrienne Jones (D-Baltimore County) and pure elation from long-suffering advocates finally seeing victory.
Martinez became the first parole agent killed in the line of duty when he was brutally slain on the morning of May 31, 2024, while making a routine check on a parolee at a home in Silver Spring.
Martinez’s supervisors did not check on him until well into the evening, after coworkers noticed him missing and expressed concern for his well-being. Police found Martinez dead with multiple stab wounds at the home of the parolee, Emanuel Edward Sewell, who was arrested a day later in West Virginia and has since been charged with first-degree murder in Martinez’s death.
Martinez’s family and labor unions called on the legislature to boost protections for state employees in the wake of the killing, which led to Senate Bill 26 and House Bill 176, which passed with unanimous approval. The legislation, now law, will provide better oversight of state workplaces and create a unit within the Division of Labor and Industry focused on public employee safety and health.
Senate President Bill Ferguson (D-Baltimore City) said Martinez represents thousands of Maryland’s “dedicated state workers that show up to work every single day to serve others.”
“We are so deeply sorry for your loss, and we hope that this piece of legislation … is one small step to honor your loved one’s memory,” he told Martinez’s family.

Tuesday’s bill signing began with Moore and legislative leadership looking back on a legislative session filled with challenges – including a multibillion-dollar budget deficit and rapid-fire policy changes at the federal level. In spite of those challenges, Moore signed House Speaker Adrienne Jones’ (D-Baltimore County) bill combining several current state offices to create a new Department of Social and Economic Mobility.
Jones believes that her legislation House Bill 1253 runs “in stark contrast” to the Trump administration’s efforts to eliminate diversity, equity and inclusion programs.
“When we say social and economic mobility, let’s be very clear on what we’re talking about,” Jones said Tuesday. “We’re talking about the strength of our diversity. We’re talking about promoting equity and we’re talking about creating inclusion in all spaces. I’m not afraid to say it.”
She noted that the bill was personal for her as a Black woman.
“I’ve walked on to an unleveled playing field. I’ve been kept out of rooms, meetings and buildings solely because of my race and gender,” she said. “We’ve come a long way since these times … and I refuse to let us go back today.”
Jones extended that promise to Maryland’s immigrant community, much of whome feel unsafe from the Trump administration’s increased deportation efforts on undocumented immigrants.
She highlighted House Bill 1222, which directs the Maryland Attorney General to develop guidelines that clarify how officials at “sensitive locations” — which include public schools, places of worship, courthouses, hospitals and similar locations — should interact with federal immigration enforcement agents.
“The fear felt in Maryland’s immigrant communities is real right now,” Jones said. “Marylanders should feel safe while seeking medical care, pursing education and going to church … But as we see the suspension of the process and as we see a continued erosion of basic human dignity in our immigrant communities, we know this work is far from over.”
The Tuesday bill signing also included the approval of the 2026 budget and a dense energy package, two heavily debated topics over the legislative session. But despite the weighty topics, there were also some moments of celebration during the event.

Longtime health care advocate Vincent DeMarco celebrated the governor’s signature on House Bill 424 and Senate Bill 357, which will expand the authority of the state’s current Prescription Drug Affordability Board to help bring prescription drug costs down for all Marylanders. Currently, the board only looks at the cost of drugs for state employee health plans.
During the bill signing, Moore gave a shout-out to DeMarco as someone who “has been a champion for affordable health care for decades.”
DeMarco later said he was “ecstatic” about the board’s expansion.
Moore also signed off on one of his priority bills, to reform the state’s procurement process – a topic that he admitted was “not sexy” but is “absolutely essential in delivering economic growth and building pathways to work, wages and wealth.”
House Bill 500 reworks several parts of the state’s procurement laws to support more minority-owned businesses and veteran-owned businesses, increase oversight of procurements, along with other changes.
Moore said that the bills signed Tuesday were reflective of the hard work the legislature, his administration and advocates put into the bills during the challenging 2025 session.
“We had to be nimble in the face of uncertainty and be courageous in the face of chaos,” Moore said. “If there is one thing we’re able to prove in this session is this: That in Maryland, we can look at challenge squarely in the face and refuse to blink.”

Wes Moore hands a pen he used to sign the state's $67 billion budget for fiscal 2026 to House Appropriations Chair Ben Barnes. (Photo by Bryan P. Sears/Maryland Matters)Maryland’s $67 billion spending plan, which includes more than $1.6 billion in taxes and fees, was signed into law Tuesday by Gov. Wes Moore (D), capping what he called a session of challenges and chaos.
The signing ceremony, the fourth and final scheduled event, caps a difficult 90-day legislative session. The budget package — three bills — were part of a tranche of 181 bills signed into law Tuesday by Moore.
In opening remarks, Moore said his third legislative session “wasn’t just … a legislative season of challenge, it was also a season of change, where the obstacles that we’re up against did not change from month to month or from week to week. We all saw they were changing from day to day.”
Lawmakers entered the session needing to resolve an immediate $3.3 billion structural budget deficit projected for fiscal 2026. A similar sized gap was projected for the following year. By fiscal 2030, that gap was projected to widen to more than $6 billion.
The effort was complicated when President Donald Trump was sworn in for his second term on Jan. 20. The Republican immediately set about slashing federal spending and employment.
A March report by Moody’s, a major bond rating agency, named Maryland the state most at risk for fiscal problems. A key concern is the large number of federal workers, contractors and grants that underpin the state’s economy, targets of Trump’s cutting, according to the company.

Senate President Bill Ferguson (D-Baltimore City) described the session as “by far the most challenging one that I certainly have experienced in my 15 years. And it continues to be incredibly difficult because of the uncertainty that we see and the volatility that’s coming out of Washington.”
The budget plan reflected that chaos as much as any other piece of legislation this year.
“We had to be nimble in the face of this uncertainty and be courageous in the face of chaos,” Moore said. “This was not just about balancing a budget, it was about weathering two very distinct and individual storms, a financial crisis and a fiscal crisis and a new White House that is determined to attack our economy. ”
Those near-daily adjustments pushed the timeline on finalizing a spending plan deep into the 90-day session. The work blew through legislative deadlines.
None of the work, however, guarantees the legislature will not have to return before January to make more budget changes.
The final $67 billion plan, which includes all funding sources including federal aid, is 1% larger than the current year budget.
The general fund budget weighs in about $400 million lower than the current year. The general fund budget represents the spending plan for which the state directly taxes Maryland residents. As part of the effort, Moore said he and lawmakers agreed on $2 billion in budget cuts. But in addition to actual reduced spending, the cuts also include holding vacant positions open, shifting costs to local governments and backfilling by transferring cash from special accounts.
Even so, the Democratic supermajority passed a spending plan that includes more than $1.6 billion in taxes and fees. Included in that is a 3% tech tax that is projected to raise $500 million.
In addition to two new higher-income tax brackets, there is some small tax relief. Moore and lawmakers said 92% of taxpayers will see a refund — $50-$65 on average — or no increase in their income taxes.
Moore signs two energy bills as June rate hikes loom

Republicans said there was little to celebrate, given all the other tax and fee increases approved by the legislature.
“Let’s be very clear — today’s bill signing wasn’t a celebration of tax relief, it was the final approval of a growing list of new taxes,” said Senate Minority Leader Steve Hershey (R-Upper Shore). “The Governor has now made permanent the tax-and-spend culture that’s already driving people and businesses out of Maryland.”
Moore last week used his line-item veto power to reject two provisions within the spending plan that were tied to separate bills he vetoed, among nearly two dozen dumped by the governor late Friday afternoon. If lawmakers want to overturn the budget vetoes, they will have to return to Annapolis before the end of June.
The work, however, did not prevent Moody’s from downgrading its rating of the state’s creditworthiness from its treasured Aaa rating to Aa1. It’s the first time the state has not held Moody’s highest rating since 1973.
Moore, Ferguson, House Speaker Adrienne Jones (D-Baltimore County) and others blamed the downgrade on Trump, but the rating firm raised concerns a year ago about the state’s fiscal situation.

For the first time since its birth as one of the good-government reforms after Watergate, the appointment of the executive director of the State Elections Enforcement Commission would be subject to the approval of the legislators whose campaign finances are overseen by the agency.
The bill passed 34-1 after a brief debate, with the sole dissenting vote cast by Sen. Mae Flexer, D-Windham. She did not enter the Senate chamber during the debate or roll call and voted remotely from elsewhere in the Capitol complex, as allowed by legislative rules. 
Unlike previous efforts to put the elections watchdog on a tighter leash, Senate Bill 1405 is the result of negotiations by the Democratic and Republican leaders of the Senate and House. The bill now goes to the House for expected passage. Gov. Ned Lamont has yet to say if he will sign the bill.
SEEC, as the elections commission is known, enforces elections and campaign finance laws and administers the Citizens’ Elections Program that was created 10 years ago as an anti-corruption measure. It provides public financing of campaigns once candidates raise qualifying contributions.
The bill would limit SEEC’s post-election audits on publicly financed candidates to no more than 20% of campaigns, rather than the 50% now allowed, and bar the commission from issuing declaratory rulings and formal written guidance in the six months before elections.
As originally drafted, the bill would have given the General Assembly the ability to review and reject the formal guidance the commission often publishes. 
An amendment drafted and adopted Tuesday gives the four legislative caucus leaders the right to review any guidance document that exceeds 40 pages before publication and also allows a hearing on such documents.
The five-member State Elections Enforcement Commission, whose members are appointed by the governor and four legislative caucus leaders, would lose its status as the sole authority to hire and fire the agency’s leader, the executive director and general counsel.

Sen. Rob Sampson, R-Wolcott, praised the bill as a “delicate balance.” Credit: mark pazniokas
Under the bill, the commission’s choice for the job would be subject to a confirmation hearing and vote by the legislature’s Executive and Legislative Nominations Committee, the panel that bottled up the reappointment of the state’s top utilities regulator until the governor agreed to appoint one of the committee members and a former lawmaker to the regulatory authority.
Confirmation also would require a majority vote of the House and Senate.
In a letter signed by all five members, the commission warned against the change.
“[H]aving an executive director appointed and evaluated by the very people regulated by our campaign finance laws will create the perception that elections enforcement is partisan,” they wrote. “This, in turn, will have the consequence of undermining public confidence in campaign finance enforcement.”
The League of Women Voters also urged rejection of the bill, saying the independence of SEEC is crucial to ensuring fair elections and transparency in campaign finances.
“It is not a moment to muck around with the institutions that safeguard free and fair elections. It is not a time to loosen accountability and transparency on how campaigns are financed, or how government funds are used,” the League wrote.
Tom Swan of the Connecticut Citizen Action Group, part of the coalition that helped pass public financing 10 years ago, said, “This is a blatant power grab by the legislature, and we will urge the House to amend it to restore the integrity of SEEC and protect the CEP.”
Passage comes at a time of transition for the commission. Its former general counsel and executive director, Michael J. Brandi, took early retirement after 12 years in the job in late 2024 due to poor health. Clare Kindall, the former solicitor general of Connecticut, is the interim director and counsel.
Kindall, an applicant for the permanent job, acknowledged shortcomings at SEEC but questioned the scope and timing of the legislation.
“The Citizens’ Election Program is kind of the crown jewel of Connecticut democracy. I mean, it has made such a huge difference in Connecticut, as far as elections and people’s abilities to run and to keep elections clean,” she said. “And given what’s happened nationally, is anybody reading the room?”
Senate Majority Leader Bob Duff, D-Norwalk, who is the co-chair of the Executive and Legislative Nominations Committee, said in an interview before the debate that he would quiz any nominee for the SEEC job as to their approach and philosophy.
“How they view the role of the agency versus what’s in the law versus what they think otherwise,” Duff said. “How do they view things? Are they there to assist and help, or are they there in a different mechanism?”
Duff objected to lobbying on the bill and other elections measures by Kindall and her predecessor as agency overreach.
On and off the Senate floor, leaders of both parties described the legislation as reflecting grievances about the aggressive efforts at times to verify the legitimacy of qualifying contributions for public financing and a slow and occasionally inconsistent review process of grant applications.
“Sometimes it’s like walking through mud, and I think that’s what frustrates me,” Duff said. “We had an instance where SEEC literally knocked on the doors of people in a community that gave $5 donations to make sure they were real. They harassed some of my own $5 contributors.”
To qualify for public financing, candidates need contributions ranging from $5 to $250. A certain percentage must be in the communities in a legislator’s district. Donors must sign a form attesting to their identity, residence and employer. The commission was slow to approve grant applications in 2024.
Like Duff, Senate Minority Leader Stephen Harding, R-Brookfield, said the frustrations with SEEC have been cumulative.
“This is something that has been problematic, and I think it’s getting in the way of good government,” Harding said. “It’s getting in the way of democracy in action and allowing candidates to get grants, allowing candidates to run their campaigns effectively and efficiently. And so I think this has gone beyond frustration. This is at a point, frankly, where this is getting in the way of elections.”
The legislative leaders eased passage by creating a new committee, the Government Oversight Committee, which originated the bill, bypassing the Government Administration and Elections Committee that is co-chaired by Flexer and formerly handled all elections-related bills.
Flexer was visited in her office immediately before the debate by Duff, Sen. Sujata Gadkar-Wilcox, D-Trumbull, and the Senate Democratic caucus’s chief of staff, Courtney Cullinan. Flexer said later she shared her misgivings about the bill.

“I think the bill just went too far, and organizations like the League of Women Voters and Common Cause outweigh the bipartisan and bicameral support. I’m going to vote with them,” she said.
Gadkar-Wilcox, a law professor elected last fall, is co-chair of the oversight committee that produced the bill. On the floor, she was joined by Sen. Rob Sampson, R-Wolcott, the ranking Republican on the committee, praising the bill as making necessary changes while maintaining a degree of independence.
“I think this bill strikes that balance,” she said.
“I think we found the delicate balance where we’re making good policy to keep the mission of the SEEC intact, but we’re also making reforms that I think will be beneficial to candidates going forward and making sure that our system is fair and is just,” Sampson said.
Gadkar-Wilson, Sampson, Harding and Senate President Martin M. Looney, D-New Haven, were the only lawmakers to speak on the floor.
Looney called public financing a success but said SEEC is in need of reform.
“We all know that treasurers often find it very frustrating to operate in dealing with SEEC in terms of the procedures they have to go through during the course of the campaign,” Looney said. “We know there have been many times where information has been provided and then seek claims that they’ve never received. It has to be provided all over again.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_7538-1024x783.jpeg,,,2025-05-21 02:00:35.887042

March 3, 2025. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — A legislative proposal seeking to help implement Nebraska’s voter-approved medical cannabis laws failed Tuesday, facing a tougher floor fight than four years ago despite widespread support in November.
The latest measure, Legislative Bill 677, failed to garner the 33 votes needed to shut off a filibuster, with the bipartisan effort to stop debate falling 23-22. The regulatory push secured the support of eight Republicans, 14 Democrats and one nonpartisan progressive in the officially nonpartisan 49-member body (State Sen. Ashlei Spivey of Omaha, the only other Democrat, was absent from the final vote but had supported the bill).
Republican State Sens. John Arch of La Vista, Carolyn Bosn of Lincoln and Merv Riepe of Ralston declined to take a position and were “present, not voting.”

State Sen. Ben Hansen of Blair, a Republican with a Libertarian bent who sponsored LB 677, sought to appeal to his conservative colleagues that “on a limb,” everyone could agree that medical cannabis could at least help someone.
“If that’s the case, you believe in medical cannabis, and that’s OK,” Hansen said. “I know sometimes that scares some of us.”
Freshman State Sen. Glen Meyer of Pender was one Republican who heeded Hansen’s call.
“I would hope, and hope’s not a plan, but I do have faith in this body, I would expect intelligent people with good hearts, which I believe this body is, can find a way to provide relief with some medical marijuana,” Meyer said.
The other six Republicans joining Hansen and Meyer were State Sens. Tom Brandt of Plymouth, Stan Clouse of Kearney, Myron Dorn of Adams, Rick Holdcroft of Bellevue, Jana Hughes of Seward and Dave Wordekemper of Fremont.
But at the end of the day, Gov. Jim Pillen, Attorney General Mike Hilgers and Nebraska’s junior U.S. Sen. Pete Ricketts, R-Neb., Pillen’s predecessor, prevailed in their public calls against passing LB 677, peeling off enough Republican senators to stop the bill.
Voters legalized medical cannabis with 71% approval in November, for up to 5 ounces of cannabis with a physician’s recommendation. A separate regulatory law secured 67% approval.
‘We can always come back’
Leading the charge against LB 677 was freshman State Sen. Jared Storm of David City, who echoed the calls of Hilgers and Ricketts that legislation wasn’t needed to help implement the state’s new medical cannabis laws.

Storm and multiple Republicans said the new Nebraska Medical Cannabis Commission, which voters created and charged with “exclusive” regulatory authority, should be left to act on its own first, without legislative changes.
“If we have any issues, we can always come back as a body and tweak those issues, not jump off the cliff,” Storm said of Hansen’s LB 677 and an accompanying amendment.
He added: “I don’t want anybody to think that I’m some cold-hearted monster here that does not have sympathy for children and adults that are suffering through pain. But we have to get this right.”
The hesitation also came as Hilgers’ office continues challenging whether the ballot measures were properly placed on the 2024 ballot and an expected future state-led challenge arguing the voter-approved laws violate federal law. The AG’s Office was in court earlier Tuesday asking for a citizen-led lawsuit alleging the same legal challenge to be tossed so Hilgers’ staff can sue.
Hilgers also organized opposition to LB 677 from 53 sheriffs, including the Nebraska Sheriffs Association, and the Police Chiefs Association of Nebraska.

‘Let’s help shape it’
State Sen. John Fredrickson of Omaha, a mental health practitioner, said cannabis would not “leap off the shelves” and corrupt Nebraska youth, as some opponents contended. He said senators sometimes needed to go outside and “touch some grass and just think about what the world is like outside of this room.”
“Let’s not get too concerned about ‘fighting against the will of the people,’” Fredrickson said. “Let’s help shape it. Let’s help put in the right guardrails in place, and let’s help build a system that we can be proud of and puts our patients first.”
Hansen said a strong regulatory system could also save lives from over-reliance on opioids, which State Sen. Dan Quick of Grand Island echoed.

Quick said he thought medical cannabis might one day be able to help his son who has struggled with opioid, drug and alcohol addiction for about 25 years. In that time, Quick said he and his wife have administered life-saving meds to reverse overdoses. 
“I think this is an important bill that could help a lot of people, and we need to take that into consideration in what we’re doing,” Quick said.
State Sens. Megan Hunt and Dunixi Guereca, both of Omaha, said opponents also needed to grow up and embrace the modern acceptance of medical cannabis.
“The 1990s have called, and they want their ‘Reefer Madness’ back,” Guereca said. “It is the year of our Lord 2025. Medical marijuana is not controversial.”
‘The will of the people’
Multiple opponents targeted Democrats for their support of LB 677 but opposition to other measures this year to water down voter-approved laws related to paid sick leave and minimum wage. In those cases, 32 of 33 Republicans support changing what voters approved, including Hansen. State Sen. Jane Raybould of Lincoln is the lone Democrat in favor of the sick leave and minimum wage changes, and she proposed the minimum wage tweaks.
“This bill’s unnecessary, inappropriate, undermines the will of the people and implements recreational marijuana,” State Sen. Bob Andersen of north-central Sarpy County said.

Hansen and State Sens. John Cavanaugh of Omaha, Danielle Conrad of Lincoln and George Dungan of Lincoln repeatedly pushed back and noted that backers of the medical cannabis ballot measure asked for LB 677, unlike supporters of the sick leave and minimum wage changes.
Public support for medical cannabis was widespread in November, with majority approval in all 49 legislative districts for legalization and 46 of 49 districts favoring a regulatory system.
Cavanaugh and Dungan said LB 677 was stricter than they would have liked but helped voters whose will Dungan said would “once again be stifled” if LB 677 failed.
Cavanaugh, who offered amendments to make the bill less restrictive, said its negotiated constraints were “in the interest of accessibility, safety, reliability.”
‘Let’s cool our jets’
State Sen. Tanya Storer of Whitman called out “political theater” and said part of the urgency for passing LB 677 was an effort by supporters of medical cannabis to get around legal challenges.
“Don’t be fooled about the why, about the panic, about why the marijuana proponents are playing on your fear and emotion that we’re going to have mayhem and chaos if we don’t pass 677. If we pass it, we put it in state statute,” Storer said.

Some senators, as well as Hilgers, have said LB 677 could weaken his office’s pending appeal before the Nebraska Supreme Court alleging improper notarizations during the ballot measure process, which a Lancaster County District Court judge widely rejected in November, after the election. Ballot sponsors have also consistently denied wrongdoing.
Some opponents flaunted that decision and said they hope the Nebraska Supreme Court “gets it right,” including State Sen. Mike Jacobson of North Platte, who asked whether LB 677 would incentivize people to “dummy up a bunch of signatures.”
Jacobson and State Sen. Bob Hallstrom of Syracuse, a lawyer, repeatedly pointed to the fraud-focused case and said Hilgers was protecting the ballot measure process.
“Let’s cool our jets. Let’s slow down the pace,” Jacobson said.
‘This issue isn’t going away’
Conrad and the ballot sponsors have said it is Hilgers and Secretary of State Bob Evnen’s alleged fraud case who are threatening the petition process and seek to “ruin the lives of grassroots activists who peacefully petitioned their government for change.”
Despite opponents’ best efforts, Conrad said, the Legislature had already affirmed the ballot measures with an earlier cleanup bill passed Feb. 21 in a 48-0 vote: LB 1.

Conrad also blasted some opponents for drumming up the very evidence that Lancaster County District Judge Susan Strong, a Ricketts appointee, had rejected, including texts among campaign volunteers. Conrad, citing Strong, said she found them “completely out of context, legally irrelevant and cherry-picked.”
“To regurgitate them here on the floor of the Legislature, again, out of context, again, to sling mud, again, to drag moms of sick kids who are petitioning their government to try and find a cure, that says a lot about you,” Conrad said.
Meyer said that even if signatures are ultimately tossed, and the state Supreme Court sides with Hilgers’ appeal, voters’ strong approval would still carry weight.
Many of the same campaign volunteers, including all but one of the main notaries being targeted by the AG’s Office, showed up for the debate. In the early hours of debate, one of the long-time advocates had seven seizures. Her mom helped start the legislative push more than a decade ago.
Some volunteers said that while the defeat of LB 677 was a loss, they wouldn’t stop fighting and would keep showing up.
“This issue isn’t going away. I don’t believe the people will let it go away,” said Crista Eggers, executive director of Nebraskans for Medical Marijuana, who described the defeat as an “absolute failure.”
Hansen predicted that LB 677’s defeat could accelerate the push for recreational marijuana, as early as the 2026 election. That would come at the same time Pillen, Hilgers, Evnen, Ricketts and half of the seats in the Legislature are up for reelection.
‘Choke it to death’
Another major theme of the debate was whether the Legislature should step in before the Medical Cannabis Commission has a chance to, as the Legislature has not yet considered or confirmed two final gubernatorial appointees.
Both of those Pillen picks — Dr. Monica Oldenburg of Lincoln and Lorelle Mueting of Gretna — have a confirmation hearing Thursday. Each has consistently opposed the same measures that Eggers and other long-time supporters have fought for. Mueting opposed LB 677 but was “neutral” on a much stricter bill from Storm.
“Why would we as a Legislature start messing with the commission that hasn’t even started doing its work yet?” State Sen. Rob Dover of Norfolk asked during debate.

But Hansen said the commission’s broad authority and the apparent lean of the appointees could signal where the regulations ultimately end up, which he said does nothing but hurt patients.
“If they take the reins, they can choke it to death,” Hansen said of the commission.
Four years ago, an earlier medical marijuana bill failed 31-18 in face of Republican opposition. Hilgers, a former state senator, opposed the 2021 bill, too. 
But unlike that narrow defeat, LB 677 faced one of the toughest fights for advocates in a decade, even as the 2025 debate came at a different political moment than in 2021. That includes Ricketts no longer being governor. He had said legalized marijuana would “kill your kids.” It also includes overwhelming approval of the ballot measures.
“I think you know in your hearts that people deserve this, and you know in your hearts what’s going to happen if we don’t,” Hansen told his colleagues. “The people voted for you to make a decision, not to push it off to somebody else.”

 With 370,000 acres of active farmland, our agricultural sector contributes more than $4 billion annually to the state economy and supports 30,000 jobs. Yet despite this economic and social importance, Connecticut’s agrarian future is precarious. Between 2017 and 2022, we lost 463 farms. Rising production costs, climate pressures, and an aging farmer population threaten the future of farming in our state.

Zane Tickoo
To support our farmers and secure a more resilient food system, we must start by rethinking how we value food, not as a commodity, but as a connector. Connecticut, one of the most urbanized states in the country, may not be the first place that comes to mind when you think of farmland. Yet it is precisely because of our size and geographic diversity that we are uniquely positioned to lead in local food innovation, if we invest in the right programs.
Farm-to-school initiatives like CT Grown for CT Kids and the Connecticut Local Food for Schools Incentive Program are shining examples of what this kind of investment looks like. These programs connect local farmers with schools, ensuring that students receive fresh, nutritious meals while providing farmers with a stable, reliable market. It’s a win-win, children are better nourished, and farms are better supported.
That’s why recent developments are so alarming. In 2025, both programs faced devastating federal and state funding cuts. The USDA unexpectedly ended the Local Food for Schools Cooperative Agreement Program, stripping $5.6 million from Connecticut’s farm-to-school pipeline. At the state level, Gov. Ned Lamont’s proposed budget would cut $1 million from the Department of Agriculture, effectively eliminating CT Grown for CT Kids. Without meaningful intervention, these setbacks threaten to undo years of progress toward building a healthier and more resilient local food system.
Fortunately, the legislature has a chance to reverse course. House Bill 7013, now under consideration, offers a path forward. It proposes measures to strengthen program coordination, outreach, and technical assistance with schools and ensure smoother implementation. The bill also expands program eligibility to include childcare providers, broadening the reach of local food access beyond K–12 settings.
Just as importantly, HB 7013 and the proposed Appropriations budget seeks sustained funding for both programs, providing the financial stability needed for them to thrive. Organizations like the Connecticut Northeast Organic Farming Association (CT NOFA) have voiced strong support, recognizing the bill’s potential to bolster local agriculture, improve student nutrition, and increase public awareness around food systems.
This isn’t just smart policy,  it’s a moral imperative. Supporting farm-to-school programs isn’t just about feeding kids; it’s about shaping the next generation of Connecticut’s farmers, food entrepreneurs, and engaged citizens. When students learn where their food comes from, they gain a deeper appreciation for the land, labor, and community behind every meal.
Moreover, these programs can help address one of the most pressing challenges in agriculture today: a lack of young people entering the field. Farming is often viewed as inaccessible, outdated, or financially unviable. But by embedding food literacy into school curricula, expanding school gardens, and exposing students to sustainable farming practices, we can help change the narrative and inspire a new generation to see farming as both a calling and a career.
If we want a future in which Connecticut’s farms flourish and our children grow up nourished in every sense of the word, we must start by protecting and expanding these programs. That means not only preserving existing farmland but also investing in the infrastructure, both physical and educational, that connects people to it.
The future of Connecticut’s food system depends on bold, community-centered action. HB 7013 and funding for farm-to-school represents a critical next step to affirm a vision for Connecticut in which every child has access to healthy food, every farmer has access to a strong market, and every community has a stake in the resilience of our local food system.
Contact your legislators. Let them know that food matters, not just to our plates, but to our economy, our health, and our shared future.

Unfortunately, the special education bills currently speeding their way through Connecticut’s legislature, HB-7277 and the identical SB-1561, would make the system far worse and reduce the ability of families—and even school teams—to meet the needs of children with disabilities. Worse, they would further erode the rights and protections for these children and reduce accountability and transparency in our public schools.

Diane Willcutts
For example, the bills call for removing from children’s Individualized Education Plans (IEPs) a column called “service implementer.”  Why should families care?  Because if that column is removed, districts will have free rein to use anyone to provide specialized instruction. It could be a special education teacher, a paraprofessional, or the next random person to walk past the principal’s office. 
Many short-staffed districts already try to provide special education services with unqualified staff, but students are entitled to have those services made up by the implementer listed in the IEP. Without that column in the IEP, there is no accountability or transparency, and it may be impossible for families to contest the district’s decision-making. 
This is just one example; a baffling number of other such “poison pills” lurk in the 63-page bills, despite the supporters’ stated intentions to make special education more accessible.
Most of the April hearing focused on the high cost of private special education placements, and Rep. Maryam Khan, House Chair of the Committee, stated, “As a teacher. . . I’ve been in PPTs (special education Planning and Placement Team meetings) where I’m, like, this child should be elsewhere, but I know I can’t say that as a teacher. That’s just the reality. . .because of what districts are faced with. Districts can’t pay what they are going to be asked to pay if they actually want to provide what the student needs.” 
She also stated, “Our goal is to fix the system, not just to save the couple (students) that we can.”  Note that Khan is herself a special education teacher in East Hartford. My translation of her alarming remarks:  Because of budget concerns, school districts are failing to meet the needs of all but a few students with disabilities. And even if a teacher believes the child needs a private special education school, the teacher cannot speak up for the child but must remain silent, even knowing the child’s needs are not being met.
Khan added, “The education system itself is very broken. . . some students, if they are lucky enough to get access to an advocate or attorney or they have a parent who really knows or understands the system, they may be able to make it, but everybody else is not in a good space.  So through some of the measures in this bill we try to address that, so everyone has equal access. . .” 
(Khan’s remarks begin at around 8:34:30 of the above video and continue to 8:35:32. The quotes are exact but are out of order.)
But instead of providing more access to special education protections for all children and their families, HB-7277 and SB-1561 move in the direction of eliminating any ability of families to enforce the law. I suppose that could be considered “equal access,” but it is certainly not in the interest of children.
So how do we fix special education?  
1) Teach our kids to read! 
According to the National Assessment of Educational Progress, only 36% of all Connecticut fourth graders are at or above proficiency in reading. In contrast, research tells us that, if students received structured literacy delivered in a way that is consistent with reading science, 95% of ALL students are capable of reading proficiently. 
Unfortunately, most of our universities have not provided our K-3 teachers, special education teachers, or even our reading specialists with adequate preparation to effectively teach reading in a way that is consistent with reading science. Most teachers require two years of training and supervised practicum specifically in structured literacy, which can be done through Orton-Gillingham certification, CALT certification, etc. 
Most children, including those with dyslexia, require structured literacy, and all students benefit from it. Providing effective reading instruction —which requires teachers to be certified in structured literacy— will help all students, not just those with disabilities.
2) Districts need to use evidence-based social/emotional/behavioral programming that published, peer-reviewed research has determined to work. 
For example, Ross Greene’s Collaborative and Proactive Solutions has an entire body of peer-reviewed publications showing that his model is successful in reducing restraints/seclusions and reducing exclusionary discipline. It is also likely to reduce bullying in our schools. This too requires extensive training and increased staffing in our public schools. But again, this investment helps all students, not just those with disabilities.
We need to keep our eyes on the ball —meeting the needs of all our children, including those with disabilities. The reality is that educating children who need special education does cost more. We can either invest the money to provide children with disabilities a meaningful education now, or we can pay exponentially more throughout their lifetimes. 
Ninety-eight percent of students with disabilities are capable of becoming independent adults. Let’s prepare them to be productive taxpayers rather than setting them up to be incarcerated or to need a lifetime of public assistance.

For Democrats, these slips often expose a cynical deceitfulness —an eagerness to impose taxes, rules, and sprawling legislation while dismissing the public’s ability to notice or care. From Rep. Anne Hughes’ recent quip regarding taxes to the Greenwich Democrats’ brazen falsehoods about “slashing” school funding, the party’s penchant for deceptive rhetoric exposes a disconnect between their private beliefs and public posturing.
On Tax Day 2025, Rep. Anne Hughes (D-Easton) was caught on a hot mic during a Connecticut press conference, high-fiving a colleague and laughing, “We’re not rich. But I always tell the governor to tax my people —they won’t even notice.” 
The comment, made while pushing a capital gains tax hike, wasn’t just tone-deaf—it was a stark admission of exploiting perceived voter apathy and a haughty contempt for overtaxed families. In a state with one of the nation’s highest tax burdens, Hughes’ casual dismissal betrayed a belief that taxpayers are either too numb or too naive to resist. This wasn’t a policy debate; it was a celebration of squeezing constituents, cloaked in the guise of “tax equity.”
Hughes’ gaffe echoes a broader Democratic pattern, where unguarded moments expose a love for expansive legislation and the power it grants. Take Nancy Pelosi’s 2010 comment on the Affordable Care Act: “We have to pass the bill so that you can find out what is in it.” Delivered publicly but with a cavalier air, the remark suggested that the ACA’s 2,700 pages were too complex —or inconvenient— for public scrutiny before passage. It revealed a truth Democrats preferred to obscure: their urgency to enact legislation outstripped their commitment to transparency. The comment fueled distrust, painting Democrats as architects of opaque rules who prioritized political wins over public understanding.
This same cynicism is playing out in a more public manner in Greenwich, where Democrats have twisted the 2025 education budget debate into a masterclass in deception. The Board of Estimate and Taxation (BET) reduced the proposed budget increase by $4 million, leaving a still-generous $8 million year-over-year hike. Yet, Democrats have cried “slashing” and “devastating cuts,” whipping up parents and teachers with apocalyptic rhetoric and orchestrating a letter writing campaign with similar jeremiads. They know the budget remains robust, as Greenwich’s schools continue to enjoy funding levels envied by many districts. Their public histrionics mirror Hughes’ private assumption: voters won’t notice the truth if the narrative is loud enough.
Democrats’ hot mic slips sting more because their sanctimonious rhetoric —casting opponents as uncaring while claiming a moral high ground— sets a high bar that their cynicism betrays. In Greenwich, this hypocrisy fuels their budget distortions, assuming emotional appeals will obscure the fiscal reality of a hefty increase. Off-mic, they might concede the budget’s adequacy, just as Hughes admitted taxpayers wouldn’t feel new taxes.
This pattern —private truths and public deceptions— reveals a Democratic playbook that thrives on control and manipulation, whether through taxes in Hartford or distorted narratives in Greenwich. As hot-mic gaffes expose their cynicism and budget falsehoods unravel, Greenwich’s taxpayers are slowly starting to see through the con. 
Hughes’ laugh may fade, but its echo lingers. Taxpayers in Easton and Greenwich are beginning to notice after all.

(Commonwealth Media Services)One hour after polls closed Tuesday, Pennsylvania Secretary of the Commonwealth Al Schmidt said that “it’s been a relatively calm and successful primary election day,” in the Keystone State. 
“As always, I’d like to thank the hundreds of county election officials and the approximately 45,000 poll workers who made democracy possible today,” Schmidt said. “Because of them, Pennsylvanians were able to cast their vote at more than 9,000 precincts across 67 counties.”
“A quiet day like today is a testament to the hard work and dedication of our county election officials, especially those new ones who are running elections for the first time and have done their part to make sure voters in their counties can cast their ballot and make their voice heard,” he added.
The 2025 primary election featured contested Republican races for the state’s Superior and Commonwealth courts. There was only one Democratic candidate in each race who will move on to the general election.
Despite few statewide races, several of the state’s biggest cities had big-ticket contests Tuesday. Pittsburgh and several other Democratic strongholds held mayoral primaries, while Philadelphia Democrats voted in a closely watched district attorney primary.
Schmidt said that although municipal primaries are lower profile elections, in his experience, they are some of the most complex.
“There are so many different candidates running for so many different offices, down ticket at the local level, that makes them a particular challenge,” Schmidt said. “Nevertheless, we had reports of only a few minor and isolated issues occurring in the Commonwealth.”
Schmidt said that the Department of State received approximately 500 calls on its voter hotline, which is fewer than the municipal primary election in 2023, when the state received about 600 calls.
“It’s not an insignificant number, of course, but it does demonstrate that Pennsylvania voters overwhelmingly encountered an improved voting experience this year,” Schmidt said.
Schmidt said that with a “successful primary election day” behind them, it was now time for election workers across the state to count the votes. Although voter turnout tends to be lower during these primary elections, he urged patience, saying “this work takes time.”
As of 7:30 p.m., Schmidt said counties reported at least 70% of the 800,000 mail-in ballots issued had been returned.
The official vote count will be available in a few days, according to the Department of State, but it added that “anecdotal reports indicate turnout was typical for municipal primary elections.”

(Photo by Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images)Democratic lawmakers in Montana asked the state’s congressional delegation Tuesday to defend “affordable health care access” for Montanans and oppose efforts to “defund” Planned Parenthood and “slash Medicaid” in the reconciliation bill under consideration in Washington, D.C.
The letter, signed by Democratic legislative leaders in the Montana House and Senate plus 45 other legislators, said Planned Parenthood is a “trusted, irreplaceable part” of the state’s health care system, and it has served communities for more than 55 years.
“We write in support of the thousands of Montanans who rely on Planned Parenthood health centers, especially those who live in rural, remote and medically-underserved communities where Planned Parenthood is the only provider who can care for patients, many of which are Medicaid recipients,” said the letter.
The lead signers to the letter were Rep. Katie Sullivan of Missoula and Sen. Pat Flowers of Belgrade, minority leaders in the House and Senate, respectively.
The massive tax and spending bill is in the U.S. House, and Republican Speaker Mike Johnson told reporters Tuesday it still has “a number of loose ends to tie up,” according to States Newsroom’s Washington, D.C. bureau.
The letter from Montana Democrats was directed to U.S. Sens. Steve Daines and Tim Sheehy and U.S. Reps. Ryan Zinke and Troy Downing, all Republicans. Daines, Sheehy and Zinke did not respond Tuesday to requests for comment.
Downing, however, said many Americans don’t want federal money to pay for abortions.
“For too long, the U.S. government has subsidized abortions at Planned Parenthood with complete disregard for the sincerely held beliefs of millions of Americans,” said Congressman Downing in an email from his office. “If the brutality of abortion should exist in this country, may it never receive another penny of federal funding.”
Planned Parenthood Advocates of Montana describes Planned Parenthood as the largest provider of sexual and reproductive health care in Montana, with four health centers in the state and telehealth services for thousands of patients, including Medicaid recipients.
The advocacy group said Planned Parenthood is like any other health care provider, with health centers reimbursed through health programs like Medicaid: “Medicaid funds are not used for abortion other than in rare exceptions due to the Hyde Amendment.”
The federal law known as the Hyde Amendment disallows federal funds for abortion except to save the life of the parent or for pregnancies that are the result of rape or incest.
Mary Sullivan, with Planned Parenthood Advocates, said language in the bill is specifically pointed at Planned Parenthood, but because the Hyde Amendment already restricts funding for abortion, the effect would be a limit on other services.
“Really, where they’re drawing the line is birth control, cancer screenings, STI (sexually transmitted infection) screenings,” Sullivan said.
The bill (Sec. 44126) identifies entities prohibited from receiving funds as nonprofit organizations that receive more than $1 million and are “primarily engaged in family planning services, reproductive health, and related medical care.”
Sullivan, of Planned Parenthood Advocates, said if health care centers were forced to close, many patients would have nowhere to turn, and the health care landscape in Montana is “already overwhelmed.”
In a statement, Quinn Leighton, with Planned Parenthood Advocates of Montana, said the organization would continue to work to ensure care remains available and affordable for Montanans.
“Every Montanan, no matter where they live or how much money they have, deserves access to essential, affordable health care,” Leighton said. 
A  2025 public opinion report about abortion and reproductive health policy said respondents generally opposed “a number of actions” the Trump administration could take, including taking away funds from Planned Parenthood.
“Opposition crosses party lines — with about four in 10 Trump voters or more in opposition (including 63% who oppose taking away funds from Planned Parenthood),” said the report from PerryUndem, which describes itself as a nonpartisan public opinion research firm.
In the letter from Democrats, the legislators said the consequences of “defunding” Planned Parenthood “could be catastrophic.” 
“No other provider would be able to fill the gap left by Planned Parenthood, and making cuts to Medicaid would put rural hospitals and medical centers in jeopardy,” the letter said.
A separate letter Monday organized by the State Innovation Exchange’s Reproductive Freedom Leadership Council described the prohibition in the federal bill as the latest in “politically motivated attacks” against Planned Parenthood and abortion providers.

A narrow House majority didn’t stumble
During the session, legislators contended with falling oil revenue. Legislators didn’t pass any tax increases, instead adopting significant budget cuts. The Alaska House navigated partisan divisions that left its majority coalition — 14 Democrats, 5 independents and 2 Republicans — with only a one-vote margin over a 19-person House Republican minority.
That coalition majority, and a similar one in the Senate, had to negotiate with a governor who has significantly different policy views from the coalitions.
Speaker of the House Bryce Edgmon, I-Dillingham, said the early adjournment is something to be proud of.
“I’m pretty pleased that we achieved it,” he said.
It was the first time since 2018 that the Legislature did not reach the constitutional limit of 121 days to complete the session, though the 2020 session was interrupted by a seven-week break due to the COVID-19 pandemic. 
“In a year where the House was sharply divided in terms of numbers, oil prices sank, we did our best to work with the governor, who, at many times, was not seemingly here in the building, and we put it all together,” Edgmon said.
House Minority Leader Mia Costello, R-Anchorage, said her caucus wasn’t satisfied with the result.
“I think we’re disappointed that we didn’t address more issues related to energy and the challenges we have and the opportunities that we have with resource development and energy and dovetailing with the president and our congressional delegation,” she said. “So we wanted more legislation in that area. But as far as adjourning, it is what it is, and we’re just going to gear up for next year.”

Spending plan has limited increases
One of the Legislature’s final acts before adjournment was to pass the state’s operating budget for the fiscal year that starts July 1.
“You could say that both the operating and the capital budget, the two main budgets, were maintenance-level budgets,” Edgmon said.
The capital and operating budgets, including money for next fiscal year and changes to the current fiscal year, spend $6.2 billion, when looking only at general-purpose state spending. If federal funding and things like fees, college tuition and other money is included, the budget bills spend $16.3 billion. 
General-purpose state spending is down significantly. The enacted budget bills from last spring totaled more than $6.5 billion.
Legislators started the budget-drafting process with the expectation that North Slope oil prices would average $68 per barrel in the next fiscal year. 
By the end, that expectation had dropped to $64, and the federal government — which pays for about 40% of the combined budget bills — had begun cutting its contributions.
As revenue projections declined, legislators slashed programs from the budget, including things like new state troopers for the Matanuska-Susitna Borough. 
A relative handful of budget increases made it through the process — money for mental health treatment in Anchorage, early childhood education programs, and child advocacy centers, which help the survivors of child sexual abuse.
Those increases — and all other parts of the budget — are subject to approval by the governor, who has the power to veto individual line items. Every year of his term, Dunleavy has vetoed significant amounts from the budget.
In the House, legislators failed to pass one part of the budget — a roughly $200 million draw from the state’s principal savings account, the Constitutional Budget Reserve, in order to pay for a deficit in the current fiscal year, which ends June 30.
Conditional language in the budget says that if the CBR vote fails, the state will instead take up to $100 million from the accounts of the state’s investment bank — the Alaska Industrial Development and Export Authority — and the state’s higher education investment fund.
The vote failed after members of the House Republican minority opposed it. Thirty votes are required to spend from the reserve.

“I wasn’t comfortable going into savings,” said Costello. “I felt like we could have done more work on the budget and involved our House Finance Committee team, which has a lot of experience, so I just wasn’t willing to give my CBR vote to go into savings.”
Costello said she feels that other members of the minority felt similarly. 
Next year, legislators expect that they will need to spend heavily from the CBR in order to balance the budget.
In addition, legislators are expected to pass major policy bills, including a revival of the state’s pension program for public employees, and election reform bills. 
“Hold on to your hat, Nellie, for next session, because it could be much more challenging, as we all know,” Edgmon said.

Bob Ferguson entered office warning that a multibillion-dollar budget shortfall would require spending cuts and, as a last resort, higher taxes.
On Tuesday, the first-term Democrat appeared satisfied with lawmakers’ work to close the financial gap, signing a two-year state budget and a tax package to produce billions of dollars in new revenue to keep it in balance.
“To get a budget in a challenging situation to the finish line, it’s going to require working together and a lot of compromise,” Ferguson said. “I believe we accomplished that with this budget.”
Ferguson’s approval ended weeks of speculation about whether he would reject tax increases in favor of deeper cuts. It also capped off months of wrangling between the governor and Democratic lawmakers over how far to go in raising taxes. Republicans slammed Ferguson for agreeing to the hikes after he’d voiced support for greater fiscal restraint.
This all came in the face of an estimated $16 billion shortfall over the next two budget cycles and uncertainty about federal funding.
Also Tuesday, the governor approved a 6-cent increase in Washington’s gas tax to ensure planned transportation projects move forward.
In the end, he only used his veto power to remove one significant piece of a tax bill, related to community banks, and to nix about $25 million from the operating budget.
Sen. June Robinson, D-Everett, the lead budget writer in the Senate, said she was “very pleased” with the limited use of the veto pen.
“I think he’s sincere and understands the difficult decisions that were made,” she said. “The fact that he didn’t make significant changes shows he respects our views.”

The two-year operating budget signed Tuesday calls for $77.8 billion in spending across government, including public schools and colleges, health care, social services, housing, corrections, and environmental protection. It also funds new two-year collective bargaining agreements with most, but not all, public employee unions.
It relies on about $4 billion from new and higher taxes and transfers from other accounts into the general fund, the central pot of money used to pay for most state spending. The state will end the fiscal cycle with $225 million in cash reserves and $2 billion in its emergency, or rainy day, fund. 
The suite of revenue bills inked by Ferguson includes a permanent across-the-board boost in business taxes, a temporary surcharge on high-grossing firms, and higher tax rates on large financial institutions and computing giants. Sales tax would be applied to more services, some tax breaks disappear, and an existing tax on tobacco products gets broadened to include nicotine pouches, like Zyn.
A wide swath of private sector firms and health care providers urged Ferguson to reject some of the measures, insisting higher costs would be passed on to customers and patients. For the most part, he did not heed their requests.
However, he restored a tax break for community banks that allows for a tax deduction for interest they receive on loans for residential property. That exemption helps people afford housing, he said. It will trim the tax package by $215 million over four years, a state budget official said.
Republicans panned the governor’s approval of the taxes as an about-face.
“On his first day in office, Governor Ferguson spoke of fiscal responsibility, yet today he’s supporting the largest tax increase in state history,” Senate Minority Leader John Braun, R-Centralia, said in a statement. “That’s disappointing. The majority Democrats who don’t believe government can ever have enough money were unhappy with him back then; they must be elated now.”
Ferguson said he planned to further scrutinize the tax increases on businesses in the interim. 
“There are some revenues there that I think require a closer look to make sure there are not unintended consequences,” he told reporters Tuesday. “So I would not be surprised if you see some changes beyond technical changes to those revenue streams.”


The Big 5
Five tax bills signed Tuesday are counted on to bring in roughly $3.6 billion for the next budget and $9.4 billion over four years. Here’s where those dollars would come from.
House Bill 2081, the largest money maker, is projected to generate $2.1 billion in the next budget. It has an across-the-board boost in business taxes, a temporary surcharge on high-grossing firms and higher tax rates on large financial institutions and computing giants.
Senate Bill 5814 is relied on to raise $1 billion for the next biennium, mostly by applying the retail sales tax to more services, such as digital advertising and temporary staffing. There is also a provision to begin taxing certain products with nicotine, like Zyn pouches.
Senate Bill 5813 will bring in $321 million by adding a layer to the capital gains tax. In addition to the existing 7% tax on gains over $270,000 from the sale or exchange of long-term assets, another 2.9% will be levied on gains above $1 million. 
Senate Bill 5794 aims to bring in $148.5 million by getting rid of a variety of tax breaks enjoyed by around 4,000 taxpayers, including operators of self-service storage facilities and sellers of precious metal bullion.
House Bill 2077 is expected to generate $54.5 million with a new tax on the sale of electric vehicle credits between automakers. This has been dubbed the “Tesla tax” because the firm is the only automaker with credits to sell in Washington.


Critics of where majority Democrats landed point out that state spending with the operating budget has increased from roughly $38 billion to upward of $70 billion over the past decade. Spending in the current two-year budget cycle that ends June 30 is around $72 billion.
Transportation budget also rides on tax hikes
Ferguson also approved separate spending plans for transportation and capital construction for the 2025-27 biennium that begins July 1.
The $15.5 billion transportation spending plan funds Washington State Ferries, highway megaprojects and maintenance of state roads and bridges. Washington State Patrol and public transportation are also paid for through this budget. And there’s over a billion dollars for the court-ordered removal of barriers to fish in waterways that cross under state roads.
Similar to the operating budget, transportation faced a major shortfall due to diminishing gas tax receipts and ballooning costs for the state’s already-expensive road projects.
To fill the gap, Ferguson signed a separate six-year, $3.2 billion transportation revenue package intended to pay for promised infrastructure. While the state’s first gas tax hike since 2016 anchors it, there are a number of other new and higher fees and taxes, including on rental cars, non-commercial aircraft, luxury vehicles and car sales, among others.
Washington’s gas tax — already among the highest in the nation — will rise from 49.4 cents to 55.4 cents per gallon in July, then by 2% each year.
“The people of the state of Washington expect us to invest in those projects, but we have limited revenue options right now,” Ferguson said. “The gas tax, unfortunately, is one of them.”
The capital budget authorizes $7.6 billion in new spending. It will drive $760 million into affordable housing, most of it through the Housing Trust Fund. There’s nearly a billion dollars for K-12 school construction, plus funds for salmon recovery and behavioral health facilities.
How we got here
In the final weeks of the session, Ferguson objected to budgets passed in the House and Senate, saying they each relied too much on taxes. At that time, he called on lawmakers to “immediately move budget discussions in a different direction.”
Before that, he refused a proposed “wealth tax” on investments held by the richest Washingtonians. He felt the new tax was sure to face legal challenges that could threaten the stability of the state’s budget and that it would be difficult to implement.
In response, Democratic lawmakers dropped the idea for this year. The new governor also opposed a proposal to repeal a voter-approved limit on property tax growth in Washington, so legislators abandoned that, as well. 
By the time Democrats’ slate of revenue proposals reached the governor’s desk, lawmakers had dropped it from a total of $21 billion over four years to $9.4 billion, excluding the separate transportation taxes and fees.
Lawmakers are scheduled to next return to Olympia in January, when they will hash out a supplemental funding plan for the final year of the cycle.
But Ferguson didn’t rule out a special session before then to deal with potential havoc wreaked by the Trump administration or cuts under consideration by the Republican-controlled Congress. He said federal funds make up about one-fifth of Washington’s budget.

(Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)Nearly 300 striking workers from Butler Hospital took to the Rhode Island State House around 2 p.m. Tuesday. The purple-clad filled the rotunda and surrounding hallways. They filled the line to get through the metal detector at the front door, and when the House and Senate floor sessions started around 4 p.m., they filled the viewing galleries in both chambers.

The throng was there to call attention to the ongoing walkout by about 800 employees of the hospital, demanding better pay and working conditions.
Before sitting quietly in the legislative chambers during the session, the workers participated in a series of chants, the collective roaring peaking at around 119 decibels when measured from the third floor balcony by Rhode Island Current. A chainsaw, by comparison, measures about 125 decibels.
Jesse Martin, the Executive Vice President of SEIU 1199 New England, told Rhode Island Current after the rally had finished around 5 p.m. that he was confident the legislature was listening to the striking workforce of the Providence psychiatric hospital. 
“I think they had no other choice but to listen today,” Martin said. “And I know that the champions for working people in this state house heard that hospital workers need to be included in how policy is set for funding our hospitals.”
On the House floor, Rep. David Bennett, a Warwick Democrat, was listening, and prompted his colleagues to do the same.
“If you notice, there’s an ocean of purple above the speaker, and behind me,” said Bennett, a retired registered nurse who previously worked at Butler. He motioned to the viewing galleries stationed on opposite ends of the House chamber. “They’re fighting for fair wages, a fair contract, and I’m with you.”

Bennett was not the only lawmaker to support the strike in their State House rally. Rep. Teresa Tanzi, a South Kingstown Democrat, was coordinating a different but adjacent casino workers’ rally the same afternoon, and she greeted the purple-clad SEIU members awaiting the security checkpoint with a smile. A big megaphone slung over her shoulder, Tanzi offered a friendly reminder to the union members to empty their pockets before reaching the metal detector.
The line to get in the State House stretched out the front door, but by the time the SEIU members had packed in, the spectacle and noise was unmissable. Over more than an hour, Senators, state employees, lobbyists, and other curious onlookers would crane their head over the marble balustrade on the third floor, their eyes meeting a rotunda filled with purple, yellow, and signs of white and red with the tagline: “ON STRIKE. DUE TO UNFAIR LABOR PRACTICES.” 
About 800 unionized workers at Butler Hospital — who comprise mental health staff, nurses, clerical workers, and custodial and dietary employees — have been on strike since May 15, after contract negotiations with Care New England, the 168-bed hospital’s parent company, fizzled. 
During contract negotiations, the workers pushed for higher wages, pension access for future hires, and more robust safety protocols after several years of increased workplace violence. All four of the union’s contracts with Care New England expired on March 31. The union voted to authorize a strike on April 25, and the last bargaining session was held May 7. 
Days into the strike, hospital management notified workers that their health, dental, and vision coverage would conclude on May 31. Employees can elect to continue coverage through COBRA, but those costs will come out of their pockets. The last paycheck for employees will be May 23.
A mix of 44 senators and reps added their names to a May 8 letter to Butler President and CEO Mary E. Marran which urged the hospital to resume talks with the union. Missing from that list of allies was House Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi — who, immediately ahead of Tuesday’s floor session, offered his own statement on the strike.
“Having access to the critical high-quality mental health services provided at Butler Hospital is vital to so many struggling Rhode Islanders, as well as those who love them,” Shekarchi wrote. “I am calling on both the management of Butler Hospital and health care workers represented by SEIU 1199 New England to get back to the bargaining table to negotiate in good faith and come up with a fair deal. Patients, family, friends and neighbors in every Rhode Island community are being impacted by the ongoing strike at Butler Hospital. My hope is that management and the union at Butler Hospital reach a fair deal in the very near future.”
Reps. David Morales and Rebecca Kislak, both Providence Democrats, picketed alongside the workers for multiple days during the strike. Providence City Council President Rachel Miller joined the picket on Monday.
Finger pointing over stalled talks
Care New England has maintained that it has been transparent about negotiations. The hospital set up a dedicated website with information on the contract process around Jan. 30, according to domain registration information. When bargaining stalled months later, Marran’s messages posted to the site argued that media coverage and the union narrative had skewed the reality.
Martin disputed that, saying that Butler walked away from the negotiating table.
“What comes next is, we’re going to stay on strike one day longer than Butler Hospital is willing to stand,” Martin said. “When they want to negotiate, they know our phone number.”

A Care New England spokesperson did not provide a fresh statement Tuesday, but pointed to a Monday comment from Marran: “Despite SEIU 1199 NE taking its members off the job, Butler Hospital remains open for business. While we would prefer to have our own employees working with patients, we have highly qualified replacement workers here who will continue to be here, fulfilling Butler’s essential role in the community by providing vital behavioral health services.”
“Our team will be here when the union decides it is ready to come back to the table and work toward a solution,” Marran continued. 
The Butler strike emerges during a volatile stretch for Rhode Island’s hospital finances, as shown by hospital leaders ramping up advocacy this legislative session amid shifting federal rules and chronically underfunded Medicaid reimbursement rates. Another example of ailing hospital finances can be found in a recent study by Brown University researchers, which found that the state’s 2010 hospital price-growth cap cut average commercial prices by 9% — a win for some consumers, but one that has cost hospitals about $158.3 million since the regulation took effect, researchers estimated.
Jillian Scott, a Hospital Association of Rhode Island spokesperson, said via email that the coalition does not provide official commentary on labor negotiations, but she did relay a statement from Interim President Howard Dulude on what can be done policywise. 
“Right now, Rhode Island’s health care system is in crisis, and hospitals face ongoing financial pressures in delivering high-quality care and supporting their workforce,” Dulude wrote. “Continued collaboration with the legislature on the 2026 State Budget is critical to ensure hospitals have the resources needed to invest in staff and meet the health care needs of Rhode Islanders.”
Martin agreed that hospitals aren’t getting enough money, but he wasn’t sure the money should be going toward “CEO pay and CEO golden parachutes.”
“It’s really hard to take someone seriously when they make multiple millions of dollars in salary, but most of their workers live in poverty on state assistance,” Martin said. “That seems to be hypocritical.” 
Martin said he believes the General Assembly is largely sympathetic to union needs, but urged lawmakers to “first put themselves in the shoes of a health care worker,” and allocate Medicaid dollars to hospitals with guardrails in place. Martin cited a 2022 infusion of $75 million to nursing homes and hospitals from the General Assembly, but argued that money didn’t reach unionized workers like those at Butler.
“A hospital repaid themselves for the overtime that workers had already worked,” Martin said. “They used that money to buy them pizza. I’m sorry, but pizza doesn’t lift people out of poverty. Might fill your belly for a meal, but it doesn’t fill your belly for a lifetime.”

Columbia City Council deferred a contentious vote Tuesday on whether to roll back the 2021 ordinance that threatens a $500 fine for counseling that attempts to change the sexual orientations or gender identities of children. It is the only South Carolina city with such a law.
Columbia has been under pressure from state Attorney General Alan Wilson to repeal the local law.
And at the Legislature, Sen. Josh Kimbrell, R-Boiling Springs, has pushed a one-year measure in the budget to cut $3.7 million in state funding to the city if it does not reverse course. State budget writers have yet to make a final decision on the proposed budget rule.

Under the 2021 ordinance, any licensed therapist found in violation could be fined. Leaders of organizations advocating to keep the ban in place were not aware of any instances of the city issuing a penalty as most so-called conversion therapy is performed by private religious groups rather than the licensed therapists and counselors the law governs.
In the meantime, city leaders voted to move money around in its own budget, holding back revenue generated from hospitality taxes in an effort to cover any gaps should the state budget amendment be upheld.
“There’s a significant amount of (state) money,” said Mayor Daniel Rickenmann. “So, we need to know where that lands.”
LGBTQ+ groups and advocates considered the wait a win.
“I think that it speaks volumes that they voted to hold over,” said Matthew Butler, LGBTQ Advocacy Strategist for the American Civil Liberties Union of South Carolina. “I think that might indicate more than just a little bit of discomfort with what all is going on. So, I do commend the city for acting by not acting, and we will work to make sure that they stand by this provide by this ordinance.”

During the council meeting, some 20 people testified for more than hour before a crowd that spilled over to a second room. Many shared their own experiences with conversion therapy, as well as instances of physical and mental abuse, rape and suicide attempts.
“(People) are having to relive some of the worst memories of their lives to come up here and support something that we shouldn’t even be discussing. It’s barbarous, it’s treacherous and it’s disastrous for our youth,” said Enid Campbell, of Columbia.
Butler of the ACLU called a letter, sent by the attorney general on April 23 claiming the ordinance violates state law and constitutional rights, political “posturing.”
“It’s a dangerous thing when the top law enforcement officer of the state uses the power of his office, not to protect the public, but to bully cities into submission for political sport,” Butler said.
“This ordinance is not unlawful. It is simply inconvenient to men who confuse bluster with leadership,” Butler continued. “But threats only work if you surrender to them.”
Meanwhile, the U.S. Supreme Court has taken up a Colorado case that could decide at the national level whether state and local governments can enforce laws banning conversion therapy for LGBTQ+ children.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/DSC_0660-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-20 22:04:23.887104

After HB265 passed this year, schools started scrambling to make the most efficient plan to reallocate their resources, with many exploring program consolidations, cutting courses and layoffs.
The process seems abrupt, Sen. Kathleen Riebe, D-Cottonwood Heights, told the Executive Appropriations Committee on Tuesday, especially since many faculty members have inundated her inbox, worried about the potential elimination of curriculums and jobs.

“There’s a lot of frantic behavior and in government we never want to be frantic,” Riebe said. “We want to be methodical. We want to be research driven and data driven. And I understand where this bill is going, but it’s been a very hard, abrupt turn, and there’s a lot of pain points in our universities.”
That, she added, may scar the reputation of Utah universities, frightening off staff and prospective professors wanting to apply for jobs in the state. 
HB265 passed comfortably in Utah’s Republican supermajority Legislature while being opposed by most of the Democratic Caucus. The bill’s goal, its supporters said, is to cut “underperforming programs” and direct those funds to highly-sought degrees.
With tight deadline, Utah universities scramble to cut 10% of budget for courses

That’s a premise that House Speaker Mike Schultz, R-Hooper, defended during the Tuesday discussion, arguing that some of the cuts were overdue, and may even keep tuition costs low. 
“Liberal arts, for some reason, keeps being the topic of discussion,” Schultz said. “Yes, maybe every one of those programs might not be available at four or five universities across the state. You may not be able to take a program at the University of Utah, you might have to go to Weber State to take the program, or vice versa, but I think that’s a wise use of the way that our dollars are spent.” 
The cost of attending college “is a huge concern,” putting higher education increasingly out of reach for many, Minority Whip Jennifer Dailey-Provost, D-Salt Lake City, said. As many Republican lawmakers emphasized the intent of making college more efficient, affordable and accessible, she asked whether tuition will decrease as a result of HB265. 
No more ethnic, women and gender studies at WSU as state-mandated budget cuts start

Those numbers were not available during the committee discussion. But Schultz, who recently spoke with Weber State University leaders about their reallocation plans, highlighted that the school’s overall tuition increase this year was 2% for bachelor’s degrees and it kept the same costs for its associate degree programs.
“They were very proud that they found ways to take the savings and find savings and not increase for their associate’s degrees,” Schultz said. “So if the universities are not doing that, then I think that they are being a little bit derelict in their duties.”
While he understands faculty and staff members’ concerns, Schultz said he hopes that schools find the right balance in their process, and that the Legislature continues these types of initiatives more often.
“We do it on a regular basis with our state agencies,” he said. “And with as much money as the state spends on higher education, and with the cost of higher education growing more and more out of control, I really think that this ought to become a little bit more of the norm.”

The federal government last week released the latest population counts for the nation’s more than 3,000 counties, as well as all incorporated cities and towns. 
In Montana, 32 of the state’s 56 counties saw a population increase, concentrated in the state’s western counties, while the mostly eastern counties that saw population declines did so by just over a thousand cumulative residents. 
As a whole, Montana added 5,931 new residents between July 1, 2023 and July 1, 2024, for a total state population of 1,137,233. The state’s growth rate of .52% was slower than the national growth rate of 1%, partly due to a last-in-the-nation level of international migration, and far lower than in recent years. Between 2020 and 2021, Montana added a whopping 19,000 new residents.
The United States has added 3,304,757 people between 2023 and 2024.
In the last release of census data, Gallatin and Flathead counties added 1,055 and 1,032 new residents, respectively, the first time since the population boom began in 2020 Flathead County hasn’t led in raw numbers. But the northwest county had a higher rate of change at .91% compared to Gallatin’s .84%. 
Broadwater County had the highest percentage population increase in the last year, 2.96%, and over the last four years, with 22.2%, but the county’s 8,302 residents makes it just the 27th most inhabited in Montana. 
Since 2020, however, Flathead County has led the state in sheer number of additional residents, adding more than 10,100 to Gallatin’s just over 8,000 and Yellowstone County’s 6,800.
Meanwhile, Kalispell, the county seat of the Flathead, added 1,125 new residents between 2023 and 2024 for a population of 31,296, a nearly 4% increase stemming from the city’s annexation of new developments and migration into the area. 
Bozeman added the second most residents, 788, followed by Billings (686), Missoula (557) and Helena (360). Of the state’s most populous cities, Great Falls, Havre and Sidney all lost residents. 
Kalispell’s growth is even more drastic over the last four years. Between 2020 and 2024, the city added 6,218 new residents, a 24.8% increase that ranked the city 39th in the nation for growth among cities with more than 20,000 residents. 
Helena, which grew by 8.2%, and Bozeman, which grew by 8.1%, ranked in the 260s.  
Kalispell City Manager Doug Russell said seeing the actual numbers isn’t a big surprise for the people who have been working to accommodate the rising population. 
“We’ve experienced that large growth in person over the years,” Russel said. 
Russell said that planning for increased growth is key to keeping city services and infrastructure at a level to handle the demands of a rapidly growing population.
“Our public works department has done a really great job updating facilities plans on a routine basis and updating growth models to to anticipate where we’ll need to prioritize infrastructure projects,” Russel said.
Among the major infrastructure projects Kalispell has prioritized in recent years are construction of a new water tower to bolster the municipal water storage and working with the state transportation department to address potential bottlenecks along major transit corridors, such as W. Reserve Drive, along the city’s north end. 
Russell said the city is currently updating its land use policy, which will allow city officials to prepare for the next round of anticipated growth. 
If Kalispell’s growth trend continues, it could soon overtake Helena and Butte-Silver Bow in size. 
Just north of Kalispell, Whitefish has also grown by nearly 20% since 2020, adding 1,481 residents, while nearby Polson and Columbia Falls have grown 9.6% and 7.4%. 
Belgrade, a suburb of Bozeman, one of the state’s least affordable cities, is the only other large city in Montana to exceed 20% growth, adding 2,265 residents since 2020. 
On the other end of the spectrum, Montana’s smallest incorporated town, Ismay, has stayed exactly the same, with 21 residents since 2020, according to Census data. 
A call placed to the only publicly listed phone number in Ismay, the Ismay Community Church, did not get a response on Tuesday to verify the town’s 21 residents.
Two other incorporated towns in Montana showed flat growth rates since 2020, both on the Hi-Line in Phillips County — Dodson, which increased from 126 residents to 127 in 2023, but then returned to 126 in 2024, and Malta, which has fluctuated around 1,853 residents for several years. 
Nationally, of the 10 fastest growing cities in the country, six are in Texas, and one each is in Florida, Utah, South Carolina and North Carolina.
Forney, Texas, added 15,079 residents between 2020 and 2024, a 62.2% increase.  
The nation’s fastest shrinking city was Big Spring, Texas, which lost 14% of its population. 
 A county shift 

The U.S. Census Bureau data breaks out changes to county population by natural change — the difference due to birth rates and death rates — and net migration into and out of a county. 
While Flathead and Gallatin counties each grew by roughly the same 1,000 residents between 2023 and 2024, they did so in vastly different ways. 
A quarter of Gallatin County’s increase was due to a younger population. The county’s birth rate was 1,141 people while only 686 individuals died during the year of record. 
Meanwhile Flathead, Missoula, and Yellowstone counties had almost equal numbers of births and deaths in their communities, trends that extend back to 2020. 
Flathead County’s primary source of growth is new residents moving to the county. Ninety-nine percent of new residents between 2020 and 2024 relocated to the area, while just three-quarters of new Gallatin County residents did. 
Both on the eastern side of the state, Montana’s two least populous counties, Treasure and Petroleum, with 739 and 535 residents respectively, saw the largest population percentage decline in residents. 
Petroleum lost 18 residents in 2024, six from a higher death rate than birth rate, and 12 who moved out of the county. Treasure County dropped by 28 residents, gaining two from natural change, but losing 30 to relocation. 
The state’s largest county, Yellowstone, with 171,583 residents, is more populous than the state’s 36 least inhabited combined.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/20241231_093900-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-05-20 20:59:16.702944

Josh Shapiro has proposed another $25 million for Solar for Schools grants in the upcoming state budget.,"A solar array.  (Robert Zullo/ States Newsroom)Pennsylvania has awarded grants totaling $22.5 million to 73 schools across the state to help pay for solar energy installations, the Commonwealth Financing Authority announced Tuesday.
The awards under the Department of Community and Economic Development’s Solar for Schools program will provide up to $500,000 to each school. The solar arrays they help pay for could save school districts millions of dollars in energy costs, state Rep. Elizabeth Fieldler (D-Philadelphia) said.
“I am so happy for each of these schools and excited to see names from nearly every corner of the state,” Fiedler, who introduced legislation to create the program last year, said. “I’ve heard from rural schools who plan to include their solar panels in agricultural education and from city schools that are thinking strategically about rooftop solar with limited space. I have no doubt that the recipients will benefit from the program’s flexibility to meet their school’s needs and to make the most of their strengths.”
The grant awards come as the legislature is preparing for the final month before the state budget is due June 30. The current budget included up to $25 million for the Solar for Schools program and Gov. Josh Shapiro has proposed to match that amount in the upcoming budget.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Fiedler’s bill, which passed both chambers of the General Assembly with broad bipartisan support last summer, was created as a way to address the school funding crisis, rising utility costs and climate change together, her office said.
“As energy costs rise, diversifying our energy sources is more important than ever. Increased energy usage throughout the country also puts us at a higher risk because of the inadequate power grid,” state Sen. Camera Bartolotta (R-Greene) said. “Schools that use solar panels will counteract that problem by improving Pennsylvania’s energy security and lowering costs – saving millions of dollars of taxpayer money.”
It also received strong support from building trade unions, whose members will benefit from the construction jobs the grants help to create.  
“These new projects through Solar for Schools will open up doors for workers across the state,” said Robert S. Bair, president of the Pennsylvania Building Trades Council. “Energy jobs are crucial in Pennsylvania. Labor needs to be on the forefront of growing industries like solar.”
Union support was, in part, the result of a yearslong effort to strengthen relationships between environmental and labor advocates, who recognize the adoption of renewable energy sources requires skilled workers just as fossil fuel plants do. 
In the initial round of applications for Solar for School, districts from rural, suburban and urban areas requested $88 million, more than three times the amount available in the current budget. The grants awarded totaled less than the full $25 million because the money is divided between three regions and the DCED did not find enough qualifying applications in one of them, Fiedler said. 
While interest in renewable energy is growing and political support for such programs is broadening, solar energy still faces hurdles in state government. With the overwhelming response to the initial appropriation, Fiedler said she is hopeful that at least another $25 million Solar for Schools will be approved as part of the next budget.

Alaska’s 20 centers were in limbo, facing a $5.5 million shortfall after federal grants were ended or cut, as well as uncertainty over whether operations and services would continue past June. 
On Friday afternoon, the budget conference committee – tasked with hammering out the final budget between the House and Senate versions – approved the funds to fill the gap and provide $5.5 million in state funding.
Rep. Andy Jospephson, D-Anchorage and chair of the committee, said it was made clear that funding for the centers was a priority. “They’re critically important, and they rose to the very, very top of my list,” he said. “In other words, there was no ask, given their financial predicament and importance, that I thought was more significant.”
Mari Mukai, executive director of the nonprofit Alaska Children’s Alliance, said she was grateful for the funding. The alliance provides support, training and technical assistance to Alaska’s 20 child advocacy centers around the state. “I know what a difficult fiscal situation we’re in right now and understand that many difficult decisions needed to be made,” she said in a phone interview on Monday.
Child advocacy centers provide services for children and their caregivers after suspected physical or sexual abuse, including trauma-informed interviewing, forensic services, streamlined investigations, and victim advocacy through the life of the case. They served 2,061 families statewide last year, Mukai said. 
The centers are funded at $10.9 million through a mix of federal and local grants, as well as other funding they raise. Mukai said the state’s backstop funding will make up about half of their budget, and enable the centers to continue current operations and services. 
“Unfortunately, Alaska is consistently on the top of the nation for rates of child abuse and violence, and domestic violence, and so unfortunately, yes, I do think that there’s still a lot of need, but this would be a great first step,” she said. 
The Alaska Legislature voted to approve the final operating budget on Tuesday, and Gov. Mike Dunleavy will issue budget vetoes of individual line items before July 1. 
Mukai added that another federal grant the centers rely on is in danger – the Victims of Crime Act, provided by the U.S. Department of Justice through penalties related to crimes. Alaska advocates are urging the congressional delegation to push the U.S. Congress to protect this funding, as the Trump administration has moved to cancel hundreds of grants and millions of dollars supporting victims services through the Department of Justice.

SPRINGFIELD — A bill that bans carbon sequestration over, under or through portions of the Mahomet Aquifer passed out of the Illinois General Assembly on Tuesday.

The bill has been a point of contention in the Statehouse during this year’s legislative session, after it was found that a leak occurred during carbon injections carried out by ADM, a Decatur-based agriculture giant.

Carbon sequestration is a relatively new technological process that pumps liquified carbon dioxide deep underground for long-term storage. Proponents say it could help reduce greenhouse gas emissions for high-emissions industries like ethanol production.

The ADM injection site, which opened in 2011, received the first federal permit for “geologic sequestration of carbon dioxide” in 2017. Since then, the project has stored more than 4.5 million tons of carbon dioxide more than a mile underground.

Although the leak did not take place in the Mahomet Aquifer area, roughly 8,000 metric tons of liquid carbon dioxide and other ground fluid escaped the area it was permitted to be in. ADM temporarily paused carbon injections in October after another issue with a well was identified.

The Mahomet Aquifer supplies water to hundreds of thousands of people in central Illinois.  Estimates for the number of Illinois residents served daily by the aquifer range from 500,000 to 1 million people.

In 2015, portions of the aquifer in 14 Illinois counties were designated as a sole source aquifer by the EPA, since contamination of the aquifer could cause significant public health risk. That EPA designation also indicates that there are no “reasonably available alternative drinking water sources” that could be used if the water in the aquifer were contaminated.

Senate Bill 1723 passed on Tuesday with bipartisan support. The bill was spearheaded by Sen. Paul Faraci, D-Champaign, and Sen. Chapin Rose, R-Mahomet. It comes after Illinois lawmakers passed a law last year allowing carbon sequestration anywhere in Illinois.

“Proposals under consideration by the U.S. EPA today would store 50 times the amount of carbon that has been stored at the ADM facility under the Mahomet Aquifer,” Andrew Rehn, the climate policy director of Prairie Rivers Network, said during a Senate committee hearing on the bill in March. “Last year's bill leaves a critical gap. It says you have to replace drinking water if you damage it through your carbon sequestration activity, and the sole source designation means that there is no alternative.”

Charles Harvey, a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, spoke on the dangers of carbon sequestration in the wake of the recent ADM leak during the committee hearing. He called the ADM injection facility an “experiment,” as the injection of carbon at such a depth had never been done before.

He said the pressure and depth of the injections led to fissures in both the injection pipes and the levels of rock the carbon was being pumped into and stored under. Since carbon dioxide is a gas, he said it began to seep through the cracks and the fissures and rise back to the surface, which began the leak.

“To do this, it had to move at an alarming velocity of at least three meters a day to have reached it in the four months that after injections for when the seismic inference was made,” Harvey said. “Now, the original report predicted that with 90% confidence this would not happen.”

Due to the aquifer’s sole source designation, bill proponents also argued that central Illinois residents can’t afford the water to be at risk.

“Eighty-five percent of the geographic land mass in the state of Illinois can be used for carbon sequestration. The aquifer is a very small piece of that, it's just kind of the width of Central Illinois,” Rose said. “You can sequester north or south of this without putting anybody's water in jeopardy.”

Opponents of the bill argued that since the Mahomet Aquifer sits at roughly 200 feet under the surface, it isn’t at risk to leaks, as carbon injections pump the gas thousands of feet underground.

“The geology under and around the Mahomet Aquifer is the best geology to ensure that thousands of feet below the aquifer — we’re not talking immediately under the aquifer, we’re talking thousands of feet, up to a mile below — is the best geology to ensure that the carbon capturing is taking place,” Donovan Griffith, the vice president of the Illinois Manufacturers’ Association, said during the committee. “It's the best in the state.”

The bill passed out of the Senate in April 55-0. It now awaits approval from the governor after passing out of the House on Tuesday with a vote of 91-19.

IMA released a statement on X following the passage of SB1723 urging Gov. JB Pritzker to veto the bill.

“Carbon capture and sequestration is a safe and proven technology that is key to maintaining economic growth and advancing our state’s decarbonization goals. We urge Gov. JB Pritzker to veto this legislation, which discourages investment in clean energy projects including sustainable aviation fuel,” said Mark Denzler, President and CEO of the Illinois Manufacturers’ Association.

(Photo by Christopher Shea/Rhode Island Current)“NO MORE SMOKE! NO MORE SMOKE!” 
That was the chant from about 150 casino workers who packed the steps inside the State House Tuesday — their backs to the House chamber, but their voices aimed directly across the rotunda to the Senate floor.
It’s the fourth such year they’ve backed the bill by Rep. Teresa Tanzi, a South Kingstown Democrat, seeking to end the Lincoln and Tiverton casinos’ exemption from the state’s 2005 indoor smoking ban.
“For the last 20 years, there has been a grave injustice happening in our casinos,” Tanzi told the crowd. “These are our workers who are there day in, day out — they’re doing a service for our state.”
Tanzi’s proposal has yet to reach the House floor. But unlike previous years, casino workers now have some additional institutional backing. For the first time, House Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi is a co-sponsor on Tanzi’s legislation.
Casino workers from 11 separate unions had help making noise from yellow and purple-clad striking Butler Hospital workers who gathered at the State House Tuesday to call on House Democrats meeting for a budget caucus. The Butler workers, who are members of SEIU 1199NE, want lawmakers to prioritize any state funding intended for hospitals for wages and staffing for frontline staff. 
“Workers deserve a smoke-free workplace,” Jesse Martin, the executive vice president of SEIU 1199NE, told the crowd. “People deserve the ability to do their work free from injury, free from these types of concerns.”
Across the rotunda, companion legislation sponsored by Sen. V. Susan Sosnowski has still yet to be heard by the Senate Committee on Labor and Gaming chaired by the chamber’s newest majority leader: Frank Ciccone III.
Ciccone, a Providence Democrat, has been a staunch opponent of the ban citing concern that the state would lose millions in revenue should smoking completely disappear from the two casinos.
It’s the same position shared by the late Senate President Dominick Ruggerio, whom many advocates saw as the main reason smoking still remains inside Rhode Island’s casinos.
Newly-elected Senate President Valarie Lawson, an East Providence Democrat, has previously stated she personally supports a smoking ban. But she also indicated that she would like to see the standard committee review process play out.
But Ciccone is instead looking to reach an agreement between Bally’s and the union to expand existing non-smoking areas in the casinos. Ciccone said in an interview Tuesday that talks remain ongoing.
“If anything looks fruitful, we’ll set up another meeting with everyone again,” he said in an interview Tuesday. “Hopefully we’ll get closer.”

Whether Bally’s wants to expand its nonsmoking offerings — or reduce the size of the smoking area — is still being kept under wraps.
“We don’t have anything to report right now on the smoking issue,” Bally’s spokesperson Patti Doyle said in an email Tuesday. “Will certainly share updates when/if we do.”
Union leaders remain adamant that a compromise won’t solve the problem.
Matt Dunham, president of Table Game Dealers Laborers Local 711, told Rhode Island Current that even with a larger non-smoking section at the state’s two casinos, some workers would still be exposed to smoke.
“A lot of people are going to be left out,” he said in an interview before the rally. 
Dunham pointed to the 2024 non-smoking expansion at Bally’s Lincoln casino, which he said has flaws.
“We still have to walk through cigarettes to get to our own break room,” he said.
Ending Bally’s smoking ban exemption is also a top priority for the AFL-CIO, which commissioned a poll in February that found nearly 7 in 10 survey respondents “strongly” or “somewhat” supported a smoking ban at the state’s two casinos.
“We’re taking the lead from the workers,” Rhode Island AFL-CIO Political Director Autumn Guillote said in an interview just before the rally. “And the demand is still 100% from the advocates.”
Vanessa Baker, an iGaming supervisor at Bally’s Lincoln casino, said staff are constantly “abused and assaulted” by the second-hand smoke that lingers throughout the two Rhode Island facilities.
“The Rhode Island casinos are allowing the safety and wellbeing of their employees and patrons at risk and showing that their employees are expendable,” Baker said. 
There was a time when smoking was temporarily banned inside Bally’s two Rhode Island casinos: when they first reopened after being closed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. But those rules were eventually lifted by March 2022.
“And all our lives changed for the worse,” Baker said.
Philip Farinelli, a floor supervisor at Bally’s Twin River Lincoln Casino, told the crowd he has dealt simultaneously with stage 3 neck and head cancer and stage 1 lung cancer, along with a heart attack, because of conditions caused by lingering smoke.
“I’m still here fighting today so I can work in a healthy environment,” he said. “We all suffer — nose running, eyes itching — it’s just every day, it’s terrible.”
Maegan Tikiryan, a server and bartender at Bally’s Lincoln for 14 years, said she regularly deals with congestion and headaches from the casino’s smoke. She’s said she’s seen three coworkers diagnosed with cancer and is worried it could happen to her as she begins to pursue a law degree at UMass Law.
“I don’t want the smoke to kill me before I earn my degree,” Tikiryan said.

Spencer Cox is among 20 Republican governors who have sent a gushing letter to President Donald Trump expressing support for his “big, beautiful” tax and spending bill that’s been held up as U.S. House Republicans continue to fight over it. 
“As Republican Governors, we stand UNITED in strong support of your One, Big, Beautiful Bill,” the governors wrote in the letter dated Tuesday. “This landmark piece of legislation embodies your powerful vision to bring about the next great American revival.”
They added that the bill “truly delivers on the bold promises all Republicans made to the American people to restore the security, prosperity, and fiscal sanity for our nation.”
Giant tax and spending bill in U.S. House remains snagged by GOP disputes

The massive, 1,116-page bill package includes sweeping tax breaks and controversial cuts of more than $600 billion over the next decade from Medicaid, the government health program for low-income individuals and those with disabilities. However, negotiations continue over the bill and it’s not yet clear whether it has the support it needs from the U.S. House Republicans’ slim majority.
Earlier Tuesday, Republicans who have yet to rally behind the bill huddled in Speaker Mike Johnson’s office to hash out agreements on Medicaid and other outstanding issues. Johnson said he hopes to pass the legislation this week, though he didn’t appear to have the votes as of Tuesday afternoon. 
Even as the bill remains snagged, Republican governors signaled to the president that he has their support, writing “after four long years of tremendous hardship under President Joe Biden and (Vice President) Kamala Harris, the American people cannot wait any longer for Congress to enact the One, Big, Beautiful Bill.”
“The American people have witnessed the tireless work undertaken by you and your administration to reverse the disastrous consequences of President Biden’s failed and often illegal policies,” the governors’ letter says. “You have demonstrated a commitment to using every ounce of Executive authority available to reinstitute fiscal sanity, fight the deep state, secure our borders, and achieve energy dominance.”
‘Counterproductive and cruel’: Advocates form coalition to protect Medicaid from federal cuts

Cox and other governors also called on Congress to act to “fully and permanently implement” Trump’s “America First agenda.”
“Thankfully, your One, Big, Beautiful Bill would accomplish this,” their letter continues. “It would provide you with the resources you need to permanently secure the border, remove barriers needed to truly unleash American energy production, protect Americans by making a once-in-a-lifetime investment in military technology that once seemed like science fiction, give working class families tax cuts worth thousands of dollars each, and ensure your administration has the tools needed to deport illegal alien murders (sic) and rapists.”
They concluded their letter saying they agree that Republicans must “UNIFY around this unprecedented piece of conservative legislation.” They added that “we cannot miss this chance to save taxpayers $1.6 trillion over the next 10 years.”
“We stand by your side and will support you in any way to ensure this necessary piece of legislation is enacted,” the governors wrote.

Boise State Public Radio)This story was first published by Boise State Public Radio on May 20, 2025.
The federal government is suing a small Idaho town for denying a conditional use permit to let a far-right, evangelical church hold services in its downtown.
City Council members in Troy, Idaho, which is about 12 miles east of Moscow in Latah County, denied the permit to Christ Church elder Matt Meyer in March 2023 and a subsequent appeal.
The Department of Justice said in a press release Tuesday that denial was based on animus against the church and its teachings, which violates the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act.

Boise State Public Radio explored Christ Church and its ideology in-depth in Extremely American: Onward Christian Soldiers. The church stresses strict gender roles and advocates for limiting civil rights for women and those who don’t follow its interpretation of Christianity.
“RLUIPA unequivocally forbids local governments from deciding zoning matters based on their dislike of certain religious groups,” said Assistant Attorney General Harmeet K. Dhillon of the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division.
Meyer had purchased a former bank building along the city’s main street, which had been vacant for about a year.
Meyer planned to split the property between office space and event space, including exclusive Sunday use for religious services by Christ Church.
At the time, Troy’s land use ordinance required conditional approval from the city for any new church, regardless of the zone in which it would be located.
Nearly all public comments submitted opposed issuing the permit – several of which included pushback against the church’s conservative ideology.
“The City of Troy welcomes any church to our community,” the denial states. However, it must be denied because the church’s use of the property “… is against the will of the people and will have a negative effect on the City’s ability to grow its business community.”
Just last month, Troy City Council members adopted a new land use ordinance banning 39 different uses within the central business district, including churches and religious facilities.
The suit asks a federal judge to force the city to grant the church permission to worship at the location, along with mandating training for city personnel on federal religious discrimination laws.
A request for comment from the city’s attorney wasn’t immediately returned Tuesday afternoon.

(Photo courtesy NV Energy)Doug Cannon, president and CEO of NV Energy for the last six years, is leaving the post to join American Electric Power Transmission, according to a news release. 
Cannon will be replaced by Brandon Barkhuff, who currently serves as a vice-president, general counsel, and chief compliance officer for NV Energy, according to a statement from the utility. 
“Brandon is a lifelong resident of Nevada, providing him with a strong understanding of the needs of the customers and communities NV Energy serves,” spokesperson Meghin Delaney said.
Cannon’s departure comes amid a call from regulatory staff at the Nevada Public Utilities Commission for an investigation into allegations that NV Energy overcharged some 80,000 customers statewide by at least $17 million, then failed to fully refund them. 
Cannon, while president and CEO, shepherded legislative approval for Greenlink, a massive transmission project that was partially rejected by regulators out of concern for the cost to customers. 
In 2021, Cannon told lawmakers that ratepayers would not be on the hook for Greenlink’s estimated $2.5 billion cost for at least five years.  
“We will put thousands of people to work today and Nevadans will not be asked to pay for this investment until at least five to six years down the road.” Cannon told legislators.
A year later, NV Energy asked federal regulators to grant permission (called incentives) for the utility to come back and request that ratepayers offset the costs of the project’s construction and pay for its troubles should Greenlink be canceled. 
Greenlink’s estimated cost has since ballooned to $4.2 billion.

(Photo provided by Gadsden Independent School District) While the State of New Mexico reported gains in its most recent high school graduation rates, they still remain below the national average.
According to recently released graduation rate data by the state Public Education Department for 2024, the state’s average graduation rate was 78.04%, or 20,375 students, which reflects an increase of over one percentage point from the 2023 rate.
The 2024 rate also marks the state’s highest graduation rate and the largest number of graduating students in the last 15 years. 
“This increase reflects the hard work of our educators, students and families, and it underscores our shared commitment to student success,” PED Secretary Mariana Padilla said in a statement. “At the same time, we recognize that too many students are still not making it to the finish line—and we must continue working together to ensure every student has the support they need to graduate.” 
According to the National Center for Education Statistics, a nonpartisan federal statistical agency, the national high school graduation rate has been about 87% since the 2021-2022 school year. 
Some districts have met the national rate, such as Gadsden Independent School District in the southern part of the state, which has been on par with the national average for several years.
GISD Superintendent Travis Dempsey told Source NM the district’s success does not boil down to just one factor, but multiple steps teachers and administrators have taken. For instance, he said, the district partnered with outside consultant Marzano Resources for additional support. 
The district also releases students two hours early every Wednesday to allow teachers to participate in “professional learning communities” to learn from one another and improve individual instruction. 
“A third factor, I would say, is we’ve really tried very hard to come at this from a perspective that we have to meet our kiddo’s needs, basic needs, before we start trying to press in academically,” Dempsey told Source. 
He pointed to breakfast and dinner programs in several schools, as well as an addition of six mental health therapists to the district’s secondary schools. He added that Career Technical Education programs have also allowed students to explore and meet their needs in other areas. 
“Please don’t think that we’re perfect, because we are far from that, but I think that’s part of the success that you’ve seen over the last couple of years,” Dempsey said. “Stability in a district makes all the difference in the world, in my opinion. And listening to your…community about what they think is important.”
He told Source that because GISD encompasses multiple rural communities in Doña Ana and Otero counties and students often come from low income families, parents have voiced that they feel their children get limited experiences. To address this concern, Dempsey said the district tries to bring experiences to the students and “put learning tools in their hands as much as” possible.  
Dempsey added that GISD also has a low staff turnover rate, which contributes to the stability of the district, its schools and the students. 
“When we hire a teacher, we typically keep them for a whole career,” he said. “And it’s very common that many of our teachers are from Gadsden, so we get a lot of people who come back home to serve their community. And that fact just does wonders for us.”
According to the PED news release, improving graduation rates throughout the state is a primary goal of the department’s strategic plan. The department noted that about 2,400 more high school students need to graduate on time annually for the state to reach the national benchmark by 2027. 
The department added that districts that reported higher graduation rates typically all closely monitor students’ course completion; identify and support at-risk students early; implement school improvement plans; participate in CTE programs; and have students set personal goals before entering high school. 
“Our kids work hard,” Dempsey said. “There’s a culture here in Gadsden of, we expect kids to perform, and they do.”

Greg Gianforte vetoed two bills respectively designed to make the executive and judicial branches of government more transparent to the public — but acknowledged the public’s strong right to know in the Montana Constitution.
In a veto letter, Gianforte also acknowledged his frustration with “judicial activism.”
House Bill 271 was aimed at ensuring transparency by the executive branch by limiting “executive privilege,” or the governor’s power to withhold specific government information.
Senate Bill 40 would have required Montana Supreme Court deliberations to be recorded and, after a case closed, be made available to the public.
Gianforte, a Republican, vetoed both bills on Friday using similar rationale, and proponents of HB 271, including the bill sponsor, soon pushed back against “secret decisions” made by the executive branch.
However, University of Montana law school faculty member Constance Van Kley said the rationales offer consistency, and she said members of the public don’t lose any rights to information and remain free to request government documents.
“Fundamentally, what it reinforces is that … the existence of privileges from the right to know raises constitutional questions, and the scope of any privilege that is asserted against the right to know raises legal questions,” Van Kley said.
 ‘Chill candor among justices’

In his veto letters, the governor said although the Montana Constitution “contains some of the strongest — if not the strongest — rights to public information,” limitations exist.
He said during the 1972 Montana Constitutional Convention, delegates acknowledged that privileges, “such as judicial privilege,” shape the scope of the right to know, or allow for some information to be protected.
Gianforte said legislators passed SB 40 “in response to rampant judicial activism,” and he understands and shares their “deep frustration” and sees it “as a threat to our constitutional order.”
“Time and time again, judges across Montana issue rulings that infringe on the Legislature’s policymaking authority and a governor’s ability to faithfully execute the laws,” Gianforte said in the letter. “The effect of Senate Bill 40, however, will chill candor among justices against the public’s interest and weaponize those discussions in future litigation.
“Legal arguments will no longer be properly focused on majority decisions of the court and discussion among justices may become less honest and robust.”
Van Kley said the delegates in 1972 generally wanted openness in government, but with limits.
“At the Constitutional Convention, the delegates were really focused primarily on transparency and not exceptions to transparency,” Van Kley said. “However, they did recognize that judicial deliberations were generally not open to the public already, and so that did seem to be on the delegates’ minds as an exception to the transparency provision.”
 ‘“Right to know” will die’

The governor used a similar argument in his veto of HB 271, although he also cited the Montana Supreme Court’s order in O’Neill vs. Gianforte.
In that case, a citizen and former government official, Jayson O’Neill, sued the Governor’s Office after it would not provide him forms used to track legislation, citing executive privilege and the need for candor in decision-making.
The Supreme Court found a gubernatorial privilege is “necessary to the integrity of government,” but it also said it is not an absolute privilege, and the governor must meet “a high bar” to keep information private.
In the veto letter, the governor said HB 271 attempts to repeal a “constitutional privilege,” and signing it into law would be contrary to the public interest.
“House Bill 271 categorically limits a governor’s constitutional expectation of privacy where he is executing his constitutional duties,” Gianforte said in the letter.
Democrat Rep. Ed Stafman of Bozeman sponsored the bill, and he said earlier this year that it would “restore transparency and open government in the executive branch to what it has consistently been for at least 50 years.”
In the earlier interview, Stafman also said Montana hadn’t previously recognized executive privilege, the Supreme Court crafted a narrow decision based on common law, and the Legislature has the authority to overturn common law through statute, which his bill aimed to do.
In a statement this week about the veto, Stafman said it allows a backslide in Montana’s history of open government.
“Even as the judicial and legislative branches become more transparent, if we let the executive branch become the place where secret decisions are made and deals are cut, then that’s where the public’s constitutionally protected ‘right to know’ will die,” Stafman said.
The Right to Know in Article II Section 9 of the Montana Constitution states the following:

        “No person shall be deprived of the right to examine documents or to observe the deliberations of all public bodies or agencies of state government and its subdivisions, except in cases in which the demand of individual privacy clearly exceeds the merits of public disclosure.”    
House Minority Leader Katie Sullivan, D-Missoula, also said Montana’s governor answers to the people, and previous governors, both Democrats and Republicans, have made documents available to the public.
“But Gov. Gianforte now sees himself above the law,” Sullivan said in a statement. “He is hiding documents from the public, battling transparency requests in court, bending the rules, and making new ones, all to hide from the people. What is he hiding?”
 Veto won’t make documents private — unless they already are

Van Kley said it would be difficult for other branches of government to claim privilege if HB 271 became law and was found to be constitutional.
That’s because, according to one view of privilege, it’s reasonable to expect that privileges among branches “should be roughly equivalent to each other,” said Van Kley, with the UM Alexander Blewett III School of Law.
Van Kley argued on behalf of plaintiff O’Neill in front of the Montana Supreme Court, so would speak only generally about the Constitutional issues it raised when contacted by the Daily Montanan on Tuesday.
In his veto letter, Gianforte discussed the same: “The Legislature itself has legislative privilege. Senate Bill 40 upsets the separation of powers by eroding the privilege of one branch of government while retaining it in another.”
Van Kley said the veto letter outlines a legitimate view of the separation of powers, and it is consistent with the veto letter for SB 40 which claims the judicial privilege is grounded in the separation of powers.
The order from the Montana Supreme Court, however, said gubernatorial privilege is among the “candor privileges,” such as those protecting the confidential relationship between a priest and churchgoer.
The order said those privileges are rooted not in separation of powers but in the “historical and practical need of society for candor between individuals and those from whom they are seeking counsel,” including government officials.
Van Kley also said the vetoes take off the table any questions about the constitutionality of the bills, and she said a citizen can still request records and claim a constitutional right to examine documents in Montana.
“The veto is not going to privilege any documents that aren’t already privileged,” Van Kley said.
Now that a court ruling recognizes executive privilege “to some degree,” Van Kley said she expects specific questions to emerge and end up litigated.
In January 2025, the Montana Supreme Court directed the district court to do a private review of the documents O’Neill had requested to determine whether they were protected or could be released to the public.
The case was filed in 2021 and is pending.

Photo by Glenn Russell/VTDiggerWe’re now well into overtime, at least compared to legislative sessions past, under the Golden Dome. Committee agendas are looking light, but floor calendars have been packed — and word is it won’t be until next Friday, May 30, that the House and Senate gavel out for the session. So, what will the next two weeks in the Statehouse look like?While legislators have already sent Gov. Phil Scott their proposed state budget for the upcoming fiscal year — typically their last act before adjournment — there are still several major bills working their way through the building that deal with some of the headline issues from last fall’s election. Top of mind this week is lawmakers’ landmark education bill, H.454. The legislation — which faced sharp criticism last week as it was voted out of the Senate Finance Committee, including from committee members who voted for it — could be up for consideration on the Senate floor this week, though there was uncertainty Tuesday over how, exactly, that process would go. The House and Senate are far apart on several key provisions in the legislation.There’s also S.127, which contains a smorgasbord of housing policy changes including a new program to finance infrastructure for housing, such as water lines and sidewalks. The House Appropriations Committee approved the bill Tuesday, but lawmakers are expecting to consider further changes to it Wednesday before taking it up on the House floor Thursday. Meanwhile, there’s H.91, a bill that would create an off-ramp to the state’s mass use of motel rooms as a primary form of emergency shelter. That bill was voted out of the Senate Appropriations Committee Tuesday and is also set to come up for a floor vote Thursday.Lawmakers need more to fill their time, though, (and to justify those per diems,) than just voting on key bills. House committees are planning to hold hearings on the implementation and efficacy of past legislation and, in some cases, are set to take field trips to sites and projects that are relevant to their work, according to Conor Kennedy, chief of staff for Speaker Jill Krowinski.Committees are also taking a close look at the role of federal funds in different areas of state government — and preparing contingency plans for what would happen if President Donald Trump’s administration pulls that funding, as it already has in some cases, Kennedy said.    House and Senate leaders, he added, expect their annual adjournment resolution to include language that would allow Krowinski and Sen. Phil Baruth, the Senate President Pro Tempore, to call their colleagues back into session if the state loses certain amounts — still to be finalized — of its federal funding. The governor could also, under his existing authority, call legislators back if he thinks it is necessary.“I think we’re all hoping that we do not have to come back, right? Everyone’s got normal jobs, and seeing family and stuff,” Kennedy said. “But we’ll see.”— Shaun RobinsonIn the knowGov. Scott told Baruth and Krowinski at a meeting Tuesday afternoon that he would use his power to call legislators back into session after they’ve adjourned for the year if they do not pass an education reform bill first, Baruth told his Senate Democratic colleagues at a caucus meeting Tuesday evening. The meeting focused on the prospects of the Senate’s version of H.454, and a number of senators expressed displeasure with the current state of the bill. The governor “did say that we wouldn’t be going home until it was done,” Baruth said. H.454 had been scheduled for a vote on the Senate floor Wednesday, but toward the end of Tuesday’s meeting, Baruth said he now plans to skip over it and allow more time for his caucus to build consensus around what should be included. In its current form, “a majority of our caucus cannot vote for what’s come out at the end of the process,” Baruth said. — Shaun RobinsonForty-four Vermont state legislators joined more than 500 of their colleagues from other states in signing a letter to the majority and minority leaders of the U.S. House and Senate, calling on them to oppose language in the budget bill working its way through Congress that would block patients using Medicaid insurance from accessing care at Planned Parenthood clinics. — Kristen FountainOn the moveThe Senate approved H.238, a bill that seeks to ban PFAS chemicals from dental floss, cleaning products and containers treated with fluorine from being manufactured or sold in the state. The chamber added new language to prohibit sales of firefighting protective gear containing PFAS, including respirators. Firefighters have particularly high exposure to PFAS from the chemicals’ prevalence in their gear and fire-fighting foam. The occupation also carries a higher risk of cancer, which scientists suspect is linked to heightened PFAS levels in their blood.  With the addition from the Senate, the bill now makes its way back to the House for a vote. If passed, the bill would expand existing state law that keeps the chemicals out of cosmetics, menstrual products and other consumer products. Bans on different categories of product take effect at different dates through mid-2028. The ban on firefighting gear and respirators would go into effect in mid-2029 and 2032, respectively, following a report from the Agency of Natural Resources on their availability and cost at the end of 2028.— Olivia GiegerGov. Scott has already signed several bills into law this week, including the so-called “yield bill,” which sets property tax rates for the upcoming fiscal year. Property taxes are the primary source of revenue for public education in the state.This year the average property tax bill increase will be 1.1%, a sharp contrast to last year’s average increase of 13.8%. However, achieving that low tax rate required allocating over $40 million in surplus funds to the task as well as a $77 million transfer from the general fund. That plan did not sit well with some legislators, and it also drew a warning from the governor:“Buying down rates year after year isn’t good fiscal management and we should only view this as a bridge to the real education transformation our system needs,” he said in a written statement. “Before this session adjourns, it’s critical we work together to deliver an education bill that sets us on a path to a better more sustainable funding system, a more efficient and effective governance structure, and a commitment to doing the education quality work needed to make sure all students have access to educational opportunities, at a price Vermonters can afford.”— Kristen FountainVisit our 2025 bill tracker for the latest updates on major legislation we are following. Read the story on VTDigger here:  Final Reading: It’s T-minus 2 weeks until the Vermont Legislature plans to adjourn.

Lawmakers are taking up library books as conservative activists around the state pore over material in young adult and teen library sections for sexual content.
The post Legislative panel pursues bills to regulate Wyoming library books with sexual material appeared first on WyoFile .","TORRINGTON—A Wyoming legislative committee decided Tuesday to draft bills to police books in libraries, taking steps down a constitutionally fraught path out of concern that literature dealing with sexuality and gender identity can corrupt minors.
Lawmakers are reviewing the content of library books, which has become a national crusade by religious conservatives, as activists and lawmakers around the state pore over material available in young adult and teen sections of libraries, hunting for sexual content.
They have focused specifically on books exploring LGBTQ+ issues that are written for young people, though some books dealing with issues like drug use are also under the microscope. 
In Torrington, the Joint Judiciary Committee voted nearly unanimously to draft bills that would remove books containing sexually explicit materials from the children’s sections of libraries, and also police minors’ access to library materials accessible online. 
The first and more consequential bill draft, as proposed by Casper Republican Rep. Jayme Lien, would list out specific sexual acts and rule any literature depicting them as sexually explicit material. It would also punish librarians with criminal and financial penalties if minors gain access to such books, and allow citizens to bring civil actions against library officials they believe are violating the rules.
Some lawmakers on the committee said they were voting for the bill draft to carry the policy discussion forward, but would likely later oppose the penalties in the legislation — a chief concern of the Wyoming Library Association.

Any such penalties are also a concern of the Wyoming Education Association, that group’s lobbyist Tate Mullen told the committee. His organization, which represents the state’s professional educators, worries that any effort to penalize librarians could hurt efforts to attract and retain teachers and school staff for Wyoming. 
Rep. Ann Lucas, a freshman lawmaker endorsed by the Wyoming Freedom Caucus, has led the charge to involve the Legislature in the selection and placement of books in public libraries. At Tuesday’s meeting, the Cheyenne lawmaker brought a bag of books, some checked out from libraries and some she had purchased herself, which she said contained material inappropriate for children.
“I sat here for the past week and I went through a lot of books and I looked for all the nasty words,” she told the committee. Lucas put sticky notes on certain pages in the books, and one title in particular, the book “Gender Queer” by Maia Kobabe, drew the committee’s opprobrium. 
“I don’t think there is a single person up here … that would look at this book ‘Gender Queer’ and think it belongs in a children’s section,” said Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Jared Olsen, R-Cheyenne. 
The only no vote on Lien’s bill draft came from Rep. Kenneth Chestek, a Laramie Democrat and University of Wyoming law professor, who said he feared the Legislature would struggle to regulate books without running afoul of the U.S. Constitution. In particular, the U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that regulation of materials as obscene must pass what’s called the Miller test, after a 1973 case. In Miller v. California, the justices found that for material to be considered obscene under the law, it had to lack serious “literary, political or scientific value.”
Lawmakers asked Wyoming Library Association President Lindsey Travis and other bill opponents several times if they thought copies of Hustler, a pornographic magazine, should be available to minors. Travis responded that Hustler was considered obscene under the law and pornography wasn’t available in the library. The books in question aren’t the same thing, she said. 
“Gender Queer” is described by the author as a memoir written as a graphic novel. Through words and drawings, it recounts the author’s experiences as an adolescent and young adult grappling with her gender identity, and includes explicit depictions of masturbation and later sexual encounters as the author enters adulthood. Kobabe wrote the book for young people facing similar turmoils, according to an online interview with Michigan news outlet MLive, and considers it most appropriate for high school students. 
“I felt very alone in my gender experience as a teenager and I’m very grateful that as an adult I’ve been able to share this and I’ve been able to build such a loving and strong community out of sharing,” Kobabe said in the interview, in which the author called for tolerance from people seeking to ban or isolate the book.
“Even if they can’t see the value of this book, it could be valuable to someone else,” Kobabe said of crusaders against the text. “Just let it be, as a resource, one among many in a community, and know that the people who read it will mostly be the people needing it.”
In Wyoming, Kobabe’s book is located on bookshelves in the young adult or adult sections, Travis told WyoFile. What ages are considered young adult is a decision made by each local library, Travis said, but it generally includes teenagers. Libraries pick their own collections and display locations, she said. They are governed by local library boards, and the Legislature’s efforts would take some of that control away. 
“Wyoming libraries are locally controlled, and I think we need to maintain that,” she said. 
But lawmakers worried that children could access “Gender Queer” and other books as they roam through libraries, regardless of what shelves they’re placed on. The practicalities of keeping younger children away from books for adults and teenagers weren’t substantively discussed at the meeting in Torrington, though Lucas noted the public library in Cheyenne keeps its young adult section in an area of the library that doesn’t sit behind closed doors.

Wyoming libraries have drawn conservatives’ ire, particularly when they highlight LBGTQ+ literature in special sections or social media posts. In Campbell County, for example, where the political dispute has played out most sharply, trouble started in 2023, after the library highlighted a series of such books for Pride Month. 
Furor over that post kicked off sustained scrutiny of books in the Gillette library from a group of local residents. That conflict ended with the firing of a library director who had resisted such efforts, and the regulation of certain books to a special library section. The library board later ended the special section, and placed the books into the adult section of the library, current Campbell County library director John Jackson told WyoFile on Tuesday.
The ousted-director, Terri Lesley, has sued both a local family and government officials for discrimination and wrongful termination. The two lawsuits accuse residents of harboring clear bias against LGBTQ+ people and lifestyles, and violating the First Amendment in their quest to limit access to books on the topic.

“Do you know that discretion is allowed?” Eva Vekos said on one of the recordings to a state police trooper processing her on the DUI offense. She added, “No photographs. My face is not going to go out in the paper.”

Screenshot from video footage provided by the Vermont Department of Public SafetyThe state Department of Public Safety has released audio and video recording of the arrest of Addison County State’s Attorney Eva Vekos on a charge of drunken driving more than a year ago.The recordings, which include videos from troopers’ body worn cameras and dash cam footage from a cruiser, show about two hours of interactions between police and Vekos, mostly after she was taken into custody. The recordings, however, do not capture all the interactions that led up to the arrest, including some instances when troopers reported observing the prosecutor allegedly slurring her speech and smelling of alcohol, according to charging documents.The recordings and the Vermont State Police troopers’ observations of Vekos may prove critical in her case since Vekos refused a breath test that could have shown a measure of any intoxication.The release of the recordings follows a decision earlier this month by Judge Timothy Tomasi in Washington County Superior civil court ruling in favor of the Vermont Journalism Trust, the parent organization of VTDigger, which brought a lawsuit seeking the recordings.  Tomasi, in his decision ordering the release of the recordings to VTDigger, told the state Department of Public Safety to produce the previously withheld records to the news outlet within 10 days, making Monday the deadline. The department provided the material Monday afternoon to VTDigger.
VTDigger filed the lawsuit after the Department of Public Safety refused to provide the recordings to the news organization. Officers from Vermont State Police, which is within the department, arrested Vekos.Vekos has pleaded not guilty to the DUI charge and a trial has not yet been set. A judge told attorneys in the case at a recent hearing that he expected it to take place sometime this fall. Vekos has continued to serve as the Addison County state’s attorney while the criminal case against her remains pending. The prosecutor’s post is an elected position.The recordings released Monday begin shortly before a trooper placed Vekos in handcuffs, put her in a cruiser and drove her to the state police barracks in New Haven to be processed for drunken driving. READ MORE
Vekos was arrested on the night of Jan. 25, 2024, after she allegedly drove impaired to the scene of a suspicious death investigation in Bridport, according to the charging documents.Recordings show very little interaction between Vekos and Trooper Kelsey Dobson, who was driving the cruiser, during the roughly 25 minute trip to the barracks, according to the released video. The videos do show that moments before Vekos was placed in the cruiser she was handcuffed by a trooper. She then walked a short distance from her vehicle, which was parked at the scene at the time, to a nearby cruiser. She appeared steady while walking and without any support before she took a seat in the back of the cruiser.  The recordings also don’t clearly show slurred speech, though the videos released do not show much of her interactions with police at the scene. At the barracks, the videos and audio recordings show Vekos appearing uncooperative at times, though never raising her voice when Sgt. Eden Neary, who conducted the processing, read her rights and questioned her.Vekos immediately told Neary when the processing began at the barracks she was not going to answer questions, take a breath test or have a mugshot taken.“Do you know that discretion is allowed?” she said to Neary, adding: “No photographs. My face is not going to go out in the paper.”“As far as discretion, we as a department don’t take any discretion with DUI,”  Neary replied.“There wasn’t any DUI,” Vekos said to him. “There was alcohol on the breath and alleged slurred speech.”“Which are enough indicators to request an evidentiary test, which you know as the state’s attorney,” Neary responded.Vekos then spoke about the impact the incident would have on her office. “We’ve been working really hard with law enforcement to build a good relationship and this is gonna knock that really down and my office is going to suffer now,” Vekos said. “I’m not gonna argue with you about it,” Neary said to her. “That’s a discussion for another day, not right now.” Vekos then talked about how much she had to drink.“I came out to participate in a homicide scene investigation,” she told Neary. “I understand that, and I guess that’s where maybe your discretion would have been better used,” Neary said.“In what way?” Vekos asked him.“Well, if you knew you had a drink or two,” Neary said. “An hour ago – one – an hour ago with a meal,” she said. “It doesn’t make me inebriated.” Vekos spoke in a normal tone during the roughly 45 minute interaction with Neary. At times, she appeared to be crying.Charging documents in the case included an affidavit by Detective Trooper Mengbei Wang who wrote about being inside a residence in Bridport as part of the death scene investigation. Wang wrote in the filing that, while standing next to Vekos, she detected a “strong odor of intoxicants emanating” from Vekos and heard her slurring her speech.There is no body camera footage of Wang’s interaction with Vekos.Detective Trooper Ryan Normile, in a separate charging affidavit, wrote that he was present when Vekos arrived driving a Volkswagen Golf. Normile wrote that he walked beside Vekos at the scene and “recognized an odor of intoxicants emanating” from her  Later, as Vekos was sitting in her vehicle, Normile wrote that he asked her how much she had to drink that night. Vekos replied that she had one gin and tonic with a burger for dinner about an hour ago, Normile wrote in his affidavit.Normile wrote that Vekos’ speech appeared slurred and he asked her to undergo field sobriety tests, which she refused. Vekos, according to Normile’s affidavit, then asked him: “Are you serious Ryan, can’t you just have a friend come and get me?”Normile was not wearing a body camera, but footage from Dobson captured the interaction between Normile and Vekos as she sat in her vehicle before she was placed in custody. However, the exact words exchanged between the two at times aren’t entirely clear.Vekos can be heard saying that it doesn’t matter if she performs the field sobriety tests because she would be arrested anyway.“Eva, that is not true,” Normile replied. Adam Silverman, a spokesperson for state police, stated in an email Tuesday that since Wang and Normile are both detectives, they typically dress in business attire and “generally” do not wear body-worn cameras. “In addition,” Silverman wrote, “BWC policy requires activation of cameras during anticipated interactions with members of the public; in this case, the situation at hand was a controlled scene with access limited to law-enforcement personnel, including the state’s attorney. When the nature of this encounter changed, troopers activated their BWCs as required.”David Sleigh, an attorney representing Vekos on the drunken driving charge, said Tuesday that he has reviewed the audio and video footage from state police in the case and didn’t believe it indicated his client was guilty of the charge. “Other than showing that she was distraught and upset at being arrested, there doesn’t seem to be any clear indication of impairment or lack of control of her physical or mental faculties,” Sleigh said. “We think that largely the recorded evidence is consistent with innocence.”He also disputed that comments Vekos made to police indicated any intent to seek favoritism to get out of a DUI arrest, including when she asked them to use discretion, and when she requested to have a friend pick her up, rather than undergo sobriety tests. He said police “make discretionary decisions” at many points when considering whether to arrest someone for drunken driving. “I don’t take her requesting a ride home from somebody else as asking for a favor or admitting that she was impaired, but rather saying, ‘Look, if you guys have even the slightest concern about my ability to operate, I’ll have somebody else come get me,’” Sleigh added. Near the end of the video recordings of Vekos’ processing at the state police barracks, she can be heard asking a trooper about the status of her vehicle that was left parked at the scene she had been seeking to keep from being towed. A trooper replied that a tow truck had already been called to remove the vehicle. “Thanks,” Vekos said to him in apparent sarcasm, adding, “just a little consideration.” Read the story on VTDigger here:  State police release arrest recordings of Addison County state’s attorney on drunken driving charge.",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Eva-Vekos-States-Attorney-Footage-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-20 19:06:29.763435

(Photo by Laura Paton/Rhode Island Current)The Rhode Island Office of the State Fire Marshal is investigating the cause of Tuesday’s early morning fire that engulfed the popular Matunuck Oyster Bar in South Kingstown.
No injuries were reported from the blaze that seriously damaged the waterfront restaurant on Succotash Road ahead of Memorial Day weekend. Heavy smoke and flames were coming from the restaurant at the time firefighters arrived at approximately 3:45 a.m., according to Associated Press reports.
“Currently, the cause of the fire is undetermined. Updates will be shared as they become available,” Matt Touchette, spokesperson for the fire marshal’s office said in an emailed statement.
Perry Raso opened Matunuck Oyster Bar in 2009, selling the fresh oysters harvested at the Matunuck Oyster Farm, the wading depth aquaculture farm he founded on Potter Pond in East Matunuck. The restaurant had commercial docks that facilitated access for work boats.
Restaurant employees surrounded Raso in a group hug outside the burned out building late Tuesday morning as firefighters continued to work at the scene.
Rhode Island Department of Labor and Training Chief Public Affairs Officer Edwine “Drine” Paul said a department official connected with the restaurant’s owner Tuesday afternoon. 
“The department is coordinating efforts with the restaurant to expedite our rapid response services to support all of the impacted workers,” Paul said. “We want to make sure that we support them at this difficult time.”
It was unclear how many employees worked at the restaurant. Raso was unavailable for comment.
Matunuck Oyster Bar has received numerous accolades, including making USA Today’s Restaurants of the Year list.

(Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — An Oklahoma City federal judge on Tuesday put a two-week hold on the state’s enforcement of a law criminalizing immigrants living in Oklahoma without legal residency.
House Bill 4156 created the state crime of “impermissible occupation” last year. Federal District Judge Bernard Jones blocked enforcement of HB 4156 from June until March, when President Donald Trump’s administration dropped his Democratic predecessor’s lawsuit challenging the law.
Two undocumented immigrants living in Oklahoma and two organizations based in the state refiled the case this month. Jones agreed, like he did last year, that their case against HB 4156 is likely to succeed in court.
The U.S. Supreme Court has repeatedly found that control of immigration is an exclusively federal power, he wrote in his decision issued Tuesday. Jones found that federal law on this issue is likely to preempt state laws.
“Based on the comprehensive and exhaustive immigration framework that Congress designed, the Court is left with one conclusion: H.B. 4156 must fail,” Jones wrote.
Jones’ decision blocks enforcement of the law until June 3, but the order could be extended. 
The judge decided the undocumented residents could proceed under the pseudonyms Barbara Boe and Christopher Coe. His ruling also provisionally creates two classes of plaintiffs, an “Entry Class” including those who unlawfully entered the country and a “Reentry Class” made up of individuals who were deported and have returned to the United States.
Attorney General Gentner Drummond said the judge’s decision is “outrageous.” He said HB 4156 is essential to stopping drug trafficking and other illegal activities in the state.
“In the name of federal law, the court is protecting admitted lawbreakers from federal and state consequences,” Drummond said in a statement. “This is perverse, contrary to the rule of law, and we will be evaluating all options for challenging the ruling.”
Attorneys from the American Civil Liberties Union of Oklahoma are leading the plaintiffs’ legal team.
“The court’s decision today is a victory for Oklahoma’s immigrant community, but the damage of HB 4156 and the national rhetoric repeated by local politicians has already created an environment of fear in our state,” ACLU of Oklahoma executive director Tamya Cox-Toure said in a statement. “No matter what someone looks like, sounds like, or what their immigration status may be, they should feel safe in their own communities. We will continue to fight for the rights and dignity of immigrants and their families.”

[…]","Michigan House Speaker Matt Hall (R-Richland Township) at his weekly press briefing. May 20, 2025 | Photo by Ben SolisMichigan House Speaker Matt Hall said Tuesday that it wouldn’t be difficult to cut $326 million from state government to pay for road funding – but the items that could be on the chopping block include a key DEI and refugee resettlement program, arts and culture grants and money for the state’s COVID-19 Task Force.
Hall (R-Richland Township) keyed in on those items during a regularly scheduled news briefing with reporters. Although the House has yet to pass a budget like its Senate counterpart, Hall said his Democratic colleagues have told him that finding $320 million in cuts to divert to roads would be nearly impossible or costly to the state in the long run.
Not so, Hall said Tuesday, touting at the very least a potential framework for making deep cuts. The speaker said he and Rep. Ann Bollin (R-Brighton), chair of the House Appropriations Committee, were going line-by-line to find maximum benefit for taxpayers in their version of the budget.
Hall showed where they might be going with a slide presented during Tuesday’s briefing, 
The largest item on the block was $115 million in what Hall said were remaining corporate handouts. That includes $100 million in business attraction and community development money and $15 million for entrepreneurship ecosystem funding.
Additional cuts Hall noted that could be made included $61 million from other programs – the top line being $28 million from the Office of Global Michigan. The office is a creation of Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s administration, and touts itself as the state’s arm in advancing equity and inclusion initiatives throughout the state. The office also facilitates smooth transitions for newcomers from foreign countries, immigrants, refugees and members of marginalized communities.
Of that remaining $61 million, Hall eyed $22 million in cuts from the COVID-19 Task Force, also created by Whitmer, and $11 million in arts and culture grants.

Hall did not mince his words on cuts for “corporate handouts.”

“None of them, and none of these things are resulting in any job creations,” Hall said. “We’re just saying local roads are probably more important to most people than these big corporate giveaways.”
Nor did he pull his punches at the various social programs that could see cuts.
“The COVID-19 Task Force. … What are these people doing?” Hall asked. “Are they going around asking people to wear masks still? I’ve talked about the arts and cultural grants. The Capital City Film Festival, barbershop quartets, I mean, it’s incredible. What’s more important, puppet art, or roads? I think most people in Michigan would say roads.”
Whitmer’s Office of Global Michigan was another area Hall appeared to see as expendable in any House-passed budget, saying that the initiative housed and subsidized “illegal aliens.” That office has been a target of Republicans for its Newcomer Rental Subsidy program, which they contend encourages illegal immigration by providing up to a year of rental assistance for “Refugees and other Newcomer population-eligible households,” even though eligibility is based on having a legal immigration status.
Another $150 million could be eliminated, he said, by cutting 2,900 unfilled state government positions, which Hall called phantom jobs. The speaker said the fact that the state hasn’t filled those positions was, in his view, a product of government expanding too quickly and without a plan. 
Overall, Hall said the slide illustrated that deep cuts were possible despite objections from the House chamber’s Democrats.
“It’s very easy to do, and there’s a lot more things that we could cut,” Hall said. “I just put this up here for simplicity to show you some things that we’re contemplating that are very easy to cut in this budget.”

“Vermonters have always been in the forefront of standing up for civil liberties, and they've always been in the forefront of standing against the abuse of governmental power,” said Sen. Peter Welch. 
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Vermont delegation, municipalities take action to uphold the right to due process.","From left: Sen. Bernie Sanders, Rep. Becca Balint and Sen. Peter Welch. Photos by Glenn Russell/VTDiggerOn Monday night, the towns of Shaftsbury and Bennington joined a growing number of municipalities that have passed a resolution condemning attacks on due process and affirming the rights of residents granted in the U.S. Constitution. Meanwhile, members of Vermont’s three-person congressional delegation have also been speaking out in recent weeks in defense of the Fifth Amendment — the right to not be deprived of life, liberty or property without due process — on the floor of the U.S. House, at rallies and in letters to officials in the administration of President Donald Trump. “Due process is the heart of enforceable liberty against overreach by government, and every citizen has an interest in being entitled to due process to restrict the government from arbitrarily arresting them,” said Sen. Peter Welch, D-Vt., in an interview.“We’re seeing unprecedented use of arbitrary power in some of these recent cases” such as the international students who were detained in Vermont, Welch said. The Shaftsbury Select Board passed the resolution unanimously with little discussion. Board Chair Naomi Miller said she supported the resolution because due process rights are under “existential threat from the current government in Washington” and so she believes any action “people can take to resist the erosion of democracy is essential.”The Bennington Select Board passed the resolution 5-2 after ample discussion by members and the public. Tom Haley, the board’s chair, said the initiative to bring the resolution forward for discussion was “citizen-led” and he was grateful for the civil discussion of the resolution. Haley said he voted in favor because he knows that residents of Bennington, particularly LGBTQ people, immigrants and people of color, have expressed to him that they are afraid their due process rights will be violated, and he said he believes that in Vermont “you take care of your neighbors.”While the language of the resolution has been adapted to fit the context of each municipality, the “resolution condemning attacks on due process and affirmation the constitutional rights of all persons,” first passed in Rutland City on April 21, has served as a model for towns around the state.Michael Talbott, a member of the Rutland City Board of Aldermen who penned the original resolution, said the document aimed to show to residents, through a “symbolic action,” that their local governing body will uphold their due process rights, and he hopes that other local boards will take the resolution up.“It was meant to be reassuring to members of our community who are pretty scared and uncertain about the current moment and the future because of things going on at the federal level,” Talbott said. “I found statements made by the federal government to be pretty disturbing in that they run counter to the protections that are guaranteed to everyone in our country, regardless of citizenship status.”Acting nationallyWelch spearheaded a letter sent last week to Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, calling for a hearing to evaluate the Trump administration’s infringement of due process rights in the case of the deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia. Garcia was deported to a prison in El Salvador, where he remains, despite the U.S. Supreme Court ruling that the administration has an obligation to facilitate his return and the Trump administration admitting Garcia was deported due to “administrative error.”Welch said Garcia’s case is among several instances of violations of due process, including the detainment of the Palestinian Vermonter Mohsen Mahdawi during a citizenship interview and of Rümeysa Öztürk by masked, plainclothes ICE agents outside her apartment for exercising their right to free speech. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and Rep. Becca Balint, D-Vt., along with other congressional colleagues also held a press conference on April 29 calling for the release for Mahdawi after his detention without due process, before he was released a day later on April 30.The letter sent to Grassley also mentioned that Trump administration officials have said they are assessing the possibility of suspending habeas corpus, or the right against arbitrary detention, which Welch said is “an explicit threat to abuse executive authority.” Balint also spoke on the U.S. House floor Monday about her concern with the threat to the right of habeas corpus. She said only Congress has the right to suspend habeas corpus, and its suspension would mean the abandonment of a “core principle that no one in this country will be imprisoned unlawfully.”Acting Locally Welch said he is heartened and inspired by the governing bodies in municipalities around the state taking up resolutions to protect due process and constitutional rights.“Vermonters have always been in the forefront of standing up for civil liberties, and they’ve always been in the forefront of standing against the abuse of governmental power,” Welch said. Since the resolution passed in Rutland City, resident and U.S. Army veteran Peter Franzoni said he has sent the resolution to the town clerk or selectboard members of every municipality in Vermont and has attended board meetings in various towns to advocate for the resolution’s passage. Franzoni said he has taken action to drum up support for the resolution around the state because he believes that despite partisanship, people should work together to protect constitutional rights. “We’re being torn apart by all these other forces in our culture and our society. Right now, we can’t find any common ground, but the one common ground we all have is our Constitution,” Franzoni said. “It’s literally what binds us together as a nation, and if we start letting people chip away with it, it will be destroyed.” The selectboard for the town of Wallingford passed the resolution unanimously on May 5, and the town of Rockingham selectboard passed the resolution on May 6. The Brandon selectboard then passed the resolution unanimously on May 12, and the selectboards for the towns of Jericho and Pittsfield also unanimously passed the resolution on May 15. Several municipalities including East Montpelier, Rutland Town, Proctor and Middletown Springs have also placed the resolution on their agendas for upcoming meetings. The Burlington City Council passed a resolution on April 28 to uphold the constitutional right to free speech and the free press, free association and dissent and to express support for student activists Mahdawi, Öztürk and Mahmoud Khalil. Council Chair Ben Traverse said he adapted some of the language of the due process resolution, which had already passed in Rutland City at the time, and said Vermont’s political leaders on the local and national level will need to continue efforts and “band together” to uphold democratic principles. “I think that the free speech resolution and these due process resolutions are just the beginning — not the end — of various efforts that we’re going to need to undertake to support and maintain a resilient community,” Traverse said.Read the story on VTDigger here:  Vermont delegation, municipalities take action to uphold the right to due process.",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Bernie-Sanders-Becca-Balint-Peter-Welch-Vermont-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-05-20 19:06:29.763435

(Image from Iowa PBS video)Iowa Secretary of Agriculture Mike Naig announced Tuesday he will not pursue a gubernatorial election and will instead seek another term as agriculture secretary.
Naig was one of the many Republicans considered a potential candidate in the race to succeed Gov. Kim Reynolds after she announced she would not seek reelection in 2026. Naig had said in April he and his family were “thoughtfully discussing that possibility.” But on Tuesday he said he had decided not to run, adding that there was “still work to be done growing our state and economy as secretary of agriculture.”
Naig has held his current position since being appointed in March 2018 after serving as deputy agriculture secretary under Bill Northey, who was appointed undersecretary for farm production and conservation in the U.S. Department of Agriculture during President Donald Trump’s first term in office. Naig won reelection in the 2018 and again in 2022 against Democratic challenger John Norwood.

SPRINGFIELD — A long-awaited bill to reform the Prisoner Review Board will soon go to Gov. JB Pritzker’s desk after receiving approval in the legislature Tuesday.

The House voted 74-37 to approve Senate Bill 19, which contains a series of reforms designed to include victims’ participation in Prisoner Review Board decisions. The measure now needs only a signature from the governor to become law.

The bill would give victims the right to file victim impact statements ahead of hearings, provide them with additional notice when their offender is granted early release, and allow them to seek an order of protection against an offender who is incarcerated.

It would also create the Office of the Director of Victim and Witness Services, which would ensure the board complies with victims’ rights, and mandates the board provide victims with contact information for the State Victim Assistance Hotline.

The bill also extends the terms for PRB members from six to eight years.

“The bulk of this bill is focused on ... making sure that victims, survivors, are more engaged in the process at PRB because unfortunately, too often, we’ve heard from victims and family members that they simply haven’t been given a voice in this process,” bill sponsor Rep. Will Guzzardi, D-Chicago, said.

Reforms pushed by the General Assembly last year failed to advance to the governor’s desk despite nearly unanimous support from the legislature. Pritzker opposed a requirement in the bill that board hearings to be livestreamed, and the bill was never called for a vote in the final days of last year’s session.

Guzzardi said the bill passed Tuesday includes many of the portions lawmakers agreed on last year, but many Republicans have expressed concerns the latest version was too weak compared to the previous version.

The reforms come after Crosetti Brand allegedly murdered an 11-year-old Chicago boy in 2024. That February, the board voted to release Brand, finding there was not enough evidence he had violated his conditions of release. His ex-girlfriend, Laterria Smith, was denied an emergency order of protection by a Cook County judge while Brand was imprisoned at Stateville in Crest Hill.

Brand was charged with attacking Smith the day after his release and killing her 11-year-old son, Jayden Perkins, who attempted to protect his mother. Two PRB members, including the board chair, resigned in the wake of the incident.

Brand’s history of domestic violence against women prompted both advocates and lawmakers to call for stricter review of prisoners’ backgrounds before their release.

Response to Sonya Massey’s death

Another bill needing only the governor’s signature to become law would change hiring practices for law enforcement agencies after it passed through the House on May 15.

Senate Bill 1953 would require all law enforcement agencies in the state to obtain all of the investigations, examinations and records about a potential hire from all entities that previously employed them. Previous employers and law enforcement agencies are required to release the information within two weeks of receiving such a request.

Sen. Doris Turner, D-Springfield, has been pushing for legislation in response to the death of Sonya Massey, a Springfield resident who was shot and killed in her home by a Sangamon County Sheriff’s deputy in July 2024.

The former sheriff’s deputy, Sean Grayson, was originally called to Massey’s home in Springfield about reports of a prowler. After not finding anything outside, Grayson and his partner spoke with Massey inside her home.

The deputies stood in the living room while Massey, with permission, removed a pot of boiling water from the stove in the adjoined kitchen. Massey said, “I rebuke you in the name of Jesus” after comments from deputies about the hot water, then Grayson threatened to shoot her. Body camera video showed Grayson shooting her seconds after the threat as Massey apologized.

Grayson is awaiting trial on first-degree murder charges and has pleaded not guilty.

Following Massey’s death, Capitol News Illinois unearthed documents showing Grayson was disciplined at a previous job for disobeying orders from superiors, general aggression and posting about drug busts online. Grayson was also found to have lied about being honorably discharged from the Army.

“We can't legislate for judgment,” said the bill’s House sponsor Kam Buckner, D-Chicago, during a news conference last week. “What we can do is make sure that the answer that we got from the Sangamon County Sheriff's Department was that they did not know. That will no longer be the case when we pass this bill.”

Turner sponsored another bill in response to Massey’s death that would give Sangamon County residents the power to recall an elected official, like the sheriff. Cook County already has the power to hold recall votes.

Senate Bill 1954 passed through the Senate but hasn’t made its way through a House committee, meaning its passage could be an uphill battle.

“It's not done for this year,” Buckner said. “We just need to figure out what's going to happen in these next couple of weeks.”

Tornado-safe warehouses

A mile-wide EF3 tornado tore through St. Louis on Friday afternoon before crossing into Illinois and inflicting more damage in parts of Madison County. According to the National Weather Service, the tornado passed less than a mile from a complex of warehouses where a man was killed when a similar strength tornado demolished an Amazon warehouse in December 2021.

In response to the 2021 tornado, Illinois lawmakers convened a task force to issue recommendations on how to make warehouses safer in a tornado. In response to those recommendations, the House voted 83-28 Tuesday to pass House Bill 2987, which creates a series of new requirements warehouses must follow to protect their employees during a tornado warning.

""It’s very timely that I’m calling this today as I spent part of my Friday and the last three weekends hunkered down in the basement with a tornado coming through my area,” Rep. Katie Stuart, D-Edwardsville, said.

Read more: Task force recommends tornado shelters in warehouses following deadly 2021 storm

The bill now heads to the Senate. It requires warehouse operators to work with local first responder agencies to craft safety plans for severe weather. New warehouses would need to be built with shelter spaces compliant with building codes for tornadoes and other types of natural disasters.

The 2021 tornado hit as the Amazon warehouse was bustling ahead of the holidays. According to the National Weather Service, the tornado traveled through the south half of the building. The tornado first impacted the west-facing wall, causing it to collapse. That caused other structural failures, including the roof to collapse.

An Occupational Safety and Health Administration investigation into Amazon did not find any violations, according to the task force report. OSHA recommended the company review its severe weather procedures, ensure employees are provided training and participate in drills, have site-specific information about severe weather plans, and ensure audible warning devices are accessible. The warehouse was rebuilt and reopened in September 2024.

Loss of a National Endowment for the Humanities grant, which was 80% of its budget, led the 55-year-old organization to dramatically downsize come June. 
The post Wyoming Humanities staff cut from 6 to 2 following DOGE-driven funding freeze appeared first on WyoFile .","A banner atop the Wyoming Humanities’ website warns that its work promoting the stories and cultures that shape Wyoming “is at risk” after losing a federal grant and two-thirds of its staff as a result.
On Tuesday, the statewide nonprofit sent word of what it needs to keep the lights on without an $870,000 National Endowment for the Humanities grant that was abruptly frozen by the Trump administration’s Department of Government Efficiency in early April. Faced with losing 80% of its funding, the Wyoming Humanities Board recently decided to shrink its staff from six full-time employees to two, in order to keep the 55-year-old nonprofit from fully shuttering.

Shawn Reese (Wyoming Humanities)
“The whole situation is unfortunate,” Wyoming Humanities Executive Director Shawn Reese told WyoFile. “Congress had authorized direct funding to state humanities councils, and DOGE still decided to cut the funding. That was unexpected and questionable, but nevertheless, it’s the position that we’re in.”
Reese is among the four Wyoming Humanities employees whose positions will be eliminated come June 1. Other staff whose jobs are casualties of the federal funding freeze are Emy DiGrappa, executive producer; Lucas Fralick, program coordinator; and Katie Beuman Parrish, director of advancement. 

Chloé Flagg (Wyoming Humanities)
Chloé Flagg, formerly the director of grants and programs, was retained and named interim executive director. Michele Carter will stay on as the group’s director of operations. 
“We plan to continue to operate at the fullest level we can,” Flagg said. 
Wyoming Humanities will be able to sustain several programs despite its reduced state. Its grant program will continue thanks to the Wyoming Legislature, which appropriates funding for its community culture and Spark grants, Flagg said. The Wyoming Center for the Book program also is expected to continue, she said, as is Native American programming that mostly takes place on the Wind River Indian Reservation and in Teton County. 
Flagg, Carter and their board members in the months ahead will have to pick up the pieces and figure out what’s next for Wyoming Humanities. A strategic plan just completed in 2024 will need to be revamped.
“The work of Wyoming Humanities is more important than ever,” Wyoming Humanities Board Interim Chair Stacy Stebner said in a statement. “In times of uncertainty, we need more, not less, connection. More dialogue. More stories.” 
The soon-departing executive director, Reese, said he’s pleased his board isn’t dissolving the organization and is instead recalibrating and planning for a future likely to include much less government funding. Wyoming Humanities is one of many cultural, historical and art-focused organizations facing financial conditions right now that are forcing them to “regroup,” he said. 
“It’s going to take some time to understand what the revenue situation will be with a reduction in property taxes, but I think museums and libraries are going to be in a challenging position,” Reese said. “There’s just a lot of headwinds.”

(Photo by Emma Murphy/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY – The Oklahoma House on Tuesday advanced a measure to lower the state’s income tax despite concerns it would have little impact on residents.
House Bill 2764 creates a process for ultimately eliminating the state’s income tax when revenues hit certain triggers.
The measure would initially reduce the state’s top income tax to 4.5% from 4.75%. 
It would also collapse the six income tax brackets into three.
Rep. Mark Lepak, R-Claremore, said the measure has safeguards to compensate for economic downturns. A tax cut would not occur if a revenue failure is declared, he said.
It would take nearly 20 years before the income tax could be eliminated, Lepak said.
Tax collections for the past 20 years on average grew at 4%, even when taxes were reduced, he said.
A 0.25% cut would cost state coffers about $340 million, Lepak said.
“While it will have a small amount of savings for those in poverty, it is not sufficient enough to really have an impact on their circumstances,” said Rep. Michelle McCane, D-Tulsa.
Rep. Ellen Pogemiller, D-Oklahoma City, questioned the timing of the cuts. Proposed federal changes to Medicaid could cost the state $841 million, she said. Congress is considering proposals that could require states to pick up more of the cost.
Cutting taxes is an effort to check a “political box” when there has been no substantial evidence that people want it, Pogemiller said.
“I think people would rather have daycare,” she said. “I think people would rather have health care. I think people would rather have good roads.”
Cutting the income tax by 0.25% equates to a Starbucks coffee a month for his constituents, said Rep. Andy Fugate, D-Oklahoma City.
“Maybe if you add it up over a year, it’ll let them buy a couple dozen eggs,” Fugate said.
The state expects to have $3.5 billion in surplus, said House Speaker Kyle Hilbert, R-Bristow.
“You reach a point as a state where you have so much surplus, you start to ask is it time we restore some of that back to the taxpayers to let them keep a little bit more of their hard earned money,” Hilbert said.
He said the bill was responsible.
It sets up a mechanism where an additional tax cut is only triggered if revenue projections are met plus more than what the tax cut would cost in terms of lost revenue to the state, Hilbert said.
Even if the triggers are met, the Legislature could still put a tax cut on hold, Hilbert said.
The measure passed by a vote of 74-19 and heads to the Senate for consideration.

(Kentucky Lantern photo by Abbey Cutrer)Families of victims of a mass shooting at a Louisville bank in 2023 may proceed with their lawsuit against a firearms dealer who sold the shooter a semi-automatic rifle and accessories, a judge in Louisville has ruled. 
Jefferson Circuit Judge Mitch Perry in a Monday order denied attempts by defendants to dismiss the case, writing that the case arose “from one of the worst acts of mass violence this community has ever experienced.” 
“The court is required to take the allegations in the complaint as true and view the record in the light most favorable to the plaintiffs. That is what this court has done here,” Perry wrote in his order. “As such, the litigation may continue in the ordinary course.” 
Six people died, including the shooter, and eight people were injured in April 2023 at Old National Bank in downtown Louisville. The shooter was an employee of the bank. One of the eight people injured, Louisville police officer Nickolas Wilt, was shot in the head while responding to the shooting. Wilt left a rehabilitation facility months later as he was recovering from his injury. 
Families of the victims brought a lawsuit in early 2024 against River City Firearms, the gun store that sold the shooter an AR-15, and against companies that manufactured accessories sold to the shooter at the store which included large-capacity magazines, a red-dot sight and a vertical grip for the rifle. 
Plaintiffs alleged employees of the firearms store should have noticed suspicious and erratic behavior of the shooter, who bought the weapon days before the shooting. The plaintiffs further alleged the manufacturers of the firearm accessories incentivize gun stores to upsell customers in a way “that places profits over safety.” 
Defendants had argued the lawsuit should have been dismissed because a federal law bars the plaintiffs claims from being heard. Congress has enacted the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act (PLCAA), which protects firearms manufacturers, dealers and distributors from being held liable for crimes committed with their products.
Perry disagreed with those arguments in his order. 
“The plaintiffs here have carefully crafted their complaint to avoid the protections of the PLCAA,” Perry wrote.

The bill does provide exceptions for situations where public safety is at risk, under a court order and if the police officer believes the child is a danger to themselves or others.
A provision that would have gradually prevented young people under the age of 14 from being arrested and tried for a crime was stripped from the bill prior to Senate passage. Children under the age of 14 instead would have been diverted to a Juvenile Review Board, a community-based program designed to keep young people who have committed crimes out of the court system.
Sen. Gary Winfield, D-New Haven, noted that the Judiciary Committee had been discussing raising the age of arrest for several years. 
In 2021, the legislature voted to raise the minimum age of arrest from 7 to 10. In 2023, lawmakers introduced two bills — one to raise the minimum age of arrest to 12, and one that would have raised it to 14. Neither made it to a public hearing.
Sen. John Kissel, R-Enfield, said on Tuesday that he strongly supports the prohibition of handcuffing young children, and believes the bill reflects “fundamental basic human rights and the dignity of young people.”
Kissel said the bill would give “wide latitude” for law enforcement officers to make a determination whether a young person is or is not a threat. 
Under the bill, law enforcement officers are not penalized if they place handcuffs on a young person when they mistakenly believe them to be older than they are. 
Kissel said the testimony at the bill’s public hearing clearly showed that the way police officers interact in communities directly affects whether a young person falls into a life of crime, and what law enforcement looks like to the community overall. He noted that for some young people, being arrested might be their first interaction with a police officer.
“If it’s all just automatically cuffing them and being rough and throwing them up against a wall and throwing them into the cruiser — that’s the first message. And it may send that person off on a course that’s not the best,” said Kissel.

Sen. Herron Gaston, D-Bridgeport, referred to the bill as “a step in the right direction to try and cure some of the societal ills around putting handcuffs on young people.”
Gaston said that because young people were still developing emotionally and cognitively, the “trauma” they experience while handcuffed will have a “lifelong impact on their psychological and mental well-being.”
He also noted the disproportionate number of Black people who are arrested and incarcerated and said that, for many years, he felt afraid to see a police officer walking nearby or driving behind him. He also said he felt the bill would help law enforcement better interact with those with autism or ADHD. 
“I think that [kids] should see our law enforcement profession similarly to how they see their teachers — you’re there to be guardian of the community, to help them to right wrongs when you see it, and to use other mitigating factors when appropriate to make sure that we are disciplining people appropriately,” he said.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/HOUSE-SESSION-0520-SR-3-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-20 18:08:39.188083

(Library of Congress photo)Thomas David Carruth, a former Monroe County district judge and deputy prosecutor, was sentenced Monday to two years in federal prison for making false statements to the FBI.
Carruth, 65, of Clarendon, was accused in 2022 of soliciting sex from the girlfriend of a defendant in his court. He had previously been admonished by the Arkansas Judicial Discipline and Disability Commission for unethical behavior over contact outside the courtroom with defendants appearing before him. The contact included allegations of soliciting sex from defendants, according to court documents.
  T. David Carruth, former Monroe County district judge
A federal grand jury indicted Carruth in January 2023 on three counts each of honest services wire fraud and interstate bribery and one count each of lying to the FBI and federal program bribery. A ninth count was dismissed ahead of his trial last year.
After a two-day trial in a federal court in Helena, a jury of six men and six women convicted Carruth on Aug. 30, 2024, only of making false statements to the FBI.
In a sentencing memorandum filed in April, federal prosecutors asked U.S. District Judge D. Price Marshall Jr. to upgrade the sentencing guidelines applicable to the crime from a maximum of six months to a maximum of 18 months in prison with a year of supervised release.
The memo cited Carruth’s “decades of abuse of authority, his ardent refusal to accept an ounce of responsibility for his misconduct, and his abhorrent behavior during trial” as reasons for a harsher sentence.
In the memo, Assistant U.S. attorneys Madison Mumma and Nicholas Cannon from the U.S. Department of Justice’s Criminal Division and Assistant U.S. Attorney Julie Peters with the Eastern District of Arkansas wrote that “throughout his career, Carruth has repeatedly abused [his positions of authority] for his own sexual gratification.”
An FBI search of Carruth’s electronic devices found surreptitiously-taken video of his nude stepdaughter and sexually graphic email exchanges with a court employee, according to the document.  
The memo also contains as exhibits the JDDC’s 2018 admonishment and a Feb. 11, 2025, letter to the court from Emily Abbott, executive director of the judicial disciplinary body.
“Before Mr. Carruth left the judiciary, I considered him to be one of the top five threats to the integrity of the Arkansas state-level judiciary,” Abbott wrote. She said his conviction was “a great relief” because it means he can no longer serve as a judge in Arkansas, but his inability to return to the judiciary or continue to practice law “is not an adequate punishment for misrepresentations to the FBI.”
“He is a predatory liar and has been for quite some time. My hope is that his sentence will match the magnitude of his actions,” Abbott wrote. 
Defense attorney Jeffrey Rosenzweig of Little Rock argued in separate memos that Carruth’s underlying conduct should not be considered in his sentencing and for probation.
In a court document, Marshall accepted the government’s position that Carruth’s behavior should be taken into consideration, and on Monday sentenced the former judge to 24 months with no required supervised release. He also allowed Carruth to remain free on bond and self-report to the Federal Bureau of Prisons on Aug. 22.",https://arkansasadvocate.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Jacob-Trieber-Federal-Bldg-Helena-1024x456.jpg,,,2025-05-20 18:08:39.188083

DemasMichigan lawmakers on the state House Election Integrity Committee approved a bill Tuesday aimed at confirming if longtime non-voters are still eligible to vote before elections.
Many people have lost trust in elections, Rep. Mike Hoadley (R-Au Gres) told lawmakers on the committee last week as he presented his bill, House Bill 4356, aimed to “clean up” the qualified voter file of eligible voters. Hoadley, whose 2022 House campaign was backed by President Donald Trump, remarked that after weeks of testimony from individuals, many of which question the integrity of the 2020 election where Trump lost to former President Joe Biden, that there are real doubts from Michiganders about the sanctity of electoral processes.
Speakers who have provided testimony to the committee over the first few weeks of the committee have included a Detroit-area pastor who delivered the benediction at President Donald Trump’s second inauguration in January and vocal critic of Michigan’s voter roll and co-founder of Check My Vote Phani Mantravadi.
House Bill 4356 would require the Michigan Secretary of State to send mailed notices to Michigan voters who have not voted in the last 10 years in order for them to confirm they’re still eligible voters who should remain on the qualified voter file.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Those notices would have to be sent to voters within 180 days after each general November election with information on what will happen if a response is not received. Parties interested in remaining on the voter file would have to complete and sign a card enclosed in the notice confirming their current address to their local clerk at least 15 days before the next election.
If the person does not submit the card or engage in a “voting-related activity” such as requesting an absentee voter application or updating their voter registration, they would have to confirm their current address at the polls before they could vote.
Upon receiving the card from a voter who would like to remain on the voter file, the local city or township clerk would compare the signature on the card to the one on file in the qualified voter file and if the signatures don’t match, the registration will be considered “challenged” and that person would have to provide proof of their residency and their voter certification when trying to vote.
The process of sending the notices and processing them will take time, Hoadley told the committee last week, but it’s “time well spent”.
The committee cleared the bill to be considered by the House as a whole with approval from all of the Republican members of the committee except for Rep. Joseph Fox (R-Fremont) who voted against the bill while the three Democratic members passed.
Oversight Committee Chair Jay DeBoyer (R-Clay Twp.), who previously served as the clerk of St. Clair County, overseeing elections, supported Hoadley’s sentiments last week, telling the committee that whether elections have been secure or not in the past, there are plenty of people who have completely lost confidence.

Free.,Giant tax and spending bill in U.S. House remains snagged by GOP disputes,"Jennifer Shutt, Ashley Murray",,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/giant-tax-and-spending-bill-us-house-remains-snagged-gop-disputes,,"WASHINGTON — The U.S. House Republicans who have yet to rally behind the party’s “big, beautiful bill” huddled in the speaker’s office Tuesday as different factions tried to hash out agreement on taxes, Medicaid and a few other outstanding issues.Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., told reporters before those meetings began there were “a number of loose ends to tie up” with deficit hawks and members from high-tax states, who are pressing to raise the state and local tax deduction, also known as SALT.“We got some hours ahead of us to work this out, and I'm very confident we will,” Johnson said. “I'm going to have a series of meetings that will begin right now in my office to try to tie up the final loose ends. This is a 1,100-page piece of legislation. We're down to a few provisions so we are very confident, very optimistic we can get this done and stay on our timetable.”Johnson hopes to pass the legislation this week, though he didn’t appear to have the votes as of Tuesday afternoon.Trump pays a House callThe smaller meetings followed a closed-door huddle between all the chamber’s GOP lawmakers and President Donald Trump earlier in the day that didn’t quite have the intended effect of immediately convincing holdouts to vote for the bill.Trump, however, appeared to declare victory before leaving the Capitol.“I think we have unbelievable unity. I think we’re going to get everything we want,” Trump said after the morning meeting. “And I think we’re going to have a great victory.”House Republicans have an extremely thin 220-213 majority, requiring nearly every GOP lawmaker to support the 1,116-page package in order for it to reach the Senate.Getting SALT-yThe reconciliation bill currently proposes lifting the SALT cap from $10,000 to $30,000 for married couples filing jointly, with a phase-down for those earning $400,000 or more, but that’s not enough for Republicans from states most impacted by the aspect of tax law.New York Republican Rep. Nick LaLota told reporters in the early afternoon that he would likely lose reelection if he can’t secure a better SALT agreement than what was on the table.“If I do a bad deal, I would expect my constituents to throw me out,” LaLota said. “If I did a deal at $30,000, my own mother wouldn't vote for me.”LaLota said Republicans leaders should prioritize a deal that benefits swing voters to avoid the party losing centrist members and possibly the House majority in the 2026 midterms.“If we win that one issue, they'll have a much easier November of 2026. And thus we'll be able to keep the House and do other fiscally responsible things for the next couple of cycles here, if we get this one issue right,” LaLota said. “Conversely, you get this issue wrong — you vote for a bad bill and you keep the cap low — those folks are getting thrown out of office, we lose the majority, and then we have an open border, then we have an impeached president, and then we have all the other things that America voted against.”LaLota said later Tuesday, after GOP leaders proposed different SALT cap numbers, that there was still “no accepted deal, yet the parties are talking a little more with an understanding of each other's position.”""Leadership understands better what our pain threshold is,” LaLota said. “We clearly rejected the $30,000 number that's in the Ways and Means bill.” He declined to say if the SALT Caucus was prepping a counteroffer for leadership, but said that staff were conducting “some research on some of the mixes of income caps and what SALT cap there would be and how much that would be valued at relative to the entire $4 trillion package.”‘Bad faith negotiation’Rep. Mike Lawler, a staunch supporter of raising the SALT cap for his constituents north of New York City, would not comment to reporters outside the speaker's office about a specific dollar amount but said there's an “improved offer” on the table.“We’re waiting on more details. We’ll have more to say later,” Lawler said.Speaking to Fox News in the hallway, he said, “I'm not going to sacrifice my constituents and throw them under the bus in a bad faith negotiation, which is what this has been by leadership and Jason Smith,” he said referring to the chair of the House Committee on Ways and Means.“We need to come to an agreement. We need to provide real and lasting tax relief, and that's what I'm fighting for, for my constituents. I respect the president … but I'll respectfully disagree,” Lawler said.Trump urged House Republicans Tuesday morning that raising the SALT cap benefits Democratic governors.Conservatives still unhappyComplicating negotiations, some far-right House Republicans remain opposed to the bill, saying it does not go far enough.Rep. Chip Roy of Texas, who did not support the bill during a committee vote Sunday night, told States Newsroom Tuesday afternoon that his “concerns and problems still exist.”Roy argues the massive reconciliation deal does not reduce deficit spending enough, particularly with respect to Medicaid and clean energy tax credits.When asked whether lawmakers were approaching an agreement, Roy said “Not sure. We're still talking. We've had literally like five meetings today already.”Thune predictionsThe House passing the package this week would only be one of many steps in the long, winding process.Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., said during a press conference Tuesday afternoon, just after Johnson spoke during a closed-door lunch, that changes to the package are expected in the upper chamber.Thune said one of the major questions for GOP senators is whether the legislation holds “sufficient spending reforms to get us on a more sustainable fiscal path.”“I think most of our members are in favor of a lot of the tax policy and particularly those portions of the tax policy that are stimulative, that are pro-growth, that will create greater growth in the economy,” Thune said. “But when it comes to the spending side of the equation: This is a unique moment in time and in history where we have the House and the Senate and the White House, and an opportunity to do something meaningful about government spending.""Thune said that GOP senators would likely make “tweaks” to the tax provisions once the House sends over a package, especially around how long certain tax policy lasts.“They have cliffs and some shorter-term timeframes when it comes to some of the tax policies,” Thune said. “We believe that permanence is the way to create economic certainty and thereby attract and incentive capital investment in this country that creates those good-paying jobs, and gets our economy growing and expanding, and generates more government revenue.”",,,,2025-05-20 18:08:39.188083

(Photo: Galen Bacharier/NC Newsline)The state House is on track to pass its proposed budget that includes substantial raises for beginning teachers while cutting thousands of vacant jobs and delaying future tax cuts.
The House votes this week are a prelude to the coming negotiations between House and Senate budget writers who must reconcile the differences between two distinctly different spending proposals before sending a compromise plan to Gov. Josh Stein.
“We continue to give that tax relief while also making sure we’re investing in the state’s most important asset, which we believe are its people,” said House Speaker Destin Hall (R-Caldwell) during a press conference Tuesday morning.
The House budget includes a 2.5% raise for state employees, with some of the money for raises coming from the elimination of thousands of jobs. Though the vast majority of the job cuts are to positions that are currently vacant, the total also includes about 62 currently filled positions, lawmakers said.
In addition to the 2.5%, the House budget allows state agencies and universities to use money saved by cutting vacant jobs for raises and retention bonuses.
The State Employee Association of North Carolina urged its members to tell legislators to reject that plan.
“Employees are stressed and burned out from trying to fill the gaps, ensuring citizens receive the services they pay for with their tax dollars,” SEANC posted on Facebook. “Robbing Peter to pay Paul is no way to run a state government and no way to treat dedicated career employees.”
Hall said the cut vacancies would free up money for agencies to use as needed, including to amp up pay for current workers. He said the decision to eliminate the jobs “doesn’t mean we can’t come back later and add those positions” back.
Contrary to the proposal for most other agencies, the House budget adds more than 60 driver’s license examiner jobs at the DMV and provides money to open new DMV offices in Fuquay-Varina, and in Brunswick and Cabarrus counties.
Legislators had said they would wait for an auditor’s report on the DMV before they put more money into the agency. But they have been inundated with complaints about long lines at DMV offices and unavailable appointments.
“All the members get a lot of questions about DMV,” said Rep. Donny Lambeth (R-Forsyth), a lead budget writer. “We needed to respond to the needs that we’re hearing all across the state to get the wait times down.”
Nevertheless, the House Appropriations Committee rejected a proposed amendment from Rep. Mary Belk (D-Mecklenburg) for 10 more DMV self-service kiosks at a cost of $43,000, which would have doubled their number.
The House budget raises beginning teacher base pay from $41,000 to $48,000 in 2025-26 and to $50,000 the following year. The increases would rank the state first in the Southeast in beginning teacher pay. Average teacher salaries would increase 8.7%.
The House budget also restores salary supplements for teachers who hold advanced degrees.
When they get to the negotiating table, lawmakers in the House and Senate will have to talk through their different perceptions of revenue growth and related tax cuts.
The state’s 2023 budget built in up to three automatic personal income tax cuts in tax years 2027 to 2034 that depend on the state meeting revenue targets. The House budget changes those targets, meaning the state would need to bring in more money to trigger the next cut. That plan could delay future cuts.
“When we ran the numbers, Mitch and I had true concerns that we needed to adjust those numbers,” said Rep. Julia Howard (R-Davie). She and Rep. Mitchell Setzer (R-Catawba) are senior co-chairs of the House Finance Committee. “The first trigger is okay. The second trigger could create some problems, and that’s why we adjusted it so that second trigger is most likely not going to click in,” Howard said.
Population increases and inflation “caused enough concern” to make the change, she said.
Nonpartisan economists in the state budget office and the legislature have projected state revenue to drop in 2026-2027, as planned tax cuts take effect. Republicans have focused on cutting taxes since they took control of the legislature in 2011. In addition to incorporating graduated cuts in the personal income tax rate, Republicans are phasing out the corporate income tax. Corporations will pay no income tax after the 2029 tax year.
The Senate budget proposal added more revenue-triggered tax cuts. Senate leader Phil Berger (R-Rockingham) told reporters last month that he did not believe the forecast and anticipated revenue will continue to grow.
House Republicans were less rosy in their assessment of the state’s financial future. “We’d need about an hour” to discuss the challenges they face, Lambeth said Tuesday morning. Chief among those challenges is uncertainty out of Washington.

“We made a strategic decision — let’s just assume that we’re going to continue business as usual,” Lambeth said. “When something comes down the road, we may have to reconvene and deal with those changes.”
In his budget request, Gov. Josh Stein, a Democrat, froze the tax rate and urged Republicans to do the same. The governor has repeatedly warned of a coming fiscal cliff.
House Democratic leader Robert Reives (D-Chatham) said Tuesday that the plan was a step in the right direction, getting “closer to what Gov. Stein proposed” on teacher pay and revenue concerns. But he criticized “cuts to public safety, public services and negative impacts on clean air and water efforts,” and the continued funding of school vouchers.
“Democrats will be offering amendments to improve our public schools, invest in health care for working families and protect public safety and clean air and water,” Reives said in a statement.
In the Appropriations Committee, Republicans took care to protect the voucher reserve fund, rejecting Democrats’ requests to shift relatively small amounts of money to support a program for high school students who aspire to teach, or for a pilot on sustainable teaching practices within the New Teacher Support program.
Democrats condemn corporate tax cuts, call for health and education funding
House Democrats took aim at the budget plan in a Tuesday afternoon press conference for spurning increases to health and education funding in favor of corporate tax cuts.
Putting forward their own proposal, entitled “Make Corporations Pay What They Owe,” the representatives focused their criticism on Republicans’ plan to lower the corporate income tax to zero by 2030, which they said will cause the state to lose about $2 billion annually. They also criticized the elimination of thousands of positions under the House budget plan, which they said will make North Carolinians less safe, healthy, and educated.

Rep. Marcia Morey (D-Durham) condemned the plan for corporate cuts as a “house of cards” that “cannot be sustained.”
“This shortfall is not because our state spends too much taxpayer dollars on handouts to the poor or to our public schools or to immigrants — it’s because we have eroded revenue and put corporate interests over people,” Morey said.
Rep. Maria Cervania (D-Wake) focused her criticisms of the budget on health policy, calling out the House’s plan to eliminate 50% of funding for community-based mental health crisis services. “We cannot build a healthy economy by gutting the health of our people,” she said.
State employees also gave remarks during the press conference, including Charles Owens, a health care technician at Cherry Hospital, a psychiatric facility in Goldsboro. He singled out increases to state employee health care costs, including higher co-pays, premiums, and deductibles, despite health benefits being a key incentive to join the state workforce.

“We could deal with some of the wage problem, but now you increase our health care costs to the point where employees can’t afford to get sick,” Owens said. “It’s time to stop taking care of corporations and giving them tax cuts and start taking care of the people that take care of this state.”
Owens added that cutting positions at facilities like his, which house “the most vulnerable, exploited, and some of the most dangerous people in this state,” endanger the lives of state employees.
“It’s a safety issue. We’re understaffed, and as we were saying, 300, 400 positions — it may [not] sound like a lot to most people, spread across the number of hospitals, but for me and my staff, that’s one less person watching your back, that’s one patient that could sneak up and smack you in the back of the head with no recourse,” he said.
Rep. Laura Budd (D-Mecklenburg) said Republicans’ lack of funding for public education runs counter to their stated aim of making North Carolina more attractive destination for corporate investment. She pointed out that the quality of local school systems is a key factor businesses rely on to determine the suitability of a location, in order to attract a skilled workforce willing to raise their families in the community.
“How do you attract qualified workers to move from other states to North Carolina if the school system where you’re going to put that entity isn’t very good?” Budd asked. “Put your money where your mouth is, pay for what you need, not for what you want.”
Nicole Price, associate executive director of the North Carolina Association of Educators, said it is critical for lawmakers to halt the cuts to corporate taxes and instead “reinvest in the future of our state.” She cited a petition that has garnered more than 1,800 signatures calling for the protection of public schools, health services, and other vital programs.
“Now is the time to invest in students’ future by investing in our schools,” Price said. “We can prepare every child regardless of gender, race, ability, family income, to reach their potential, but only if we truly commit to investing in our students.”
House Democrats registered some amusement that a few of their past proposals that had been derided when they submitted them had now made their way into the budget bill. Rep. Deb Butler (D-New Hanover) noted that she had proposed reducing the triggers for income tax cuts in March, citing the state’s revenue shortfalls, a change House Republicans have now adopted as their own. Likewise, Cervania had previously proposed a back-to-school tax holiday that’s now in the budget bill.
“Let’s be clear: there’s still a structural deficit. The triggers may have been adjusted, but the damage of revenue erosion continues,” Butler said. “We’re still asking our state to do more with less, and we’re doing it with a straight face. Meanwhile, the federal government has been quietly shifting costs to the states.”
Butler and Morey also expressed dissatisfaction with a lack of transparency and bipartisan engagement in the budget-writing process. Butler noted that she only gained access to the bill at 3:30 p.m. Monday when she was due to discuss it in committee at 8:30 a.m. the following morning. And Morey noted that the first item lawmakers received in their subcommittees was “an entire page” of restrictions barring amendments that would increase overall funding, allocate money to Helene relief, and make numerous other changes.
“They set the lines and we can’t draw out of the box,” Morey said.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_1812-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-20 18:08:39.188083
,Connecticut Mirror,2025-05-20 21:44:38+00:00,CT Mirror,"With deadline approaching, CT lawmakers’ energy bill comes into focus",John Moritz,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/05/20/ct-electric-rates-bill/,Latest draft of the bill includes measures to offer immediate relief and longer-term reforms to lower CT's electricity costs.,"When Senate Democrats rolled out their signature bill addressing Connecticut’s energy affordability crisis more than four months ago, the text intentionally left a lot to be desired. The legislation, Senate Bill 4, began as just a single sentence promising to “provide for improved service and reduced costs for electricity ratepayers in the state.”
Since then, proponents have been working — mostly behind the scenes — with Gov. Ned Lamont’s administration on a broader package to provide immediate relief to utility customers as well as longer-term reforms to lower Connecticut’s nagging electric costs.
With just over two weeks to go before lawmakers must wrap their work June 4, the details of that plan are coming into focus.
The latest draft of the bill, topping 150 pages and 45 sections, is expected to be released as soon as Tuesday evening, according to state Sen. Norm Needleman, D- Essex, who has been heavily involved in the negotiations as co-chair of the legislature’s Energy and Technology Committee.
“Not close in certain buckets, but close in some other buckets,” was how Needleman described the draft, which is expected to be revised further in the coming days and weeks. “I mean, it’s comprehensive.”
According to Needleman, the new bill includes a plan for the state borrow up to $260 million a year in order pay for bill arrearages, EV charging infrastructure and energy efficiency programs that are currently covered by utility customers through what’s known as the public benefits charge. As a result, the cost of those programs would be removed from customers’ bills and paid back using taxpayer dollars.
In addition, he said, the legislation would allow utilities to securitize their expenses from storm damage and switch to smart meter systems — essentially spreading those costs out over time and at lower, state-backed interest rates.
Needleman said his “very rough estimate” is that the bill could save a typical utility customer around 5% off their current monthly bill. That would come on top of recent reductions in the public benefits charge and anticipated lower supply costs starting this summer.
While that amount is well below the demands of Republicans who sought to shift most or all of the $1-billion-a-year cost of the public benefits charge off of customers’ bills, Democrats argue it is a more realistic approach given the state’s fiscal constraints.
“I think we have pretty good agreement on the energy bill,” Gov. Ned Lamont said this week when asked about negotiations with lawmakers. “I think we’re going to be shifting some of the costs from ratepayers over to bondholders. You know, they’re all pretty much the same people. So that’ll reduce the public benefits a little bit.”
On Monday, the Finance, Revenue and Bonding Committee voted along party lines to advance a slimmer version of S.B. 4, even as lawmakers on both sides conceded that the measure remained a work in progress.
The co-chair of that committee, state Sen. John Fonfara, D-Hartford, has been another leading voice among Democrats on energy policy, with many members pointing to his years of experience gained as Needleman’s predecessor on the Energy Committee. (The senator has also attracted scrutiny over his ownership of several energy-related companies, conflicts with regulators and efforts to secure his own appointment to a seat on the Public Utilities Regulatory Authority.)
Earlier this year, Fonfara released his own proposal promising to immediately lower electricity bills by up to 20% through state borrowing that would cover nearly all of the public benefits charge. In addition, he proposed the creation of a new quasi-public authority tasked with directing energy procurement, in hopes of saving customers more over the long term.
That effort caused tensions between Democrats to spill briefly into the open. 
During one particularly contentious hearing last month, Needleman insinuated that portions of Fonfara’s bill had been drafted by the utilities, and he accused the senator of trying make an end run around the Energy and Technology Committee. Eventually, the two chairmen agreed to sit down and begin crafting a compromise that incorporated aspects of both their bills, as well as some Republican proposals.
“There is a good faith effort to meld those concepts as best we can,” Fonfara said Monday, before adding “there is a lot of work yet to be done.” 
As a practical matter, S.B. 4 will become the vehicle for whatever plan the lawmakers come up with to move through both the Senate and House.
Republicans who voted against the bill in committee on Monday said they did so because they felt the existing, incomplete proposal didn’t go far enough to address voters’ dissatisfaction with electricity prices. The ranking Republican on the committee, state Rep. Joe Polletta, R-Watertown, acknowledged the ongoing negotiations at the time and said he was “cautiously optimistic” those conversations would bear fruit.
“We are butting up against the end of session, so everyone is kind of at the edge of their seat hoping and praying for a bill, a comprehensive bill, that will ultimately lower bills here in the state of Connecticut,” Polletta said, adding that it would be a “shame and massive failure,” for the legislature to take no significant action on the issue.
Even before drafters revealed a more complete version of the bill Thursday, some of their ideas had come under scrutiny from people keeping track of the bill’s progress.
For example, a proposal endorsed by Fonfara and other legislative leaders to adopt mandatory time-of-use electric rates that charge customers more for power during hours of peak demand was opposed by the American Association of Retired Persons, whose leadership encouraged members to write legislators in opposition to the concept.
“The problem we have is that the poor, the elderly, the disabled, disproportionately need to use electricity at peak times,” said John Erlingheuser, a lobbyist for the group. “You’re an elderly person who’s disabled or uses oxygen or medical devices — those don’t make a difference between day and night, right?”
Needleman said that he was sympathetic to the group’s concerns, and that the final version of the bill would include an opt-out mechanism allowing customers to revert to single, constant rate. Erlingheuser said he was still concerned that solution could prove confusing to some customers.
Lori Brown, the executive director of the Connecticut League of Conservation Voters, said she feared the latest version of the bill would include language paring back Connecticut’s incentives for rooftop solar panels, causing significant disruption for the industry and the state’s clean energy goals. Needleman responded that those aspects of the bill were still being worked on as of Tuesday afternoon.
Environmental advocates have also raised concerns that borrowing the money necessary to pay for recurring programs like energy efficiency could doom their existence once the money runs out. 
“I’ve not heard of anything positive in the bill yet,” said Charles Rothenberger, a climate and energy attorney with Save the Sound. 
In addition to Fonfara and Needleman, those involved in the negotiations around S.B. 4 have included the House chair of Energy and Technology, state Rep. Jonathan Steinberg, D-Westport, Lamont’s energy advisor Jonathan Dach, as well as representatives of PURA, the Department of Energy and Environmental Protection and the Office of Consumer Counsel.
The state’s two investor-owned electric utilities, Eversource and United Illuminating, were not directly included the discussions, though lawmakers said they would solicit feedback from the companies after releasing the latest draft of their bill.
“We had a lot of bright people in the room” Steinberg said adding “there were also disagreements, not all of us were on the same page.”
One of those disagreements had to do with the procurement process for power supply, which is currently handled by utilities. In his earlier bill, Fonfara proposed creating an entirely new government entity, the Connecticut Energy Procurement Authority, to take over that process, similar to a system currently used in Illinois.
While that idea drew initial support from utilities like Eversource — who earn no profits off the sale of power under Connecticut’s deregulated energy market — Lamont and other Democrats have been more skeptical about the costs and bureaucratic challenges associated with the proposal. Both Needleman and Steinberg said this week that while the bill will include some language offering the utilities additional flexibility in how they purchase power, it will not put the state in charge of that process.
The ranking Republican on the Energy and Technology Committee, state Sen. Ryan Fazio, R-Greenwich, said he expected that some portions of S.B. 4 will come from ideas originally raised by his GOP colleagues, though he declined to share more details until a draft of the bill is released publicly. 
“I feel that there’s a good opportunity to come up with something that we can all get on board with,” Fazio said. “But there’s still issues that need to be bridged where there’s not agreement.”
Democrats also hope to gather at least some bipartisan support for the measure in order to avoid a lengthy filibuster that could derail their agenda in the final days of the session.
When asked Monday whether rank-and-file lawmakers would have enough time to digest the final draft of the bill before voting on it, Fonfara noted that work on the state’s massive, $26 billion annual budget routinely lasts until the final days of the session.
“I think there’s plenty of time,” he said.

(Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — A growing number of high-dollar executive hires and “questionable spending” on a Super Bowl commercial and Narcan machines have contributed to the financial disarray at the state’s mental health department, the state auditor reported Tuesday.
The audit of the Oklahoma Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services also reported that leadership at the agency is unable to understand and explain some complex issues within the agency and that employees were forced to sign nondisclosure agreements and discouraged from cooperating with investigations.
State Auditor and Inspector Cindy Byrd said the report’s preliminary findings, released Tuesday, revealed “some glaring financial and systemic issues” at a “massive state agency” that has a budget of over $750 million. 
“It needs a director with executive managerial experience and a mastery of basic budgetary and compliance skills,” she said in a statement.

The audit comes amid reports of financial shortfalls, canceled or cut contracts and other disarray at the department. The Oklahoma State Auditor and Inspector’s Office expects to release a more detailed audit at a later date.
Although Gov. Kevin Stitt requested the audit in March, on Tuesday his spokesperson said the report didn’t fulfill his request, is “politically charged” and wastes taxpayer dollars because it duplicates work already completed. 
The audit found that since January 2024, when Stitt named Allie Friesen commissioner, her agency has hired 38 people at a salary exceeding $100,000 and awarded 376 employees pay raises greater than 10%. Only 17 of new hires were medical while the rest were executive hires. The agency’s payroll was over $150 million in budget year 2024, according to the audit. 
The audit urged the agency to reexamine its recent executive hires and review terminations to ensure they weren’t retaliatory. 
The state’s transition to a Medicaid managed care health care insurance system has created issues paying providers which also impacted the agency’s budget. The agency also hasn’t communicated effectively that there have been changes in the federal government’s Medicaid reimbursement rates since the end of the COVID-19 pandemic, the audit found. 
The transition to managed care “caused a lag in both billing and payments after implementation,” the audit found, creating issues with properly paying claims. Payments have been made to the wrong parties and sent to wrong locations. 
The payment issues affect the department’s cash flow, the report found.
The audit also questioned the decision to spend state funds on a regional Super Bowl commercial promoting 988, a suicide hotline.
The mental health department’s existing budget request, made by Friesen to lawmakers at the beginning of the year, was impacted by the governor’s request for executive branch agencies to submit flat budget requests and “difficulty explaining complex and misunderstood needs related to topics like Medicaid growth and pended payments, which resulted in a lack of urgency around these issues,” according to the audit.
The mental health department also began the current budget year with a deficit as $9.4 million from its current budget was used to pay last year’s debts, according to the audit. But the audit also flagged “questionable” spending and said there’s increasing pressure on employees from agency leadership with required nondisclosure agreements.

The pressure on employees also included “employing armed guards, locking down the administrative floor, and even threatening employees in meetings,” according to the report. One lawmaker on the select committee previously asked agency leadership about a report that someone had threatened to go “full cop mode” on staff that hadn’t signed an NDA, but leadership said they were not aware of this instance. 
While testifying to a select committee of state lawmakers, Friesen admitted that some employees were asked to sign NDAs, but that it was an optional practice. 
But the report from the state auditor’s office revealed agency staff told investigators they were “required” to sign the NDAs. Staff also reported to investigators issues with leadership not attending meetings, signing documents, having to learn about “internal events” through the media, and frequently changing the supervisor structure so they don’t know who to report to. 
Friesen did not directly comment on the findings, but agency spokesperson Maria Chaverri said the department is reviewing the state auditor’s report.
“We’ve created a large table of external diverse experts to help us bring light and end years of corruption,” she said in a statement. “… We look forward to the additional contributions from third party investigators and financial auditors in the coming months.”
Friesen’s agency has come under fire and is the subject of a handful of probes. A certified public accountant appointed by Stitt most recently reported a nearly $30 million shortfall for the current budget year, and lawmakers are currently working to finalize the agency’s budget for the upcoming fiscal year. 
Byrd said the state agency needs $28.7 million in emergency funding to make it through the current budget year.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLESome providers have reported a lack of reimbursements for services provided to indigent populations, and Byrd’s report found over $87.6 million of those. These payments are historically reimbursed with funds still available at the end of the budget year, but not at 100%. 
Stitt has continued to express his support for Friesen and previously said she is “shining a light” on bureaucracy and agency mismanagement. The commissioner has previously blamed her predecessors for many of the issues at the state agency. 
“This is disappointing,” he said in a statement Tuesday. “On behalf of the Oklahoma taxpayers, I asked for a financial audit of the financial management of the last five years, not an exploration into whether or not Cindy Byrd approves of the culture of the department. This reeks of politics. Oklahomans deserve an audit done in good faith and a report that gives them the answers they deserve.”
Byrd said the urgency of Stitt’s audit request forced her office to put other investigations on the “backburner,” including one of the Oklahoma Turnpike Authority, but plans to resume them immediately. 
In addition to the report from the state auditor, reports from the Legislative Office of Fiscal Oversight, a select investigative committee of lawmakers and David Greenwell, an accountant appointed by Stitt, have publicly shared their own findings. None of their numbers for the agency’s deficit have been the same.

Daisy Berbeco, D-Winooski. Questions and comments spanned a gamut of issues faced by Winooski residents, from immigration enforcement to federal budget cuts and tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump’s administration.More than 60 people attended, with several parents, students and residents sharing their thoughts and questioning state leaders on matters ranging from schools and health care to property tax and flood response.Attendees and panelists roundly criticized H.454, an education reform bill first introduced by Republican Gov. Phil Scott and the Agency of Education that aims to overhaul Vermont’s education funding and governance model over several years.“It’s a really hard time right now because we are taking on a massive reform that will likely result in our students not getting what they need,” said Sen. Martine Gulick, D-Chittenden Central, one of the panelists.The reform proposal “is being used as a political tool to achieve specific agendas” to benefit the interests of the people with the most means to maintain power, said panelist and Winooski School District Superintendent Wilmer Chavarria, who oversees one of Vermont’s most diverse school districts.READ MORE
He was not consulted on the matter and neither was the state Office of Racial Equity, he said. Panelists expressed frustration that big decisions seem to be made based on gut feelings rather than data.“Nobody, except for our delegation – two senators out of three – have asked me what this will do for Winooski,” Chavarria said. “But Winooski has done the modeling and none of the scenarios they’re looking at is going to do anything good for the taxes in Winooski. If anything, there’s a potential for substantial increases, and a substantial decrease in the quality of education our students will be receiving.”Gulick agreed, adding that the bill the Senate is considering “doesn’t address cost drivers” like health care, inflation or the deferred maintenance of school buildings.Mea Ree Jan, a senior at Winooski High, asks a question at a community forum in the  school on Monday, May 19. Photo by Auditi Guha/VTDigger“If we do save money, it’s just because we are slashing, we are cutting and not in a thoughtful way. So that is problematic,” she said.That led residents to raise concerns about escalating property taxes in a city with many immigrants and young families.While it may be too early to predict the bill’s impacts, State Treasurer and Winooski resident Mike Pieciak, another panelist, said the overarching goal of the bill is to provide “a really exceptional education at a price that Vermonters can afford.”That was the hope when a previous education reform law, Act 60, was enacted, he said, but the state did not adequately track “clear, articulable, measurable goals for what they were trying to achieve from a financial savings standpoint.” Pieciak said he hoped the state could learn from that as it considers new legislation.Tul Niroula, a multilingual liaison for the Winooski school district, speaks to state leaders at a community forum on Monday, May 19. Photo by Auditi Guha/VTDiggerEnacted in 1997, Act 60 significantly changed how public education is funded in Vermont with the intent to allow towns to pay equal tax rates for equal spending, regardless of local property wealth.A Yale University student who last year analyzed the effect of Vermont’s education finance system to see if school district mergers, like the ones prompted by the passage of Act 46 in 2015, saved money. Her analysis did not find any significant savings in spending per pupil between the merged and the non-merged districts.George Cross, who formerly served as superintendent of schools in Winooski and in the Vermont House, recalled participating in “the Act 60 revolution.” The fight then was not just between communities but also between the rich and the poor, he said, a divide he said the Legislature is not addressing in the current bill.“The Legislature does not represent the people of Vermont and that’s a big problem,” he said. “It might have represented the people of Vermont 100 years ago, but it doesn’t represent them today.”That divide was evident throughout the public commentary offered during the two-and-a-half-hour forum where many referenced unequal access that marginalized community members face. Some residents spoke of the anxiety immigrants in the city are feeling five months into an administration that often illegally targets them.A community organizer, who spoke on behalf of Latin American families in the city, said undocumented workers who contribute to the economy are particularly scared and being subject to scams promising legal services.“They just don’t know who to trust,” said Corali Cotrina. “The reality is, there is a deep disconnection between legislators, representatives, State House and the grassroots, especially the Black, Brown community, who are undocumented, who are the current invisible slaves and are being treated like animals by ICE.”Nepalese and Bhutanese residents talked about refugee deportations they’ve heard about in the United States and the anxiety and fear that have gripped their communities.“And what are the processes for those families? What resources can support us?” asked Tika Timsina, a tax preparer for refugees.Attorney General Charity Clark, also on the panel, said a scam is a crime and her office has a consumer assistance program that can help residents without requiring them to share their background information. She further assured residents she will continue to take legal action against the Trump administration when it violates the Constitution. Clark said her office is creating a document to alert immigrants of their rights this week, particularly if U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents come knocking.President Trump’s approach to immigration “has been offensive, appalling and un-American,” she said. “We are this wonderful melting pot of immigrants. We believe in freedom, and our Constitution is fundamental, and we have no kings.”Chavarria said the Winooski School District has a 30-member rapid response team that includes a home-visiting program and interpreters that can be used in an emergency.Panelists directed concerned speakers to resources available in the state, such as Vermont Legal Aid, Vermont Law School clinic, Vermont Asylum Assistance Project and pro bono and low-cost lawyer options available through the Vermont Bar Association.Berbeco, who moderated the panel, reminded attendees that Winooski has adopted a sanctuary schools policy, meaning students and families are protected from the impact of federal immigration enforcement actions there, reflecting that “schools should be places of trust, not enforcement.”Pieciak said immigrants have always been part of the American story and immigration is an economic issue and also a moral one. “The future of Vermont, if it’s going to be successful, is going to require a lot of immigrant labor,” he said.Mea Ree Jan, a senior at Winooski High School, asked panelists how they keep their decisions honest and free of bias when considering bills that have the potential to negatively impact communities of color.Berbeco said she uses an impact assessment questionnaire created by the state racial equity office to confront biases in committee; Gulick said she tries to listen to her heart and her moral compass to imagine how constituents might react.Read the story on VTDigger here:  At Winooski forum, education reform, immigration and taxes on residents’ minds.",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Winooski-ed-reform-1-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-05-20 18:08:39.188083

It isn’t working in California,"Wendy Fry, Mohamed Al Elew and Sergio Olmos",,,,,https://calmatters.org/justice/2025/05/expedited-removal-pomona-home-depot/,Unauthorized immigrants can be deported quickly if they're detained near the border. The Trump administration wants to expand expedited removal inland.,"In summary
Unauthorized immigrants can be deported quickly if they’re detained near the border. The Trump administration wants to expand expedited removal inland.


The Trump administration is backing off a push to rapidly deport three Guatemalan day laborers who were detained 200 miles north of the Mexico border after a federal judge blocked it from fast-tracking their removal. 
The administration wanted to deport the men under a new policy that it adapted from one that previously was used nearly exclusively at the border, and only for immigrants who recently arrived in the U.S. Advocates said the case had the potential to signal whether the Trump administration could carry out its promised mass, rapid deportations across California
Judge Dana Sabraw issued a temporary restraining order Friday, prohibiting the government from removing the workers from the Southern District of California after their attorneys argued the agents stopped them without reasonable suspicion, in violation of their Fourth Amendment rights. The men were detained by Border Patrol agents in Pomona.
“There’s no dispute that the Fourth Amendment applies to people within the interior of the United States, is there?” Sabraw asked the attorney for the federal government, who argued the court didn’t have jurisdiction over the workers’ claims and who characterized the stops as consensual.  
On Monday, the administration backed down.  
Assistant U.S. Attorney Erin Dimbleby said during a court hearing that the men were no longer being processed for rapid removal without a hearing before an immigration judge. She added she was seeking assurances from federal immigration authorities that they would not be placed back in the process called expedited removal. 
“No reason was given by the government, but we would guess that the government decided it did not want to produce the arresting Border Patrol agents to testify in court under oath on Thursday to justify the legality of their actions,” said Niels Frenzen, an attorney with the USC Gould School of Law Immigration Clinic who filed a habeas corpus petition on behalf of the workers. Habeas corpus is a constitutional right protecting people from unlawful imprisonment by the government. 
The workers have not yet been released from custody, but they will now have a chance to appear before an immigration judge in court, giving them the opportunity to challenge their return to Guatemala and to argue that their due process rights were violated.  
This case is similar to a lawsuit filed earlier this year by the American Civil Liberties Union on behalf of the United Farm Workers about sweeping immigration raids that rattled Kern County in January. In response to the ACLU’s claims that those raids violated farmworkers’ constitutional rights, the Department of Homeland Security said in court papers that it would retrain the Border Patrol agents on how to follow the Fourth Amendment, which governs police searches and arrests. 
In that case, the judge barred the El Centro Border Patrol from carrying out warrantless immigration sweeps in areas governed by the federal courts’ Eastern District of California, which spans the Central Valley from Redding to Bakersfield. The district does not include Pomona, where Border Patrol agents arrested the day laborers in a raid on a Home Depot parking lot on April 22. 
Detained while looking for work
The agents conducted the Home Depot arrests without warrants, court records show. At least nine people total were taken into custody in the parking lot sweep, the records state.
Jesus Domingo Ros, one of the men detained in Pomona, said in an interview that he was standing on a street corner near the Home Depot when agents appeared from all sides, grabbed him, and threw him to the ground, leaving him with bruises on his shoulder and knee. 
“I panicked,” he said in Spanish, describing the instant he realized he was in custody of U.S. immigration authorities. “Just with everything you’re seeing on the news right now, I really panicked because we didn’t know what was going to happen.” He spoke to CalMatters last month at the Imperial Regional Detention Facility in Calexico, where he is now being held.

The 38-year-old Guatemalan said he crossed into the United States without federal authorization nearly three years ago and has been working in construction in Pomona ever since. He said he was looking for work when agents surrounded him. “I’ve never been arrested. I’ve never been detained. This is my first experience,” he said. 
Before transferring him to the custody of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, he said the El Centro Border Patrol agents held him and others in freezing cold cells for days while interrogating them about who they might know. The agents hung enlarged mug shots along the walls of their cells, demanding to know the names of the people in the mug shots and whether the workers knew them. “When we said we didn’t know them, they argued with us,” he said.
According to U.S. Customs and Border Protection, agents arrested 10 people that day in Pomona and placed them into removal proceedings. No other agencies were involved, said Michael Scappechio, a spokesman for U.S. Customs and Border Protection. Advocates are adamant that more than 20 people were initially taken into custody, based on piecing together the accounts of different witnesses about what happened. 
Federal officials defended their actions, saying agents were initially targeting a single individual with an active arrest warrant — a barber who they arrested at gunpoint. During the operation, nine other people were also taken into custody. Some of those detained had prior charges, including child abuse, assault with a deadly weapon, immigration violations, and DUI, said Hilton Beckham, the assistant commissioner for the Border Patrol’s office of public affairs.
At least two other Guatemalans — Yoni Jacinto Garcia and Edwin Juarez-Cobon — detained during the same immigration sweep outside the Home Depot in Pomona were facing the rapid removal process, court records show. 
“All three men have been living in the United States for more than two years,” said Alexis Teodoro, Worker Rights Director at the Pomona Economic Opportunity Center. 
Domingo Ros said he fled violence and poverty in his hometown, located directly on the border of Guatemala and Chiapas, Mexico. His brother is a legal permanent resident in Pomona, having successfully won an asylum case in the United States, he said.
“Looking for work is not a crime. Waiting for a job opportunity outside a Home Depot isn’t a threat to anyone,” said Teodoro. 
Advocates said federal immigration authorities last week told Domingo Ros that he’d be back in Guatemala within days. 
That’s because the Trump administration was trying to apply a new policy to his case that expands the powers of immigration officers to fast-track removals of people arrested in the interior of the country.
Trump’s push to speed deportations
The process, known as expedited removal, allows immigration officers to remove certain non-citizens from the United States without a hearing before an immigration judge, according to the American Immigration Council. Historically, the process for bypassing immigration courts has been reserved primarily for areas close to the border and for migrants who arrived by sea or crossed the border within the prior two weeks.  
The Trump administration released a new expedited removal policy on Jan. 21, allowing immigration officers to apply expedited removals across the entire United States, instead of only near the border and for people who had been in the country longer than two weeks.
“The effect of this change will be to enhance national security and public safety — while reducing government costs — by facilitating prompt immigration determinations,” says the notice of the policy change published online.
Advocates say it’s part of a broader effort to boost deportations by chipping away at the limited due process afforded to immigrants in the United States. The Trump administration has also cancelled grants that funded legal representation for children and for families separated during his first term. It fired dozens of immigration judges in Massachusetts, California, and Louisiana, and removed people to remote locations outside of the United States without a hearing, including to a notorious El Salvadoran high-security prison. 
Trump and his supporters argue that using expedited removal will help alleviate the long-overburdened and backlogged immigration court system, which has more than 3.5 million cases pending. The swelling backlog has tripled since 2020, meaning detained migrants are waiting months and even years for their hearings.
“We have thousands of people that are ready to go out, and you can’t have a trial for all of these people,” Trump said last month from the Oval Office.

The policy places the burden on the person detained to prove that they’ve been in the country continuously for more than two years “to the satisfaction of an immigration officer.” In the past, it’s led to U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents being mistakenly deported.  
“It isn’t reasonable to expect someone to carry around 24 months’ worth of utility bills on their person at all times. There must be an opportunity, a reasonable opportunity, to provide evidence that they have been in the U.S. for longer than two years, if that is the case,” said Christian Penichet-Paul, the assistant vice president of policy & advocacy, at the National Immigration Forum, an immigrant advocacy non-profit in Washington D.C. 
Similar efforts to speed up the process for deportations during Trump’s first administration were challenged in federal court. Initially, a district court granted a preliminary injunction in 2019 blocking the expansion of expedited removal, but this was overturned by the D.C. Circuit, allowing Homeland Security to expand its use of expedited removal while the lawsuit continued. 
The legal battle blocked the policy from going into effect until late 2020. The Biden administration then rescinded it in early 2021. 
The ACLU is suing again in D.C. District court to try to stop the expanded use of expedited removal. The government has filed a motion to dismiss the suit, claiming the court does not have jurisdiction. 
“We think it’s unconstitutional. People who have been in the country clearly have due process rights, and the entire expedited removal process gives people less process than you do when you get a traffic ticket,” said Anand Balakrishnan, senior staff attorney at the ACLU’s Immigrants’ Rights Project.
The use of expedited removal to bypass the court system and deport people was rising before Trump was re-elected president. In fiscal year 2013, the numbers peaked when Barack Obama was president, at 193,032 people detained at the border who went through the expedited removal process. That represented 44% of the total number of removals that year.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/050625-PomonaRaidProtest-TS-CM-06.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-05-20 18:08:39.188083

IDALS will host an informative webinar on the handbook Wednesday, May 28, to give an overview of the tool, which provides agency-specific, and species-specific, guidelines. 
Iowa Secretary of Agriculture Mike Naig said the department’s animal health staff developed the handbook so that partners across the state have the tools to respond with IDALS to animal welfare complaints. 
“The Iowa Department of Agriculture and Land Stewardship is responsible for keeping animals in our state safe and healthy, and it’s a responsibility we take very seriously,” Naig said in a statement.

Mindi Callison, of the animal advocacy group Bailing Out Benji, called the guidebook “a phenomenal resource.” 
“This is the most comprehensive handbook out there outside of the USDA,” Callison said.
Callison said while the U.S. Department of Agriculture has a thick handbook, it’s geared towards licensees and inspectors. Callison said the plain language of IDALS handbook will make it easier for law enforcement to step in without having to look through and interpret Iowa code.
Officials who might respond to an animal welfare call have different roles. The USDA and the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, or APHIS, control the licensing, inspection and outreach for any groups transporting, researching, exhibiting or dealing animals. The agency works to ensure these individuals meet standards set by the Animal Welfare Act.
Local law enforcement, including animal control groups, and county attorneys may also be involved in animal welfare cases to respond to calls, determine the course of action and build animal abuse cases when applicable. 
The handbook outlines how law enforcement should respond to and investigate an animal welfare complaint, which Callison said is an “immediate resource” that will allow authorities to respond to calls sooner.
“We’ve seen cases where law enforcement agencies were hesitant to step in because they didn’t know how to handle the case … But this guidebook really lays it out for them, and it kind of shows them who to contact in different cases for support,” Callison said. 
The handbook advises local authorities to plan in advance, by identifying facilities that could house animals in the event they need to be relocated, and building relationships with local partners and veterinarians. 
It also encourages communities to build a response plan in the event of animal welfare complaints, to “ensure a collaborative approach to safeguarding animal welfare.” 
Callison said she believes these community connections can also “really help” facilities to “do better” before it comes to a complaint and animal welfare investigation. 
The handbook also serves as a quick reference guide for Iowa code related to animal welfare, including statutes on livestock, the mistreatment of animals, animals in commercial establishments and rescuing animals. 
Don McDowell, communications director for IDALS, said “a lot of work” went into developing the handbook. 
“We identified a significant need for this resource in working with and communicating with local law enforcement partners over the past few years – both larger urban counties and smaller rural counties,” McDowell said in an email.
He said the guide emphasizes the importance of advanced planning for law enforcement officials, but is also meant to help “county attorneys document the situation and build a strong animal neglect case.” 
For several years, Iowa has placed high on the list of states with the highest number of puppy mill violations. 
Part of the issue, which Callison’s organization Bailing Out Benji has highlighted, is that federally licensed facilities do not have to follow the same standards as state licensed facilities. Callison said the handbook helps to clarify the role each agency plays, regardless of where a facility is licensed, which she said “will provide some clarity.” 
Legislators proposed a fix to this “loophole” as Callison called it, but the bill did not advance before the close of Iowa’s legislative session. 
Bailing Out Benji is based in Iowa but works to expose animal cruelty situations across the country. Callison said she has not seen similar handbooks in other states but hopes the IDALS move will inspire other states to create similar guides.
“This is a great move by the department,” Callison said. “I’m shocked that our state has the most comprehensive handbook out there. I’m excited to see how it changes what’s going on in our state.” 
Those interested in attending the webinar on the handbook can register online.

Larry Scott (R-Hobbs) speaks during a committee hearing during the 2025 legislative session. (Photo by Austin Fisher / Source NM)As a panel of state lawmakers on Tuesday planned out their work for the rest of the year, their hopes to improve health outcomes for New Mexicans were overshadowed by the looming threat of federal cuts to health insurance coverage.
At the Legislative Health and Human Services Committee’s first meeting since the most recent legislative session, Rep. Larry Scott (R-Hobbs) told the committee lawmakers need to be ready if the U.S. government turns administration of Medicaid over to the states.
“I don’t think any of those changes should try to take us by surprise,” Scott said.
State and federal officials say the GOP budget bill making its way through the U.S. Congress could not only reduce federal spending on Medicaid but also the oil and gas revenue that the state government could use to cover the costs.
In the worst-case scenario, the proposal would translate to cuts of more than $1.1 billion for New Mexico’s Medicaid program, according to one of the Legislature’s top budget advisers.
The worries over Medicaid cuts come as New Mexico is in the middle of restructuring its entire behavioral health care treatment system, with the state’s Medicaid program expected to create a group of licensing boards to help streamline mental health providers’ credentialing.
During public comment at Tuesday’s meeting, Rick Madden, chair of government affairs at the New Mexico Medical Society, told the committee that his organization strongly supports the committee’s focus on the potentially extreme effects of funding cuts and work requirements on local patients and communities.
Sen. Liz Stefanics (D-Cerrillos) said she wants the health panel to receive updates from the Federal Funding Stabilization Subcommittee, which legislative leaders created late last month in order to track all federal money coming into New Mexico.
“Many of us, of course, are very concerned about it, and it’s not just Medicaid that we need to be concerned about,” Stefanics said.
Rep. Marianna Anaya (D-Albuquerque) suggested the panel have a joint meeting with the Legislative Finance Committee for any health care-related cuts coming from the federal government, not limited to Medicaid.
“When we’re talking about funding and affordability, knowing that we’re going to have to plug holes, what realistically does the picture look like for us?” Anaya asked.
During the legislative session, New Mexico created a new Medicaid Trust Fund that aims to generate enough in interest to pay for at least some of what the federal government could cut in Medicaid spending. Rep. Eleanor Chavez (D-Albuquerque) wants the committee to review what’s happening with that money.
The committee’s next meeting is scheduled for June 25 through June 27. Lawmakers also suggested where they will hold their meetings, however, a complete schedule was not available as of Tuesday.

(Photo by Jacquelyn Jimenez Romero/Washington State Standard)The parental “bill of rights” overhaul, one of the most divisive bills approved during this year’s Washington state legislative session, was signed by Gov. Bob Ferguson on Tuesday. 
The legislation stems from Initiative 2081, a citizen initiative lawmakers approved last year that granted certain rights to the parents of public school students under age 18. It allowed parents to easily access school materials, their child’s medical records, and promised immediate notification if a child is involved in a crime. 
Democrats said they would write a “clean-up bill” if the initiative clashed with other state and federal laws. But Republicans said the law signed Monday goes much further and undermines the initiative, which hundreds of thousands of voters signed on in support of in 2023. 
The law contains an emergency clause. This will allow it to take effect immediately, and it eliminates the possibility of a referendum that would give voters a chance to weigh in on the law. Democratic lawmakers have said the emergency clause would help provide schools more clarity right away. Republicans criticize it as a ploy to block any referendum effort.
Meanwhile, some opponents are already saying they will seek alternative paths to a repeal.
Along with parental rights, students’ rights are included, such as the right to receive an education in a safe and supportive learning environment, free of harassment and bullying. The law also makes clear that students are free to exercise constitutionally protected rights at school.
Rep. Monica Stonier, D-Vancouver, the lead sponsor of House Bill 1296, said students deserve to have a diverse curriculum that reflects the true history and experiences of people, to be able to experience a school system without discrimination, and that student rights can coexist with parental rights. 
Ferguson echoed that view during the bill signing. “The top priority for our schools must be to ensure a safe learning environment where every student has a chance to thrive,” he said.
Parts of the earlier parents’ rights initiative, such as allowing parents to review school curriculum and textbooks, and requiring school districts to “immediately” notify parents if a student is a victim of abuse, sexual misconduct, or assault, were kept in the rewrite. 
A significant change from the initiative was the removal of access to medical records. Democrats have said separating educational and medical records was necessary to prevent confusion. For example, a 1985 law gives children 13 years or older the right to mental health treatment without parental consent.
Republican critics of the new legislation argue that the definition of mental health care has expanded over the past 40 years to include gender-affirming care, psychiatric medications and other health services that parents should know about.
New parental rights would also be added, including ones for parents to be notified of their child’s unexcused absences and to engage in efforts to reduce those absences and to request information about special education programs and determine eligibility. 
Throughout the session, debates related to the legislation flared over gender inclusivity and diversity, equity and inclusion. Republicans introduced several unsuccessful amendments to prevent transgender girls from participating in girls’ sports and entering girls’ locker rooms.  
The law also adds ethnicity, homelessness, immigration or citizenship status, and neurodivergence as protected classes and clarifies protections for sexual orientation, gender expression and gender identity. 
A new complaint process is established as well. This directs the Office of Superintendent of Public Instruction to investigate complaints if schools fail to comply with state laws in areas like civil rights, nondiscrimination, harassment, and the physical restraint or isolation of students. 
In cases where districts are found to be willfully disobeying state law, they could see 20% of their state funds withheld and redirected to resolving the issues identified by the state. This option is intended as a last resort. Even so, Republicans view it as too punitive and claim it takes away local control.
Let’s Go Washington, the group behind Initiative 2081, plans to mount a repeal effort against the new law, according to Hallie Balch, a spokesperson for the group. Balch did not specify whether this might involve a ballot initiative or a new initiative to the Legislature. 
Unlike a referendum, both of those options would be open to the group. But they would require the collection of nearly 400,000 signatures. The deadline to file initiatives, including required signatures, for the 2025 general election ballot is July 3. Initiatives to the Legislature, for next year’s session, can be filed until Jan. 2, 2026.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_2712-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-05-20 18:08:39.188083

(Photo by Shahrzad Rasekh/CT Mirror)HARTFORD, Conn. — The House of Representatives on Tuesday overwhelmingly approved a proposal that would grant Connecticut State Police troopers a 2.5% general wage hike and a step increase next fiscal year.
The proposal, which is also expected to win approval in the Senate, passed 134-12 in the Democratic-controlled House, enjoying bipartisan support despite objections from GOP leaders.
Legislators from both parties have lamented a state police force that’s now about 25% smaller than the 1,200-plus troopers who served Connecticut prior to 2010.
Democrats said the raises, which would affect an estimated 885 troopers, are essential to recruitment efforts.
But both House Minority Leader Vincent J. Candelora, R-North Branford, and Rep. Tammy Nuccio, R-Tolland, argued against the raises.
“We’re facing a collision course with a rather ugly truth” — that state employee compensation is becoming unsustainable, said Nuccio, who is the ranking House Republican on the Appropriations Committee.
Nearly all unionized workers have received a 2.5% general wage hike and a step, which typically adds another 2 percentage points to the raise, each fiscal year since 2021-22.
Gov. Ned Lamont’s administration, which negotiated the wage deal with the troopers, also is bargaining new contracts with all other major state employee unions. And it would be difficult for state officials to convince labor arbiters that Connecticut could not afford effective 4.5% annual increases for other state employees if the legislature approves one for troopers.
The House GOP proposed a $54.4 billion biennial budget earlier this month that counts on more than $300 million in savings over the next two fiscal years by freezing pay for all workers.
Candelora said troopers earn an average of $116,000 per year in base pay, but compensation rises to $175,000 per year once overtime is considered.
“There’s no amount of pay that’s going to be able to recruit more officers,” he said.
The solution, Candelora added, involves criminal justice reforms that give officers greater legal protection when performing searches or pulling over motorists on the highway.
“What they really need is our support,” he said. “They need real criminal justice reform.”
Despite Nuccio and Candelora’s arguments, 35 of the 47 Republicans who cast ballots in Tuesday’s joined 99 Democrats in supporting the raises.
Andrew Matthews, executive director of the state police union and a former president, noted before a legislative panel earlier this month that union concessions packages have weakened retirement benefits for troopers.
Before 2011, a trooper was eligible for a hazardous duty pension based on the three highest annual salaries of a minimum 20 years of service.
Now Connecticut requires 25 years of service that offers a hybrid pension/401(k) benefit calculated on average wages over the entire 25-year span.
But Matthews also said workers deserve the raises in the deal and more.
“It’s a dangerous job,” he said at the time, adding that 26 troopers have died in the line of duty and that post-traumatic stress injuries are “a real thing” many troopers face.
The legislature’s nonpartisan Office of Fiscal Analysis estimated the agreement would cost state government nearly $4.1 million next fiscal year. Municipalities that participate in the resident state trooper program would collectively incur an added cost of $301,675 next fiscal year, nonpartisan analysts estimated.

(Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — A Lancaster County district judge is reviewing whether to dismiss a lawsuit alleging that Nebraska’s voter-approved medical cannabis laws violate federal law after in-person arguments Tuesday.
This is the second medical cannabis case to reach District Judge Susan Strong, who in late November ruled against a preelection lawsuit challenging that the ballot measures shouldn’t have been placed on the ballot because of allegedly fraudulent notarizations. Strong rejected those arguments. In the latest case, Strong must first decide whether to let the federal preemption case proceed based on whether a longtime marijuana opponent, John Kuehn, has the necessary “standing” to sue.

That’s the legal term of art required for cases to proceed, meaning that Kuehn, a former state senator and former member of the State Board of Health, must show injury as a result of the new medical cannabis laws legalizing and regulating the drug.
The ballot measures overwhelmingly passed in November, with 71% approval for legalization and 67% approval for a regulatory law. Tuesday’s arguments came on the same day state lawmakers are considering Legislative Bill 677, a separate effort to create a clearer regulatory scheme around medical cannabis to assist in the program’s implementation.
‘He couldn’t wait’
Many of the arguments in court Tuesday mirrored legal briefs filed earlier. Largely, they argue that Kuehn is not the right party to challenge the measures under “taxpayer standing,” or that, as a taxpayer, he should get to challenge “illegal” taxpayer spending.
All 11 defendants named in the case from Kuehn have filed to dismiss the case. Attorney Jason Grams, for the three members of the new Nebraska Medical Cannabis Commission that voters’ regulatory law established, told Strong no taxpayer funds had been spent by Jan. 10, when Kuehn amended his lawsuit to include the commissioners.
“He couldn’t wait to take the time to meet the demand requirement for taxpayer standing,” Grams said.

Grams represented the Nebraskans for Medical Marijuana campaign in 2020 against a lawsuit brought by Lancaster County Sheriff Terry Wagner. The Nebraska Supreme Court ruled against the campaign and removed the measure from the 2020 ballot.
A ‘recycled argument’
Attorney Daniel Gutman, who is now representing the three sponsors of the 2024 cannabis ballot measures, said the “ship has long sailed” for election-related challenges against his clients. Gutman continues to defend the sponsors as Kuehn and the Attorney General’s Office appeal the earlier notarization case, also from Kuehn, to the Nebraska Supreme Court. 
Gutman said the sponsors didn’t agree to be “sued in perpetuity” for any challenge from Kuehn.
Of the dozens of states that have legalized medical cannabis, Gutman and Grams said no court has tossed the laws.
Gutman said states are meant to be “labs of democracy” and that the federal government and Congress do not preempt the Nebraska laws. He also noted a provision in annual federal spending bills prohibiting the U.S. Department of Justice from spending federal money to prosecute people following state medical cannabis laws.
“We would literally be here all day if I cited all the cases rejecting this recycled argument,” said Gutman.

Deputy Solicitor General Zach Pohlman, defending Gov. Jim Pillen, Secretary of State Bob Evnen, Treasurer Tom Briese and two other state defendants in the case, summed up morning arguments that someone should challenge the laws, but Pohlman said it shouldn’t be Kuehn.
“Just because that statute is on the books doesn’t mean that Kuehn can run around the normal standing requirements,” Pohlman said.
Instead, the AG’s staff has said Nebraska Attorney General Mike Hilgers and his staff should be the ones to challenge the law, which they’ve pledged to do if and when the Medical Cannabis Commission issues any dispensary licenses under the new laws.
‘Snip this off at the bud’
Attorney Eddie Greim of Kansas City, representing Kuehn, said the challenge should proceed in part because public records requests indicate that staff for the Liquor Control Commission, which the regulatory law voters passed and tied closely to the Nebraska Medical Cannabis Commission, have discussed how to implement the laws and estimated possible costs.
“If we can snip this off at the bud, and we can enjoin the NMCC from doing anything,” Greim said, “then the harms will never flow down to the other defendants.”

Some of the records received include fiscal or lobbying requests related to pending legislation just down the street from the courthouse at the Nebraska State Capitol, which Greim said show regulatory steps being taken. Grams said the records are “utterly irrelevant” to the lawsuit.
Grams also filed affidavits from each of the three commissioners on the Nebraska Medical Cannabis Commission stating that the commissioners had taken no regulatory action as of Jan. 10, when the commissioners were added to the lawsuit.
Greim objected to that evidence, saying he needed to be able to “look behind the veil” and challenge the commissioners’ statements.
Strong said she would take the evidence challenges and the motions to dismiss from all defendants under advisement and rule at a future date.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-05-20 21:15:32+00:00,CT Mirror,CT bill to require ‘just cause’ when firing teachers passes Senate,Jessika Harkay,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/05/20/ct-teacher-terminations-bill/,Proponents said the bill would protect teachers in ‘very politicized times.’ Opponents said it infringes on local board of education control.,"A piece of legislation that would change the teacher termination process in Connecticut passed out of the Senate Tuesday afternoon on a 27-8 vote.
Senate Bill 1371 would now require a valid reason, or a “showing of just cause,” for why a teacher would be facing termination. It also removed language in current state statute that allows a board of education subcommittee to uphold the termination and would instead now require local boards to hire an impartial hearing officer to make the final decision.
Democratic lawmakers said Tuesday that the proposed bill would better protect educators from political bias.
“Currently, we are in the position where we have teachers who could be terminated by a decision of board of education, and in these very politicized times, that might not be neutral, and impartial, and a fair process,” said Sen. Julie Kushner, D-Danbury, who championed the legislation. 
Sen. Bob Duff, D-Norwalk, added that teachers have more commonly come “under assault” across the country both online and from parents.
“Because of social media, people are able to organize and talk and then pounce on teachers,” Duff said on the Senate floor. “There’s a lot of pressure to get rid of them if they don’t agree and it’s not because they’re not doing the job that they’re supposed to do … it’s because of the fact that maybe somebody doesn’t like their political views or that maybe a teacher put up a certain flag that is offensive to somebody.
“When we see teachers getting attacked for various views, or perceived views that they may have, we need to offer them a little more protection,” Duff continued. “We need to say that we’re standing with our teachers because of the work that they have done for our children decade upon decade.”
The bill was supported by the entire Democratic caucus. Senate Republicans broadly rejected the legislation, except for Sen. John Kissel, R-Enfield, who said the measure was “appropriate, right, fair and a part of what I would consider due process.”
Other Republicans, including Sen. Rob Sampson, R-Wolcott, argued that the bill was overstepping on local control.
“If this becomes law, you will lose a say that you have right now as a citizen in the great state of Connecticut. You will lose the ability to have a say over whether a teacher is fired or not. You lose that right,” Sampson said Tuesday. “I would much rather have communities having their own boards of education that are responsible to their constituents … making the decisions.”
Sampson raised two amendments Tuesday. One measure proposed keeping the new just cause standard, but eliminating the second part of the bill that said termination decisions would be determined and finalized by an impartial hearing officer. Another amendment called for a task force to study school discipline.
“We have other problems in education. The quality of education is at stake and that is what we ought to be doing here today — is finding ways to actually hold institutions of education more accountable to providing a quality education and not protecting what could be teachers that are failing at their job,” Sampson said, adding that though he has “tremendous respect for this noble profession,” he was fearful the legislation would protect “bad teachers.”
Both amendments failed.
“The focus on this bill is much less about teachers and protecting teachers and protecting good teachers from being terminated and it’s more about advancing the cause of organized labor,” Sampson said.
“My personal frustration is that I’m going to be on the record at the end of the discussion voting against this bill, and really, it’s not fair because I’m somebody who supports teachers … but I think this is bad policy and deprives the local community of the control of making sure of the status of teachers in their district and handing it over to a binding arbitrator,” Sampson added.
S.B. 1371 didn’t define what “just cause” was, but an Office of Legislative Research bill analysis said “‘just cause’ is a concept developed in case law that involves a termination for employee misconduct that is so serious that it (1) violates an essential condition of employment, (2) breaches the trust or faith inherent in the working relationship, or (3) is fundamentally or directly inconsistent with the employee’s obligations to the employer.”
Kushner said Tuesday that “every unionized employee for the state and municipality have this right guaranteed,” and that it was “long overdue” for the protection to be extended to educators.
At the bill’s public hearing in February, it received overwhelming support from educators across the state.
“Increasingly, decisions to terminate a teacher are driven by politics, not justice. The result is good teachers leaving the classroom and new and aspiring educators seeking different career paths. SB 1371 would take politics out of discipline and reduce the intensifying climate of political fear in schools,” Connecticut Education Association Union President Kate Dias wrote in public testimony.
The only written opposition for the bill came from the commissioner of the state Department of Education, who echoed some of Sampson’s concerns.
“Currently, the arbitrator makes factual findings — which are binding on the school board — but only recommends appropriate discipline, which the board can accept or reject. This change would give the arbitrator the unilateral power to determine discipline, and the school board would be bound by it,” wrote Education Commissioner Charlene Russell-Tucker. “This would remove the right of local and regional school boards to make the fundamental determination as to the qualifications of individuals who teach in their systems and interact with their students.”
The bill next faces a vote in the state House of Representatives.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/HOUSE-SESSION-0520-SR-7-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-20 18:08:39.188083

(Photo by Lauren McCauley/ Maine Morning Star)The Maine Legislature is poised to undo a decision it made last year to join a pact that presents an eventual path to do away with the Electoral College. 
The Maine House of Representatives passed legislation, LD 252, on Tuesday that would repeal the decision, but did so after some Democratic members first attempted to buck a committee recommendation and reject it. 
While the bill is sponsored solely by Republicans, it has been backed by some Democrats in committee and floor votes. The bill now heads to the Senate. 
In 2024, the Legislature adopted something called the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact, which Gov. Janet Mills allowed to become law without her signature. 
States that are part of the compact pledge their Electoral College votes to the presidential candidate with the most overall votes across the country, but it would only take effect once states with a total of 270 Electoral College votes have joined. Including Maine, 17 states and the District of Columbia have ratified the agreement, giving the compact a total of 209 electoral votes. 
During floor speeches, lawmakers disagreed on which system would give more of a voice to Mainers.
“We were the first state in the nation to split our Electoral College votes by congressional district — a system that reflects our political diversity and values every voice, whether rural or urban,” said Rep. Barbara Bagshaw (R-Windham), the bill sponsor. 
Maine and Nebraska are the only states that split their electoral votes across candidates. Other states use a winner-take-all system where the candidate with the majority of the state’s popular vote gets all of the state’s electoral votes.
“By joining the National Popular Vote Compact,” Bagshaw said, “we have undermined that.”
However, Rep. Arthur Bell (D-Yarmouth), who sponsored the legislation to enter the pact last year, argued the Electoral College system results in candidates only paying attention to voters in swing states, which Maine is not.
“To me, it’s as simple as every vote should be equal,” Bell said. 
Rep. Sean Faircloth (D-Bangor) said he is sympathetic to people who he hears say, “My vote doesn’t matter,” given that twice in this century a candidate who has lost the popular vote has become president. 
Others pointed to the founding intent behind the Electoral College when explaining their opposition. 
Rep. Adam Lee (D-Auburn), an attorney, pointed to Federalist Paper 68 when making the point that the Electoral College is based on the idea that regular citizens can’t be trusted to elect the president. 
When the Electoral College was conceived, its design was intended to advance the political power of slave states, said Rep. Ambureen Rana (D-Bangor). Enslaved people were counted toward the electoral population of the states in which they were enslaved despite not having the right to vote.
Subject matter aside, several Republicans took issue with procedure. Rep. Laura Supica (D-Bangor) made a motion to accept the minority report of the Veteran and Legal Affairs Committee, which would have preserved the agreement, though that motion failed 71-76 and was preceded by a half hour of floor debate.
“This is just poking the eye [of] the committee,” said Rep. Shelley Rudnicki (R-Fairfield). 
In April, the majority of the Veterans and Legal Affairs Committee voted in favor of LD 252, with eight legislators in support of the measure and five opposed, a breakdown that did not fall along party lines.
While five of those in favor were Republicans — Reps. David Boyer, Quentin Chapman, Ann Fredericks, Benjamin Hymes and Sen. Jeff Timberlake — two are Democrats — Sens. Jill Duson and Craig Hickman — and one is unenrolled — Rep. Sharon Frost. However, the committee members who voted against its passage were all Democrats: Reps. Sean Faircloth, Anne Graham, Marc Malon, Parnell Terry, and Supica.
The committee voted against legislation, LD 1356 sponsored by Lee, that seeks to change Maine’s method of allocating electoral votes from the current district split to a winner-take-all system — but only if Nebraska also adopts winner-take-all. Lee’s bill has yet to be heard on the floor.
In April, the Nebraska Legislature killed a bill that sought to make this switch, after Republicans failed to secure enough votes to overcome a four-hour filibuster.

At some elementary schools in north and central Jackson, nearly all the students passed the third-grade reading test on the first try. But the results show that a majority of third graders at schools in south Jackson failed the test, raising the possibility that those students will be retained this fall. They have multiple chances to test again before that happens.
Students at Barack H. Obama Elementary and McWillie Elementary had the highest scores, with more than 95% passing, while students at Key Elementary, Shirley Elementary and Wilkins Elementary had the lowest, with less than 40% of students passing at those three schools. 
There are likely many reasons for this disparity, but local educators say the low reading scores reflect that it can be hard to be a kid in south Jackson right now. 
Learning to read is all the more challenging for kids whose basic needs are not being met. 
“The less resources you have at home, the heavier that burden is going to be,” said Pam Franklin, the program director at Operation Shoestring.
The nonprofit is one of several groups in the city that are working to get Jackson’s third graders reading at the level they were just 10 years ago, when nearly 85% of the city’s public schoolers passed the third grade reading test. 
But without nutritional meals, clean clothes, playtime, sleep and a supportive parent who reads to them, kids will struggle to be friendly with their peers or respectful to teachers, let alone concentrate on vocabulary or phonics. 
“Before I walk in the door, I’m bringing all of that with me,” Franklin said. 




These challenges exacerbate the urgency educators face in teaching them to read by the end of third grade. It’s not just because students must, with some exceptions, pass the third-grade reading test to advance to the fourth grade. The failure to learn to read by this age has been linked to poor outcomes later in life, such as dropping out of school, earning low wages or delinquency. 
That’s partly because knowing how to read is a crucial life skill, said Greer Proctor-Dickson, the executive director of the Mississippi Reading Clinic. 
“We’re not conscious of all the reading that we do,” Proctor-Dickson said. “Street signs, bills, legal documents, menus.” 
For instance, students need to learn how to read in order to solve math problems that are posed in paragraph form. 
“Now I’m getting a double strike,” Franklin said. 
As Jackson loses population, fewer families are sending their children to JPS, leaving the district with less funding.
Ironically, that’s exactly what educators say Jackson’s kids need: More resources and more support. 
During the school year, the Mississippi Reading Clinic hosts classes at local middle schools to work with students with poor reading skills. 
Proctor-Dickson recalled a story of a JPS teacher the clinic was coaching who noticed that something was off with a boy in her class. When she asked him what was wrong, he said he was long overdue for a haircut and embarrassed to be seen in public. 
So the teacher called a barber who volunteered to come to the school and cut the boy’s hair that day.

(Screenshot from White House livestream)Speaking from the Oval Office, U.S. Sen. Jim Banks touted the inclusion of Indiana companies in a multi-billion missile shield project known as the “Golden Dome.” It is currently part of the massive reconciliation bill working its way through Congress.
“Your legacy with Space Force, Mr. President, is already big, but the Golden Dome is going to be an even bigger legacy for our country,” Banks told President Donald Trump in a live briefing on Tuesday.
“And Indiana is going to help you make it,” Banks continued, citing Fort Wayne’s L3Harris as a source for space satellites and the Naval Surface Warfare Center in Crane as a supporter.
L3Harris recently underwent a $125-million upgrade to support the Golden Dome project and is expected to be the “most advanced payload production center supporting the project,” per WANE.

“Hoosiers are very proud of that; we’re proud of you,” concluded Banks, who was introduced by Trump as a “great senator.”
The Golden Dome missile defense shield, introduced by Trump in January, will cost a projected $175 billion, but Republicans opted to include a $25 billion down payment in a contentious defense reconciliation bill.
The project is inspired by Israel’s land-based Iron Dome, which protects the country from missiles and rockets shot by nearby enemies. Trump said the dome would be complete by the end of his term in January 2029, naming Alaska, Florida, Georgia and Indiana as states that would benefit from the project.
Canada will also be a partner, Trump added. General Michael A. Guetlein, the vice chief of space operations, will lead the project.
Details about the bidding process are still scarce, as reported by Reuters, though he said all components would be made in America.
SpaceX, Palantir and Anduril have emerged as potential frontrunners to build the project. Elon Musk, founder of SpaceX, has proposed a governmental “subscription service” as part of the Golden Dome project, a concern for some critics.

(Photo credit Mitch Perry/Florida Phoenix.)Two Florida newspapers are reporting there is an open investigation into the Hope Florida Foundation, First Lady Casey DeSantis’ signature social-services program, which came under legislative scrutiny this year over its finances.
The House Health Care Budget Subcommittee, chaired by Pensacola Republican Alex Andrade, held a series of meetings this year investigating the transfer to the foundation of $10 million from a $67 million Medicaid overpayment settlement with the state. The nonprofit organization steered the funds to two groups that wound up directing a combined $8.5 million to Keep Florida Clean, a political action committee created to oppose Amendment 3, the failed 2024 ballot measure that would have legalized marijuana.
The anti-marijuana campaign was of particular importance to Gov. Ron DeSantis, and was chaired by James Uthmeier, then DeSantis’ chief of staff, now the governor’s appointee as state attorney general.
According to a report published Tuesday by the joint Capitol bureau for the The Tampa Bay Times and Miami Herald, the papers requested documents that State’s Attorney General Jack Campbell — who investigates and prosecutes alleged crimes in Franklin, Gadsden, Jefferson, Leon (the seat of Florida state government), Liberty, and Wakulla counties — may have received from Andrade regarding the Hope Florida Foundation. Andrade had suggested the financial arrangements might have been illegal.
The state attorney’s office declined to release any information because it was “part of an open, on-going investigation,” the newspapers reported.
The Florida Phoenix asked Campbell on Tuesday whether his office was investigating the Hope Florida Foundation. He did not respond.  The Phoenix also put in a request for any documents related to the Hope Florida Foundation that Campbell’s office may have received from Andrade.
“The information you request is part of an open, on-going investigation,” public records administrator Lori Abbey replied. ” I cannot verify what information is contained or referenced within the investigation. Also, I cannot verify how any information has been provided to this office. “
Meanwhile, the governor and First Lady held a lengthy press conference in Tampa Tuesday, touting the Hope Florida program and its success.
When asked about the reported investigation Tuesday, DeSantis seemed surprised and said, “Based on what?” Then he defended the program, championed by his wife.
“Well, I mean, I can tell you, this has been a very successful program,” DeSantis said. “Everything that’s been thrown at it is pure politics.”

“I believe in this program deeply, and I stand by it 100%,” he added.
Hope Florida uses state employee “navigators” to help connect people who rely on Medicaid and supplemental nutrition programs with the private sector and faith-based communities in an effort to help them gain financial independence.

His food had just arrived when the leader of the Senate Education Committee called. Tinney’s confirmation to the Oklahoma State Board of Education, which had been mired in uncertainty, was going to move forward.
Tinney, a Norman attorney, said he was unsure before that point whether the committee would consider his confirmation at all. His home senator had declined to support his nomination by Gov. Kevin Stitt to the board, which typically is a death knell for a nominee’s chances at Senate confirmation. 
He learned in that Friday phone call that the Senate’s top lawmaker, President Pro Tem Lonnie Paxton, R-Tuttle, would step in to carry his nomination. With Paxton’s support, the Senate committee voted 10-2 on Tuesday in favor of confirming Tinney to the state board through April 2027. He must pass a vote by the full Senate for it to be final.
“I’m just glad this is done,” Tinney told reporters after the vote. “You guys probably know the hurdles that my nomination overcame. I don’t want to rehash all that. I’m just thankful that things got worked out and thankful I got the opportunity to be heard. Hopefully I’ll be confirmed by the Senate, and then I will get on with doing my job.”
The committee on Tuesday also advanced the confirmation of two other state Board of Education nominees, Ryan Deatherage, of Kingfisher, and Becky Carson, of Edmond. It did so for board member Chris Van Denhende, of Tulsa, last week.

Paxton said Sen. Lisa Standridge, R-Norman, asked him to take over Tinney’s nomination. Standridge, who did not return multiple requests for comment from Oklahoma Voice, told other media outlets she objected to supporting Tinney because she is a friend of the state board member he replaced.
The governor appointed Tinney, Deatherage and Van Denhende to the board in February while ousting three members he said were complicit in “needless political drama.” Stitt did so after the removed board members voted in favor of collecting public school students’ immigration status.
Paxton said he decided to carry Tinney’s nomination after speaking with Stitt, Tinney and Education Committee leader Sen. Adam Pugh, R-Edmond.
“We didn’t want time to run out in the session without going ahead and getting this accomplished,” Paxton said. “We’re going to be able to get that done.”
Tinney, Deatherage and Van Denhende already have had a tumultuous three-month tenure on the board.

In their first board meeting Feb. 27, they voted on new academic standards for social studies education. They said they later learned the standards included significant changes they were unaware of at the time of the vote, including new language that casts doubt on the legitimacy of the 2020 presidential election results. 
The controversy led to a confrontation during the board’s April meeting between the three new members and state Superintendent Ryan Walters, who directed the last-minute changes.
During that meeting, Walters said the updated standards were provided to the board members before the meeting, but he couldn’t force them to read the information. Records that Walters’ administration provided indicated the board members received the lengthy document at 4 p.m. the evening before the Feb. 27 meeting.
The episode stirred up questions about the standards’ legitimacy and Walters’ compliance with public transparency. A lawsuit already has been filed over whether the approval process of the standards followed proper procedures.
“I hope things smooth out, and the board as a whole can start moving forward and doing some good for education in Oklahoma,” Tinney said.
Tinney, Deatherage and Van Denhende faced numerous questions from the Senate committee about their approach to the board.

“I want to think of it as the state superintendent is like the team captain and the state Board of Education are like the coaches,” Deatherage told the committee. “The team captain helps run practice and lead the team, but the coaches make the game plan, choose the plays they were running and make sure the captain is doing a good job.”
Sen. Dusty Deevers, R-Elgin, peppered Tinney, Deatherage and Van Denhende with questions and voted against their confirmation. Deevers, a member of the far-right-wing Freedom Caucus, said during Van Denhende’s hearing last week that he had no qualms with the nominee but believes “there’s been a disservice done to our board.”
He said he wouldn’t support Tinney because of the candidate’s connection to a professional organization for teachers. His wife, Ginger Tinney, leads Professional Oklahoma Educators and his son, Daniel Tinney, is the group’s government relations liaison. Tinney co-founded POE with his wife in 1998.

“I think there is too severe a conflict of interest for me to approve this,” Deevers said during the committee meeting.
Tinney said his proximity to POE will be an asset rather than a conflict. He said he would recuse from certain votes, if necessary, and wouldn’t share confidential board information with his family.
“I think it’s a real advantage that I have access to all those teachers and resources and knowledge about education,” Tinney said of the organization. “It will help me immensely on the board.”

The governor nominated Carson, a retired Edmond Public Schools teacher, to the board three weeks ago. She is the only recent board nominee who hasn’t yet taken office. If confirmed, Carson will fill a seat representing Congressional District 5 that has been vacant for two years.
Carson said Oklahoma must focus on improving student absenteeism rates, classroom funding, teacher retention and test scores.
“There shouldn’t be the controversy that is happening in this board right now,” Carson said during the committee meeting. “They’re there for one purpose and one purpose only, and that is to make sure that students are given a quality education in the state.”

Bill Lee's veto of a measure giving more authority to parole boards. (Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)The Tennessee District Attorneys General Conference is denouncing Gov. Bill Lee’s first veto and urging state lawmakers to override him on a bill giving the parole board more power.
Passed overwhelmingly with little fanfare by the legislature this year, HB527/SB455 expands the Board of Parole’s “authority to deny early release when the severity of the offense demands it or where it sends a critical message that serious crimes carry serious consequences,” a DAs Conference letter from early May says.
“These are not abstract concepts —- they are the bedrock of public safety, justice for victims, and confidence in the rule of law,” the letter says.
The state’s prosecutors, led by Executive Director Steve Crump, further say ignoring the “gravity and specific facts of an offender’s crime when determining early release eligibility is not only irresponsible, it is dangerous” because it disregards victims’ suffering and erodes trust in the criminal justice system.
The letter grows harsher, saying some crimes are so “egregious” the defendant should not receive “early” release.
Lee vetoed the bill May 5, calling it a “step backwards” from the advances of the Reentry Success Action of 2021. That measure passed with strong support and led the state to record its lowest rate of return to prison in history, Lee said when he defended his position.
Current statute allows the parole board — which is appointed by the governor — to deny parole based solely on the seriousness of the offense for 22 violent felonies. The bill seeks to broaden that authority beyond those crimes.
Republican Rep. Rick Scarbrough of Oak Ridge, a former Clinton Police chief, and Republican Sen. Paul Rose of Covington sponsored the measure.
Scarbrough said after the veto that the bill was designed to handle “critical gaps” in the state’s parole system to make sure serious offenses aren’t “minimized.”
A spokesperson for the governor did not respond to questions immediately Tuesday.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX",https://tennesseelookout.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Budget-Public-Safety015-1024x596.jpg,,,2025-05-20 17:07:22.965330

Free.,Democrats in Congress decry 'outrageous' DOJ charges against New Jersey colleague,Shauneen Miranda,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/democrats-congress-decry-outrageous-doj-charges-against-new-jersey-colleague,,"WASHINGTON — Congressional Democrats on Tuesday blasted the assault charges the Trump administration is pursuing against New Jersey U.S. Rep LaMonica McIver following a clash with law enforcement earlier this month outside an immigration detention center in Newark.Leaders of the Congressional Black Caucus, Democratic Women’s Caucus and Congressional Progressive Caucus defended McIver at a press conference attended by dozens of Democrats outside of the U.S. Capitol, arguing that the New Jersey Democrat was simply doing her job in conducting oversight of the facility.In a criminal complaint, McIver is charged with two counts of “assaulting, resisting, and impeding certain officers or employees,” with one charge involving a Homeland Security Investigations special agent and another surrounding an Immigration and Customs Enforcement deportation officer.The charges are tied to McIver’s May 9 visit to the detention center, where she was accompanied by fellow New Jersey Democrats — Reps. Rob Menendez and Bonnie Watson Coleman. The lawmakers had said they wanted to inspect the detention center.Federal authorities say McIver assaulted two officers as she tried to prevent the arrest of Newark Mayor Ras Baraka. Alina Habba, acting U.S. attorney for the District of New Jersey, announced Monday that she would be dropping a trespassing charge against Baraka stemming from the same standoff.‘Reprehensible political stunt’At the Capitol press conference, Rep. Yvette Clarke, chair of the Congressional Black Caucus, described the charges as a “reprehensible political stunt.”The New York Democrat said “members of Congress have every right to conduct oversight at ICE facilities and any other federal agency, and when egregious, undeniable and vicious violations of the law and people’s freedoms are taking place, we, they, in fact, have an obligation to do so.”New Jersey Democratic Sen. Cory Booker said McIver, Menendez and Watson Coleman “stood their ground, used their voice and did their job.”“They actually are obeying the Constitution. They are standing up to give checks and balances to this administration at a time that the Republicans in control of the House and the Senate are laying down and completely abrogating their duties to check and balance and give oversight to the president,” he added.New Jersey Democratic Rep. Frank Pallone also condemned the charges on Tuesday, calling the Justice Department’s actions “outrageous.”Ahead of a Tuesday hearing in the House Judiciary Committee on “threats to ICE operations,” Pallone led several other New Jersey Democrats in writing to the panel’s chair, Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio, and ranking member, Rep. Jamie Raskin of Maryland, to express their support for the three lawmakers’ oversight visit to the detention center.The group also condemned what they see as efforts from the Justice and Homeland Security Departments to “politicize and suppress lawful Congressional oversight through acts of intimidation and threats of legal action against our colleagues.”‘Baseless charges’Rep. Greg Casar, who chairs the Congressional Progressive Caucus, said the Department of Justice “filing baseless charges against a member of Congress for simply doing her job should send a chill down the spine of every American.”The Texas Democrat said the caucus held a meeting just before the press conference where they decided that they are “just about to go and do a lot more oversight visits at ICE facilities.”He said the members of the caucus recognized at the meeting that President Trump “doesn’t want us conducting oversight at ICE facilities like these brave members of Congress were doing — he wants to intimidate us out of doing that.”",,,,2025-05-20 17:07:22.965330
,DC,2025-05-20 21:01:47+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,U.S. House spending panel indicates it will boost Interior funding above Trump request,Jacob Fischler,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-house-spending-panel-indicates-it-will-boost-interior-funding-above-trump-request,,"Just after President Donald Trump rallied U.S. House Republicans to pass a giant legislative package containing most of his domestic policy goals Tuesday, members of both parties on a U.S. House Appropriations subcommittee told Interior Secretary Doug Burgum they would likely provide his department more funding than Trump requested.Even as Republicans professed a deference to Trump — with the subcommittee’s chairman calling him “the boss” — they also reaffirmed Congress’ power to direct spending, winning a promise from Burgum to spend congressionally appropriated money for its intended purpose.Republicans and Democrats on the House Appropriations Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies Subcommittee raised concerns with Burgum about proposed deep cuts in the administration’s “skinny budget” request to the National Park Service, Bureau of Indian Education and other Interior Department programs.“The administration proposed some deep funding cuts that we will likely not see eye-to-eye (on), especially when it comes to Indian programs and the operations of our national parks,” subcommittee Chairman Mike Simpson, an Idaho Republican, said.The subcommittee’s ranking Democrat, Maine’s Chellie Pingree, was more blunt in her objection to the budget request, saying she “wholeheartedly” opposed it.“Secretary Burgum, the document we're here to discuss today is more than just a budget,” she said. “It's a blueprint for dismantling the very mission of the Department of Interior, making it impossible to protect our natural resources and iconic national parks or uphold our commitments to tribal communities now and for future generations.”In his opening statement, Burgum highlighted efforts by the administration to increase oil and gas development, which he said would increase federal revenues from the department.Burgum rejects impoundmentThe panel’s hearing started late as Republican members were delayed listening to Trump address their conference’s weekly meeting.“I want to apologize for the half-hour late start; we were listening to the boss over at conference,” Simpson said, referring to Trump’s appearance at the House Republican Conference meeting.But, he continued, the panel would likely not accept the president’s recommendation to reduce the department’s budget by 30%, and he used his first question to put Burgum on the record about the administration’s duty to spend congressionally appropriated funds.“If Congress chooses to provide discretionary appropriations for the agency that are at levels above the president's budget request, how would you handle that?” Simpson asked. “In other words, would you spend the amounts provided in an enacted bill and for the specific programs that Congress identifies?”“Yes,” Burgum responded. “That would be the law.”While Congress has the constitutional authority to make federal spending decisions, spending hawks within the administration, including budget chief Russell Vought, have broached the idea of “impounding” money that Congress has directed. The legality of the concept is untested.Burgum’s response to Simpson rejected the use of impoundment, but Pingree noted that his department has still been unable to access appropriations due to delays at the Office of Management and Budget, which Vought oversees.‘Congress has the power of the purse’The continuing resolution that Trump signed in March included a provision that the Interior Department would have funds available within 60 days, she said. That deadline has passed but the money had not yet been apportioned, threatening job losses in Maine and other states, she said.Pingree asked Burgum if he was “pushing the OMB to appropriate your department’s funding.”Burgum said he was.“Okay, pushing is good,” she said. “So just from my perspective, if you don't get this funding, then that is impoundment. It is breaking the law. And I think perhaps on both sides of the aisle, we're feeling very frustrated this administration is not expeditiously appropriating what we funded.“Congress has the power of the purse,” she continued. “We meet in this committee, and we do an incredible amount of work negotiating back and forth on both sides of the aisle to arrive at these numbers and to figure out what should be done. And to have this administration just wantonly disregard what we have done, and to worry about having to do that in the next, 2026, budget, I would ask, you know what, why do committees meet? Why do we do the work that we're doing if, in fact, we can't count on the OMB?”Cut in spending on Park ServiceThe president’s budget request included a $900 million decrease in spending for the National Park Service, which is part of the Interior Department. The administration proposed turning some NPS assets over to the states to manage as a way to reduce expenses.Asked by Simpson about that idea, Burgum said no one was considering removing any of the 64 “crown jewel” national parks, but that some of the more than 400 other NPS sites could be managed by state or local authorities. Those sites may include historic battlefields or presidential birthplaces, he said.“There's, I think, zero intention of transferring any actual national parks,” he said. “I mean, the 64 crown jewels that we have, there's zero thought about that.”Full committee Chairman Tom Cole, an Oklahoma Republican, noted that Burgum had taken the 64 large parks off the table, but was supportive of transferring smaller sites. He urged Burgum to look not just at states but at tribal governments.“Look at the Chickasaw National Recreational Area sometime,” Cole, a citizen of the Chickasaw Nation, said. “I guarantee you, we’d manage it better. And that's not to say the federal government does a bad job. They don't, but we would put more resources into it.”Tribal educationMembers also questioned Burgum on the administration’s proposed $187 million decrease for the Bureau of Indian Education construction.Burgum said his team was trying to understand the challenges of BIE facilities and noted that some were in need of maintenance.But he said that his experience as North Dakota governor showed him that poor outcomes at BIE were not necessarily related to funding.“It's not always correlated between the more money you spend, the better outcomes you get,” he said.Cole said he agreed with that idea, but said funding was also a statement of priorities.“But I also think that kids have to have a good place to learn,” he said. “And sometimes that's an expression of whether or not you care about them very much. And I've been to some excellent BIE schools… but I've been to some places I wouldn't send my kid to simply because the resources aren't there and haven't ever been there.”",,,,2025-05-20 17:07:22.965330

Patrick Morrisey announced in a video message on Tuesday, May 20, 2025, that he has formally asked the federal government to disallow the state’s SNAP program from paying for soda. (West Virginia Office of Gov. Patrick Morrisey video screenshot)West Virginia Gov. Patrick Morrisey has formally asked the federal government to disallow the state’s food assistance program from paying for soda. Morrisey submitted a request for a waiver to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program to make the change, the governor announced in a video message Tuesday.

“For a long time I’ve talked about the fact that SNAP — the N should stand for nutrition,” Morrisey said. “Well, now it’s going to, even more than you’ve seen in the past. We’re promoting healthy bundles. That’s fresh produce and lean meat, and good opportunities for some hot foods for West Virginians for some products that you’ve never been able to have before.”
Morrisey first announced the SNAP proposal during an event in March with federal Health and Human Services secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has promoted the idea of states prohibiting SNAP from covering soda. 
The SNAP changes are part of a statewide health initiative Morrisey called the “Four Pillars of a Healthy West Virginia.” Other pillars included prohibiting the sale of certain food dyes in the state, and the “Mountaineer Mile,” challenge to walk at least a mile a day.
Legislation similar to the SNAP change was introduced during the 2025 regular session, but went nowhere. House Bill 2350 would have required the state to submit a SNAP waiver so that the program could disallow coverage of soda and candy. Opponents of the bill expressed concerns it would hurt local grocery stores, particularly near the state border, by causing SNAP recipients to use their assistance to buy the sweets in stores across state lines.
One in six West Virginians, or approximately 277,000 residents, rely on the SNAP program for food assistance, according to the West Virginia Center on Budget and Policy. The program is paid for by the federal government’s Department of Agriculture and administered through the state.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-05-20 20:53:36+00:00,CT Mirror,CT state police contract: House approves raises for troopers,Keith M. Phaneuf,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/05/20/ct-state-police-contract-raises/,The proposal to boost pay by an effective 4.5% had bipartisan support despite objections from GOP leaders and is expected to pass the Senate.,"The House of Representatives on Tuesday overwhelmingly approved a proposal that would grant state police troopers a 2.5% general wage hike and a step increase next fiscal year.
The proposal, which is also expected to win approval in the Senate, passed 134-12 in the Democratic-controlled House, enjoying bipartisan support despite objections from GOP leaders.
Legislators from both parties have lamented a state police force that’s now about 25% smaller than the 1,200-plus troopers who served Connecticut prior to 2010. 
Democrats said the raises, which would affect an estimated 885 troopers, are essential to recruitment efforts.
But both House Minority Leader Vincent J. Candelora, R-North Branford, and Rep. Tammy Nuccio, R-Tolland, argued against the raises.
“We’re facing a collision course with a rather ugly truth” — that state employee compensation is becoming unsustainable, said Nuccio, who is the ranking House Republican on the Appropriations Committee.
Nearly all unionized workers have received a 2.5% general wage hike and a step, which typically adds another 2 percentage points to the raise, each fiscal year since 2021-22.
Gov. Ned Lamont’s administration, which negotiated the wage deal with the troopers, also is bargaining new contracts with all other major state employee unions. And it would be difficult for state officials to convince labor arbiters that Connecticut could not afford effective 4.5% annual increases for other state employees if the legislature approves one for troopers.
The House GOP proposed a $54.4 billion biennial budget earlier this month that counts on more than $300 million in savings over the next two fiscal years by freezing pay for all workers. 
Candelora said troopers earn an average of $116,000 per year in base pay, but compensation rises to $175,000 per year once overtime is considered. 
“There’s no amount of pay that’s going to be able to recruit more officers,” he said.
The solution, Candelora added, involves criminal justice reforms that give officers greater legal protection when performing searches or pulling over motorists on the highway. 
“What they really need is our support,” he said. “They need real criminal justice reform.”
Despite Nuccio and Candelora’s arguments, 35 of the 47 Republicans who cast ballots in Tuesday’s joined 99 Democrats in supporting the raises.
Andrew Matthews, executive director of the state police union and a former president, noted before a legislative panel earlier this month that union concessions packages have weakened retirement benefits for troopers.
Before 2011, a trooper was eligible for a hazardous duty pension based on the three highest annual salaries of a minimum 20 years of service.
Now Connecticut requires 25 years of service that offers a hybrid pension/401(k) benefit calculated on average wages over the entire 25-year span.
But Matthews also said workers deserve the raises in the deal and more. 
“It’s a dangerous job,” he said at the time, adding that 26 troopers have died in the line of duty and that post-traumatic stress injuries are “a real thing” many troopers face.
The legislature’s nonpartisan Office of Fiscal Analysis estimated the agreement would cost state government nearly $4.1 million next fiscal year. Municipalities that participate in the resident state trooper program would collectively incur an added cost of $301,675 next fiscal year, nonpartisan analysts estimated.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/2025_0107_SR_CapitolMugs_071-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-20 17:07:22.965330

(Photo by Getty Images)As health care providers warn of depleted funds hampering services, the Maine Legislature appears poised to close off a path that would make already allocated Medicaid funding available sooner. 
With a 93-50 vote on Tuesday, the Maine House of Representatives failed to reach the two-thirds support needed to enact an emergency measure. 
The contents of this bill are already law. The funding was included in the two-year budget passed in March. What’s new is that this bill would make that funding available immediately.
Democrats pushed through a two-year budget that continued government spending at the same level but also included additional funding to address emergency needs, notably to address a $118 million funding deficit for MaineCare, the state’s Medicaid program. 
However, because that budget bill also failed to garner the support of two-thirds of the Legislature, the funding will not be available until late June. 
The Democratic majority moved ahead with that plan without GOP support after Senate Republicans refused to support an earlier change package for the current fiscal year to address the MaineCare deficit and other urgent needs unless it included structural reform to the health care program.
Legislative leadership accepted a late-submitted emergency bill, LD 1948, as a way to try to get the funding out to providers sooner. 
“This bill before us here is just the blank check part without the other reforms that we had agreed to,” House Minority Leader Billy Bob Falkingham (R-Winter Harbor) said ahead of the vote on Tuesday. 
However, not all members of the minority party felt the same way. Rep. Rachel Henderson (R-Rumford) voted against the supplemental budget because at the time she’d felt that there was an opportunity to push for reform, but she said on Tuesday that the measure before the body was different. 
“Now what’s before us is, we’re asking ourselves, do we want to pay our bills?” Henderson said. “I would urge my colleagues, let’s let the past be the past.” 
Despite not clinching the support needed, the bill will still head to the Senate for enactment and could return to the lower chamber if the emergency threshold is reached in the upper chamber. 
The state started withholding some payments to health care providers on March 12 amid the budget debate to ensure some level of funding would be available for the duration of the current fiscal year. Several hospitals said then that they were not in a position to absorb the payment cuts.
Now, the total withheld to community-governed hospitals in the Maine Hospital Association is  approaching $100 million, Jeffrey Austin, vice president of government affairs for the association, told Maine Morning Star. 
“This is a lot of cash to not have available to pay bills with,” Austin said. “Maine hospitals have some of the lowest margins in the country and the highest debt.”
The load hospitals bear gets heavier with each day that goes by without a full restoration of reimbursements, Austin said. 
“It’s made a tough situation that much tougher,” he said, “and the sooner it’s over the better.” 
Several legislators said on the House floor Tuesday that they’ve heard similar concerns from constituents, both those who work in the health care field who are worried about layoffs and those who rely on Medicaid worried about accessing services. 
“So when I’m asked, ‘What’s in it for us?’” Rep. James Dill (D-Old Town) said. “The answer is simple: people.”
Hearing similar concerns in his district, Rep. David Rollins (D-Augusta) acknowledged LD 1948 won’t fix all of the financial challenges providers are currently facing, “but it will provide some relief by ensuring that the providers get the MaineCare funding they’re owed by the state.” 
Speaking with Maine Morning Star, Scott Hanson, president of the Maine Medical Association, which represents the state’s physicians, residents and medical students across all clinical specialties, had a similar view of the emergency legislation. While noting challenges with hiring and retention and what he sees as inadequate reimbursements rates, Hanson said MaineCare payments are a crucial part of providers’ bottom lines, so having that funding restored sooner is a priority for the association. 
Regardless, Hanson is concerned about the state of Medicaid, given possible cuts coming from the federal budget being considered by U.S. Congress. 
“Things are so, how shall we say, topsy turvy, or uncertain coming out of Washington,” as Hanson put it. 
The U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Energy and Commerce, which oversees health care, approved a bill last week that proposes the largest cuts to Medicaid in the history of the program. The full House is expected to vote on the package this week and, if it passes, it would then head to the Senate, where GOP lawmakers are expected to rewrite numerous sections of the bill.
“That’s going to trickle down to the states as a lack of funding,” Hanson said. “So it could make the current crisis for Augusta legislators a whole lot worse.”
The two-year budget Democrats passed in March did not include any policy changes to address the sizable budget deficit the state faces over the next biennium, including another expected shortfall for MaineCare. Gov. Janet Mills’ proposals to close that gap — tax increases and program cuts — as well as the requests from the public and lawmakers are being considered for the next iteration of the budget plan.

On Tuesday the union announced it would strike starting May 27. (Photo by Erik Gunn/Wisconsin Examiner)Nurses at Madison’s Meriter hospital plan to walk off the job for five days starting Tuesday, May 27, after negotiations on a new union contract ended Monday night without an agreement.
The hospital management and Service Employees International Union (SEIU) Wisconsin, which represents about 950 nurses at the hospital, are divided over pay, security provisions and whether the hospital should commit to specific ratios of how many patients are under a nurse’s care.
The union and the hospital management have scheduled another bargaining session for Monday, May 26 — the day before the strike is scheduled to start. If the strike goes forward, it is scheduled to last for five days, with union members returning on Sunday, June 1.
In order to allow hospitals to secure temporary replacement staff or move patients, federal law requires hospital workers to give at least 10 days notice before striking, which SEIU Wisconsin gave May 9. The union also opted for a fixed duration for the walkout.
“We don’t take going on strike lightly, but we truly feel in order to make the changes that are necessary we’re willing to fight to make things safe for our patients,” said Pat Raes, a long-time Meriter nurse and also president of SEIU Wisconsin, in an interview May 14.
“Nurses have been clear with Meriter management that we will strike for patient and staff safety, improved compensation to retain nurses, and staffing solutions that include the voices of bedside nurses who care for patients day in and day out,” declared a union statement issued Tuesday morning. “Meriter is still not listening to the nurses.”
The hospital, UnityPoint Health-Meriter, is one of 17 regional hospitals in the large, Iowa-centered nonprofit health care chain, UnityPoint Health.   
“We’ve been in a union environment for decades and know that a strike could happen. We always work very, very hard to avoid that,” said Sherry Casali, market chief nursing officer for the hospital, in a statement released to the press Tuesday. “I think both parties would prefer not to have a strike.”
In past years, the union and the hospital have worked with federal mediators during contract talks. This year federal mediation wasn’t available after President Donald Trump issued an executive order in March gutting the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service (FMCS), nursesan independent federal agency.
Although that order was blocked by a federal judge May 6, the union and hospital turned instead to the Wisconsin Employment Relations Commission.
Defined patient-nurse ratios have been a longtime goal for union nurses. California and Massachusetts both have state laws setting certain minimum ratios, according to  NurseJournal.org. A limited number of other states require hospitals to publish their nurse-to-staff ratios.
“The more patients you take care of once you get above that ratio puts every patient that you’re taking care of at higher risk for complications and higher risk for mortality,” Raes said.
The statement the hospital issued Tuesday acknowledged that “both parties agree on the importance of safe and effective staffing,” but said that mandated ratios “limit flexibility” and could make it more difficult “to adjust to patient needs and staff availability in real time.”
The hospital statement said the facility relies on its charge nurses, who “are key to staffing and have clear avenues to discuss any patient care needs throughout each shift.”
There are limits to flexibility, however, according to the members of the nursing staff. Flexibility “sometimes works and sometimes doesn’t,” said Amanda Husk, a postpartum nurse. “We just know there’s always a base need for nurses to make sure patients are safe.”
Husk said ensuring that the ratio of nurses is always sufficient “also prevents burnout and turnover of nurses. That’s a big deal.”
Raes said nurses also wanted stronger security measures — including metal detectors — in light of violent incidents at hospitals across the country that have led to injuries or deaths of health care workers.
The hospital’s statement said its security staff regularly updates security measures and plans additional unspecified changes this summer.
On pay, Raes said that while nurses in their first 12 years have had significant raises, those at the upper end of the scale for pay and longevity don’t see their pay keeping up.
The shift to a 401(k) retirement plan from a standard pension has diminished the incentive for more experienced nurses to stick around, said Raes, while the original pension plan encouraged longevity on the job.
Meriter’s statement said the hospital’s most recent pay offer would keep its nurses “some of the best-paid nurses in Wisconsin” as well as in Madison.

Ben Ray Luján (D-N.M.), joins colleagues introducing the DOGE BROS Act, to increase penalties for improper access to personal info","Congressional Democrats say the DOGE BROS Act is needed to counter Elon Musk and DOGE's efforts to access individuals' personal information. (Photo by Andrew Harnik/Getty Images)Several Congressional Democrats on Tuesday, including U.S. Sen. Ben Ray Luján (D-N.M.), announced a new bill aimed at countering what they describe as Elon Musk and the Department of Government Efficiency’s “continued efforts to improperly access” individuals’ “personally identifiable information,” such as names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses and Social Security numbers.
The Defending Our Government’s Electronic data: Bolstering Responsible Oversight & Safeguards (DOGE BROS) Act would increase five penalties for violation of federal privacy laws.
As Source reported this week, the New Mexico Health Care Authority recently informed the contractor who manages payments on its behalf that it did not consent to such information being shared with the federal government, which requested the data. The United States Department of Agriculture, earlier this month, wrote a letter to all U.S. states asking them to provide the “names, dates of birth, personal addresses used, and Social Security numbers” of anyone who is receiving or has applied to receive benefits under the Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program (SNAP).
“From day one, Elon Musk’s DOGE has taken a wrecking ball to the federal government and critical services for the American people, all while carelessly pursuing their sensitive personal data,” Luján said in a statement. “Congress must do more to protect that information and keep it out of the wrong hands.”
Specifically, the law proposes the following penalty increases for improper disclosure:

identifiable information in any agency record from its current penalty of up to $5,000 to up to $30,000
information obtained from a computer in any U.S. agency or department without proper authorization from $250,000 up to $750,000
any Social Security or Medicare data would increase from $10,000 to $25,000
tax return information, which now carries a penalty up to $5,000, would increase up to $25,000
census data, now with a penalty up to $5,000, would increase up to $25,000

Lead sponsor U.S. Sen. Mark Warren (D-V.A.) said in a statement, “As unvetted and unqualified DOGE employees continue to recklessly access the sensitive personal information of millions of Americans, it’s important that we take steps to better protect this data. For too long, our privacy laws have sat outdated, barely serving as a deterrent for improper handling or potential release of information. This legislation would enforce that privacy must be a priority when handling the data of the American public.”

(Inset photo provided by Ryan Peterman campaign, background via Canva)Democrat Ryan Peterman announced he will run for Iowa secretary of state in the 2026 election.
Peterman, 34, who grew up in Bettendorf. He served 10 years as a helicopter pilot in the U.S. Navy after graduating from the Naval Academy, and later returned to work at the Naval Academy as a honor education officer. He also spent a year working as a legislative fellow for U.S. Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-New Hampshire. In a news release announcing his campaign, Peterman said these experiences give him a foundation to serve Iowans in the role “with integrity, transparency, and nonpartisan professionalism.”
If elected, Peterman said he would plan to focus on making voting more accessible for Iowans while protecting election security. Under the Republican trifecta at the Iowa Capitol, GOP lawmakers have passed several measures in recent years that Democrats say limits voters’ ability to participate in elections, such as shortening the early voting window and a ban on providing citizens with non-English ballots, voter registration forms and other materials.
“Iowa needs leaders who put country and community before politics” Peterman said. “Our elections should be free from partisan interference and focused on empowering voters. I’m running for Secretary of State because I believe in making it easier — not harder — for eligible Iowans to legally vote, and I will fight every day to ensure they can trust that their voice will be heard and their ballot will be counted.”
The seat is currently held by Republican Paul Pate, who won his fourth reelection to office in 2022 against Democratic challenger Joel Miller, former Linn County auditor. Pate has not yet announced whether he intends to seek another term.
Peterman also said he would focus on ensuring Iowans have faith in the state’s election systems. The most recent changes to Iowa’s voting laws came during the 2025 legislative session through a bill proposed by Pate allowing the Secretary of State’s office to contract with federal and state agencies, as well as private entities, for voter roll verification. The legislation also allows voters to be challenged at the polls over their citizenship status, and laid out a process for marking a voter’s registration status as “unconfirmed” if local or state officials have received information the voter may not be legally qualified to vote, primarily in cases involving unconfirmed citizenship status.
These changes came following Pate’s directive to county auditors ahead of the 2024 general election to challenge the ballots of 2,176 voters identified as “potential noncitizens” based on state information that the Secretary of State’s office was unable to cross-check using a federal database. Pate said in March 277 people on the list were confirmed to not have U.S. citizenship, and 35 noncitizens cast ballots that were counted in the 2024 election.
Peterman kicked off his campaign with an event at Grumpy’s Saloon in the Village of East Davenport, and plans to hold another campaign launch event in Des Moines Wednesday at Star Bar.",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Ryan-Peterman-green-background.jpg,,,2025-05-20 17:07:22.965330

Democrats and Progressives deliberated into Monday night on a request by more than 100 businesses to relocate a free lunch program in a downtown parking garage.

Photo by Corey McDonald/VTDiggerTensions emerging in the Burlington business community came to a head Monday night when the City Council, after hours of deliberation, voted to direct the mayor to relocate a free lunch program located in a downtown parking garage.The mutual aid program, Food Not Cops — the local chapter of Food Not Bombs — has operated out of the Marketplace Garage off Cherry Street for five years. There, volunteers and organizers distribute home-cooked meals to people struggling to find shelter or anyone in need of a meal.Burlington Mayor Emma Mulvaney-Stanak on Monday said she has been in discussions with the group for months about a potential relocation. But earlier this month, a letter signed by more than 100 city businesses asked city officials to find a new location for the program.Its operation out of the parking garage “has had a negative impact on the area,” and the signatories suggested that “some attendees have repeatedly stolen from businesses or caused harm,” the letter reads. “We respectfully ask that this program be relocated to a more appropriate and secure setting—not eliminated.”The letter, sent directly to Mulvaney-Stanak, came days after Nectar’s, the famed bar and music venue, announced it would be closing for the summer.Signed by dozens of local businesses, restaurants and other property owners, the letter underscored feelings of uncertainty many community members have about the future of downtown. Business owners have said the downtown core has been beset by drug use and petty theft, which has contributed to a deterioration of foot traffic and business.Meanwhile, ongoing construction on Main Street has further compounded the issue. City officials say gross receipts tax revenues are down by about 10% over the past year as a result.“Businesses are closing their doors, valued long-term employees are leaving, and residents are increasingly choosing to avoid the downtown area. Those of us who remain feel neglected and increasingly unsafe,” the letter reads. “Our expectations are not for an unattainable ideal, but for effective leadership, genuine support, and the fundamental resources necessary to operate businesses that are safe, welcoming and sustainable.”A resolution, written and sponsored by Democratic Councilor Becca Brown McKnight and presented to the council on Monday, offered a boost to the business community by tackling these issues head on.The resolution called on the city Department of Public Works to conduct a feasibility assessment and timeline for reopening Main Street to one-way traffic, and urged the city’s Business and Workforce Development agency to conduct “more effective coordinated marketing and PR efforts that promote downtown and re-establish it as a vibrant, safe, and inclusive space.”But the resolution’s provision to find a new permanent location for the meal program prompted some backlash.A counter letter, signed by dozens of organizations and businesses, expressed support for the meal exchange program, while dozens of people protested outside of City Hall on Monday before the council meeting began.During the council’s public forum, Burlington resident Gabriel Nelson called the resolution “baseless scapegoating.” Leif Taranta, an Old North End resident, said the program was meeting the survival needs for many in the community.Sam Bliss, an organizer and spokesperson for Food Not Cops, contested that there was a safety issue at the garage.“Business owners want to move our lunch so that Church Street shoppers don’t have to look at poor, suffering people on their walk from their vehicles to the stores they’ll shop at,” Bliss said. “And I get it, I don’t like seeing my neighbors and friends unhoused or desperate either, but that’s not a safety issue, that’s a discomfort issue. Is the solution to avert our gaze? To push poor and suffering people out of sight, out of mind, so that business as usual can just go on?”Others who spoke at the meeting, however, supported the resolution. “Being pro-downtown and pro-business does not mean that we are against those that are unhoused,” said Megan Meinen, a downtown Burlington resident who works at Home and Garden Vermont on College Street. “We are not against those people. It also does not mean that we want mutual aid to stop or food distribution programs to stop. What businesses are against is behavior that is illegal. We want those behaviors to have consequences.”Progressive and Democratic city councilors on Monday deliberated into the night over the provisions addressing the meal exchange program, with Progressive Councilor Marek Broderick making a motion to strike its relocation from the resolution.Progressive councilors said the mayor needed more time to discuss the relocation with the group. Councilor Gene Bergman at one point asked Democratic colleagues to join them in removing the language, so they “could get as close to a unanimous vote on this as absolutely possible, because there are a number of good things in here that we should all be united on.”The two parties ultimately reached an agreement, with some Democratic councilors joining Progressives in an 8-4 vote to strip a provision that would have required the program to find a new location by June 14.It appeared at first to be a rare compromise between the city’s Progressive and Democratic councilors. But later in the meeting, Democratic Councilor Allie Schachter introduced an amendment to the resolution establishing a later deadline — July 14 instead of June 14 — for the mayor to find an alternative long-term location for the program.Progressive councilors accused Democrats of backing out of a compromise, while Mulvaney-Stanak accused Democrats of “legislating on the fly.”Schachter said the amendment “sets an intentionality” around the conversation, while McKnight later added that “the public deserves to know that the choice to allow it to continue is a policy choice and an enforcement choice.”“We need to be honest about the choices that we’re making here,” she said.The resolution eventually passed, with Councilor Carter Neubieser joining the Democratic majority to pass the resolution in an 8-4 vote. Mulvaney-Stanak now has a July 14 deadline to find a long-term location for the lunch service.Read the story on VTDigger here:  Tensions mount in Burlington business community as council orders meal program relocation.",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/food-not-cops-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-20 17:07:22.965330

May 20, 2025 | Photo by Ben SolisIt was a rough day for the Michigan Department of State on Tuesday as lawmakers from two separate legislative committees grilled officials about major ongoing issues with the state’s new campaign finance reporting system.
The haranguing was a bipartisan affair, with lawmakers from both sides of the political aisle taking turns sharing the frustrations and disbelief over the lack of functionality of the state’s $9 million Michigan Transparency Network project, which launched late last year and replaced the aging Michigan Electronic Reporting and Tracking System.
Much of the ire was aimed at Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson, who is seeking the Democratic nomination for governor in the 2026 race. Christina Anderson, Benson’s chief of staff, appeared before the joint committee Tuesday to apologize for the shape of the system and vowed that the department would work nights and weekends until the issues are resolved.
“The current performance and usability of all functions of the MiTN system is below [Benson’s] standard of excellence and we will be working nights and weekends until it is fixed,” Anderson said. “The problems with the MiTN launch are deeply serious to us. We have a dedicated, talented team along with our top executives engaged in resolving this. … We will not pay another dime on this project until the system meets our standards, and I know that my team and the team at Tyler are committed to making this work, quickly.”

Halting payment to Tyler Technologies, the vendor chosen for the project, was included in the department’s next steps to fix issues and bring the site up to full functionality, Anderson added.
Republican members of the House Oversight Committee and the House Appropriations General Government Subcommittee, which met jointly on Tuesday to discuss the website’s woes, raised concerns about the cost of the project, its vendor and the bid process used to select them, as well as privacy and data concerns with the new website.
Several Democratic members of the committee had different concerns, like being able to submit accurate information on time according to Michigan campaign finance law, and worries about future ballot access if that information isn’t transmitted to the state properly.
Anderson testified before the committee with representatives from Tyler Technologies. In an overview of the decision to move to the MiTN system over the old MERTS program, Anderson said the previous system was antiquated, inefficient and had consistent problems that required significant updates. 
Anderson said a request for proposal was issued on the project in July 2022. The state had two bids – one from Tyler Technologies and another from TenX Software. New finance disclosure laws were passed a year later, necessitating an overhaul to the system to include that data along with the normal course of campaign finance reporting. MiTN was slated to launch in July 2024, but that date was pushed back until the end of the year, when it launched its system for lobbyist and agent disclosures. MiTN’s campaign finance module was launched in March of this year.
Issues arose with the new system upon launch, with many frequent users complaining about the lack of search functionality, a new login page that was not part of the old system and incomplete data. A summary page for candidate filings that outlined the total expenditures, contributions or campaign committee debts on one easy to read page was also absent.
Overall, Anderson said Benson and the MDOS team in charge of the project were pushing to complete the overhaul in an off-election year, but also by the end of the secretary’s term. In their zeal to meet that deadline, however, mistakes and data issues arose that led to the release of a faulty product.
“These launches, while able to capture the required filings, did not meet our standard of excellence,” Anderson said. “We struggled through a complicated data migration and had problems with our test environment reflecting the production environment. Essentially, things we thought were fixed were not.”
Of the total five-year, $9 million contract term with Tyler, the state has spent just more than $3 million, including $2.3 million on implementation and the rest on maintenance and hosting. Further payments were suspended to Tyler until each of the current list of 40 separate website issues were resolved.
Anderson said substantial work was being done to get the system up and running properly by the next candidate filing deadline, July 25. Search and bulk data upload functionality are a priority, Anderson added, and the website will again feature a summary page for easier access.
House Oversight Committee Chair Rep. Jay DeBoyer (R-Clay) asked who made the decision to switch the systems. Anderson said it was a joint decision from several individuals in the Bureau of Elections, but she said she also supported the decision to launch the module when the department did because she believed the issues were fixed. Anderson said she would have not made that same decision, in retrospect.
DeBoyer also questioned the bidding process that selected Tyler Technologies, which has been the subject of bad press over its technology products and was named in several lawsuits across the nation. Although the Department of State had two initial bidders, TenX was disqualified, leaving only Tyler to bid on the project. DeBoyer equated that to a single-source bidding process because the department didn’t seek an alternate after punting the TenX bid.
It was also revealed in DeBoyer’s questioning that Tyler had purchased the subsidiary company that owned the state’s former MERTS system, raising conflict of interest concerns.
Abby Diaz, chief administrative officer with Tyler, told DeBoyer and other legislators who raised reputational concerns that the reporting on their company was largely inaccurate and that several of the lawsuits were without merit.
Rep. Tim Kelly (R-Saginaw) asked if Anderson believed the vendor had lied to her about the progress and functionality of the system. Anderson said she did not, noting that the data was displaying differently – and efficiently – in the test environment while the production environment displayed poorly. Kelly continued to question why department staff signed-off on the project each step of the way when issues persisted up until launch.
Anderson said that, with any software launch, issues will arise after launch that weren’t anticipated, which she said was regrettable.
Some Democrats, like Rep. Will Snyder of Muskegon and Rep. Dylan Wegela of Garden City, also said the issues with the website were alarming.
Wegela called for a refund of the state’s money. Rep. Reggie Miller (D-Van Buren Township) questioned the need for a refund or halting payment if no mistakes were made. She also wondered if Benson had been properly briefed on the issues as they occurred.
It was Snyder who raised concerns about barriers to getting on the ballot for sitting legislators and prospective candidates if they can’t accurately or timely file their campaign finance and financial disclosures.
He asked if the department would be willing to attest, in writing, that no legislators or candidates would be disqualified by the Bureau of Elections due to ongoing issues with the website. Anderson said she needed to be careful in her response because election law was tricky, but said she would submit a response in writing to the committees.
In a regularly scheduled news briefing with House Speaker Matt Hall (R-Richland Township), the speaker blamed the mess on Benson being distracted with her political ambitions for governor. He also agreed with Snyder’s ballot access concerns, noting then-presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s ballot access issues in Michigan and Benson’s refusal to remove him from the ballot when he turned to support now-President Donald Trump.

“If I were someone like [Detroit Mayor and independent gubernatorial candidate] Mike Duggan, I’d be pretty worried,” Hall said. “Cornell West, she found some way to disqualify him. With all this chaos, with a website that doesn’t work, and a very political Secretary of State running for governor, I’d be worried.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/6631be2b-5867-49f5-b5d9-1bda1d5448b7-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-05-20 17:07:22.965330

Free.,DHS Secretary Kristi Noem stumbles over questions from Democrats on habeas corpus,Ariana Figueroa,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/dhs-secretary-kristi-noem-stumbles-over-questions-democrats-habeas-corpus,,"WASHINGTON — U.S. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem Tuesday was grilled by senators on the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee about funding estimates for a barrier along the southern border, as well as concerns about the Trump administration’s adherence to due process in immigration enforcement.Noem was sharply criticized by Democrats for her answers to questions about habeas corpus, which they said she did not define correctly. “Habeas corpus is a constitutional right that the president has to be able to remove people from this country,” Noem said before she was cut off by Democratic Sen. Maggie Hassan of New Hampshire, who had asked her for a definition.“That’s incorrect,” Hassan said. “Habeas corpus is the legal principle that requires that the government provide a public reason for detaining and imprisoning people. If not for that protection, the government could simply arrest people, including American citizens, and hold them indefinitely for no reason.”As for the cost of President Donald Trump's border plans, even Republicans expressed doubts.“I know the wall is (of) great symbolic value, but I think we should reassess the cost,” Republican Chair Rand Paul of Kentucky said about the House’s reconciliation package, which calls for $46 billion in border wall funding.Noem appeared before the committee to discuss President Donald Trump’s fiscal year 2026 budget request for Congress along with the border security provisions in the reconciliation package. Congressional Republicans are using reconciliation — a special procedure that skirts the Senate’s 60-vote filibuster — to put together one bill to fulfill Trump’s priorities on border security, tax cuts, energy policy and defense.“The border crisis is the biggest problem that was facing our country, and it was one that was imperative to fixing for our nation's future,” Noem, the former governor of South Dakota, said. “We're solving this crisis at a record pace, and we have delivered the most secure border in American history.”Senate Democrats pressed Noem about DHS spending, noting that she is on track to run out of funding by mid-July, and her agency’s immigration crackdown that has led to expensive immigration enforcement.The top Democrat on the panel, Sen. Gary Peters of Michigan, noted that detaining migrants at the Guantanamo naval base costs as much as $100,000 a day, compared to $160 a day at a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility. “I think that's kind of outrageous,” Peters said. “I'm concerned by the staggering cost of this, and I would hope, Secretary (Noem), you could commit to providing this committee a detailed breakdown of the total cost of that operation there.”Noem said she would get the cost breakdown for him. Questions about habeas corpusSeveral Senate Democrats, including Hassan, Andy Kim of New Jersey and Elissa Slotkin of Michigan, questioned comments from senior White House officials such as Stephen Miller, who has said discussions about suspending habeas corpus were underway.Habeas corpus allows people in the U.S. who believe they are being unlawfully detained to petition for their release in court, and it can be used to challenge immigration detention.The U.S. Constitution in allowing for habeas corpus to be suspended says “in Cases of Rebellion or Invasion the public Safety may require it.” That provision is within Article I of the Constitution, which covers the functions of the legislative branch, or Congress.Habeas corpus has only been suspended four times in U.S. history, during the Civil War; in almost a dozen South Carolina counties that were overrun by the Ku Klux Klan during reconstruction; in a 1905 insurrection in U.S. territories in the Philippines; and after the Pearl Harbor bombing in Hawaii.Slotkin told Noem she was concerned by her response that she believes the president has the right to suspend habeas corpus.“You sat here in front of all of us and swore an oath to the Constitution,” Slotkin said to Noem, adding that if the president were to suspend habeas corpus, it would be a “complete overreach.”“It is a right that we all get, that American citizens get, that people who are in the United States legally have,” Slotkin said.Kim asked Noem, a former member of the U.S. House, if she knew what section of the Constitution allows for the suspension of habeas corpus and which article it’s under.Noem did not know the answer to either question.“It’s in Article I,” Kim said. “Do you know which branch of government Article I outlines the tasks and the responsibilities for?”Noem said Congress. She then argued former President Abraham Lincoln suspended habeas corpus.Lincoln suspended habeas corpus between Washington, D.C., and Philadelphia because of the Civil War and initially did so without congressional approval. He later called Congress back into session to get congressional approval for it.Reality show with competing immigrantsDemocratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut asked Noem if DHS was considering hosting a reality show that would make immigrants compete for citizenship, according to multiple media reports.Noem vehemently denied that DHS was looking at it.“There may have been something submitted somewhere along the line, because there are proposals pitched to the department, but me and my executive team have no knowledge of a reality show, and it's not under consideration,” she said.Kim pressed Noem about the recent confrontation between House lawmakers and immigration officials at Delaney Hall in his home state of New Jersey.Three New Jersey Democratic members – Reps. Bonnie Watson Coleman, LaMonica McIver and Rob Menendez — were in Newark protesting the reopening of Delaney Hall, an immigrant detention center.The mayor of Newark, Ras Baraka, who was also protesting, was arrested.The Trump administration Monday levied two felony charges against one of those members, McIver, accusing her of assaulting officers during Baraka’s arrest.Kim said he was concerned about the incident and asked Noem if she was aware that members of Congress do not need prior notice to conduct oversight at DHS facilities.Members of Congress are allowed to conduct oversight visits at any DHS facility that detains immigrants, without prior notice, under provisions in an appropriations law.Noem accused the three House members of “storming” the facility.“We give tours when members of Congress ask for it, we just ask that they not be politicized,” she said.Prep for big sporting eventsFlorida GOP Sen. Rick Scott and Rand Paul asked Noem about how prepared DHS is for providing security to big sporting events such as the Super Bowl and soccer's World Cup.Scott wanted to know how security preparations for the 2026 World Cup, which includes games in Miami, are going.Miami is one of 11 U.S. cities hosting the World Cup. The others are Atlanta; Boston; Dallas; Houston; Kansas City, Missouri; Los Angeles; the San Francisco Bay area; the New York and New Jersey metropolitan area; Philadelphia; and Seattle.“We are working diligently with FIFA and other entities to ensure that cities and states have the assets that they need. This will be an unprecedented world event,” Noem said. “It will be taking place in three different countries and many cities across our country, but also Mexico and Canada, and it will take place over a month.”The World Cup, which first began in the 1930s, is typically held in one country every four years. The last time two countries hosted the month-long event was in 2002, with Japan and South Korea.Paul asked Noem if the NFL or FIFA, international soccer's governing body, ever paid DHS for its security measures.Noem said no.“Here's my point,” Paul said. “The NFL makes billions of dollars. These people ought to pay. I mean, it's ridiculous that the average taxpayer could never afford to go to an NFL Super Bowl, (and) has got to pay for their security.”",,,,2025-05-20 17:07:22.965330

(Getty image)The Rhode Island Ethics Commission is contemplating major changes to the state ethics code for the first time in over a decade.  
A pair of unanimous votes by the commission Tuesday start the rulemaking process to explicitly ban lobbyists from giving gifts other than campaign donations to public officials, and to increase the maximum value of “insubstantial” gifts that can be accepted to account for inflation.
The last time the ethics panel substantially updated state ethics laws was in 2012 to require public officials to include out-of-state travel on their annual financial disclosure documents, John Marion, Common Cause Rhode Island executive director, said.
Ciccone can vote on assault weapons ban, other gun bills, R.I. ethics panel says

The ethics panel’s votes Tuesday came without discussion, though Chairman Lauren Jones noted the two proposed rule changes were debated extensively in prior meetings.
One rule change was born out of a three-year state investigation into Gov. Dan McKee’s relationship with ILO Group, an education nonprofit awarded a 2021 multimillion-dollar state contract. An October report detailing the investigation by the Rhode Island State Police and Office of the Attorney General found no evidence of criminal wrongdoing by McKee or his former advisor, Mike Magee. But Common Cause maintained that McKee’s acceptance of $90,000 worth of consulting services — some of which was for his reelection campaign — paid for by Magee’s education company, exposed flaws in the state ethics code. Common Cause in December wrote a letter to the ethics panel, asking it to consider updating ethics rules around gifts.
The state ethics law presently bans public officials and employees from accepting gifts above $25 in value from “interested persons,” defined as anyone with a “direct financial interest in a decision” that a public official or employee might make. 
While most state lobbyists adhere to this ban as a matter of practice, the law does not explicitly ban lobbyists from giving gifts to public officials in exchange for personal or business gain. That is why Magee was not penalized for paying for McKee’s consulting services in exchange for help steering a $5 million state education contract to Magee’s former colleague.
Common Cause has proposed expanding the definition of “interested persons” to explicitly include lobbyists, following practices adopted in at least 22 other states, according to its letter.

$25 limit may be too low for 2025
A second rule change being contemplated by the ethics panel would increase the monetary value of gifts that public officials or employees can accept. Existing limits of $25 per gift, with no more than $75 worth of gifts from the same person or group per year, were set in 2005. But some state lawmakers want the ethics panel to up the limit, as laid out in legislation sponsored by Senate Majority Leader Frank Ciccone III.
Ciccone’s bill, which received an initial vetting before the Senate Committee on Judiciary on April 8, calls for a $50 per-gift limit, with no more than $250 worth of gifts per year. 
Ciccone, a Providence Democrat, said his proposal aimed to account for inflation.
“If you go to McDonald’s, you can get a great meal for $18,” he told the Senate Committee on Judiciary during a preliminary hearing on April 8. “If we go back to the late ‘90s early 2000s, I think this bill would put us $1 ahead of what it would bring that number to with inflation.” 
A $25 gift in 2005, when Rhode Island last updated its gift limit, equals $41 today based on the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics inflation calculator. A $75 per-year cap in 2005 is the equivalent of $126 today.
Gramitt countered that the Rhode Island Supreme Court in a 1992 advisory opinion empowered the ethics panel — not the legislature — to change the state ethics code.
“We think the Ethics Commission is the proper and appropriate place to handle it,” Gramitt told the judiciary committee on April 8. “We are taking it seriously.”
Examples of public officials or employees violating the existing gift limit are scarce — mostly because the law is very clear, Gramitt said at the April 8 hearing. But when the limit is surpassed, the repercussions are “really bad,” he said.
And they can take years to resolve. 
Ethical violations from a state investigation into the infamous 2023 Philly trip by a pair of former state officials remain pending after one of the officials, former administration director James Thorsen, refused to settle or admit wrongdoing. The panel is expected to get an update on the adjudicative hearing process, for which attorneys are taking depositions, at its June meeting.
Other states have $50 limit
The proposal put before the Ethics Commission Tuesday comes from a review of gift limits for public officials in other states. A $50 per gift limit — with a $150 limit per year — is the most common across states, according to a May 14 letter to the commission from Gramitt. Massachusetts relies on a $50 per limit, while Connecticut limits gifts to no more than $10, with a separate $50 cap for food and beverages.
Gramitt’s letter, however, noted the difficulty in making a direct comparison with other states, based on varied applications of who is subject to gift rules, and a host of exceptions such as for food, drinks and celebration of life events. Some states adjust gift limits based on changes to the consumer price index, Gramitt wrote.
Both changes will go through an extensive internal deliberation and review process before taking public feedback and eventually, a formal vote. Gramitt said he expects the commission will hold public hearings on the proposed changes “by the end of the summer.”
 A two-thirds majority of the nine-member panel is required to approve any changes to the state ethics code.

(Image via Maine Legislature live stream)The U.S. Supreme Court on Tuesday granted an injunction overruling the Maine House of Representatives’ decision to block Maine Rep. Laurel Libby from voting or speaking on the chamber floor after she was censured for posting personal information about a transgender student on her legislative Facebook page.
In a statement, the Republican from Auburn said the ruling was “a victory not just for my constituents, but for the Constitution itself.”
“The Supreme Court has affirmed what should never have been in question — that no state legislature has the power to silence an elected official simply for speaking truthfully about issues that matter,” she said. 
Libby has been barred from speaking on the chamber floor since late February, when the House voted 75-70 along party lines in favor of the censure, which would have ended if the legislator apologized to the body, which she has declined to do. 
Libby petitioned the high court last month after the 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals denied her motion for an expedited appeal to end the censure, which she argued disenfranchised her constituents. 
The ruling was issued by the so-called “shadow docket,” which is traditionally how the court handles procedural matters and does not involve extensive hearings or arguments, and the decisions often come with little-to-no explanation. There was no opinion issued in Libby’s favor. 
However, Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson penned a dissenting opinion, arguing that the case raised a number of important questions about the rights of state legislatures to enforce its rules that the court “neither addressed nor answered.” She also questioned whether Libby’s appeal actually warranted emergency relief. 
“Not very long ago, this Court treaded carefully with respect to exercising its equitable power to issue injunctive relief at the request of a party claiming an emergency,” Jackson wrote. “Those days are no more. Today’s Court barely pauses to acknowledge these important threshold limitations on the exercise of its own authority. It opts instead to dole out error correction as it sees fit, regardless of the lack of any exigency and even when the applicants’ claims raise significant legal issues that warrant thorough evaluation by the lower courts that are dutifully considering them.”
“Also, as a practical matter, it is plainly prudent to reserve our emergency docket for applicants who demonstrate that they truly need our help now,” Jackson added.
Justice Sonia Sotomayor also said she would have denied the application.
The Facebook post at the heart of the dispute is credited with kicking off a firestorm that has since led to the U.S. Department of Justice suing Maine over its protections for transgender students. 
Days after Libby’s viral post, which contained the name and image of a transgender student athlete, President Donald Trump threatened to withhold funding from the state for not complying with his executive order seeking to ban transgender women from competing in sports that correspond with their gender identity.

SPRINGFIELD — A bill to ban the sale of firefighter protective gear containing “forever chemicals” is gaining momentum in the Illinois General Assembly, as lawmakers, union leaders and firefighters themselves warn that the very equipment designed to save lives may be silently endangering them.

House Bill 2409, co-sponsored by Rep. Mike Kelly, D-Chicago, and Sen. Ram Villivalam, D-Chicago, seeks to expand on the state’s existing PFAS Reduction Act by targeting a lesser-addressed but critical source of firefighter exposure to these harmful substances: their turnout gear.

Turnout gear, also known as bunker gear, is the specialized protective clothing worn by firefighters to protect them when they respond to fires or other hazardous situations.

“We know the damage that PFAs can do to our bodies,” Kelly said in an interview. “While this is supposed to protect us, it’s doing us serious harm.”

PFAS have long been used to make products -resistant to water, heat and staining, but research has increasingly linked them to serious health issues, including multiple forms of cancer. According to the Environmental Working Group, an advocacy organization trying to protect environmental health through better industry standards, PFAS were first added to firefighters’ personal protective equipment in 1976.

The bill is backed by the Associated Firefighters of Illinois, a statewide union representing more than 17,000 firefighters and paramedics in 237 communities. Advocates argue that the legislation is crucial in addressing the leading cause of death among firefighters today—chronic illnesses such as cancer.

“Little did we know that the bunker gear, the very gear that is supposed to protect us, to keep us safe, is actually killing us,” AFFI President and retired firefighter Chuck Sullivan said. PFAS are known as “forever chemicals” because they can stay in the human body a long time.

Numerous scientific studies from the American Cancer Society, National Institutes of Health, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention indicate the correlation between exposure to PFAS and the increased number of firefighters developing various forms of cancer. Kelly and Villavalam cited this research as the impetus driving the legislation.

Sullivan said the Illinois bill closely follows similar legislation passed in Massachusetts, Minnesota and Connecticut. Under HB 2409, manufacturers would be banned from selling gear containing PFAS in Illinois after Jan. 1, 2027. In the interim, labeling requirements would take effect beginning in 2026. Fire departments would be mandated to phase out affected equipment, such as self-contained breathing apparatuses or certain rescue harnesses, by 2030.

“When we put our gear on, it's not on the forefront of our mind that that is also dangerous and also giving us additional exposures,” Steve Shetsky, a member of AFFI’s executive board, said. “So this bill would absolutely limit those exposures, which would make this profession safer.”

Retired Chicago Fire Department Lieutenant Jim Tracy knows the risk firsthand. Diagnosed with colon cancer six years ago, he endured chemotherapy, radiation and surgery to eradicate the cancer he blames on the uniform.

“I was 22 years in the field when I got diagnosed,” Tracy said. “It is unfortunately one of those cancers you get from PFAS.”

Tracy, who spent 28 years working as a firefighter, said it was only recently that they received one set of gear that is “99% PFAS free.” The new equipment was delayed in production, he said, because manufacturers had to remove PFAS-laced materials from collars and cuffs and replace them with 100% cotton. Many firefighters, however, still wear older gear that is laden with forever chemicals.

“Personal protective equipment,” Tracy said. “It’s not very protective if it is giving us cancer.”

In addition to his own health battle, Tracy said he has many colleagues in the department who have gotten sick but do not report their illnesses out of fear of losing their jobs.

“They don’t want to get kicked off the job, so they go through it on their own and don’t tell the department,” he said.

‘Financial unknowns, replacements under testing’

HB 2409 passed the House 114-0 on April 10.  It passed a Senate committee unanimously and is awaiting final action on the Senate floor before it can head to Gov. JB Pritzker for a signature.

Despite bipartisan support in both legislative chambers, the Illinois Fire Chiefs Association has been vocal in its opposition to the bill, citing concerns about the availability and cost of compliant gear.

John Buckley, executive director of the IFCA, testified before the Senate Labor Committee on May 6, urging lawmakers to amend the bill to delay the enforcement date.

“Our ask and our solution to the problem was to move the date from Jan. 1, 2027, to Jan. 1, 2029 — to give two years to determine if gear would be available and meet the needs of the firefighters in Illinois,” Buckley said.

While Buckley emphasized that the IFCA supports eradicating PFAS from firefighter gear, he warned that the current timeline does not allow enough time for departments to identify, test and purchase safe alternatives, which he said are not affordable or readily accessible.

“Currently, nothing’s been tested and vetted that meets that requirement,” he said. “The gear that’s out there that is PFAS-free is in very limited use, and some of it does not meet national standards,” Buckley said.





Buckley also pointed out that the proposed legislation lacks a funding mechanism to help departments cover the cost of new gear, which he said could “range from $4,000 to $5,000 per set.”

According to the Office of the Illinois State Fire Marshal, the state has 39,564 firefighters. Outfitting each with PFAS-free equipment could cost between $158 million and $198 million—a significant expense as Illinois faces a tightening budget picture for fiscal year 2026.

Still, sponsors said protecting firefighters from potentially deadly chemical exposure should take precedence over its price tag and logistical concerns.

“Our first responders deserve to work with equipment and clothing that does not pose a risk to their health,” Villivalam said. “This measure ensures they are able to continue to be protected while doing their work effectively.”

Even if HB 2409 becomes law, Buckley said he plans to continue pushing for a 2029 effective date when the 104th General Assembly reconvenes in January 2026.

Mike Kehoe and First Lady Claudia Kehoe take a moment by the casket of Christopher S. “Kit” Bond during a memorial service Tuesday the Missouri State Capitol rotunda (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent).Missouri said goodbye Tuesday to Kit Bond, the Republican former governor, U.S. Senator and auditor who spent 34 of his 86 years in public office.
During a memorial service in the Missouri Capitol Building’s rotunda, Bond was eulogized by John Ashcroft, the Republican who succeeded him in office as governor, and U.S. Rep. Emanuel Cleaver, a Democrat who said the two formed a lifelong friendship during Bond’s first term as governor from 1973 to 1977.
 Kit Bond’s portrait in the Hall of Governor’s is marked by a black band to memorialize his death (Rudi Keller/Missouri Independent).
“Talk is cheap, but doing takes the devotion of one’s lifetime,” Ashcroft said. “Bond was a doer.”
Cleaver said he first met Bond as a civil rights leader, and the friendship was cemented during his time as mayor of Kansas City and when he was elected to Congress in 2004. 
On Cleaver’s arrival in Washington, Bond, starting his fourth term in the Senate, held a reception for the freshman Democrat. They worked together to restore the Liberty Memorial, obtain funds for a new courthouse and find money for bridge and road projects, Cleaver said.
“I will be delighted for the rest of my life to have worked with Kit Bond,” Cleaver said.
The hour-long ceremony also featured prayers from former U.S. Sen. Jack Danforth, an Episcopal priest who, along with Bond and Ashcroft, were the young Republican leaders who broke a Democratic monopoly on state offices in the late 1960s and early 1970s.
Bond’s casket will remain in the rotunda until 1 p.m. Wednesday, when he will be taken to St. Louis for a family memorial service and private interment.
Bond died May 13 and was survived by his wife of 22 years, Linda Holwick Bond, and his son, Samuel.
Bond grew up in Mexico, Missouri, the grandson of the founder of A.P. Green Industries, a fireclay manufacturer and a major employer at the time. He attended a boarding school in Massachusetts, Princeton University as an undergraduate and studied law in Virginia, practicing law in Washington, D.C., until he returned home in 1967. 
Bond lost a bid for Congress in 1968 before winning the race for state auditor in 1970. When he was elected governor in 1972 at the age of 33, he was — and remains — the youngest person ever to win the state’s highest office.
In 2020, veteran journalist Phill Brooks, who covered both Bond administrations for KMOX and the University of Missouri School of Journalism, wrote that Bond won office in 1972 by campaigning on a platform to restrict special interest influence in government.
“His victory empowered him to lead the successful, bipartisan legislative effort for campaign and lobbyist disclosure requirements, as well as the state’s ‘Sunshine Law’ requiring public access to government meetings and records,” Brooks wrote.
In his first term, Bond also won passage of stronger consumer protection laws and, in 1975, issued an executive order rescinding former Gov. Lilburn Boggs’ 1838 order that Mormons “must be exterminated or driven from the state.”
Bond also reorganized state government, taking it from 96 independent agencies to 14 state departments organized along lines of responsibility such as health, education and corrections.
After losing a bid for re-election, Bond made a political comeback in 1980, winning the governor’s office again. He won his seat in the U.S. Senate in 1986 and was re-elected three times.

The turnout Tuesday, which filled the rotunda for the 45-minute memorial service, included former governors Bob Holden and Mike Parson, former U.S. Sen. Roy Blunt, people who had worked with Bond in Jefferson City and Washington, and current officials elected since he left office in 2010.
Warren Erdman, executive vice president-administration and corporate affairs for Kansas City Southern railway, was Bond’s chief of staff in his U.S. Senate office and an aide to Bond in his second term as governor. He said Bond embodied the spirit of the early Pilgrims, who founded a society, described by John Winthrop in 1630, as one of “communal charity, affection and unity.”
“Kit loved and practiced these beliefs throughout his lifetime and in his public service,” Erdmann said. “They were foundational to his approach to public service.”
In his second term as governor, Bond had to deal with state budget shortfalls as the economy weakened. He promoted and won passage of a $600 million construction bond issue to boost employment and renew state facilities.
As a senator, Bond became known for his work on the Senate Intelligence Committee, his commitment to national defense and, as illustrated by buildings like the Christopher S. Bond Life Sciences Center at the University of Missouri, the source of earmarked federal funds for local projects.
When his son was born, Bond was introduced to the program for parental guidance of education that became known as Parents as Teachers. 
“I think that Parents as Teachers is Missouri’s greatest export,” Bond said in an oral history interview in 2014. “We believe that when you advocate Parents as Teachers, you are telling people across the country that Parents as Teachers is Missouri’s greatest export.”
In that same interview, Bond said “the job of governor was one of the most satisfying jobs I’ve ever had.”

Bond’s 1972 victory energized new leaders to go into public service, Ashcroft said in his eulogy.
“Over and over again. Kit launched the careers of young people, talented, committed, dedicated people who later, after appointment, found opportunity beckoning them to achievement levels they had not anticipated,” Ashcroft said.
Danforth, who has parted ways with Republicans over many issues in recent years, said Bond made state government better and enjoyed doing it.
“He elevated the quality of government,” Danforth said. “And besides that, in his day, politics was fun. I don’t think it’s fun anymore.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/052025_kitbond12-1024x667.jpg,,,2025-05-20 16:07:55.502471

The family of the late James Joseph Foster Jr. is suing the City of Sioux City, Sioux City Fire and Rescue, the Sioux City Police Department and 10 of their employees in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Iowa.
The lawsuit claims that in the early hours of Aug. 18, 2023, a Sioux City police officer responded to a call about Foster, who was sitting or lying along the curb of a deserted residential street. Foster told the responding officer he had injured his arm, and eventually eight people from the police department and Sioux City Fire and Rescue responded.
According to the lawsuit, the 26-year-old Foster “never posed any threat” to the responders and was instead acting disoriented and fearful, repeatedly moving away from them.

At one point, paramedic Deanna LaMere allegedly decided the situation called for the use of a chemical restraint in the form of the incapacitating drug ketamine. With the assistance of other responders, Foster was “held down and injected against his will,” the lawsuit claims. “However, instead of injecting him with ketamine, LaMere injected him with a lethal dose of the paralytic medication rocuronium,” the lawsuit states.
The lawsuit claims body-cam footage shows Foster soon was gasping for air while asking, “Am I gonna die?” and repeatedly crying, “I can’t breathe.”
“You’re not gonna die, you’re fine,” Sioux City Police Officer Alan Schmeckpeper allegedly replied.  
“LaMere realized that she had given the incorrect and life-threatening medication rocuronium, but she did not notify anyone, nor did she take any action to protect his airway and/or intubate him before he became paralyzed and unable to breathe,” the lawsuit states. “Not a single person on-scene mentioned Mr. Foster’s objectively obvious respiratory distress and, instead, police officers handcuffed the chemically incapacitated Mr. Foster and strapped him to a gurney.”
Minutes later, Foster lay motionless with his eyes open and one of the individuals on scene told him, “Night-night,” the lawsuit claims.
In an ambulance en route to a hospital, Foster’s heart stopped and LaMere allegedly called ahead and falsely reported Foster had been given a dose of ketamine. Upon their arrival at the hospital, the lawsuit alleges, LaMere “finally informed medical personnel that she had injected him with rocuronium. She then continued her clumsy cover-up when she improperly disposed of the vials of rocuronium and ketamine in a sharps container in contravention of Sioux City Fire and Rescue’s policies and procedures.”
Foster died two days later, allegedly from an anoxic brain injury due to the administration of rocuronium, according to the lawsuit.
Criminal charge filed in the case
The lawsuit claims LaMere falsely recorded in an incident report that she had conducted an advanced life support assessment of Foster when she arrived on scene, although body-cam footage reportedly shows that this was never done. LaMere also is alleged to have falsely recorded that she and her EMT partner had verified the correct dose of the injection administered to Foster,
In addition, the lawsuit alleges LaMere “had one or more incidents similar to the one at issue in this lawsuit that she was not properly disciplined, retrained or dismissed and her employment continued despite her previous failures endangering multiple patients.”
The lawsuit seeks compensation for past and future economic losses and funeral and medical expenses, plus punitive damages. The city has yet to file a response to the allegations, and a representative of the city’s legal department declined on Tuesday to comment on the case.
The individual Sioux City employees named as defendants in the case include LaMere, Drake Carnahan, Dustin L. Johnson, Brandon R. DeRocher, Jordan Reinders, Jim Haden and Randall Wood of Sioux City Fire and Rescue, as well as Schmeckpeper, Carolina Ochoa and Donette Sassman of the Sioux City Police Department.
Separate from the civil lawsuit, court records show that on Jan. 16, 2025, LaMere was criminally charged with involuntary manslaughter and that she entered a not-guilty plea on Feb. 3, 2025.
According to an affidavit filed by Assistant Woodbury County Attorney Loan Hensley, LaMere realized her error when she went back to the ambulance to give what she believed would be a second dose of ketamine to give Foster. LaMere, Hensley states, “did not take the appropriate actions” at that time, and “did not take the appropriate steps to notify anyone or treat the patient any different. It wasn’t until they got to the emergency room at Mercy One Medical Center that the defendant told the ER physician about the medication error.”
A pretrial conference in the case is scheduled for July 18, 2025.
State records indicate LaMere’s paramedic license with the Iowa Bureau of Emergency Medical and Trauma Services is in good standing, with no history of public disciplinary action, and that it expires in March 2027.

(Wes Muller/Louisiana Illuminator)After outcry from several corners of the legal community, Louisiana lawmakers scuttled a controversial proposal backed by Attorney General Liz Murrill that could have moved thousands of criminal cases involving children and teenagers from juvenile to adult courts every year. 
The Louisiana Senate Finance Committee voted 6-5 Monday to reject Senate Bill 74 by Sen. Alan Seabaugh, R-Shreveport. The committee’s decision came a few weeks after state voters overwhelmingly rejected a similar constitutional amendment. 
The legislation would have mostly affected Orleans, Jefferson, East Baton Rouge and Caddo parishes, where juvenile courts operate separately from district courts. 
Larry Frieman, chief deputy attorney general, told senators the bill was crafted specifically to address New Orleans juvenile court judges who are too lenient on the teens and children who come before them. 

“They are one of the ones that have created this problem that we are trying to fix,” Frieman said. 
Pushback for the bill came from a wide swath of people involved in the criminal justice system who often aren’t aligned with each other. District attorneys, public defenders, judges and anti-incarceration groups all spoke out against the proposal. 
“The logistics of it are not as simple as everyone seems to think,” said Kyla Romanach, chief public defender for East Baton Rouge Parish, who opposed the legislation. 
Had it been approved, the bill would have allowed district attorneys and the attorney general to transfer 15- and 16-year-olds accused of felony crimes from juvenile courts to state district courts that mostly handle adult cases. 
District attorneys and the attorney general also would have gained the ability to move cases involving children under 15 accused of any crime, misdemeanor or felony,  from juvenile courts to city and parish courts that focus on adult cases. 
District attorneys can already move 14-, 15-, and 16-year-olds into the adult criminal justice system, but only when they are accused of the most serious crimes such as murder, manslaughter and rape.SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE 

The Louisiana Legislature also passed a statute last year that reclassifies all 17-year-olds as adults in the eyes of the criminal justice system. They are automatically tried in adult court and face adult prison sentences.

The attorney general’s failed legislation would have further blurred the lines between punishments for adults and minors in Louisiana, though the additional children and teenagers transferred from juvenile to adult courts under the bill would have been subjected to juvenile law standards, Frieman said. 

Judges, prosecutors and public defenders from the four parishes with juvenile courts indicated the attorney general’s proposal would cost their courthouses and offices hundreds of thousands of dollars each. 

District attorneys and public defenders from East Baton Rouge, Jefferson and Caddo all said they would have to hire more staff to track cases in juvenile and district court if the legislation had been approved. 
Federal and state law also require minors to be separated from adult detainees. District courthouses in the four affected parishes don’t have the appropriate accommodations for minors and would have had to retrofit their buildings. 

East Baton Rouge judges said the changes they would have to undertake at their courthouse would have cost between $3 million and $10 million, according to a legislative financial analysis.

Legislators initially delayed a vote on the bill last week over questions about the accuracy of the financial analysis attached to it. An earlier version didn’t have as many of the potential costs included, in part, because State Public Defender Rémy Starns told the legislative staff to disregard information about potential expenses. 
Daniel Druilhet, a member of the Legislative Fiscal Office staff,  said Starns asked him to ignore any costs public defenders had initially said would be associated with the attorney general’s proposal. 
“[W]hile I did receive an initial response from the Office of the State Public Defender, including information from those four jurisdictions related to potential costs, I was contacted by Mr. Starns on May 2, 2025, instructing me not to include that cost in the fiscal note,” Druilhet told senators at a public hearing last week. 
In response to Druilhet’s comments, the senators put off a vote on the matter for a week so a new financial write-up could be put together. 

Sen. Katrina Jackson-Andrews, D-Monroe, chastised Starns for intervening in the legislative process. 

“I want our state employees to understand there’s not a time when they can tell our fiscal office  not to consider costs that have been submitted,” she said after Druilhet’s testimony. 
Starns told Jackson he had decided, after an amendment was added to the legislation, that the expenses his office had turned over to the fiscal office were no longer relevant. 
Starns has been working closely with the attorney general on other criminal justice bills filed this session that would give Starns more authority over local public defender office budgets and personnel.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/IMG_5974-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-20 16:07:55.502471

(Lindsey Toomer/Colorado Newsline)A coalition of groups that reject transgender rights sued Colorado officials Monday over a newly signed law that put protections for transgender people, and how they are addressed, into Colorado’s anti-discrimination law.
The lawsuit, filed in the U.S. District Court of Colorado, alleges that House Bill 25-1312 violates the First and 14th Amendments .
“The purpose of H.B. 25-1312 is clear. The law punishes those who refuse to speak using chosen names and pronouns, and it does so in order to suppress traditional beliefs about sex and gender. In other words, the law openly discriminates based on viewpoint,” lawyers for the plaintiffs wrote.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The lawsuit was brought by the Virginia-based conservative group Defending Education, the Colorado Parent Advocacy Network, Protect Kids Colorado, a health group called Do No Harm, and Grand Junction dermatologist Dr. Travis Morrell. CPAN and PKC are both parental-rights groups that advocate against “gender ideology” topics in schools, often from a far-right perspective.
It names Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser, a Democrat, and the members of Colorado’s Civil Rights Division as defendants.
HB-1312, also known as the Kelly Loving Act after a transgender woman who died in the 2022 Club Q shooting, expands Colorado’s anti-discrimination laws to include a person’s chosen name and pronouns. Those laws apply to workplaces, schools and other places of public accommodation.
The law also includes provisions to make it easier for transgender people to change their name and gender markers on birth certificates, drivers licenses and marriage documents.
It was sponsored by Rep. Lorena Garcia of Adams County, Rep. Rebekah Stewart of Lakewood, Sen. Faith Winter of Broomfield and Sen. Chris Kolker of Centennial. It passed with entirely Democratic support, and Gov. Jared Polis signed it on May 16.
The bill was amended to remove several controversial provisions during the legislative process and faced stiff opposition from Republicans and conservative groups, including the parties in the new lawsuit.
They allege in the filing that the law could impact their ability to hold public advocacy events, publish materials and do other work. CPAN and PKC use “biologically accurate pronouns and birth names” for transgender people, a practice also known as misgendering and deadnaming. The groups worry that continuing to use those names and pronouns will result in an investigation from the state’s civil rights commission and individual lawsuits.
They argue that recent legal decisions — including 303 Creative v. Elenis, where a Colorado website designer did not want to create a hypothetical website for a gay couple — support the claim that HB-1312 unconstitutionally compels speech, in this case forcing them to refer to a transgender person by their name.
The lawsuit repeatedly misgenders and deadnames state Rep. Brianna Titone, former state legislative candidate Vivian Smotherman and transgender social media influencer Dylan Mulvaney.
“When CPAN and (Executive Director) Ms. Gimelshteyn use birth names and biologically accurate pronouns, they are not doing so to be malicious or hurtful. They do so because this expression reflects their deeply held beliefs that sex is fixed in each person from the moment of conception and cannot be changed,” the lawsuit says. If they cannot use that language, their impact will be “greatly diminished.”
Morrell, the dermatologist, contended in the lawsuit that using someone’s “biological pronouns” is necessary for clear communication, as a person’s sex assigned at birth could be important when determining proper treatment.
Representatives from the Colorado Civil Rights Division and the attorney general’s office were unable to comment on the litigation.

Ron DeSantis speaking at the Vault in Tampa on May 20, 2025 (Photo by Mitch Perry/ Florida Phoenix)When Gov. Ron DeSantis suspended two Democratic state attorneys in recent years, he contended that both deserved to be removed because they were ignoring the law and not following their duties. But when asked on Tuesday in Tampa why he now supports his hand-picked attorney general saying that he wouldn’t defend the state law banning individuals 21 and under from purchasing a long gun, the governor called it a “different situation.”
DeSantis told a Phoenix reporter at a news conference in Tampa Tuesday morning that he stands behind Attorney General James Uthmeier’s decision to not fight the law if the case is accepted by the U.S. Supreme Court.
“You have an obligation to support and defend the Constitution,” he said. “And there are times when you have to make judgments about that. Now, those state attorneys were basically saying that they didn’t want to enforce statutes that the Legislature had done. They made their arguments as to why, but ultimately, I didn’t find those arguments to be persuasive.”
Uthmeier stated in March that if the National Rifle Association decided to appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court a ruling by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit denying their claim that Florida’s 2018 law barring individuals under the age of 21 from buying a long gun is unconstitutional, his office would not defend the law in front of the nine justices in Washington D.C.  That possibility now exists after the NRA announced on Friday that they would appeal the 11th Circuit’s ruling to the highest court in the land (the Supreme Court has not said if it will hear the case).
Uthmeier has not said anything publicly about the NRA lawsuit since the gun rights organization filed the appeal on Friday
DeSantis said Tuesday that he personally has always believed the law to be unconstitutional. That measure was passed just weeks after the mass shooting at Parkland on Feb. 14, 2018, that claimed the lives of 17 people. The governor said that “it was an emotional time” in describing why the GOP-controlled Legislature passed the law, which received bipartisan support and was signed by Republican Gov. Rick Scott. But he maintains that Uthmeier’s stance to not fight for the law in the U.S. Supreme Court is a “good faith position” because he doesn’t believe it’s consistent with the state Constitution.
“So that’s different than just saying that laws that have been passed you don’t like,” he added. “You can say that they’re unconstitutional, but that’s gotta be credible. It is credible. There’s a lot of people who have contested the constitutionality of suspending entirely someone’s right under an enumerated provision of the Constitution. I mean, I’m not just saying, ‘I have a right to this.’ There’s an enumerated provision. You’ve got people that are 18 years old that will be sent halfway around the world to carry a rifle in the Marine Corps. Then they finish that and they’re 20 and they can’t buy a rifle to go hunt? I think that’s a big problem.”
While the 11th Circuit has denied the NRA’s case, other federal courts have split on the issue of whether adults under 21 enjoy Second Amendment rights. The 3rd, 5th and 8th circuits have ruled that they do, while the 10th and 11th circuits have upheld laws banning firearm purchases by adults under 21.
When DeSantis suspended Hillsborough County State Attorney Andrew Warren in August 2022, he said “State attorneys have a duty to prosecute crimes as defined in Florida law, not to pick and choose which laws to enforce based on his personal agenda.”
The Phoenix reached out to Andrew Warren for a response.

“It’s clearly hypocritical,” he said in an email. “Asking him to explain himself is a complete waste of breath; they all lie with impunity.”
Warren was unsuccessful in his court battle to win his seat back, and ended up losing to Republican Suzy Lopez, the woman DeSantis appointed to replace him, last fall. The other state attorney the governor suspended, Orange/Osceola County State Attorney Monique Worrell did win her seat back last fall, defeating candidate Andrew Bain, whom the governor appointed to replace Worrell in 2023.
DeSantis has said that he also backs Uthmeier’s decision not to obey a federal court order requiring law enforcement agencies in Florida to halt immigration arrests under a new state law. That federal judge has said that Uthmeier needs to show cause why he should not be held in contempt or sanctioned for violating her order and will hold a hearing on the matter next week.
The Florida House of Representatives in March repealed the ban by supporting a measure that would lower the age for individuals in Florida to purchase shotguns and rifles from 21 to 18. It was the third year in a row they have done so, but none of those proposals ever reached DeSantis’ desk because the Florida Senate chose not to follow suit.
A gun safety advocate blasted the decision by DeSantis and Uthmeier to not stand up for the law banning individuals under 21 from being able to purchase a long gun.
“Florida’s law was passed in the wake of the devastating Parkland mass shooting, and it’s beyond doubt constitutional. (U.S.) Attorney General Pam Bondi and her successors defended this lifesaving law against the NRA’s attacks for years as Florida’s attorney general, and ultimately the 11th Circuit upheld it by a vote of 8 to 4, in a decision joined by both Republican and Democratic appointees,” said Janet Carter, managing director of Second Amendment litigation at Everytown Law. “It is absurd for Florida’s governor and new attorney general to try and claim otherwise, especially when research shows prohibiting 18-20 year-olds from purchasing firearms is a commonsense tool for preventing gun violence.”

(Perry Bennett | West Virginia Legislative Photography)The West Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals says convictions must stand against three adults who are in prison for their roles in the death of 8-year-old Raylee Browning.
The high-profile case has spurred attempted legislative changes — a bill known as “Raylee’s Law” — by a Democratic lawmaker who says the state’s limited homeschool regulations create a loophole to shield child abuse and neglect. Raylee was being homeschooled. 
The girl was underweight when she died in 2018 from sepsis because of a severe bacterial pneumonia infection. Raylee’s father, Marty Browning Jr., his wife and another adult ignored her deteriorating condition, a judge said, and court records said the adults failed to provide medicine or water. They were found guilty of neglect and sentenced to prison for 3 to 15 years. 
Marty Browning, his wife Julie Browning and Sherie Titchenell each appealed their convictions for a list of reasons that included a denial to a speedy trial and improperly admitting certain evidence. 
In three separate opinions issued Monday, the state Supreme Court denied their appeals, upholding the adults’ 2022 convictions in Fayette County Circuit Court.
Browning had been removed her from public school after her teachers reported suspected child abuse to Child Protective Services. According to testimony during the adults’ trial, CPS didn’t respond to the referral. 
The legislation, sponsored for multiple years by Del. Shawn Fluharty, D-Ohio, seeks to pause a parent’s request to homeschool if there’s a pending child abuse investigation against the parent.
A bill including Raylee’s Law passed the House of Delegates this year, but wasn’t taken up by the Senate.

Taylor, who was elected to the Court of Appeals in 2023, will run against conservative Justice Rebecca Bradley in a race that will decide if liberals expand their majority on the Court. 
The two previous state Supreme Court elections, which consolidated the current 4-3 liberal majority, broke national spending records for judicial races. While the stakes won’t be as high in next year’s race, Bradley has been a prominent supporter of conservative causes since she was appointed to the Court by Gov. Scott Walker in 2015. 
Bradley sided with President Donald Trump in his effort to overturn the results of the 2020 election and has been a vocal member of the right-wing Federalist Society. 
The election takes place just seven months before the midterm elections when statewide offices including governor and attorney general, as well as control of the Legislature, will be up for grabs — giving the state a view of the voting public’s mood before November. 
Taylor previously worked as Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin’s public policy director and served in the Assembly from 2013 until she was appointed to the Dane County Circuit Court in 2020. 
“As an attorney, public servant, and now as a judge, I’ve always been committed to making sure everyone is able to access our justice system,” Taylor said in a statement. “The law is a powerful tool for protecting Wisconsinites, holding people accountable, and making our state stronger.” 
“Justices on the Wisconsin Supreme Court must be fair, independent, and impartial,” Taylor said. “Justice Rebecca Bradley has proven that she’s more interested in pushing her own right-wing political agenda than protecting Wisconsinites’ rights and freedoms. Extremism and partisanship have no place on our state’s highest court. Everyone who comes before the court deserves to be heard, respected, and treated equally – that’s exactly what I’ll do as a Wisconsin Supreme Court Justice.”
While Taylor has been elected to office six times, she has only faced a Republican opponent once. She ran unopposed for her Madison-area Assembly seat in 2012, 2014 and 2018. When she had an opponent in 2016, she won with 83% of the vote. She also ran unopposed for re-election to the Dane County Court in 2021 and for her seat on the District IV Court of Appeals in 2023. 
In a statement, Republican Party of Wisconsin Chair Brian Schimming noted that she’s never had to win the votes of people outside of heavily Democratic Dane County.
“Chris Taylor’s extreme partisan record has never been on full display outside of Dane County,” Schimming said. “After ‘liberal express lane’ elections in Dane County and an appointment from Tony Evers, Radical Democrat Chris Taylor will now have to answer for her extremely partisan record in the Legislature and on the bench.”

As a result, new premium hikes are on the way for employees, retirees and their families to close the gap.(Stock photo by Wichayada Suwanachun/Getty Images)  State Treasurer Brad Briner has been sounding the alarm for months. Faced with a $507 million deficit, North Carolina’s State Health Plan will require a combination of strategies to address the fiscal cliff and ensure the long-term care of the plan’s nearly 750,000 teachers and state employees.
On Tuesday, the State Health Plan’s Board of Trustees gave its initial approval to a series of actions that would reorient the plan, incentivizing members to use “bundled” participating providers or facilities.
  Treasurer Brad Briner and State Health Plan trustees discuss benefit changes to help stabilize the system. (Screengrab from May 20, 2025 meeting)
State employees and teachers would also be asked to do their part by paying higher health insurance premiums starting in 2026.
“We began this conversation in January around premium increases for the first time in eight years, a tack that nobody wanted to take,” said state Treasurer Brad Briner. “But buried in the materials here, you’ll see that what was going to be a $20 (monthly) premium increase at the lowest tier. It’s now a $5 premium increase at the lowest tier.”
Briner said significant time has been spent trying to insulate North Carolina’s lowest compensated employees from increases as much as possible, while determining the highest and best use of the dollars that are available. Out-of-pocket maximums would not change substantially, he pledged.
The State Health Plan is also taking steps towards eliminating all prior authorizations for independent primary care, another incentive for plan participants.
Thomas Friedman, executive administrator of the State Health Plan, said state employees who are members of the plan can expect several changes in the months ahead. For starters, the names of the most common plans will change.
  Source: State Health Plan presentation
The 70/30 plan will become the “Standard PPO plan” with annual deductibles rising from $1,500 to $3,000 for individuals, and families seeing their deductibles rise from $4,500 to $9,000. The average monthly premium would jump from $25 per month to $40 per month and could be adjusted higher based on the employee’s salary.
The 80/20 plan will be known as the “Plus PPO Plan” with annual deductibles rising from $1,250 to $1,500 for individuals, and from $3,250 for families under the current plan rising to $4,500. Those on the 80/20 plan would see their premiums jump from an average of $50 per month to $100. Higher income earners could see a monthly premium of $130.
While the numbers may not be popular with state workers or teachers, trustee Dr. Brad Miller noted that on the private insurance market, individuals are paying an average premium of $119 a month, with families paying a premium of $532.

What members pay for prescription drugs would also rise next year and in some cases substantially. Specialty medications (Tier 5) would increase from $350 under the current 70/30 plan to $600 under the new Standard plan.
Friedman noted that manufacturer coupons exist for many high-end, specialty drugs, allowing patients to pay little or nothing at all.
“Why not have the manufacturers pay more if they’re willing to do it?” Friedman offered.
Coverage of the popular GLP-1 weight loss drugs remains “under development,” but nutrition and weight loss coaching would be available to everyone.
Moving forward, the State Health Plan is working to make it attractive to members – both financially and in terms of access – to engage with preferred providers.
Tuesday’s meeting of the Board of Trustees came as members of the state House advanced their own budget blueprint.
Friedman said that both the House and Senate budget proposals have fully funded the requests of the State Health Plan at a 5% premium increase per year.
“Given everything going on in the state and how little the budget increased, we are a substantial portion of that, and we are very grateful that they listened.”
Treasurer Briner also offered praise for the budget proposal emerging from the House.
“The House proposal fully funds the pension plan and increases funding to the State Health Plan to help in our effort to provide affordable, high-quality health care for state workers. Investments made in salary increases and cost-of-living bonuses will help ensure that the state can retain top talent.”

But Tamika Walker Kelly, president of the North Carolina Association of Educators, said that the legislature should step up its funding, rather than ask school employees and state workers to shoulder higher health care costs.
“It’s not only unfair, but it is unsustainable,” Walker-Kelly told the trustees.
“We are already facing a critical staffing shortage, more than 8,000 school positions were vacant at the start of this year and one-in-five teachers left the classroom over the past two years. If we increase the cost for those who stay, how will we fill the gaps and who will be there for our students?”
Walker-Kelly said the decision is not simply about numbers on a spreadsheet; it is about the people who keep our schools and state services running.
A vote by the board to set the premiums for 2026 is set for Mid-August. Open enrollment with the new 2026 rates will be October 13-31.

(Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — CoreCivic will know by Friday whether it will have to delay plans to begin holding Immigration and Customs Enforcement detainees in June at its Leavenworth facility.
The city of Leavenworth in March filed suit in U.S. District Court asking for an injunction barring CoreCivic from moving forward on a contract with ICE to turn its closed Leavenworth prison into an immigrant detention facility.
The city also asked the court to determine whether CoreCivic must obtain a special use permit before reopening the prison, as the two parties disagree about whether CoreCivic falls under the city’s development regulations.
U.S. District Judge Toby Crouse heard more than two hours of arguments Tuesday and questioned attorneys about why the injunction should be put in place. He promised a quick decision so the city would have time to appeal, if necessary, before CoreCivic follows through on its stated intent of reopening the facility June 1 as the Midwest Regional Reception Center.
“The complaint talks a lot about the scene on the ground,” Crouse said. “I’m not focused on whether this is a good idea or a bad idea.”
Crouse referred to the city’s initial filing that, in part, highlighted what it called the “unquantifiable harm caused by CoreCivic’s mismanagement.” 
The city’s filing alleged difficulties CoreCivic caused in Leavenworth in the past, including failing to cooperate with city police, failing to report the death of an inmate for six days and “routinely refusing to turn over evidence.” 
Instead, Crouse spent his time questioning whether the city and its attorney, Joseph Hatley, had included a good cause of action in its filings. A cause of action, according to Cornell Law School, is “a set of predefined factual elements that allow for a legal remedy.”
“What basis do I have to act?” Crouse asked Hatley.
Hatley told the judge and asserted in an interview after the hearing that a solid cause of action was CoreCivic officials declining to apply for a special use permit as required by Leavenworth development regulations.
The city of Leavenworth put development regulations in place in 2012, during the time when CoreCivic ran the prison as the Leavenworth Detention Center. At that point, it was grandfathered in because it was already operating, Hatley said.
However, the facility closed in 2021 and has not operated as a detention center since, Hatley said. That means CoreCivic must get a special use permit to reopen, a statement CoreCivic attorney Taylor Hausmann said was inaccurate.
She told Crouse that because CoreCivic has not changed the business it operates at the facility, which was open from 1992 to 2021 as a detention facility, and because they did not abandon the facility, they should not need to get a new special use permit.
Hausmann also said she believes the actions the city is taking are politically motivated. 
“We think it is telling that the decision to attempt to revoke the special use did not come until after CoreCivic entered into a contract with ICE,” she said. “That’s really what this is about, to leverage greater control over CoreCivic’s operations at the MRRC. We don’t think that’s appropriate.”
Hatley said the city had not filed in court previously because CoreCivic initially agreed with the city and in February applied for a special use permit. Then the company withdrew that application in February and said it did not think one was needed.

Hatley said an injunction stopping CoreCivic from housing ICE detainees at the facility would be a temporary measure while CoreCivic walked through the process of getting a special use permit.
“We’re not talking about lengthy delay, 2 to 3 months,” he said.
Leavenworth Mayor Holly Pittman, who attended the hearing along with several other city officials, said after the hearing that the city would be amenable to working with CoreCivic.
“I think we’d entertain any business, but they need to do it the right way,” she said.
City manager Scott Peterson, also at the hearing, denied that Leavenworth’s actions are politically motivated.
More than 20 people gathered outside the Frank Carlson Federal Building in Topeka where the court hearing was held to protest CoreCivic and the for-profit detention of immigrants. Many were part of the Kansas Interfaith Action advocacy group, said Rabbi Moti Rieber, who spoke passionately about why he objected to reopening the Leavenworth prison as an ICE facility.
He called CoreCivic a “bad corporate actor.”
“It’s the confluence of a lot of dysfunction,” Rieber said. “The private prison industry and Trump’s racist immigration policies are all coming together. At the current time, we’re seeing Trump’s ICE gestapo taking people off the streets, putting them in prison without due process. CoreCivic wants to take advantage of that.”
Others, like Pastor Jordan Stone from Atonement Lutheran Church in Overland Park, said this went against her faith.
“I think caring for our neighbors, caring for the least of these is important,” she said. “Standing up as a person of faith and saying this is not okay is important.” 
Stone said others may have different viewpoints about that, but she believes it comes from a place of fear.
“I think it doesn’t come from a place of caring,” she said.
Pastor Joanna Harader, of Bethel College Mennonite Church in Newton, spoke against private prisons and CoreCivic’s track record. She also was concerned about the current administration’s treatment of immigrants. 
“I’m disturbed by the lack of due process being given to immigrants,” Harader said.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/P5200575-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-05-20 16:07:55.502471

Long, who worked as an auctioneer before serving six terms representing a Southwest Missouri congressional district, also denied seeking donations from anyone associated with those companies that he used to pay off a personal loan he gave to his unsuccessful 2022 campaign for U.S. Senate. 
“You know as well as I do that anytime you’re dealing with the (Federal Elections Commission), you have to follow FEC guidelines,” Long told members of the U.S. Senate Finance Committee on Tuesday. “And that’s exactly what I did all the way through.”
Democrats on the committee were not convinced that Long didn’t ask for the money.
“You expect us to believe that the money just fell out of the sky and it showed up in your campaign treasury?” said U.S. Sen. Ron Wyden, a Democrat from Oregon. 
In December, Trump nominated Long to lead the IRS. At the time, Long’s campaign committee had $130,000 in debt — money that Long had loaned the campaign himself.
By early January, his Senate campaign committee raised $137,000, with much of the money coming from executives at companies that have been accused of selling fraudulent tax credits.
Billy Long’s bid to lead IRS under scrutiny over donations that paid off personal debt

In addition to the campaign donations, Wyden hammered Long for allegedly raking in “referral fees, steering clients to firms that sold fake tax shelters and pushing small businesses to unknowingly commit tax fraud.”
A financial disclosure Long submitted as part of his confirmation process shows him receiving at least $5,000 in compensation from White River, an Arkansas-based oil and gas company that sold a tax credit that the IRS says doesn’t actually exist. 
White River said in a statement that Long made an “insignificant amount of referrals of these credits to third parties” for the company, and that no federal agency has ever told it the credits are invalid. 
Long on Tuesday denied he’d ever met or interacted with anyone at White River and claimed he had only referred the credits to a few friends.
The Missouri Republican also faced tough questions from U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a Massachusetts Democrat, over whether President Donald Trump is allowed to use the IRS to strip organizations of their nonprofit status.
Warren pointed to a portion of federal law that prohibits any member of the executive branch to request the IRS to conduct or terminate an audit on a taxpayer. 
“In the first place, he wouldn’t do that,” Long said.
“That’s not my question, Mr. Long,” Warren responded. 
A few seconds of back and forth later, Long said he was “going to follow the law,” but that “I’d have to go to the lawyers at the IRS to tell me.” 
Warren wasn’t impressed. 
“If you think follow the law is you get to make it up on the spot,” she said, “then you don’t get to be the IRS commissioner.” 
U.S. Sen. Raphael Warnock, a Georgia Democrat, continued the line of questioning later, pressing Long over whether he had previously said he would ignore an order from Trump to audit a taxpayer. 
“I think I told you that he wouldn’t do that in the first place,” Long responded, “but if he did, I’d do exactly what you said. So, yes.”
In his opening statement, Long vowed to make long-needed changes at the agency if confirmed to be the next IRS commissioner. And if he isn’t ultimately confirmed, he’ll gladly head back to Missouri.  
“I have the opportunity to make real transformational change to an agency that needs it more than any other federal agency,” he said. “Or I can go back home to southwest Missouri where the fish are biting and as they say, they ain’t going to catch themselves.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/candidatefilingday02222022000027-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-20 16:07:55.502471

In a letter to President Trump and Health and Human Services Secretary Robert Kennedy Jr, the Democrats said public health shouldn’t be a “casualty of political ideology” and called on the administration to reverse its policies.
“We are especially alarmed by the termination of $42 million in grants for HIV research. Florida has the third-highest rate of new HIV diagnoses in the country, and our communities rely on these programs to test, treat and prevent the spread of HIV.

“The minor events of history are valuable, though not always showy or picturesque.” — Mark Twain, 1891
“I always say ‘tariffs’ is the most beautiful word to me in the dictionary.” — Donald Trump, 2025
If I could slow time down just a kiss it would all come back, clear as that wink of a moon over freshly planted rows of cotton on Trout Valley Farm. Seems like only yesterday I was living out my calling, farming with my family in Tallahatchie County. The year before we had picked our best crop on record, and 2018 promised healthier markets for the fiber. Heading into spring I couldn’t wait to prep fields for planting. 
As farmers we are fundamentally hopeful people. The mere act of putting a seed into the earth and hanging the well-being of an entire family on it is itself an act of radical hope. As I once heard my father say, “Every year I take all I have and all I hope to ever have and plow it into the ground.”
And so, we entered the 2018 planting season with even more cotton acres than 2017. We didn’t know then there was doom on the horizon, though no one in our universe had ever heard of Wuhan, China.
And yet, China loomed large in our daily discussions about the future. A trade war simmered throughout the Spring. It was like the child’s game “King of the Hill: Tariff Edition.” The contestants: President Trump and General Secretary Xi JinPing. Every time cotton and grain markets went on a run, a presidential tweet or an announcement from Beijing would send commodities tumbling, as Sisyphus after a traipse up the mountain. 
By 2019 the markets were severely depressed for both. A tariff-induced depressed market, untimely drought, runaway production costs, and uncertainty due to the trade war forced us to close the doors on a 148-year-old, multi-generational, family-run farm. We became another victim of economic central planning and the hapless confluence of calamitous circumstances.

It caused my wife, our young daughter and me to upend our lives. The dream I worked for all my adult life and upon which my future depended, dead. At 40-years old, I had to recalibrate. My wife and I had to move from my community where we were both hopeful and active participants in its revitalization. 
In 2019, there was a 20% increase in farm bankruptcies across America. And this despite government largesse in the form of an inflation-inducing 28-billion-dollar bailout. While bankruptcies ran rampant, we don’t even know the total number of farmers who simply stopped, as we did, rented their land and moved away. In the final accounting, we’ll likely find that depopulation and dispossession of our rural and agricultural class is what led to America’s demise. 
While a farm is a dynamic and complex enterprise whereby any number and any combination of things can cause its failure, there is one thing that poses a greater immediate threat to any farm at any moment: Tariffs. 
Agrarian people have always known this. Our history is replete with political and sectional strife over the federal government’s use of tariffs and the redistributionism that comes with it. This history needs a little sunshine as agricultural people have always pulled the short straw with protectionist tariffs. 
The current iteration, as far as I can tell, is a negotiating tactic, yes. Revenue tariffs, it seems. But, President Trump has also been adamant that they are protectionist, intended to bring manufacturing jobs back, which, of course, is a laudable goal. It’s not clear that further impoverishing farm families, many of whom are already in financial straits, is the way to do it.
A recent Farm Journal poll showed that 54% of farmers don’t support tariffs as a negotiating strategy. The same poll found a bleak 92% of agriculture economists believe tariffs will hurt farmers in the long run. All the while the number of farmers has dwindled to a point where we are no longer a statistically significant parcel of the population.
Conflicts concerning tariffs along the urban/agricultural divide go back to the early years of the Republic. In 1816 Congress approved the first protective tariff, the Dallas Tariff at 20% to help pay off the debt from the War of 1812. They also wanted to level the playing field between English manufacturing and the nascent attempt at industrialism in the North. In 1824, the Sectional Tariff on imported goods went to 33% . In another four years the “Tariff of Abominations” placed a 38% tax on 92% of imported goods. Each of these found opposition across the South, as Southern farmers sold their crops and bought their goods on the international market. So, they had to pay more for goods and sell their crops for less, as we did in 2018.
South Carolina threatened secession. By 1832, South Carolina had the support of several states and declared these tariffs unconstitutional, thus unenforceable. President Andrew Jackson threatened the unthinkable: using the military to go to South Carolina and collect the duties at gun point. In 1833, President Jackson successfully urged Congress to pass the Force Act, to get the authority to do it. Henry Clay (architect of the American System agenda) and John C. Calhoun (Jackson’s vice president) avoided a disaster by reaching a compromise to incrementally reduce the tariffs, thereby stopping the Nullification Crisis from devolving into violence.
By 1842 Northern industrial interests were back at it with the Black Tariff. This put rates back around the levels of the “Tariff of Abominations.” The South howled claiming revolution was the only solution for this issue. James Polk won the next election and started reducing the tariff. The Walker Tariff of 1846 lowered the average rate to 25%. This stimulated trade and led to higher government revenues. While other major sectional differences persisted, on the tariff front, at least, the sections seemed satisfied.
In 1857, however, with a healthy tariff of around 15%, it began to fall apart. There was a financial panic that year caused by several converging events. However, a leading economist – Henry Carey, a Republican and avowed protectionist– laid the whole thing at the feet of the lower tariffs.
Due to Carey’s prominence, Rep. Justin Smith Morrill (R., Vermont), a founder of the Republican Party, recruited him to help develop a new tariff. For two years, prior to 1860, Congress debated the Morrill Tariff. It didn’t pass until after Abraham Lincoln’s election once states had started to secede. James Buchanan signed it into law on March 2, 1861, two days before Lincoln’s inauguration. 
As early as 1832, in the midst of the Nullification Crises, Lincoln said, “I am in favor of the internal improvement system and a high protective tariff,” before adding 28 years later in 1860, “My views have undergone no change… the tariff is to the government what a meal is to a family.” The Morrill tariff both informed and defined U.S. trade policy until the second incarnation of the income tax in 1913.
So, in terms of cultural differences in economic philosophy, what does this history verify except that farmers and stakeholders in an agricultural economy dependent on foreign trade have always vehemently advocated for free trade and against protectionist tariffs. And, that protectionist tariffs are a fundamental part of the Republican Party’s DNA. In fact, the Republican Party’s platform from 1860 featured the tariff as its 12th plank.
Mike Wagner, who owns Two Brooks Rice and farms grain in the Delta commiserated recently, “This tariff talk comes at the worst possible time for many of America’s farmers. There’s a perfect storm of conditions already [rising taxes, land/equipment/production costs] …China has not bought U.S. corn or soy since Jan. 16th.” After a pensive pause, he continued, “This happened most recently during the 45th presidency, and our export capacity never regained its footing…when agricultural markets are lost, the loss is permanent or gruelingly regained. A nation that can’t maintain the foundational part of its economy that farming is, and won’t support her growers, sacrifices her best defense.”
To better understand the impact of these particular tariffs, I spoke with Hank Reichle, president and CEO of Staplcotn, the oldest and largest cotton cooperative in the U.S. Echoing Mark Twain, he proffered, “By the way, history rhymes. Here we go again, like the Nullification Crisis, where agrarian South Carolina was concerned with tariffs restricting commerce, this time states concerned with the same are actually taking the President to court over the tariffs. 
“Compared to President Trump’s first term, this trade war is a little different because it doesn’t involve only China. Tariffs are only good for farmers if they create a competitive marketing advantage.” Reiterating the danger to farmers, he explained, “Tariffs slow the global economic growth that fuels consumption and so decreases demand for commodities.”
But, Reichle doesn’t only predict despair and doom. Due to the reciprocal nature of the context President Trump created, we could see commodity markets rise as new markets open to U.S. farmers. According to Reichle, “…there are several countries that buy a significant amount of cotton on the export market who could easily increase purchases from the U.S. while decreasing them from the likes of Brazil and Australia…”
Tenuous as it is, I worry for all my friends still farming and welcome this bit of hope. This is a year wherein the lives of many farmers and their families’ futures hang in the balance. If we get to harvest without a solution, it will not bode well for any of us. For without farmers prayerfully, hopefully and profitably “plowing all they have into the ground” every year, American society and its position in the world will crumble. 
Our greatest hope now is that our representatives in Washington remember their constituents and make deals (and tax cuts) that are in our best interest. Quickly.
Or, as Wagner put it, “Farming has always been a full contact sport…We need leadership. Not leadershit.”

Free.,RFK Jr. insists upcoming 'Make America Healthy Again' report won’t target farming,Jennifer Shutt,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/rfk-jr-insists-upcoming-make-america-healthy-again-report-wont-target-farming,,"WASHINGTON — U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. testified before Congress on Tuesday that a major report due out later this week from his agency will not disparage farmers or a commonly used pesticide.Kennedy, who has long been critical of certain aspects of modern agriculture and processed food, at a U.S. Senate hearing urged lawmakers to read the widely anticipated “Make America Healthy Again” report once it's published Thursday, but didn’t go into details about any possible recommendations.“Everybody will see the report,” Kennedy said. “And there's nobody that has a greater commitment to the American farmer than we do. The MAHA movement collapses if we can't partner with the American farmer in producing a safe, robust and abundant food supply.”His comments followed stern questioning from Mississippi Republican Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith, who said she had read news reports from ""reliable sources” that the MAHA Commission’s initial assessment “may unfairly target American agriculture, modern farming practices and the crop protection tools that roughly 2% of our population relies on to help feed the remaining 98%.”“If Americans lose confidence in the safety and integrity of our food supply due to the unfounded claims that mislead consumers, public health will be at risk,” Hyde-Smith said. “I've said this before, and it's worth saying again, countries have gone to war over many things — politics, religion, race, trade, natural resources, oil, pride, you name it — but threaten a nation's food supply and allow people to go hungry. Let's see what happens then.”Hyde-Smith, who was her home state’s commissioner of agriculture and commerce from 2012 to 2018, probed Kennedy about his past work in environmental law and whether he might be inserting “confirmation bias” into the forthcoming report.She asked Kennedy if he would try to change the current approval for glyphosate, a commonly used herbicide, that she referred to as “one of the most thoroughly studied products of its kind.”“We're talking about more than 1,500 studies and 50-plus years of review by the EPA and other leading global health authorities that have affirmed its safety when used as directed,"" Hyde-Smith said. ""Have you been able to review thousands of studies and decades of scientific review in a matter of months?""Kennedy responded that her “information about the report is just simply wrong.”“The drafts that I've seen, there is not a single word in them that should worry the American farmer,” Kennedy said.Hyde-Smith continued her questioning and told Kennedy that it would be “a shame if the MAHA commission issues reports suggesting, without substantial facts and evidence, that our government got things terribly wrong when it reviewed a number of crop protection tools and deemed them to be safe.”Home energy program in MaineSeveral other Republicans on the Senate Appropriations Labor-HHS-Education Subcommittee raised concerns during the two-hour hearing about how Kennedy has run HHS since they confirmed him in February.Maine Sen. Susan Collins, chairwoman of the full Appropriations Committee, brought up the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, or LIHEAP, which the Trump administration has called on Congress to eliminate.“The LIHEAP program, which we've talked about, is absolutely vital for thousands of older Mainers and low-income families,” Collins said. “It helps them avoid the constant worry of having to choose between keeping warm, buying essential foods and medications and other basic necessities.”Kennedy sought to distance himself from the president’s budget request, saying that he understands “the critical, historical importance of this program.”“President (Donald) Trump's rationale and (the Office of Management and Budget’s) rationale is that President Trump's energy policies are going to lower the cost of energy … so that everybody will get lower cost heating oil,” Kennedy said.NIH indirect costsSubcommittee Chairwoman Shelley Moore Capito, R-W.Va., brought up several issues with Kennedy, including efforts to change how much the National Institutes of Health provides to medical schools and research universities for Facilities and Administrative fees, often called indirect costs.NIH sought to set that amount at 15% across the board for any institution that receives a research grant from the agency, a significantly lower amount than many of the organizations had negotiated over the years, bringing about strong objections from institutions of higher education.That NIH policy has not taken effect as several lawsuits work their way through the federal court system.Kennedy indicated NIH has figured out a way to help medical schools and research universities pay for items like gloves, test tubes and mass spectrometers, particularly at state schools.“In the public universities, we are very much aware that those universities are using the money well, that it is absolutely necessary for them. And we're looking at a series of different ways that we can fund those costs through them,” Kennedy said. “But not through the independent, indirect cost structure, which loses all control, which deprives us of all control of how that money is spent.”Kansas Sen. Jerry Moran, a Republican, brought up the measles outbreak and pressed Kennedy on whether HHS needed additional resources to help his home state and others get the virus under control.Kennedy testified the “best way to prevent the spread of measles is through vaccination” and that HHS has been urging “people to get their MMR vaccines.”South Dakota grant on mine safetySouth Dakota Sen. Mike Rounds called on Kennedy to continue fixing issues created earlier this year when HHS fired people working on mine safety issues at the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health.“My office has learned that staff at NIOSH's Spokane mining research division have been laid off. This office focuses on the unique challenges of Western mining operations that are often more geologically complex and exposed to harsher conditions,” Rounds said. “This division provides critical technical support for institutions like the South Dakota School of Mines and Technology, which recently received a $1.25 million grant to improve underground mining safety. However, the grant has now been canceled due to loss of oversight from the Spokane office.""This is not just a missed opportunity, it undermines our ability to meet national security goals tied to mineral independence and supply chain resilience.""Kennedy testified that he’s been able to bring back 238 workers at the agency and said he would work with Rounds to address ongoing issues.Pledge to fund Head Start, but no dollar amountAlabama Sen. Katie Britt, a Republican, asked Kennedy about news reports earlier this year that HHS would ask Congress to zero out funding for Head Start, one of numerous programs left out of the administration’s skinny budget request. Head Start provides early learning, health, family and development programs for free for children from low-income families.Kennedy testified that eliminating Head Start would likely not be in the full budget request, which is set to be released later this year, though the White House budget office has not said when. He said it would ask Congress to fully fund the program, but didn’t share a dollar amount.“There's 800,000 of the poorest kids in this country who are served by this program. It not only teaches the kids preschool skills — reading, writing and arithmetic — before they get to prepare them for school. But it also teaches the parents and teaches them how to be good parents.”Kennedy said there are challenges faced by the Head Start program that he hopes to change during the next four years, including the quality of the food.“The food they're serving at Head Start is terrible. You need to change that,” Kennedy said. “We're poisoning the poorest kids from their youngest years, and we're going to change that.”",,,,2025-05-20 16:07:55.502471
,Connecticut Mirror,2025-05-20 19:08:02+00:00,CT Mirror,‘Just cause’ eviction reform dies in CT legislature — again,Ginny Monk,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/05/20/ct-just-cause-evictions-bill/,"Although lawmakers said many of their colleagues privately supported the idea, not enough of them were willing to vote in favor of the bill.","Proposed reform to state eviction laws — which would have required landlords to provide a reason for evicting someone, a concept known as “just cause” — will not move forward this year, proponents said Tuesday.
As the legislature’s 2025 session approaches its final weeks, Housing Committee Co-Chair, Rep. Antonio Felipe, D-Bridgeport, said he doesn’t expect House Bill 6889 to come up for a vote in the House. The bill, which had broad support from Connecticut renters and housing advocates, passed the Housing Committee in March.
Although lawmakers who endorsed eviction reform said many of their colleagues privately supported it, not enough of them were willing to go public with that support by voting in favor of the bill.
“I don’t think there is any path forward at this point,” Felipe said Tuesday morning. “I believe we have the votes. I don’t believe those votes are all willing to be public at this point.”
Last year, Felipe faced problems in the House with a similar bill that would have reformed evictions in Connecticut. Although Senate leadership believed they had the votes, the House wasn’t able to secure enough support.
Felipe championed the just cause eviction bill again this session. The bill would have banned no-fault evictions, which typically occur at the end of a lease, in buildings with five or more units, after the tenant had been there for at least a year. Connecticut has similar protections in place for renters with disabilities and seniors.
Tenants say this type of eviction may be used in retaliation when renters complain about housing conditions or to evict every resident of a building or complex when new ownership purchases the property. 
Negotiations over the bill have been going back and forth for weeks. Members of the Democratic party were split, even in the committee process.
H.B. 6889 drew some of the most heated debate and the largest number of speakers of any bill the Housing Committee considered this session. 
Landlords opposed the bill, saying it would make it harder for them to evict problem tenants.
“There is no more cause for the ‘just cause’ bill today than there was when the legislature rejected it last year, because it does not protect Connecticut’s apartment communities and will not build one new apartment home to relieve the state’s housing shortage,” the Connecticut Apartment Association said in an April press release about the bill.
Ultimately, the bill faced a similar fate this year. 
Luke Melonakos-Harrison, vice president of the Connecticut Tenants Union, said Tuesday that the news of its demise was disheartening, particularly considering the hundreds of renters who testified and the broad support it drew from advocacy groups focused on housing, homelessness, health and labor unions.
“I don’t understand what these Democrats are so afraid of,”  Melonakos-Harrison said, adding that about a third of Connecticut residents are tenants compared to a much smaller number of landlords.
“It’s such a massive constituency that I struggle to understand why legislators, so many of them, seem to recognize landlords as a constituency with shared concerns, but don’t seem to recognize tenants as a constituency,” Melonakos-Harrison said.
The statewide Connecticut Tenants Union has gaining political power for the past few years, formalizing its structure and increasing lobbying activities. But lobbying groups representing landlords maintain a more established presence in the state Capitol.
While the bill was under consideration, some Connecticut residents received phone calls asking them to oppose the measure. “Imagine living next to someone who makes you feel unsafe, and there is nothing you can do about it. Can we count on you to oppose this bill?” one caller said.
House leadership earlier this month said support had been difficult to gather within the party caucus. Speaker of the House Matt Ritter, D-Hartford, said he’d fielded concerns from lawmakers who feared that if new owners couldn’t evict renters, they wouldn’t be able to make renovations and rental housing would deteriorate.
Members of the Democratic caucus also raised concerns that it would be hard for landlords to evict “bad tenants,” Ritter said. Landlords have repeatedly raised the same issue — that if someone is smoking or being disruptive, it’s sometimes easier to evict them through a no-fault eviction. 
“You have people saying, ‘If you don’t incentivize people to come in, and then they can’t charge higher rents, they’re going to let their buildings be decrepit, deteriorate, and then flip it,” Ritter said. “And we could not solve that in the caucus. That was probably the single biggest issue.”
House Majority Leader Jason Rojas, D-East Hartford, said it’s a tough balance to strike between tenants’ rights and landlord issues.
Republican lawmakers broadly opposed the bill.
“I had serious concerns with this same proposal last year, which would have established a general right for any tenant to remain in a rental unit after a lease term expires in perpetuity. It didn’t even come up for a vote in the House because it’s a problematic concept,” said Housing Committee ranking member Rep. Tony Scott, R-Monroe, in a text message after the launch of the just cause campaign.
Sen. Rob Sampson of Wolcott, ranking member of the Housing Committee, has said the bill would violate landlords’ rights and that government shouldn’t encroach on private contracts like leases.
It wasn’t clear whether Gov. Ned Lamont supported the bill. At a recent press briefing, he gave what he admitted was a neutral response when questioned about his stance.
“Look, rents are going up a lot,” Lamont said. “There’s a lot of sudden shock. A lot of people are at risk of losing a place to stay. So I understand the worry about that. You also want to get a balance and make sure we have people continuing to invest in a state like this with rental units.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/2025_0203_SR_HousingPolicy207-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-20 15:08:14.099030

(Photo by Jeniffer Solis/Nevada Current)Lake Mead’s infamous bathtub ring is expected to get bigger this summer as low snowpack levels in the Rocky Mountains choke the reservoir’s biggest source of water – the Colorado River.
Snow melt from the Rocky Mountains contributes about 85% of the total water flow in the Colorado River, but those flows will likely be lower than usual this summer, according to federal data.
Across the Rocky Mountains the snow season had a strong start, then came one of the driest winters on record, followed by rapid snow melt that bodes poorly for river flow in the summer.
Mountain ranges across the Rockies didn’t reach peak snowpack in April, and only hit about 63% of average peaks.
With less snow, runoff into Lake Powell is expected to be cut nearly in half this year, according to the Colorado Basin River Forecast Center. Water levels in Lake Powell, the nation’s second largest reservoir, directly impact Lake Mead because streamflow to Lake Powell is eventually released to Lake Mead.
Combined storage in Lake Powell and Lake Mead is down 920,000 acre-feet from this time last year, or enough water to supply about 1.8 million single-family homes for a year.
Utah Gov. Cox issues drought executive order, urges Utahns to conserve water

A “dreadful winter” means a high likelihood of “extreme and exceptional drought” is in store for areas of Southern Nevada, according to the Nevada Water Supply Outlook prepared by the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Natural Resources Conservation Service.
“In 2023 it was a great runoff year with a really big snow pack. But we’re not going to see anything like that this year,” said Jeff Anderson, a USDA hydrologist and water supply specialist.
Water supply estimates for the seven Colorado River Basin states were reduced in April after rapid and early snowmelt wiped out snowpack in the region.
Rapid snow melt across Utah, Colorado, and New Mexico, pushed some basins from above-average snowpack to snow drought conditions in under a month, with snow disappearing up to four weeks early, according to the U.S. Drought Monitor.
“The snow pack has melted much quicker than normal,” Anderson said. “It dropped much quicker than the normal drops.”
“Oftentimes the snow packs don’t start to melt as early as they started this year. It’s like a locomotive. Once the snow pack absorbs enough energy from the sun and from the temperature and starts to melt, it’s very difficult to stop that process,” he said.
As snowpack melts, it recharges ecosystems and replenishes reservoirs that provide drinking water for millions of people and irrigation water for millions of acres of farmland. But early melt means water leaves the region before the summer when it’s most needed. The quicker snow melts the more likely it is to evaporate too.
Less snowmelt making its way to the Colorado River is part of a larger trend. Colorado River streamflow has shrunk by about 20% since 2000, with further declines projected due to climate change.
Stalled talks and a problematic pipeline
The seven Colorado River Basin states that depend on the river’s water are currently working on setting rules for sharing a dwindling water supply after 2026, when current operating guidelines are set to expire.
But negotiations over water allotments in the country’s two largest reservoirs, Lake Powell and Lake Mead, have stalled.
Two consecutive winters with robust snowpacks gave states that rely on the Colorado River a few more years of stability, but with a dismal water year approaching tensions appear to be growing.
Colorado River negotiators — one from each of the seven states that use Colorado River water — will not be speaking at a major water law conference in June, despite having appeared together at the conference for the last few years.
That divide has come up at the other annual appearances, too. In December, negotiators opted to split into two separate panels at the Colorado River Water Users Association conference in Las Vegas after appearing together for years.
The two camps – the Upper Basin states of Colorado, Utah, Wyoming and New Mexico, and the Lower Basin states of California, Arizona and Nevada – have been at an impasse since March after submitting two competing proposals for managing the river.
One of the biggest sticking points between the two basins is whether or not Upper Basin states should absorb mandatory water cuts during dry years, despite using significantly less than their 7.5 million acre-feet Colorado River allocation year-after-year.
Historically, Lower Basin states have used nearly all their 7.5 million acre-feet Colorado River allocation under the 1922 Colorado River Compact, while Upper Basin states use about 4.5 million acre-feet annually, significantly less than their total allocation.
Lower Basin states argued all seven states should share water cuts during dry years under the new post-2026 guidelines. If they don’t, downstream states warned they could face water cuts they can’t feasibly absorb.
If the states can reach an agreement by May, then the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation can consider the proposal as part of its longer process. In the absence of a seven-state agreement on how to manage the basin’s water supply, the Bureau of Reclamation would move forward with its own management options.
Bronson Mack, a public outreach coordinator for the Southern Nevada Water Authority, said Nevada’s Colorado River negotiator, John Entsminger, is actively attending closed-door meetings and working towards compromise. However, details from those meetings have been scant.
Another fissure among states appeared after House Republicans approved a last-minute amendment to sell off nearly 11,000 acres of public land in Utah that appears to follow the pathway of the planned Lake Powell pipeline, a decades-long and highly controversial attempt by Utah to pipe water from Lake Powell.
In a joint statement, U.S. Representatives Greg Stanton (D-Ariz.) and Susie Lee (D-Nev.) said they were “alerted by Arizona and Nevada water managers that the public land to be sold in Utah could be used to develop” the controversial water pipeline from Lake Powell to Washington County, Utah.
The office of Utah Republican Rep. Celeste Maloy – who proposed the amendment – denied the allegation, as did the Washington County Water Conservancy District, which pointed to a detailed list of intended uses for the proposed land disposal, including water projects, public infrastructure, housing, recreation and an airport expansion.
That reasoning doesn’t fly with some of the state’s public land and environmental advocates, including Kyle Roerink, executive director of the Great Basin Water Network.
“There are quite a few striking similarities,” Roerink said. “We believe that this is much more than a coincidence.”
The project has yet to clear several federal hurdles, and needs a new environmental impact statement — officials in the area say the project is no longer a priority.
Roerink noted that Utah officials have also not ruled out the Lake Powell Pipeline and have continued to pursue the paper water rights that the pipeline would feed.
“This throws an even bigger wrench in a situation that is already rife with conflict, and it underscores that some states continue to believe that water exists, when in reality, we all know it doesn’t,” Roerink said.

(Danielle Prokop/Source NM)A troubled Southern New Mexico utility scrutinized for recent arsenic violations has just logged yet another one, prompting state environmental officials to evaluate taking rare emergency action.
The Camino Real Regional Utility Authority manages drinking water and sewage for approximately 19,000 people in the southern portion of Doña Ana County, Sunland Park and Santa Teresa. The area has high levels of naturally occurring arsenic in the groundwater, which can cause cancers and other health threats over years of exposure.
After a series of water quality issues in late 2023, state investigators found the utility had bypassed its arsenic treatment systems and sent water with high-level of arsenic to residents, in addition to dozens of other violations. New CRRUA leadership said it had addressed those violations, but recently self-reported arsenic levels in the water at one plant that violate the federal standards.
Last week, Doña Ana County commissioners voted unanimously to terminate its role in the utility’s governance, as residents and the state’s environment secretary continue to criticize the utility’s lack of accountability.
New Mexico’s environment secretary urges Sunland Park to cut ties with troubled water utility

Now, the state Environment Department reports that water tests the agency itself took at CCRUA on May 7 recorded arsenic levels at the Santa Teresa Industrial Park plant that violated the federal limit.
This marks the third overage recorded at the plant in recent weeks, although the other tests were from voluntary tests.
Because of the ways contaminants are measured — using a quarterly average —  the state has little regulatory authority to intervene unless further violations are recorded, NMED Water Protection Division Director Jonas Armstrong told SourceNM.
“We’ve encouraged the system to do what community groups are asking, in terms of providing onsite treatment, test strips and things like that at no cost to the ratepayers,” he said.
Thus, Jonas said, NMED is now looking at the standards for enacting emergency powers to address “immediate and substantial endangerment.”
“This is a system that has had issues with water quality for years,” he said. ”Every single instance where we find continuing evidence of that is additionally concerning, and so it is potentially, an area when the emergency authority could be exercised.”
Officials confirmed it would be the first time the state has used these specific emergency powers for drinking water in recent memory, although the department has enacted the authority in other situations, such as concern for hazardous waste.
Those powers, laid out in both state and federal law, could mean ordering CRRUA to provide alternate water supplies, or open a civil lawsuit for further action.
Charles de Saillan, a longtime environmental attorney in New Mexico, told Source NM the federal law requires the agency to determine first if there’s an imminent and substantial threat to human health.
“The environment department would have the burden, if it took the case to court, or issued an order and that order was challenged, to prove that there was an imminent and substantial endangerment,” he said.
Source NM calls, emails and texts to CRRUA Executive Director Juan Carlos Crosby and spokesperson Udell Vigil went unreturned Monday.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/IMG_9851-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-20 15:08:14.099030

(Courtesy of USGS EROS Center)A preliminary budget request from President Donald Trump takes aim at a satellite program with a 50-year history whose data is housed just northeast of Sioux Falls, at a facility employing hundreds of people.
Trump’s discretionary budget request for NASA would cut $1.1 billion in funding for Earth observation programs, including what the request describes as cuts to the “gold-plated, two billion dollar Landsat Next” mission. The cut amounts to roughly half of the space agency’s budget for Earth observation, which includes money for Landsat design.
Landsat Next is planned as the next generation of Landsat, whose nine iterations have created the longest continuously collected Earth observation record in history. The first satellite launched in 1972.
NASA builds and launches Landsat satellites. The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) operates them and curates the data collected by them. 

  Powerful storms containing heavy rains caused major flooding to areas in the east central portion of the United States in early April 2025. Some communities in Kentucky saw more than 15 inches of rain, according to the National Weather Service. In the days following April 7 — the day Landsat 8 captured this imagery over a portion of the affected area — the Kentucky and Ohio rivers were forecast to reach historic levels and crest in dozens of locations. (Courtesy USGS Landsat program)

The USGS Earth Resources Observation and Science (EROS) Center near Sioux Falls has housed Landsat data since 1973, in addition to millions of images from other satellites and modern and historical aerial imagery, all of which is accessible at no cost to users. Landsat’s free data is used to calibrate data from commercial satellites, contributing to what the USGS calculated last fall as a $25.6 billion return on public investment since the agency began freely sharing data in 2008.
The most recent satellite in the series, Landsat 9, entered low-earth orbit in 2021. Between that satellite and its near-identical predecessor, Landsat 8, the system gathers new imagery data of the entire Earth’s surface — as well as imagery from spectral bands like infrared that are invisible to the naked eye and measurements of Earth surface temperatures — every eight days.
Landsat Next was set to launch around 2030, with improvements in resolution and speedier repeat image collection.
Trump’s budget request would “restructure” the Landsat Next mission “while NASA studies more affordable ways to maintain the continuity of Landsat imagery, which is used by natural resource managers, States, and industry.”
The request also calls for the elimination of $562 million in USGS funding. The change “eliminates programs that provide grants to universities, duplicate other Federal research programs and focus on social agendas (e.g., climate change) to instead focus on achieving dominance in energy and critical minerals,” Trump’s budget request says. 
The cut to USGS amounts to about a third of its $1.6 billion budget.
The budget request is separate from the federal government’s efforts under Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency to pare down the federal workforce. 
Probationary employees across multiple federal agencies were first dismissed in February, but many returned to the federal payroll and placed on paid administrative leave after legal challenges.
It’s unclear how those moves to reduce the federal workforce have impacted the EROS Center.
Around 600 government employees and contractors work at the center, according to the latest figures posted on the USGS website, but the site including that figure hasn’t changed since March 2023.
Emails from South Dakota Searchlight to USGS press contacts at EROS and in regional and national offices on the number of employees who’ve departed since Jan. 25 went unanswered.
The biggest thing you’ve never heard of: How EROS changed the world from a cornfield

Searchlight also asked about the potential impact of the USGS budget cut proposal to EROS science programs, and about how changes to the Landsat program could affect EROS.
A NASA spokesperson told South Dakota Searchlight that the agency would be in a better position to respond “once we receive the President’s full budget request in the coming weeks.”
U.S. Rep. Dusty Johnson, R-South Dakota, pointed out that presidential budget requests are “aspirational” and “rarely implemented as written.”
“Dusty will continue to be supportive of Landsat’s efforts in Congress,” said a Johnson spokesperson.
The NASA budget has not emerged as a discussion point in budget reconciliation talks underway in Washington, D.C., on Trump’s so-called “big, beautiful bill.”
U.S. Sen. Mike Rounds, R-South Dakota, sounded similar notes in his response to questions about Landsat. 
“The president’s discretionary budget is just that — discretionary. It outlines the president’s priorities and wish lists, but it will ultimately be our job in Congress to set the budget and appropriate federal dollars,” Rounds said in an emailed statement.
Representatives for Republican Senate Majority Leader John Thune of South Dakota did not return emails requesting comment on Landsat and EROS.
Republican South Dakota Gov. Larry Rhoden told Searchlight during a visit to Sioux Falls recently that he hadn’t heard about requested cuts to the satellite program or to the USGS.
Even so, Rhoden said he trusts that an open relationship with the Trump administration on South Dakota’s priorities will help preserve them through budget negotiations.

“They give you some wiggle room as far as what your priorities are, and so I’m kind of optimistic that they are tempering some of those decisions with common sense,” Rhoden said.
Trump’s actions have had at least one public impact on EROS, though not an operational one.
EROS is home to a supercomputer whose processing power is shared across multiple arms of the Department of Interior. The system came to EROS with the name Denali, named after the tallest peak in the U.S. 
Like the Alaska mountain after which the computer was named, the Denali system at EROS was renamed “McKinley” after the issuance of a Trump executive order.
Denali has long been the mountain’s name among Alaska’s Indigenous Athabascans, but the federal government embraced the name given to it by a prospector for about 100 years. The prospector called it “Mount McKinley,” after then-presidential candidate William McKinley.
President Barack Obama renamed it Denali in 2015, matching the name the surrounding national park had taken nearly 40 years earlier.
The order does not mention the USGS or supercomputers, but rather instructs the Department of Interior to “update the Geographic Names Information System (GNIS) to reflect the renaming and reinstatement of Mount McKinley.”
The EROS supercomputer’s name was changed based on the order, however.
“Pursuant to President Trump’s Executive Order No. 14172, ‘Restoring Names that Honor American Greatness,’ this supercomputer has been renamed to McKinley,” a poster in the EROS visitor area now reads.

Jared Polis signed an executive order May 16 that pushes local governments to comply with certain state housing laws as a condition of receiving state grant funding, at the Colorado Capitol in Denver. (Lindsey Toomer/Colorado Newsline)Six cities in the Front Range filed a lawsuit against Colorado and Gov. Jared Polis claiming recently approved state housing laws violate the Colorado Constitution’s home rule provisions. 
The 86-page lawsuit filed in Denver District Court Monday says Colorado courts have established that matters of land use and zoning are “core matters of local concern,” and that home rule cities are “not inferior” to the Colorado Legislature. Colorado has 105 municipalities with home rule power, meaning they can make laws on matters of local concern instead of being directed by the state.
The General Assembly approved two laws in 2024 that are subject to the lawsuit: one that allows for denser housing close to transit stops and another that prohibits minimum parking requirements. The lawsuit also challenges an executive order Polis signed Friday to incentivize municipalities to comply with new state housing laws if they want to receive discretionary grant funding.

Housing availability and affordability has been a growing crisis in Colorado that state legislators have sought to address since 2023, when a major land use package failed on the last day of the legislative session. A 2023 housing executive order Polis signed said the state is short tens of thousands of housing units, and his latest order said the same concerns continue to escalate. 
Plaintiff cities include Greenwood Village, Arvada, Aurora, Glendale, Lafayette and Westminster. The lawsuit outlines each of the cities’ zoning and land use approval processes and how they have increased their own efforts to build more affordable housing, and how abiding by the new state laws would disrupt their approval processes. 
The cities argue the new laws won’t immediately lead to an increase in affordable housing and that a one-size-fits-all approach to zoning isn’t appropriate for the cities in the Denver metro area. They also said the laws’ requirements take away a citizen’s right to be heard on land use issues as each new potential development is reviewed at the city level.  
The lawsuit says provisions of the Colorado Constitution mandate court declarations that the two new laws “have neither force nor effect in the Cities,” and it asks for injunctive relief barring enforcement of the laws. In particular, it says House Bill 24-1313 — related to transit-oriented housing — “departs from time-tested approaches to resolving local land-use decisions” in Colorado.
“In a move without precedent in Colorado’s history of planning and zoning, the General Assembly mandated site-specific zoning changes in select urban Colorado communities, including the Cities, that the General Assembly dubbed ‘transit-oriented communities,’” the lawsuit says. 
Defendants include the state, Polis, the Department of Local Affairs and DOLA Executive Director Maria De Cambra. Polis spokesperson Shelby Wieman said Polis is “confident” a court will rule in favor of the state, and he is proud to have worked together with many local governments to work toward solving the state’s housing shortage. 
“It’s disappointing to see certain local governments that have among the priciest homes in Colorado use taxpayer money on a lawsuit that could go toward lowering the cost of housing,” Wieman said in a statement. “It’s clear this lawsuit is about preventing more housing from being built that Coloradans can afford. Rather than standing in the way of more housing being built, Governor Polis and the General Assembly have passed common-sense laws that break down barriers to housing. 
The lawsuit seeks declarations that both laws violate certain articles of the Colorado Constitution, violate due process, and that Polis’ executive order exceeds the governor’s powers.

Government […],"The Iowa Supreme Court chamber in the Iowa Judicial Building on Feb. 22, 2023. (Photo by Kathie Obradovich/Iowa Capital Dispatch)The Iowa Supreme Court gave citizen engagement and accessibility to public meetings a much-needed boost Friday in an appeal of a lawsuit against the Iowa City Community School District.
The district’s practice of posting full videos of school board meetings on the internet for on-demand public viewing was at the heart of the case.
Government officials, staffs of statewide organizations of cities, counties and school boards, and access advocates like the Iowa Freedom of Information Council had awaited the decision with some trepidation. They worried the court might impose liability for statements expressed during public comment portions of governmental meetings and for their republication via internet posting of meeting recordings on government web sites or YouTube.
But the justices unanimously upheld lower court decisions dismissing the claims by Amie Villarini, the former girls’ tennis coach at Iowa City West High School.
The Supreme Court ruling should curtail a recent practice by an increasing number of public officials who advocated that the risk of defamation lawsuits made it necessary for city councils and school boards to omit or limit public comment periods during their meetings, to warn speakers in advance about what they could and could not say, and even to remove or arrest speakers who made crude or demeaning comments.
The court decision takes away any rational basis for a governmental body to claim it should not archive recordings of meetings for later public viewing.
The Iowa City case arose because the school district is among the governmental bodies that did not cower to pressure to limit members of the public from speaking their minds, lodging complaints, or heaping praise during meetings. The district also did not give in to pressure to closet away video recordings of meetings that captured those comments.
Villarini’s lawsuit in effect challenged both practices. She sued over statements by two former West High School tennis players who spoke freely during the public-comment time at a 2022 school board meeting.
The students expressed disappointment with the results of an internal school investigation of allegations of mistreatment involving the tennis coach, whom the girls did not identify by name. One girl told the board she believed the investigation protected the coach, not students. The other girl asked the board to change the district’s investigation procedures to protect students better.
Board members did not respond to the girls’ statements. The following day, the district placed Villarini on paid leave for the remainder of her one-year contract. The deputy superintendent said school staff learned after the meeting Villarini had posted comments the administrator described as unprofessional and disrespectful to students.
In keeping with its custom, the district posted a complete, unaltered video recording of the school board meeting on its YouTube channel two days after the meeting. The district refused multiple requests from Villarini and her lawyer to take the video down.
She sued, alleging the district defamed her by republishing what she called “slanderous” statements by the two girls. The district defended the case, in part arguing that posting unaltered video of a public meeting of a governmental body constituted privileged speech.
The Supreme Court agreed. Chief Justice Susan Christensen wrote in the decision:
“The fair-report privilege protects the publication of defamatory matter concerning another in a report of an official action or proceeding or of a meeting open to the public that deals with a matter of public concern … if the report is accurate and complete or a fair abridgement of the occurrence reported.”
The court continued: “Although we are fully articulating this privilege for the first time, we have recognized a version of it since the early 1900s. At the time, the privilege only covered judicial proceedings and could be defeated by a showing of malice. … Here, we are expanding the privilege and updating it so that it covers the report of more proceedings and is defeated by inaccuracy instead of malice.”
The court said it may have reached a different conclusion had the district edited the meeting recording. Yet, the court reiterated the importance of supporting steps that increase public access to governmental meetings.
“The application of the fair-report privilege to this case furthers Iowa’s open-meeting laws. … Government entities, including school boards, must prioritize the accessibility of public meetings,” the court wrote.
“ICCSD [Iowa City Community School District] has chosen to comply with these laws with the most transparency possible, and that should not be punished. The fair-report privilege protects those government bodies that provide the public with a full account of their meetings.”
Thankfully, the Supreme Court did not mince words when it ratified that comments at a public meeting are privileged communications and that posting recordings of those comments is protected so long as the posted version is unaltered.
This common sense support of citizen participation in and access to governments continues Iowa’s history of openness and its protection of free speech, while adapting state law to current realities.
Letting people watch live-streamed governmental board meetings and archived recordings of past meetings from their homes, offices — or even their tractor cabs — is a positive result from the Covid pandemic, when many people avoided large gatherings.
Citizens without transportation, parents with children at home, the elderly, or people away from home learned to use Zoom or YouTube to watch their school boards and city council meetings when they could and from remote locations.
By applying the fair-report privilege to meetings live-streamed or archived on the internet, even when they contain untoward comments, our Supreme Court has modernized an important protection for expressive rights of Iowans and articulated how the distribution of full-length recordings of meetings promotes government transparency.
With this Supreme Court endorsement, city councils, school boards and county boards of supervisors that persist in opening their meetings only to in-person attendees serve only themselves, not the public. Even more, the court’s decision strips away a convenient but now dispelled legal excuse for elected officials to avoid doing the right thing.

(Photo by Marty Schladen, Ohio Capital Journal)The American Civil Liberties Union of Ohio is suing the Geauga County Sheriff’s office over its refusal to provide copies of contracts it’s signed with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Geauga is one of at least five counties in Ohio that have signed contracts to house migrants detained by ICE on the belief that they’re undocumented.
The ACLU on Tuesday afternoon filed a writ in the Ohio Supreme Court asking the court to mandate the release of the contracts. In a statement, the civil liberties group said that in April the sheriff’s office claimed that releasing the records was “‘prohibited by federal law’ and therefore not public per the Ohio Revised Code. (The ACLU) was instructed to instead contact ICE for the records.”
Under such contracts, the federal government pays counties to house detainees. During the first Trump administration, the Ohio counties that housed detainees faced complaints and lawsuits.
The ACLU’s statement said that the office didn’t cite a valid reason not to release its ICE contract.
Advocate: Ohio’s county jails are no place for migrants

“None of the federal statutes (the county’s lawyers) have cited, however, prohibit the disclosure of the requested records,” the writ said. “Because (the county’s lawyers) have refused to perform their clearly defined duty to provide the requested records, (the ACLU) respectfully submits this complaint for alternative and peremptory writs of mandamus to require (the sheriff’s office) to provide her with the records she seeks.” 
Geauga County Chief Sheriff’s Deputy Thomas Rowan said the county’s attorneys are telling a different story — that only ICE can release the documents.
“It’s in our attorneys’ hands,” he said. “Once the court rules, we’ll definitively know which way to go. Our attorneys believe that they have to go through ICE to get copies of any of the paperwork.”
As a general matter, government documents can usually only be withheld or redacted if they contain sensitive personal information, business secrets, or if their disclosure would endanger public safety or national security.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
A wave of state and national public records laws were passed in the wake of the Watergate scandal to crack down on government corruption. Documents relating to the expenditure of government dollars were a particular target of such laws. 
As Trump promises mass deportations, the ACLU said it would try to keep a close watch.
“The ACLU of Ohio is deeply committed to protecting immigrants’ rights and our organization serves as a watchdog for government transparency and accountability,” Jocelyn Rosnick, Chief Policy and Advocacy Officer, said in a written statement. “We know that Geauga County Jail has housed ICE detainees for years, some of whom we have previously defended in court. Our lawful demands for timely and accurate information must not be ignored.”

TYLERTOWN, Miss. (AP) — More than two months after a tornado destroyed his home, Brian Lowery still looks through the rubble, hoping to find a tie clip his mother gave him, made from the center stone of her wedding band.
“I still have hope,” Lowery said.
He, his wife and 13-year-old son made it to safety before the tornado ripped apart their trailer home of 15 years, but the recovery from the storm has been a slow and painful process. Mississippi’s request for federal aid is still pending before the Federal Emergency Management Agency, meaning badly needed assistance has not yet made it to his hard-hit community of Tylertown to recover from the storms that struck in mid-March.
The delays could provide a glimpse into what’s in store for communities around the country as the summer storm season arrives and FEMA is mired in turmoil. A stretch of states including Kentucky, Missouri and Oklahoma have already been battered with tornadoes this week, setting the stage for more disaster requests to FEMA. And the Atlantic hurricane season is just around the corner.March storms left 7 dead and hundreds of homes destroyed or damaged
In Mississippi, nearly 20 tornadoes tore through the state on March 14 and 15, leaving seven people dead and hundreds of homes destroyed or damaged. Republican Mississippi Gov. Tate Reeves asked the Trump administration for a major disaster declaration on April 1. The state, and residents like Lowery, are still waiting.
The declaration would allow the state to access a wide range of FEMA resources, including financial aid for individuals and for government agencies still removing debris and repairing infrastructure.
“I don’t know what you got to do or what you got to have to be able to be declared for a federal disaster area because this is pretty bad,” Lowery said. “We can’t help you because, whatever, we’re waiting on a letter; we’re waiting on somebody to sign his name. You know, all that. I’m just over it.”
The declaration would allow the state to access a wide range of FEMA resources, including financial aid for individuals and for government agencies still removing debris and repairing infrastructure.
“We don’t have a declaration yet. People are still hurting,” said Royce McKee, emergency management director for Walthall County, which includes Tylertown.Requests for help come at a time of upheaval for FEMA

Mississippi’s request comes at a time of upheaval for FEMA. The agency’s acting administrator, Cameron Hamilton, was recently ousted after he publicly disagreed with proposals to dismantle FEMA, an idea President Donald Trump has floated in calling the agency “very bureaucratic” and “very slow.”
David Richardson, FEMA’s new acting administrator, committed himself to executing Trump’s vision for the agency. He also previewed potential policy changes, saying there could be “more cost-sharing with states” and that FEMA would coordinate federal assistance “when deemed necessary.”
Walthall County was hit especially hard by the massive storm system that wreaked havoc across multiple states. The storm spawned two significant tornadoes in the county, where four people died.
McKee said the county has sunk an estimated $700,000 into cleaning up the damage but can’t afford to spend more and has halted operations until it receives federal help.
“We need federal help, and we need it desperately, and we need it now,” said Bobby McGinnis, a Tylertown resident and firefighter. “I know President Trump said that — America first, we’re going to help our American folks first. But we haven’t seen the federal folks down here.”
While Mississippi has been waiting, a similar major disaster declaration request out of Arkansas after the storms hit was denied, appealed by Republican Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders and finally approved on May 13.
“We are encouraged by FEMA’s decision regarding Arkansas’ application from the same storm system that hit Mississippi,” Scott Simmons, the Mississippi Emergency Management Agency’s director of external affairs, said in a statement. “We anxiously await a positive decision.”In Missouri, there are frustrations about the federal response to March storms
In Missouri, the federal response to storms earlier this year is being criticized as residents pick up the pieces from a Friday twister. The EF3 tornado packing winds of up to 150 mph (241 kph) slammed into St. Louis on Friday, and the city is awaiting a disaster declaration from the Missouri governor’s office so it can access federal help.
“We need to get the federal government mobilized,” said U.S. Sen. Josh Hawley, a Missouri Republican. “All federal resources that can be brought to bear here should be.”
The senator also expressed frustration over the federal response to a deadly March storm.
“We cannot wait months. I’m not happy about the fact we’re still waiting from all of that damage two months ago. We lost 12 people in those storms. We’ve lost seven here,” he said. “The scope of the damage is immense.”Mississippi lawmakers press federal officials about assistance
Mississippi lawmakers have been pressing federal officials on the issue. During a congressional hearing in early May, Republican Mississippi Rep. Michael Guest asked U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, whose department oversees FEMA, to push forward the request.
“I would ask you if you could make sure that you could do everything to expedite that request,” Guest said. ”It is impacting my local jurisdictions with debris cleanup. It is impacting people as they seek to recover.”
Republican Mississippi U.S. Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith also asked Noem about FEMA assistance and the administration’s new approach to the agency.
“President Trump has been very clear that he believes that the way that FEMA exists today should not continue,” Noem responded. “He wants to make sure that those reforms are happening where states are empowered to do the response and trained and equipped, and then the federal government would come in and support them and financially be there when they need them on their worst day.”

(Getty Images)Five years after medical cannabis became available in Utah after being legalized by voters, the program, while still controversial, keeps on growing. This year, the state counted over 100,000 medical cannabis card holders, a new peak in the program’s five-year existence.
Members of the Utah Patients Coalition, a plant medicine advocacy group which lobbied hard to help pass the 2018 referendum that allowed the medical cannabis program in deeply conservative Utah, see the milestone as a demonstration that the system to obtain a card is getting easier to navigate.
Even now that a major 2025 cannabis bill has gone into effect and eliminated a system that allowed for a cheaper, more accessible way to obtain a card, the group remains hopeful for the future of medical cannabis in the state.
“The growth in 2025 has been encouraging, just because we have seen a lot of patients struggling in the past. And every year we go back to the legislative session, we go back to our platforms with education, and just try to remove some of those barriers,” Desiree Hennessy, executive director at the Utah Patients Coalition, said on Monday.
 Utah Legislature still making tweaks on state’s medical cannabis law

One of the 2025 general session’s routine bipartisan medical cannabis bills, sponsored by Minority Whip Jennifer Dailey-Provost, D-Salt Lake City, and Sen. Evan Vickers, R-Cedar City, went through several iterations and proposed allowing more medical cannabis pharmacies in the state. But, it didn’t make it to a vote on the Senate floor, ultimately failing.
However, Senate Bill 64, another bill sponsored by Vickers, passed, containing a provision that Utah Patients Coalition considered “a heartbreaking loss.”
Up until this month, pharmacies were allowed to partner with clinics that have medical providers qualified to prescribe medicinal cannabis to host “card drives,” a sort of pop-up clinic in pharmacies’ parking lots in which doctors could see patients and issue cards, often at a discount.
Those partnerships allowed cards, which are good for up to a year, to go from a regular $200 to about $75, Hennessy said.
“This year, we lost the ability to allow pharmacies to do that. So now no longer can somebody write a card within 500 feet of a pharmacy unless they’re in their own business,” she said. “And so it’s really not going to hurt anybody that’s middle class or higher, but these patients struggling with finances that used these card drives.”
That was one of the last additions to Vickers’ bill. He explained on the Senate floor that the bill’s authors didn’t feel like the pop-ups were appropriate, and patients should be going to a doctor’s office for medical advice.
“If someone is a qualified medical professional, they can’t go to a pop-up tent in front of the marijuana pharmacy to give cards. We want to make sure that we are not producing a recreational environment,” SB64’s House floor sponsor, Rep. Walt Brooks, R-St George, told House members about the change.
But, with that loss, also came some flexibility on who gets to recommend medical cannabis to a patient. Now, medical providers who are licensed to prescribe controlled substances can recommend the treatment, which according to a Department of Health and Human Services April report is mostly used to treat pain.
According to Hennessy, that change would improve patient accessibility.
“Patients can go to their regular care physician, hopefully not get charged any more than a co-pay, and have this medical cannabis conversation with their doctor,” she said.
While advocates celebrate the numbers, the program remains a contentious point among Utahns, with some still protesting the annual technical bills, arguing that the state shouldn’t allow cannabis at all.
But, ultimately, Hennessy hopes that medical cannabis patients get to be treated like those receiving any other treatment. Especially, she said, since the program has been demonstrated to lower rates of opioid use and opioid-related deaths, according to a study by Management Science Associates in partnership with Dragonfly Wellness, a medical cannabis pharmacy.
“We do believe that there’s a lot of good that can come out of using medical cannabis as a first-line drug, and not as a second or third or fourth when everything else fails,” Hennessy said, “but we could use this first and treat a lot of conditions with a lot less risk than other medications that patients are now using.”

(Jeniffer Solis/Nevada Current)Lake Mead’s infamous bathtub ring is expected to get bigger this summer as low snowpack levels in the Rocky Mountains choke the reservoir’s biggest source of water – the Colorado River.
Snow melt from the Rocky Mountains contributes about 85% of the total water flow in the Colorado River, but those flows will likely be lower than usual this summer, according to federal data.

Across the Rocky Mountains the snow season had a strong start, then came one of the driest winters on record, followed by rapid snow melt that bodes poorly for river flow in the summer.
Mountain ranges across the Rockies didn’t reach peak snowpack in April, and only hit about 63% of average peaks.
With less snow, runoff into Lake Powell is expected to be cut nearly in half this year, according to the Colorado Basin River Forecast Center. Water levels in Lake Powell, the nation’s second largest reservoir, directly impact Lake Mead because streamflow to Lake Powell is eventually released to Lake Mead.
Combined storage in Lake Powell and Lake Mead is down 920,000 acre-feet from this time last year, or enough water to supply about 1.8 million single-family homes for a year.
 ‘Extreme and exceptional drought’ expected for Southern Nevada this year

A “dreadful winter” means a high likelihood of “extreme and exceptional drought” is in store for areas of Southern Nevada, according to the Nevada Water Supply Outlook prepared by the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Natural Resources Conservation Service.
“In 2023 it was a great runoff year with a really big snow pack. But we’re not going to see anything like that this year,” said Jeff Anderson, a USDA hydrologist and water supply specialist.
Water supply estimates for the seven Colorado River Basin states were reduced in April after rapid and early snowmelt wiped out snowpack in the region.
Rapid snow melt across Utah, Colorado and New Mexico, pushed some basins from above-average snowpack to snow drought conditions in under a month, with snow disappearing up to four weeks early, according to the U.S. Drought Monitor.
“The snowpack has melted much quicker than normal,” Anderson said. “It dropped much quicker than the normal drops.”
“Oftentimes the snow packs don’t start to melt as early as they started this year. It’s like a locomotive. Once the snow pack absorbs enough energy from the sun and from the temperature and starts to melt, it’s very difficult to stop that process,” he said.
As snowpack melts, it recharges ecosystems and replenishes reservoirs that provide drinking water for millions of people and irrigation water for millions of acres of farmland. But early melt means water leaves the region before the summer when it’s most needed. The quicker snow melts the more likely it is to evaporate too.
Less snowmelt making its way to the Colorado River is part of a larger trend. Colorado River streamflow has shrunk by about 20% since 2000, with further declines projected due to climate change.

 Stalled talks among Colorado River Basin states and a problematic pipeline

The seven Colorado River Basin states that depend on the river’s water are working to set rules for sharing a dwindling water supply after 2026, when current operating guidelines are set to expire.
But negotiations over water allotments in the country’s two largest reservoirs, Lake Powell and Lake Mead, have stalled.
Two consecutive winters with robust snowpacks gave states that rely on the Colorado River a few more years of stability, but with a dismal water year approaching tensions appear to be growing.
Colorado River negotiators — one from each of the seven states that use Colorado River water — will not be speaking at a major water law conference in June, despite having appeared together at the conference for the last few years.
That divide has come up at the other annual appearances, too. In December, negotiators opted to split into two separate panels at the Colorado River Water Users Association conference in Las Vegas after appearing together for years.
The two camps – the Upper Basin states of Colorado, Utah, Wyoming and New Mexico, and the Lower Basin states of California, Arizona and Nevada – have been at an impasse since March after submitting two competing proposals for managing the river.
One of the biggest sticking points between the two basins is whether or not Upper Basin states should absorb mandatory water cuts during dry years, despite using significantly less than their 7.5 million acre-feet Colorado River allocation year-after-year.
Historically, Lower Basin states have used nearly all their 7.5 million acre-feet Colorado River allocation under the 1922 Colorado River Compact, while Upper Basin states use about 4.5 million acre-feet annually, significantly less than their total allocation.
Lower Basin states argued all seven states should share water cuts during dry years under the new post-2026 guidelines. If they don’t, downstream states warned they could face water cuts they can’t feasibly absorb.
If the states can reach an agreement by May, then the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation can consider the proposal as part of its longer process. In the absence of a seven-state agreement on how to manage the basin’s water supply, the Bureau of Reclamation would move forward with its own management options.
Bronson Mack, a public outreach coordinator for the Southern Nevada Water Authority, said Nevada’s Colorado River negotiator, John Entsminger, is actively attending closed-door meetings and working towards compromise. However, details from those meetings have been scant.
Another fissure among states appeared after House Republicans approved a last-minute amendment to sell off nearly 11,000 acres of public land in Utah that appears to follow the pathway of the planned Lake Powell pipeline, a decades-long and highly controversial attempt by Utah to pipe water from Lake Powell.
In a joint statement, U.S. Reps. Greg Stanton, D-Arizona, and Susie Lee, D-Nevada, said they were “alerted by Arizona and Nevada water managers that the public land to be sold in Utah could be used to develop” the controversial water pipeline from Lake Powell to Washington County, Utah.
The office of Utah Republican U.S. Rep. Celeste Maloy – who proposed the amendment – denied the allegation, as did the Washington County Water Conservancy District, which pointed to a detailed list of intended uses for the proposed land disposal, including water projects, public infrastructure, housing, recreation and an airport expansion.
That reasoning doesn’t fly with some of the state’s public land and environmental advocates, including Kyle Roerink, executive director of the Great Basin Water Network.
“There are quite a few striking similarities,” Roerink said. “We believe that this is much more than a coincidence.”
The project has yet to clear several federal hurdles, and needs a new environmental impact statement — officials in the area say the project is no longer a priority.
Roerink noted that Utah officials have also not ruled out the Lake Powell Pipeline and have continued to pursue the paper water rights that the pipeline would feed.
“This throws an even bigger wrench in a situation that is already rife with conflict, and it underscores that some states continue to believe that water exists, when in reality, we all know it doesn’t,” Roerink said.

He plans to file and appeal regarding his execution within a couple of weeks claiming that he did not assault Lane. (Alabama Department of Corrections)An Alabama death row inmate plans to represent himself in a final appeal of his sentence, weeks before his execution.
Gregory Hunt, convicted of the 1998 murder and sexual assault of Karen Lane, will argue that he killed but did not sexually assault Lane, which would reduce his charge from capital murder to murder and make him ineligible for the death penalty.
“I think that Greg is at peace no matter what happens,” Pastor Jeff Hood, who works with inmates on Alabama’s death row, said at a news conference on Tuesday. “I think he is prepared to die no matter what happens, but he wants people to know that he is sorry for killing Karen Lane but that he did not sexually assault her.”
Messages were sent to both the Governor’s Office and the Alabama Attorney General’s Office on Tuesday seeking comment.
Hunt was convicted on three counts of capital murder by a jury in 1990 and by an 11-1 vote, recommended that he be put to death.  Two of the counts alleged Hunt sexually assaulted Lane; the other said Hunt killed her during a robbery.
The first count dealt with killing Lane during the course of a robbery while the other two counts related to allegations that he sexually abused her.
Federal and state courts in recent years have been unwilling to stop Alabama executions, even in the face of evidence of prior issues with capital punishment in the state.
Hunt, who plans to represent himself, will ask the court to delay his execution and argue his trial attorneys did not present mitigating circumstances from his background or evidence that he did not sexually assault Lane.
He has stated similar claims in his appeals in the past that were rejected by the courts.
According to Hood, Hunt is only challenging capital murder charges related to sexual abuse allegations and not the one pertaining to the robbery.
“When you look at the transcripts, the primary aggravating factor they (prosecutors) focused on was sexual assault,” Hood said. “And this is the problem with these cases. The state gets to move the goalposts.”",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Gregory-Hunt-horizontal-1024x680.jpg,,,2025-05-20 15:08:14.099030

In total, according to the New Mexico Forestry Division, 23 towns, counties, tribal or other jurisdictions across the state have imposed some level of fire restriction due to high fire risk. The division has a map here showing much of the state under some type of burn ban, including federal and state forests. 
“In the face of significant wildfire potential, we need every New Mexican to take active steps to reduce the likelihood of an accidental wildfire start,” State Forester Laura McCarthy said in a statement. “These restrictions are needed because of current wildfire threats and the rising probability of dangerous wildfires as temperatures warm through May and June.”
Forecasters predicted earlier this month that southeastern New Mexico, including the Gila National Forest, would experience above-normal wildfire risk in May that would grow to cover the eastern two thirds of New Mexico by June. A national drought update issued Tuesday said a warm, dry spring had led to intensification of drought conditions in the Intermountain West region, with the worst conditions in New Mexico and Arizona.
So far this year, 377 wildfires in New Mexico have burned more than 33,500 acres, though the vast majority of those fires burned less than an acre. The biggest wildfire this year, so far, the Mogote Hill Fire, burned a little more than 21,000 acres near Wagon Mound in mid-March. 
Of the 377 fires, 275 were human-caused, 26 were naturally caused and causes of the remaining 76 are still being determined, according to the Southwest Coordination Center.
The fire restrictions are in place as most of the state experiences some form of drought. According to the Office of the State Engineer, all but 3.8% of New Mexico is in drought, with 41% in extreme drought and 7.5% in exceptional drought. 
Stage I fire restrictions generally prohibit building a fire in an area other than a developed campsite or picnic area, along with smoking outside of a vehicle or building. State II restrictions also prohibit discharging a firearm, operating an internal combustion engine, welding or using explosives. 
Nowhere in New Mexico is currently under the most severe fire restriction, in which entire areas are closed to the public to prevent wildfires.

Rollins, accompanied by Gov. Jim Pillen on her three-stop tour, was following through on a request Pillen had made earlier. She said the waiver she signed while in Fremont was the first approved by the USDA. It becomes effective Jan. 1.
Pillen, in a news conference last month, said he planned to submit a request for the federal waiver to remove the drink items he describes as unhealthy “junk.”
 ‘First of its kind’

“There’s absolutely zero reason for taxpayers to be subsidizing purchases of soda and energy drinks,” said Pillen.
Rollins called the move “historic” and, in a statement, called Pillen a pioneer, along with the governors of six other states, in improving health in the nation. The waiver amends the definition of food products to be purchased by SNAP benefits, excluding soda, soft drinks, and energy drinks.
“Today’s waiver to remove soda and energy drinks from SNAP is the first of its kind, and it is a historic step to Make America Healthy Again,” Rollins said, adopting the phrasing popularized by the Trump administration’s Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.
Rollins’ visit and approval of the move came the same day the Nebraska Legislature upheld a Pillen veto of a bill that sought to lift a lifetime ban on SNAP benefits for some Nebraskans with past drug felonies.
Lawmakers back Pillen veto, kill bill to lift lifetime ban on food aid for some with drug pasts 

Both measures received instant criticism from nonprofits that work low-income families and inmates reentering their communities. 
Eric Savaiano, manager for food and nutrition access for Nebraska Appleseed, said SNAP is designed to “maintain the dignity” of participants by helping low-paid people buy groceries. He called the latest SNAP ban “poverty-shaming.”
“With the approval of this waiver, some of that dignity is stripped away,” Savaino said.
About 150,000 Nebraskans, or about 7.5% of the state’s population, participate in SNAP, including seniors, children, people with disabilities, working families and veterans. Nebraska Appleseed said the average SNAP benefit received in the state is about $5.82 per person per day.
Savaiano, in a statement, said research shows SNAP recipients buy the same things as everyone else, including soda, soft drinks and energy drinks. “By targeting just SNAP participants, we’re poverty-shaming the most vulnerable among us and adding complications to an already complicated system.” 
He said carrying out the restriction would cause extra expenses to grocers, and he worried that could cause smaller stores to stop serving SNAP recipients altogether, and possibly shut off options in some rural areas.
 ‘Nothing nutritious’ 

Pillen said SNAP is to help families in need get “healthy food into their diets” and that there is “nothing nutritious” about the drinks to be ruled out under the waiver.
“We have to act because we can’t keep letting Nebraskans starve in the midst of plenty,” Pillen said.
Also with Rollins and Pillen during the Nebraska ag tour was Sherry Vinton, director of Nebraska’s Department of Agriculture and U.S. Rep. Adrian Smith, R-Neb. 
The group stopped at the Cargill Bioscience 650-acre facility in Blair, Wholestone Farms in Fremont and the Ohnoutka Family Farm in Valparaiso.

LaMonica McIver was “out of control” while speaking to reporters on the Hill Tuesday.,"Rep. LaMonica McIver said a new federal felony charge won't force her to ""roll over and stop doing my job."" (Dana DiFilippo | New Jersey Monitor)Rep. LaMonica McIver acted as a human shield to thwart the May 9 arrest of Newark Mayor Ras Baraka outside an immigration detention center in Newark, federal authorities say in new court documents. 
An eight-page criminal complaint filed in federal court in New Jersey Monday formally charges McIver (D-10) with two felony counts of assaulting officers during Baraka’s arrest. The complaint includes multiple stills captured by body cameras that the Department of Justice says show her striking, grabbing, and pushing the officers.
The charges against McIver have led to complaints from her fellow Democrats that the Trump administration is weaponizing the justice system to target his political foes. President Donald Trump claimed McIver was “out of control” while speaking to reporters in Washington, D.C., Tuesday. 
“The days of woke are over. That woman, I have no idea who she is. That woman was out of control. She was shoving federal agents. She was out of control,” Trump said. “The days of that crap are over in this country. We’re going to have law and order.”
McIver has called the charges “purely political,” and said she was at the detention center that day as part of her congressional oversight duties.
“I’m not going to roll over and stop doing my job because they, you know, don’t want me to, or they want to neglect the fact that we needed to be in there to see what was going on in that detention center,” McIver said in an interview on CNN Tuesday.

Acting U.S. Attorney Alina Habba announced the charges against McIver on Monday, the same day she said she would drop a trespassing charge her office had filed against Baraka.
The charges stem from a visit McIver made to Delaney Hall, a newly opened migrant jail in Newark that Baraka has said is operating illegally without proper city permits. McIver, along with Democratic Reps. Rob Menendez and Bonnie Watson Coleman, said they wanted to inspect the facility. Baraka was also present.
According to statements made in the criminal complaint by Robert Tansey, a special agent at the Department of Homeland Security’s investigations agency in Newark, the mayor initially entered the property because guards thought he was a member of Congress. An agent approached the mayor and ordered him to leave the facility’s secure area, warning him he would be arrested if he did not do so, the complaint says.
Video shows Baraka exiting the property to join protestors on the other side of the gate separating the street from the detention center. Federal agents then moved to arrest him, and, according to the complaint, McIver started to shout, “Hell no! Hell no! Hell no!”
McIver, Watson Coleman, and other protestors circled the mayor, and during the scuffle that ensued, McIver pushed past a federal agent and pushing another on his shoulder, according to video of the episode.
McIver is represented by one of Habba’s predecessors, Paul Fishman.
“The decision to charge Congresswoman McIver is spectacularly inappropriate. She went to Delaney Hall to do her job. As a member of Congress, she has the right and responsibility to see how ICE is treating detainees. Rather than facilitating that inspection, ICE agents chose to escalate what should have been a peaceful situation into chaos. This prosecution is an attempt to shift the blame for ICE’s behavior to Congresswoman McIver. In the courtroom, facts — not headlines — will matter,” Fishman said in a statement.

Puskar/The Associated Press)In submitting her updated budget proposal in March, Arizona Gov. Katie Hobbs lamented the rising costs of the state’s school vouchers program that directs public dollars to pay private school tuition.
Characterizing vouchers as an “entitlement program,” Hobbs said the state could spend more than $1 billion subsidizing private education in the upcoming fiscal year. The Democratic governor said those expenses could crowd out other budget priorities, including disability programs and pay raises for firefighters and state troopers.
It’s a dilemma that some budget experts fear will become more common nationwide as the costs of school choice measures mount across the states, reaching billions of dollars each year.
“School vouchers are increasingly eating up state budgets in a way that I don’t think is sustainable long term,” said Whitney Tucker, director of state fiscal policy research at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a think tank that advocates for left-leaning tax policies.
Vouchers and scholarship programs, which use taxpayer money to cover private school tuition, are part of the wider school choice movement that also includes charter schools and other alternatives to public schools.
Opponents have long warned about vouchers draining resources from public education as students move from public schools to private ones. But research into several programs has shown many voucher recipients already were enrolled in private schools. That means universal vouchers could drive up costs by creating two parallel education systems — both funded by taxpayers.













School vouchers are increasingly eating up state budgets in a way that I don't think is sustainable long term.


– Whitney Tucker, director of state fiscal policy research at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities





In Arizona, state officials reported most private school students receiving vouchers in the first two years of the expanded program were not previously enrolled in public schools. In fiscal year 2024, more than half the state’s 75,000 voucher recipients were previously enrolled in private schools or were being homeschooled.
“Vouchers don’t shift costs — they add costs,” Joshua Cowen, a professor of education policy at Michigan State University who studies the issue, recently told Stateline. “Most voucher recipients were already in private schools, meaning states are paying for education they previously didn’t have to fund.”
Voucher proponents, though, say those figures can be misleading. Arizona, like other states with recent expansions, previously had more modest voucher programs. So some kids who were already enrolled in private schools could have already been receiving state subsidies.
In addition to increasing competition, supporters say the programs can actually save taxpayer dollars by delivering education at a lower overall cost than traditional public schools.
One thing is certain: With a record number of students receiving subsidies to attend private schools, vouchers are quickly creating budget concerns for some state leaders.
The rising costs of school choice measures come after years of deep cuts to income taxes in many states, leaving them with less money to spend. An end of pandemic-era aid and potential looming cuts to federal support also have created widespread uncertainty about state budgets.
“We’re seeing a number of things that are creating a sort of perfect storm from a fiscal perspective in the states,” said Tucker, of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.
Last year, Arizona leaders waded through an estimated $1.3 billion budget shortfall. Budget experts said the voucher program was responsible for hundreds of millions of that deficit.
A new universal voucher program in Texas is expected to cost $1 billion over its next two-year budget cycle — a figure that could balloon to nearly $5 billion by 2030, according to a legislative fiscal note.
Earlier this year, Wyoming Republican Gov. Mark Gordon signed a bill expanding the state’s voucher program. But last week, he acknowledged his own “substantial concerns” about the state’s ability to fund vouchers and its public education obligations under the constitution.
“I think the legislature’s got a very tall task to understand how they’re going to be able to fund all of these things,” he said in an interview with WyoFile.
Voucher proponents, who have been active at the state level for years, are gaining new momentum with support from President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans.
In January, Trump ordered federal agencies to allow states, tribes and military families to access federal money for private K-12 education through education savings accounts, voucher programs or tax credits.
Last week, Republicans on the House Ways and Means Committee voted in favor of making $20 billion available over the next four years for a federal school voucher program. Part of broader work on a bill to extend Trump’s 2017 tax cuts, the measure would need a simple majority in the House and the Senate to pass.
Martin Lueken, the director of the Fiscal Research and Education Center at EdChoice, a nonprofit that advocates for school choice measures, argues school choice measures can actually deliver savings to taxpayers.
Lueken said vouchers are not to blame for state budget woes. He said public school systems for years have increased spending faster than inflation. And he noted that school choice measures make up a small share of overall state spending — nationally about 0.3% of total state expenditures in states with school choice, he said.
“Public schooling remains one of the largest line items in state budgets,” he said in an interview. “They are still the dominant provider of K-12 education, and certainly looking at the education pie, they still receive the lion’s share.
“It’s not a choice problem. I would say that it’s a problem with the status quo and the public school system,” he said.
Washington, D.C., and 35 states offer some school choice programs, according to EdChoice. That includes 18 states with voucher programs so expansive that virtually all students can participate regardless of income.
But Lueken said framing vouchers as a new entitlement program is misleading. That’s because all students, even the wealthiest, have always been entitled to a public education — whether they’ve chosen to attend free public schools or private ones that charge tuition.
“At the end of the day, the thing that matters most above dollars are students and families,” he said. “Research is clear that competition works. Public schools have responded in very positive ways when they are faced with increased competitive pressure from choice programs.”
Public school advocates say funding both private and public schools is untenable.
In Wisconsin, Republican lawmakers are considering a major voucher expansion that would alter the funding structure for vouchers, potentially putting more strain on the state’s general fund.
The state spent about $629 million on its four voucher programs during the 2024-2025 school year, according to the Wisconsin Association of School Business Officials, which represents employees in school district finance, human resources and leadership.
The association warns proposed legislation could exacerbate problems with the “unaffordable parallel school systems” in place now by shifting more private schooling costs from parents of those students to state taxpayers at large.
Such expansion “could create the conditions for even greater funding challenges for Wisconsin’s traditional public schools and the state budget as a whole,” the association’s research director wrote in a paper on the issue.
In Arizona, Hobbs originally sought to eliminate the universal voucher program — a nonstarter in the Republican-controlled legislature. She has since proposed shrinking the program by placing income limits that would disqualify the state’s wealthiest families.
That idea also faced Republican opposition.
Legislators are now pushing to enshrine access to vouchers in the state constitution.
Marisol Garcia, president of the Arizona Education Association, the state’s 20,000-member teachers union, noted that vouchers and public education funds are both sourced from the general fund.
“So it almost immediately started to impact public services,” she said of the universal voucher program.
While the union says vouchers have led to cutbacks of important resources such as counselors in public schools, Garcia said the sweeping program also affects the state’s ability to fund other services like housing, transportation and health care.
“Every budget cycle becomes where can we cut in order to essentially feed this out-of-control program?” she said.

Emily Chenevert's House Bill 685 (Wes Muller/Louisiana Illuminator) The Louisiana House of Representatives approved a bill Monday that would ban diversity, equity and inclusion practices across state government and prohibit state universities and colleges from requiring certain race and gender-based curriculum for undergraduate students. 
House Bill 685 by Rep. Emily Chenevert, R-Baton Rouge, advanced from the House on a 57-32 vote, narrowly clearing the 53-vote threshold for passage. Sixteen members, including several moderate Democrats and Republicans, were absent for the vote.
In an unusual move, every Democratic lawmaker present stood together in solidarity behind the House floor lectern, while nearly every Black lawmaker took turns making speeches against the bill. 
“To me, this is an anti-Black bill,” Rep. Edmond Jordan of Baton Rouge said. “It’s not just divisive. It’s offensive.”
“This is the most racially oppressive piece of legislation that I think I’ve seen,” Rep. Candace Newell of New Orleans said. 
Republican Reps. Beth Billings of Deshrehan, Vincent Cox of Gretna and Jeff Wiley of Maurepas joined Democrats in opposing the bill. 
“It was needlessly divisive,” Billings said in an interview when asked why she opposed the bill. 
In tearful comments after the speeches, Chenevert said her bill is not racist. 
“This is not divisive,” Chenevert said. “This is protecting every Louisianian. This is about equality for all.” 
Chenevert’s bill has been dramatically rewritten from her original legislation, which only banned DEI practices in state government. 
As is, the bill would prohibit required classes that cover any of the following subjects: 

Critical race theory
White fragility or white guilt
Systemic racism, institutional racism or anti-racism
Systemic bias or implicit bias 
Intersectionality
Gender identity
Allyship
Race-based reparations
Race-based privilege

Amendments added to the bill on the House floor would allow any of the subjects to be taught if it is “included at the discretion of the faculty member, is not prescribed by the institution as a program requirement, and is part of a broader pedagogical objective.” 
Opponents of the bill said even with the amendments, the legislation could have a chilling effect on faculty’s academic freedom and freedom of speech. 
The bill also makes an exception for majors, minors and certificates that are specifically related to race or gender studies. 
The Louisiana chapter of the American Association of University Professors sent a letter to lawmakers Monday asking them to oppose the bill. 
“This legislation would stifle the ‘marketplace of ideas’ and infantilize our students, forcing faculty to avoid concepts the legislature dislikes and presenting only those that have gained their favor,” the letter reads. “This is antithetical to freedom in a democratic society and hurts our students as they transition into fully enfranchised citizens.” 
The Southern University Foundation, which is affiliated with Louisiana’s largest historically Black  university, also opposes the bill. 
Chenevert’s bill will next be discussed in a Senate committee.

(Photo by James Brooks/Alaska Beacon)For the first time since 2002, the Alaska Legislature has overridden the veto of a sitting governor.
With a 46-14 vote, lawmakers enacted a significant increase to Alaska’s per-student public funding formula, overriding Gov. Mike Dunleavy’s decision to reject House Bill 57. Forty votes were needed for an override. 
It was the third time in two years that the governor vetoed a significant education funding bill; lawmakers failed by a single vote to override the governor last year. A second veto earlier this year was sustained by a larger margin.
Tuesday’s vote may be the first chapter in a longer struggle between the governor and the Legislature. 
HB 57 prescribes an increase to the state’s public school funding formula, but that formula is subject to appropriations in the annual state budget. To use an analogy: If the formula is a bucket, the budget fills that bucket. 
Dunleavy has previously said he may veto some education money from the state budget, leaving the formula only partially funded.
In addition, parts of HB 57 are contingent upon the enactment of Senate Bill 113, a bill adjusting the state’s corporate income taxes. On Monday, Dunleavy implied that he will veto SB 113.
Overriding either a funding veto or a veto of SB 113 would require 45 votes.
Some legislators who voted to override the governor on Monday declined to confirm that they would override vetoes on the two funding mechanisms.

(Photo by Nancy Lavin/Rhode Island Current). Senate Majority Leader Frank Ciccone’s side business selling guns out of his house does not prevent him from discussing and voting on an assault-style weapons ban or other gun legislation, the Rhode Island Ethics Commission decided Tuesday.
The ethics panel’s 8-1 vote follows the recommendation put forth by its expert staff, which concluded that Ciccone’s federal firearms license is not a conflict of interest with the high-profile gun legislation pending at the Rhode Island State House. The four-page opinion, presented by Staff Attorney Lynne Radiches, invoked the class exemption within the state’s ethics code, reasoning that Ciccone does not stand to benefit, or suffer, any more or less from state gun laws than the other 98 federally licensed firearms dealers in the state, including the other 79 with a Class 1 license.
Ciccone, a Providence Democrat, referenced the same exemption in his letter to the Ethics Commission asking for advice. 
Ciccone has been a licensed firearms dealer for decades. Should he recuse himself from gun debate?

Ciccone, who did not attend Tuesday’s meeting, was unaware of the commission’s decision until he was contacted by Rhode Island Current.
“I believe they looked at all the facts, and they came to their conclusion,” Ciccone said.
However, the advisory opinion comes with an important caveat: If any of the gun bills under review by the Rhode Island General Assembly, including the assault weapons ban legislation, are amended in a way that impacts Ciccone, or fellow Class 1 license holders, more than other federal firearms dealers, Ciccone should recuse himself or seek a new advisory opinion.
Ciccone, a longtime opponent to state gun restrictions, has already indicated he wants to see changes to the assault-style weapons ban in order for him to support it.
Fresh off a marathon hearing before the Senate Committee on Judiciary on May 14, Ciccone said he still has questions over the legality of the legislation as drafted. However, Ciccone declined to specify what changes he’d like to see made, or whether he intends to back the controversial issue already named a top priority by Gov. Dan McKee.
“I am waiting to see what decisions the committee is going to make, what changes the sponsor is going to make,” Ciccone said. “At this point in time, I don’t know. It’s up to the committee.”
A committee vote on the assault weapons ban bill has not been scheduled as of Tuesday.
Better late than never
Ciccone has served as a state lawmaker for 22 years, and been licensed to sell guns since the 1980s. But this was the first time he asked for ethics advice on gun-related legislation. Asked why now, Ciccone said he never served on the Senate Judiciary committee, and therefore had little sway over whether gun-related bills advanced to the full chamber.
Now, as the newly elected Senate majority leader, Ciccone is an ex-officio member on all Senate committees, meaning he can vote to advance a bill to the full chamber. 
Ethics Commissioner Christopher Callahan cast the sole vote against giving Ciccone permission to vote on gun bills, pointing to Ciccone’s leadership role as reason for his hesitation.
“My perception is that there is potential as a senior political leader that he may have greater influence on the outcome of the decision,” Callahan said in an interview after the meeting. Callahan, the retired head of the Rhode Island National Guard, was tapped by Gov. Dan McKee in April to serve on the state ethics panel.
Commissioner Hugo Ricci Jr. disagreed.
“He has one vote, the same as any other lawmaker,” Ricci said during the commission discussion. “He’s not president of the Senate.”
Some commission members questioned whether the 99 federal firearms dealers in Rhode Island is a large enough number to apply the class exemption. There is no minimum laid out in the ethics code, leaving it up to the panel to determine on a case-by-base basis whether belonging to an affected group constitutes reason to grant exception to potential conflicts of interest.
“It’s not a perfect science,” Radiches, the staff attorney, told the committee. “The big numbers, we love, like 13,000 teachers.”
“I don’t think we should get into a finite discussion with facts that are presented as to whether 99 is not enough,” Commissioner Frank Cenerini said.
The size of an affected group is one of several variables the commission must weigh when considering whether a class exemption applies. Other factors include the importance of “the function or official action being contemplated by the public official” and “the nature and degree of foreseeable impact upon the class and its individual members as a result of the official action,” according to standard language in ethics opinions that involve class exemptions.
Common Cause Rhode Island Executive Director John Marion, who attended the meeting, said he was not surprised that the panel granted permission for Ciccone to vote on gun bills, given its “liberal” application of the class exemption in recent history. 
However, Marion said he wished the panel had a more robust discussion of Ciccone’s role in leadership.
“The majority leader helps set the agenda for the chamber, deciding what bills move and what bill dies,” Marion said. “That’s part of what the ethics commission can regulate.”
Marion expects the need for ethics input on legislative conflicts of interest will increase under the new Senate leadership team, both for Ciccone and for Senate President Valarie Lawson. Lawson’s day job as president of one of the state’s two largest teachers’ unions has already prompted concern by some of her colleagues about potential conflicts of interest. She has not requested an advisory opinion from the Ethics Commission since her election on April 30, though she said at the time she was considering it.
“Out of an abundance of caution, she is in the process of formulating a question to the Ethics Commission and will be submitting it to them soon,” Greg Pare, a spokesperson for Senate leadership, said in an email Tuesday.
This story was updated to correct when Senate leaders can vote on bills in committee.

Bob Ferguson on Tuesday signed into law a controversial policy requiring gun buyers to first pay for a new state permit. 
Starting in two years, House Bill 1163 will require those interested in purchasing guns to apply for a five-year permit through the Washington State Patrol. Applicants must pay a fee and have completed a certified firearms safety training program within the past five years, with limited exceptions.
“Gun violence in Washington state breaks apart too many families and kills too many children,” Ferguson said. “We must put commonsense reforms into place that save lives.”
Ferguson, a Democrat, advocated for gun control in his three terms as Washington’s attorney general.
The permit system, set to take effect on May 1, 2027, goes beyond the state’s existing background checks, which also require proof of completion of a firearm safety course. Washington also has a 10-day waiting period after a gun dealer requests a background check before they can hand over the gun.
State authorities will have to approve one of these new permits if the applicant meets the criteria, as long as they aren’t the subject of an arrest warrant or barred from having guns in the first place.
The state patrol must issue the permit within 30 days, or 60 days if the applicant doesn’t have a state identification card. If an applicant feels the state wrongly denied them a permit, they can appeal in court.
The state patrol expects the new program will cost just over $20 million in the 2027-29 budget cycle. Fees collected for fingerprinting and background checks would offset the cost. The system could bring in over $35 million in the 2027-29 biennium, according to the latest fiscal analysis.
The measure passed the Legislature along party lines, with Democrats in support. 
Democrats say the law will strengthen the state’s efforts to limit gun violence and suicides. 
The bill’s prime sponsor, Rep. Liz Berry, D-Seattle, said the law has been a decade in the making.
“I am a mom of two young kids, and I’m someone who has lost someone I love to gun violence,” she said Tuesday. “This bill is transformative for our state, and we’re not done. We’ve got more to do.”
Republicans and gun owners counter that the law is an unconstitutional barrier to the right to bear arms, which is embedded in the state and U.S. constitutions.
Some critics insist the law will face court challenges in light of a U.S. Supreme Court ruling in 2022 in which the justices ruled new gun laws need to be aligned with the nation’s “historical tradition of firearm regulation.”
About a dozen other states have such permit-to-purchase systems. Courts across the country have largely upheld them.
This month, the state Supreme Court upheld a similarly divisive ban on the sale of high-capacity ammunition magazines in a 7-2 ruling, but didn’t grapple with whether Washington’s law stayed true to the historical tradition. 
Opponents of that law vowed to ask the U.S. Supreme Court to weigh in on Second Amendment grounds.
The new permit-to-purchase law was the primary piece of gun control legislation lawmakers approved in Olympia this year. 
Failed measures would have restricted bulk purchases of ammunition and firearms, imposed an excise tax on firearm and ammunition sales, added new requirements for weapons dealers and further limited the public places where people can carry firearms.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/guns-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-20 13:18:42.636018

While his concerns span topics from facilitator qualifications to federal drug scheduling to child safety, his argument leans heavily on fear-based rhetoric and misinformation.
As a psychiatrist and licensed psilocybin facilitator, I offer a different view — one grounded in research, clinical experience, and a commitment to truth over alarmism.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Psilocybin’s legal status is not a measure of its safety
Niforatos argues that psilocybin is dangerous because it’s a Schedule I drug and lacks Food and Drug Administration approval. But those labels are not reliable markers of safety — they’re often shaped by outdated political bias and institutional inertia, not scientific evidence.
There is a vast body of research supporting the use of psilocybin for various psychiatric conditions. Institutions like Johns Hopkins and New York University have demonstrated its potential to treat depression, PTSD and addiction.
The FDA has approved countless psychiatric medications that carry serious risks, including increased suicidality. As a psychiatrist, I’ve treated thousands of patients whose lives were made worse by these medications — people left numb, disconnected and hopeless. I’ve seen firsthand how little those official stamps of approval can mean when these treatments not only fail to heal— but actively inflict harm.
Pointing to psilocybin’s legal status and saying that alone means it’s not safe ignores the science — and the people it’s already helping.
 Many facilitators are licensed mental health professionals
The claim that natural medicine facilitators are unqualified is not just wrong — it’s insulting. I’m a board-certified psychiatrist and licensed psilocybin facilitator. I know dozens of others across Colorado who are licensed psychologists, social workers and therapists — professionals who have spent their careers helping people heal, and who are now integrating psilocybin into their clinical practice with care and integrity.
At centers like Reflective Healing, Reset, LLC, and Rose NeuroSpa (where I practice), licensed mental health providers will soon be offering psilocybin within structured, ethical and regulated environments. A glance at their websites is enough to dispel the myth.
To call these professionals unqualified isn’t just misinformation — it’s a dismissal of the very people working to push mental health care in a more effective and humane direction.
 Healing centers are regulated — and not a danger to children
Perhaps the most absurd claim in Niforatos’ article is that psychedelic healing centers pose a danger to children. It’s vague, unsubstantiated and frankly irresponsible. These centers are not dispensaries. They’re not casual walk-in clinics. They are private, appointment-only spaces where every participant must be 21 or older by law and undergo a rigorous screening process. Children are not present, not permitted, and not remotely part of this system.
Colorado has built one of the most comprehensive regulatory frameworks for natural medicine in the country. Healing centers must adhere to strict safety standards, undergo state oversight, and follow detailed protocols set by the Colorado Department of Regulatory Agencies. Every session is carefully planned, supervised and documented.
If anything, the system is conservative by design. It provides access to promising therapies while maintaining strong safeguards. To suggest these centers endanger youth is not only inaccurate — it’s irresponsible fear-mongering that distracts from meaningful conversations about public safety.
 Yes, Colorado is in crisis — that’s exactly why we need psilocybin
On one point, Niforatos and I agree: Colorado is facing a mental health crisis. Depression, suicide, trauma and addiction are widespread. Too many people are slipping through the cracks. And for many, traditional medicines aren’t enough.
That’s why we need to expand, not restrict, our treatments. Psilocybin is not a cure-all — no treatment is — but when used in a structured setting with trained professionals, it can offer real relief. This work isn’t being driven by fringe movements. It’s being led by hundreds of licensed professionals and state regulators who believe in psilocybin’s potential and are working to deliver it with integrity and care.
We owe it to those who are suffering to keep the door open, not slam it shut in defense of a system that’s already failing too many. There are powerful interests invested in maintaining that failure — where keeping people suffering sustains profit, and healing threatens the business model.
Now is the time to listen to the science, trust the professionals doing this work with integrity, and stay open to the promise this medicine holds.

Puskar/The Associated Press)This story originally appeared on Stateline.
In submitting her updated budget proposal in March, Arizona Gov. Katie Hobbs lamented the rising costs of the state’s school vouchers program that directs public dollars to pay private school tuition.
Characterizing vouchers as an “entitlement program,” Hobbs said the state could spend more than $1 billion subsidizing private education in the upcoming fiscal year. The Democratic governor said those expenses could crowd out other budget priorities, including disability programs and pay raises for firefighters and state troopers.
It’s a dilemma that some budget experts fear will become more common nationwide as the costs of school choice measures mount across the states, reaching billions of dollars each year.

“School vouchers are increasingly eating up state budgets in a way that I don’t think is sustainable long term,” said Whitney Tucker, director of state fiscal policy research at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a think tank that advocates for left-leaning tax policies.
Vouchers and scholarship programs, which use taxpayer money to cover private school tuition, are part of the wider school choice movement that also includes charter schools and other alternatives to public schools.
Opponents have long warned about vouchers draining resources from public education as students move from public schools to private ones. But research into several programs has shown many voucher recipients already were enrolled in private schools. That means universal vouchers could drive up costs by creating two parallel education systems — both funded by taxpayers.











School vouchers are increasingly eating up state budgets in a way that I don't think is sustainable long term.


– Whitney Tucker, director of state fiscal policy research at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities



In Arizona, state officials reported most private school students receiving vouchers in the first two years of the expanded program were not previously enrolled in public schools. In fiscal year 2024, more than half the state’s 75,000 voucher recipients were previously enrolled in private schools or were being homeschooled.
“Vouchers don’t shift costs — they add costs,” Joshua Cowen, a professor of education policy at Michigan State University who studies the issue, recently told Stateline. “Most voucher recipients were already in private schools, meaning states are paying for education they previously didn’t have to fund.”
Voucher proponents, though, say those figures can be misleading. Arizona, like other states with recent expansions, previously had more modest voucher programs. So some kids who were already enrolled in private schools could have already been receiving state subsidies.
In addition to increasing competition, supporters say the programs can actually save taxpayer dollars by delivering education at a lower overall cost than traditional public schools.
One thing is certain: With a record number of students receiving subsidies to attend private schools, vouchers are quickly creating budget concerns for some state leaders.
The rising costs of school choice measures come after years of deep cuts to income taxes in many states, leaving them with less money to spend. An end of pandemic-era aid and potential looming cuts to federal support also have created widespread uncertainty about state budgets.

“We’re seeing a number of things that are creating a sort of perfect storm from a fiscal perspective in the states,” said Tucker, of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.
Last year, Arizona leaders waded through an estimated $1.3 billion budget shortfall. Budget experts said the voucher program was responsible for hundreds of millions of that deficit.
A new universal voucher program in Texas is expected to cost $1 billion over its next two-year budget cycle — a figure that could balloon to nearly $5 billion by 2030, according to a legislative fiscal note.
Earlier this year, Wyoming Republican Gov. Mark Gordon signed a bill expanding the state’s voucher program. But last week, he acknowledged his own “substantial concerns” about the state’s ability to fund vouchers and its public education obligations under the constitution.
“I think the legislature’s got a very tall task to understand how they’re going to be able to fund all of these things,” he said in an interview with WyoFile.
Voucher proponents, who have been active at the state level for years, are gaining new momentum with support from President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans.
In January, Trump ordered federal agencies to allow states, tribes and military families to access federal money for private K-12 education through education savings accounts, voucher programs or tax credits.
Last week, Republicans on the House Ways and Means Committee voted in favor of making $20 billion available over the next four years for a federal school voucher program. Part of broader work on a bill to extend Trump’s 2017 tax cuts, the measure would need a simple majority in the House and the Senate to pass.

Martin Lueken, the director of the Fiscal Research and Education Center at EdChoice, a nonprofit that advocates for school choice measures, argues school choice measures can actually deliver savings to taxpayers.
Lueken said vouchers are not to blame for state budget woes. He said public school systems for years have increased spending faster than inflation. And he noted that school choice measures make up a small share of overall state spending — nationally about 0.3% of total state expenditures in states with school choice, he said.
“Public schooling remains one of the largest line items in state budgets,” he said in an interview. “They are still the dominant provider of K-12 education, and certainly looking at the education pie, they still receive the lion’s share.
“It’s not a choice problem. I would say that it’s a problem with the status quo and the public school system,” he said.
Washington, D.C., and 35 states offer some school choice programs, according to EdChoice. That includes 18 states with voucher programs so expansive that virtually all students can participate regardless of income.
But Lueken said framing vouchers as a new entitlement program is misleading. That’s because all students, even the wealthiest, have always been entitled to a public education — whether they’ve chosen to attend free public schools or private ones that charge tuition.
“At the end of the day, the thing that matters most above dollars are students and families,” he said. “Research is clear that competition works. Public schools have responded in very positive ways when they are faced with increased competitive pressure from choice programs.”
Public school advocates say funding both private and public schools is untenable.

In Wisconsin, Republican lawmakers are considering a major voucher expansion that would alter the funding structure for vouchers, potentially putting more strain on the state’s general fund.
The state spent about $629 million on its four voucher programs during the 2024-2025 school year, according to the Wisconsin Association of School Business Officials, which represents employees in school district finance, human resources and leadership.
The association warns proposed legislation could exacerbate problems with the “unaffordable parallel school systems” in place now by shifting more private schooling costs from parents of those students to state taxpayers at large.
Such expansion “could create the conditions for even greater funding challenges for Wisconsin’s traditional public schools and the state budget as a whole,” the association’s research director wrote in a paper on the issue.
In Arizona, Hobbs originally sought to eliminate the universal voucher program — a nonstarter in the Republican-controlled legislature. She has since proposed shrinking the program by placing income limits that would disqualify the state’s wealthiest families.
That idea also faced Republican opposition.
Legislators are now pushing to enshrine access to vouchers in the state constitution.
Marisol Garcia, president of the Arizona Education Association, the state’s 20,000-member teachers union, noted that vouchers and public education funds are both sourced from the general fund.
“So it almost immediately started to impact public services,” she said of the universal voucher program.
While the union says vouchers have led to cutbacks of important resources such as counselors in public schools, Garcia said the sweeping program also affects the state’s ability to fund other services like housing, transportation and health care.
“Every budget cycle becomes where can we cut in order to essentially feed this out-of-control program?” she said.

(Photo from Iowa District Court records) A professional hunter is suing a state Department of Natural Resources officer whose alleged false claims damaged his business and reputation.
Mark Allen Luster of Burlington is suing Iowa DNR Officer Dan Henderson, in his personal capacity, in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Iowa, alleging malicious prosecution and “blatant violations of the Fourth Amendment.”
In court records, Luster describes himself as professional hunter and land management consultant who specializes in designing hunting properties “to attract the largest and most prized buck deer” for hunting. “Luster has been incredibly successful as a professional hunter, and he has ‘bagged’ some of the most prized trophy-worthy bucks,” the lawsuit claims. “His livelihood is dependent on his reputation and his ability to maintain his hunting license.”
In the summer of 2024, Luster began developing an 82-acre hunting property that he owned with a friend through a limited liability company called CWD Research. According to the lawsuit, on Oct. 14, 2024, Luster shot a large whitetail buck with a bow and arrow on his CWD Research property. The next day, he located and harvested the deer, then posted a photo of the kill to Facebook captioned, “Checkmate!”
The same day, Henderson reportedly received an emailed complaint from a confidential informant who had seen the Facebook post and asserted there had been bait placed on the CWD Research property in violation of state law, as evidenced by aerial drone photos the informant had collected several weeks earlier.
  This photo was taken on property owned by professional hunter Mark Allen Luster of Burlington, who is suing a state DNR officer for alleged false claims that damaged Luster’s business and reputation. (Photo from U.S. District Court records.)
Henderson submitted an application for a search warrant, seeking to collect soil samples on the property to determine whether bait was being used. Henderson’s warrant application alleged there were photos showing a deer “utilizing” bait in the area, and also suggested Henderson had learned of the illegal baiting through comments someone had made in “in passing,” the lawsuit alleges.
In reality, the lawsuit claims, Henderson was trying to conceal the fact that an informant used “illegally obtained” aerial drone photos. In Iowa, it’s a crime to pilot a surveillance drone over any secure farmstead area.
“Officer Henderson either did not want to disclose that the confidential informant had illegally obtained the information that he was relying on, or he did not want to disclose that the aerial drone photos were obtained through some other improper means,” the lawsuit alleges.
A search warrant was issued allowing Henderson to collect soil samples “in front of cellular trail camera near black hunting blind” and in other nearby sites. On Oct. 16, Henderson visited the property, covered Luster’s trail camera for roughly 14 minutes, and collected samples, the lawsuit stated.
Charges filed and later dismissed
In November 2024, Henderson submitted an affidavit for a search warrant for Luster’s residence, indicating the samples collected by him had shown evidence of bait being used as suggested by the presence of sodium and the chemical DEET. The lawsuit alleges both substances can be explained by factors other than bait.
The warrant was granted and while serving the warrant at Luster’s home, Henderson also served Luster with three criminal complaints charging him with making a false claim for a license, hunting a deer in the presence of bait, and attempting to hunt a deer in the presence of bait.
On Jan. 10, 2025, prosecutors filed a motion to dismiss the charge of making a false claim for a license, which was based on the erroneous assumption Luster didn’t own the CWD Research property. Luster then filed a motion to suppress evidence obtained in support of the other two charges, arguing the search warrants were based on false allegations.
On March 18, 2025, prosecutors Iowa moved to dismiss the remaining two charges, telling a judge that DNR “is refusing to disclose the identity of a material witness, despite multiple requests from the Henry County Attorney’s Office to do so.”
Court filings in the criminal case include images from Luster’s trail camera that show “a buck muffin” — a deer-nutrition product derived from ethanol grains — was on the property in July 2024. Attorneys for Luster told the court that by September 2024 the “buck muffin had been removed from the property” — a full month before Luster killed the deer in question.
Between the time the charges were levied against Luster and their eventual dismissal, Luster’s “life and career were turned upside down,” the lawsuit claims.
“In the professional hunting community, one’s reputation is paramount to financial success, and allegations that a person unlawfully hunted with bait provide a significant stain on a professional hunter’s reputation,” the lawsuit alleges. “Luster has suffered significant reputational harm, which has led to his loss of speaking appearances on hunting podcasts, derogation by those that comment on hunting matters, and a loss of business for Luster as a professional land manager and designer of hunting grounds.”
As for why Henderson would have included false or misleading information in his warrant applications, the lawsuit posits that Luster’s success as a hunter has led to “animosity from other hunters and the DNR, including its officers, like Officer Henderson.”
It goes on to argue that “Henderson believed that if he were to obtain evidence pursuant to the search warrant he could then pursue misdemeanor charges against Luster for hunting violations, and with a conviction on those charges, the Iowa Department of Natural Resources could revoke Luster’s hunting license… Luster is known to the DNR. Luster is a professional hunting consultant and a renowned hunter.
The lawsuit seeks unspecified compensatory and punitive damages for unlawful search and malicious prosecution. Henderson has yet to file a response to the lawsuit and did not return a call seeking comment. The DNR is not named as a defendant in the case.",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Deer-on-Luster-prorperty-July-2024-1024x690.jpg,,,2025-05-20 13:18:42.636018

This story was originally published by The 19th.
On Monday, President Donald Trump signed the bipartisan Take It Down Act, which criminalizes the distribution of nonconsensual intimate imagery, including so-called “revenge porn” and deepfakes generated by artificial intelligence.
In addition to creating federal-level criminal consequences, the new law requires online platforms to implement a request-and-removal system where victims of image-based sexual abuse can have their pictures taken down within 48 hours.
The House and Senate sent the measure to the president’s desk with nearly unanimous approval.
US bill with backing from SC legislator heads to president’s desk

Sen. Ted Cruz, the Texas Republican who chairs the Senate Commerce Committee, championed the bill after one of his teenage constituents was victimized by nonconsensual deepfakes.
It has been the main legislation that first lady Melania Trump has weighed in on since her husband returned to office. Democratic Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, Republican Rep. María Elvira Salazar of Florida and Democratic Rep. Madeleine Dean of Pennsylvania led the bipartisan push for the bill.
Teenage activists Elliston Berry and Francesca Mani, both victims of nonconsensual deepfakes, appeared at a roundtable hosted by the first lady to advocate for the bill on March 3.
With the Take It Down Act now law, The 19th explains how it will be implemented and how to request the takedown of explicit images created or shared without permission.
When does the Take it Down Act go into effect?
The criminal provisions of the law will go into effect immediately.
Online platforms have one year from the signing of the bill to create a process that facilitates the removal of nonconsensual intimate images.
What kind of images are covered by the Take It Down Act?
The law is meant to narrowly cover sexually explicit images that have either been shared without the subject’s consent or images that have been created without the consent of the subject, such as with generative AI or through media manipulation.
The definition of sexually explicit content builds on previous federal code, and includes “the uncovered genitals, pubic area, anus or post-pubescent female nipple of an identifiable individual;” the “display or transfer of bodily sexual fluids;” graphic sexual intercourse; bestiality; masturbation; sadistic or masochistic abuse; and “graphic or simulated lascivious exhibition” of anuses, genitals or the pubic area.
Synthetic images — or “digital forgeries” as the bill labels them — must be of “indistinguishable from an authentic visual depiction” of an identifiable individual.
The definition is tailored to not apply to all digital forgeries, even ones that might seem explicit on the surface. For instance, advocates have pointed out that the viral fake video of Trump licking Elon Musk’s feet wouldn’t necessarily qualify for removal or prosecution under the Take It Down Act.
How can I get images removed in the meantime? 
The Cyber Civil Rights Initiative, a nonprofit fighting online abuse, operates a free 24/7 hotline to assist victims of image-based sexual abuse at 1-844-878-2274.
Their Safety Center also maintains a list of experienced attorneys and individual state laws.
Distributing intimate images without consent isn’t just a crime, it’s a threat to democracy

As of May 2025, all states and the District of Columbia have some form of law banning image-based sexual abuse, though there are significant variances in the circumstances and types of media covered.
The first step is to make sure you are physically safe, as image-based sexual abuse is frequently an escalation of intimate partner violence. Help is available through the National Domestic Violence Hotline online or through their free 24/7 phone line at 1-800-799-7233.
CCRI recommends documenting evidence of abuse, including screenshots or PDFs of online search results or websites. They suggest keeping both digital and physical copies (printouts, for example) of evidence, and saving other relevant documents like text messages or emails.
Omny Miranda Martone, the founder and CEO of the Sexual Violence Prevention Association, recommends taking screenshots with URLs, the username of the poster, the date and the time the nonconsensual content was shared. Documentation is critical, they said, for pursuing criminal or civil action.
Make sure to only collect documentation of digital sexual violence that depicts you or someone who has authorized collection on their behalf explicitly in writing, Martone said. They also suggest storing evidence in a secure cloud folder or encrypted drive.
Major websites and image-hosting platforms have ways to request image takedowns for emergencies such as these. CCRI has a short list of contacts for major search engines, social media platforms, dating services and pornography sites.
If images you took of yourself have been posted without your consent, filing a copyright claim is another option. Without My Consent, now part of CCRI, has a resource all about filing Digital Millennium Copyright Act takedown requests.
“No one should have to go through this alone,” Martone said, recommending that victims reach out to a victims’ right attorney or advocacy organization for help navigating processes safely and confidentially. In a rapidly changing legal landscape, “talking to a professional will ensure you receive up to date information and guidance.”
What if the images are of a minor?  
Explicit images of minors are treated differently, as real images are child sexual abuse material — formally known in most legal code as child pornography — and carry severe penalties.
There are specific, dedicated resources to assist victims of child sexual abuse material.
The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, which is authorized and funded by Congress, maintains a CyberTipline to report incidents of child exploitation. Anyone can report to the tipline, and the organization also maintains a 24/7 hotline at 1-800-843-5678.
Take It Down, an initiative from NCMEC that is unaffiliated with the bill of the same name, provides services to anyone who needs assistance removing child sexual abuse material of themselves from the internet.
What might prevent the Take It Down Act from being implemented?
It’s not unlikely that the law could be challenged in court on grounds that it infringes on the First Amendment. Digital rights groups have criticized the request-and-removal provision of the bill, calling it overbroad and a threat to free speech.
The Electronic Frontier Foundation, a tech policy think tank, argues that the takedown provision could apply to consensual sexual images as well.
It is one of several groups that have highlighted how the request-and-removal process could be ripe for abuse, especially given that the 48-hour timeline may not provide covered platforms with enough time to verify that the content is nonconsensual.
The Center for Democracy and Technology sent a letter to the House Energy and Commerce Committee, urging members to amend the bill to explicitly exclude encrypted services, fearing that platforms will need access to private messages in order to comply with the takedown requests.
Trump’s assertion that he would use the Take It Down Act for himself — “nobody is treated worse online than I am, nobody” he said during his address to the joint session of Congress in March — made activists worry that the bill could be used to remove critical political speech, especially in the context of a wider crackdown by the current administration.
There may also be some issues with enforcing the request-and-removal requirement, which falls to the Federal Trade Commission. An executive order threatens the independence of the agency, and Trump fired the two Democratic Commissioners without cause, which the Supreme Court has previously ruled the president cannot do.
What else should victims know?
Martone also shared some words for anyone being targeted with image-based sexual abuse.

Meanwhile, the person who filed the complaint that gave rise to the prosecution — veteran campaign finance watchdog Bob Hall — is criticizing the settlement of the matter as “pitiful.”
The case stems from the political controversy that surrounded the removal of the so-called “Silent Sam” statute from the campus of UNC-Chapel Hill in 2018, and the subsequent back-and-forth that took place between UNC officials, state lawmakers, and private groups that sought to preserve and take control of the statue after it was torn down during a campus protest.
In January of 2020, Hall filed a lengthy and detailed complaint with the Board of Elections in which he provided evidence that the North Carolina Division, Sons of Confederate Veterans, along with individual leaders of the group and affiliated organizations were involved in illegally financing the NC Heritage PAC. That PAC, in turn, donated thousands of dollars to an array of Republican officeholders and candidates.
Last Friday’s notice reported that “NC Heritage PAC Treasurer Mitchell Flinchum and NC Heritage PAC Assistant Treasurer Thomas Smith each pled guilty to one misdemeanor count of accepting monetary (cash) contributions in excess of $50 in violation of N.C.G.S. § 163-278.14(b). Both defendants were also ordered to pay the costs of court and a $100 fine.” The notice stated that it was notified of the plea arrangements by the Wake County District Attorney’s office in January and that the complaint that gave rise to the investigation is now closed.

In a news release publicizing the closure of the case and the convictions, Hall lamented the size and scope of the penalties. “It’s a pitiful settlement, but at least they admitted to engaging in criminal activity,” said Hall, who had asked for dissolution of the PAC and the disgorgement of tens of thousands of dollars of PAC contributions that benefited Republican politicians.
Hall directed criticism at Wake County District Attorney Lorrin Freeman for the modest nature of the punishment meted out.
“It’s disappointing that the District Attorney took so long to accomplish so little,” Hall said. “The way large amounts of cash moved in and out of SCV-related operations is highly suspicious and likely violated tax and anti-corruption laws in addition to a felony statute against filing false campaign finance reports.”
The original complaint identified $28,500 in contributions to several GOP politicians — including Agriculture Commissioner Steve Troxler and Senate President Pro Tem Phil Berger — that Hall argued were unlawful and should have been redirected to the state Civil Penalty and Forfeiture Fund.
Hall’s statement also quoted a pair of dissident Sons of Confederate Veterans members as being critical of the outcome.
Robert “Smitty” Smith, a SCV member who helped the State Board of Elections document the illegal contributions, said, “The fine is basically nothing – it’s like there’s no consequences for all they [SCV leaders] did.”
“It’s crazy that it took so long and they get away,” said Chadwick Rogers, another SCV member who witnessed the illegal activity by SCV leaders that others labeled “money laundering.” Rogers said the punishment should have included SCV losing its charity status.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/justice-scales-gavel_GettyImages-1024x673.jpeg,,,2025-05-20 13:18:42.636018

(Photo of state Senate Chamber/New Hampshire Bulletin file)The New Hampshire Senate is set to vote Thursday on a bill to require that schools maintain a supply of epinephrine, which is used to treat allergic reactions.
House Bill 677 requires New Hampshire schools to have epinephrine injectors, commonly known by the brand name EpiPen, or nasal epinephrine spray, and it requires that a nurse or at least one “assistive personnel” be on site to administer the epinephrine at the school during school hours. The bill gives nurses and school staff five days to replace the epinephrine after it’s used.
Rep. Mike Drago, the Raymond Republican who sponsored the bill, said there are at least two programs that offer epinephrine to schools for free. Epinephrine manufacturers Viatris and ARS Pharmaceuticals both advertise such programs on their websites. Lawmakers plan to rely on these programs to make this proposal possible.
“In reality, we’re putting EpiPens in every single school at no cost,” Drago, who has a child with a nut allergy, said in an April Senate hearing. “And potentially saving lives.”
Under state law, schools are allowed to maintain a supply of and use epinephrine. This bill, if enacted, would require them to do so.
The House previously approved the legislation in an April voice vote, and it received the unanimous recommendation of the Senate Education Committee earlier this month. The bill is co-sponsored by a group of mostly Republicans but has bipartisan support.
Some lawmakers expressed concerns about creating a mandate without establishing a funding source in the budget and relying on outside programs to provide the epinephrine for free.
Sen. Debra Altschiller, a Stratham Democrat, commended Drago at the April hearing for raising the issue, but said she’s concerned “the state would rely on a program that’s at the discretion of a pharmaceutical company.”
“It exists today,” Altschiller said. “It might not exist tomorrow. And to require a specific product be carried in the school at the expense of the school is where I have significant problems.”
She noted epinephrine is “wildly expensive” and called this an “unfunded mandate.”
Drago said he doubts these programs will ever disappear.
Still, to address these concerns, the Senate Education Committee proposed an amendment that establishes a state fund to help schools pay for epinephrine. Though it doesn’t appropriate any money to that fund, the amendment creates a mechanism for the state to accept gifts from organizations besides the pharmaceutical companies.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/IMG_3610-1024x633.jpg,,,2025-05-20 13:18:42.636018

Andrew Tauber-Herring was determined to prove that he could go to college, despite several learning disabilities. With extraordinary effort and a unique overseas program that aligned with his passion for Japan, he is now on the path to becoming the first in his family to earn a college degree.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Despite facing multiple learni[...]","Andrew Tauber-Herring grew up in a multi-generational home in Congers, New York, with his sister, parents, grandparents, great-grandmother and great-grandfather—a Holocaust survivor who came to America from Poland and taught himself English at the public library. Now, Andrew has also crossed an ocean and immersed himself in a very different culture in pursuit of opportunity. In January, he moved to Japan, where he’s studying business administration and marketing at a Tokyo-based extension of Lakeland University in Wisconsin.“I absolutely love it, from the challenging courses that I have access to, plus the affordability of tuition. It’s been a very interesting experience,” says Andrew.He says he developed an interest in Japan at 8 years old, when his second-grade class studied different cultures in school. “Ever since I first started reading about the culture and the country, Japan is where my heart always wanted to be. That interest just stayed with me.”His strong interest in all things Japanese was a bright spot for Andrew, whose educational experience was influenced by significant challenges from an early age. While it took him years to receive accurate diagnoses, he now knows, at age 30, that he struggles with several disabilities, including autism, ADHD, dyslexia, “and several others I can’t spell,” he says. While his family, especially his mother, always told him he could do whatever he put his mind to, others weren’t quite as supportive when he was going through school. “I was told back in high school that my learning disabilities would make it very difficult for me to go to college. It was hard for me to hear. From an early age, I knew I wanted to go to college. I had many career ideas, but my teachers made me feel nothing would ever come of it. Anytime I would express interest, they told me things like ‘you shouldn’t count on being accepted.’ I wanted to prove them all wrong.”And he has. Having taken preparatory coursework at Community College of Vermont (CCV) and Champlain College, Andrew is set to earn his bachelor’s degree from Lakeland in the summer of 2027. He will be the first in his family to graduate from college. After graduating from high school in 2013, Andrew got a rough start to college, with a California-based art-school program focused on game design. When that program didn’t pan out and he moved back east—settling in central Vermont in 2016—he was advised to restart with a more traditional college program at the Community College of Vermont. Andrew credits one of his CCV professors, Ritalea Sweeny, for getting him interested in the marketing field. After connecting with the program at Lakeland that helped him achieve his first dream—living in Japan—he now hopes completing his college degree will help him achieve his second goal: working in marketing and advertising. Between college programs, Andrew held various retail and brand-ambassador jobs, worked in event and bank security, and did some manufacturing work. “I’ve done a little bit of everything,” he says. “But I decided to finish school because I realized that without a college degree, I would always stay in a low-income job.” He knew finishing college would likely improve his financial situation, but he also faced more than the usual number of challenges for an adult student looking to go back to school. Andrew says his biggest barrier was a fear of not being able to find a good work-life balance, between working part-time to cover expenses, being a full-time student, and being a student with several learning disabilities, which means he needs more time to study and absorb the material. “In terms of my needs, I’m still figuring it all out, to be honest,” he says. “A smaller classroom helps, and I need flexibility when it comes to due dates.” To help cover costs and make that balance easier, Andrew turned to Hireability Vermont (formerly known as Voc Rehab VT) and VSAC’s Educational Opportunity Center, which works with adult students seeking education and training. “It was amazing working with my VSAC counselor, Karen McGovern,” says Andrew. “She’s done everything she can to help me find additional funding for things I couldn’t afford for my classes. She was also a great support on the emotional side. If I ever felt lost or was struggling, she knew just what to say to help me find my motivation. Things would definitely have been different without VSAC.”Andrew also gives a lot of credit to his partner, Linda. “She has always been there for me and has pushed me when things got hard and I felt like giving up. I also appreciate her family being one of my primary supports in Vermont.” While Andrew says he struggles with writing because of his dyslexia, it’s worth noting that he conducted two interviews for this article entirely over email. And like his grandfather before him, he didn’t hesitate to jump into learning the Japanese language—an intimidating prospect for someone without any difficulties in visual or language processing. “I know a few phrases and words, and I’m learning more every day, the more I observe everyday life. It’s definitely different from English, but when you’re around something 24/7, it’s easy to pick things up,” he says.In terms of finding understanding and accommodation for his learning disabilities in Japan, “It’s honestly a mixed bag,” says Andrew. “In some respects, they are very accommodating with what I need, and other times they don’t really understand. It’s been difficult, but not impossible.” In daily life, however, he finds the Japanese culture to be calm, safe, and accessible, which is a great fit. “The way things are set up in their society, they accommodate me without intention.”Andrew hopes he can stay and work in Japan after he finishes his program. “Taking college classes has broadened my mind to the multitude of possibilities out there for me if I have a degree,” says Andrew. “Now that I’ve landed on marketing, though, I don’t think it will change. I hope one day I can work for a Japanese video game company doing marketing. I love it here. I couldn’t be happier.”  The Vermont Student Assistance Corp. was created by the Vermont Legislature in 1965 as a public nonprofit agency.

,New Jersey Monitor,2025-05-20 16:00:32+00:00,New Jersey Monitor,Local government workers’ health plan enters ‘death spiral’,Nikita Biryukov,,,,,https://newjerseymonitor.com/2025/05/20/local-government-workers-health-plan-enters-death-spiral/,Sharp premium increases and waning enrollment have put the local government part of the State Health Benefits Program on a path to the grave.,"Sharp premium increases and waning enrollment have put the local government part of the State Health Benefits Program on a path to the grave. (Dana DiFilippo | New Jersey Monitor)New Jersey’s health benefits plan for local public workers, harried by years of sharp premium increases and a dwindling subscriber pool, has become “structurally unstable” and “financially unsustainable,” the Treasury said in a report released Tuesday.
The purely informational report is the latest in a series of dire warnings, now outright alarms, over the future of the public worker health plan, which has faced an exodus of municipalities amid repeated double-digit premium hikes approved in recent years.
“The plan’s very high actuarial values, a depleted and now insolvent cash management margin reserve … and a static governance structure have created a self-reinforcing loop of premium increases and employer exits — what actuaries commonly refer to as a ‘death spiral,’” the report says.
Health insurance plans function by diluting risk, using healthy subscribers’ premiums to underwrite medical care for sicker members. But as premiums under the local part of the State Health Benefits Program rose, towns and cities with younger, healthier workers fled to private options.
As a result, risk and premiums continued their climb, and municipalities continued their departures. The number of local governments participating in the plan fell from 768 in 2021 to 689 at the end of March.
In January, only 56.2% of local governments were participating in the program, and the municipalities that return to the plan after facing higher premiums under private options could push costs up further as higher risk workers return to the public pool, driving up overall risk and costs.
Rising prescription drug usage — especially around new and trendy weight-loss drugs — plus the growing use of high-cost services and inflation have contributed to the plan’s rising costs, the report said.
The state’s actuary has said premiums for the local government part of the program would need to rise by 19.5% to stabilize its reserve fund, on top of separate hikes to account for increased prescription and medical benefit usage.
A law signed last November to keep local government workers’ plan solvent by lending from state workers’ plan could bring the floor for premium increases up even higher. The local part of the State Health Benefits Program owes state workers’ plan roughly $120 million, and it won’t have the money to repay that debt without a mid-year premium hike. By law, those loans must be repaid within 365 days of being taken.
“There could be a 26.5 percent ‘floor’ to 2026 premium increases … in addition to the ‘regular’ medical and prescription drug trend rates,” says the report, adding increases to rebuild the plan’s reserves could be phased in over multiple years.
Cumulative increases from 2026 through 2029 are expected to “significantly exceed” 60%, according to the report. Those would add to the 59% cumulative increase it saw between 2022 and 2025.
“Without meaningful intervention, current trends in enrollment, utilization, and health care cost inflation will continue to drive unsustainable premium increases,” the report says. “The situation is not one of temporary imbalance — it reflects deep-seated structural challenges that, if unaddressed, will further destabilize the plan.”
The high rates at which the plans cover medical expenses have also contributed to their price. Nearly all, 95%, of local government workers enrolled in the program are on plans with actuarial values of 97%, meaning workers are responsible for paying just 3% of their health care expenses through copays, deductibles, or coinsurance.
The School Employees Health Benefits Plan faces similar distress, the report says.
That program, which offers health benefits to school board employees, has escaped most of the large premium hikes faced that hit local government workers — between 2022 and 2025, their premiums rose by 44% — and saw some temporary relief from 2020 changes that moved most of its enrollees to more cost-effective plans.
But that plan is facing price pressures for the same reasons as the State Health Benefits Program, and the 2020 changes bar the committee tasked with oversight from tweaking benefits or plan rules in response to rising costs until 2028.
“The SEHBP now faces significant financial and actuarial risks and may be on a similar trajectory as SHBP-LG — potentially entering a death spiral in the medium-term or experiencing serious affordability issues for its members,” the report says.
Because state workers cannot leave their public health plan, the state part of the State Health Benefits Program remains stable, but it will still require premium increases to meet rising costs, the report says.
Plan design changes could partly defray rising costs but “even the most aggressive plan design changes will likely not be enough to reverse the systemic unraveling now underway” and broader changes are needed to stabilize the public health benefit programs, the report said.
Those changes could include a lower actuarial values — meaning enrollees would pay a greater share of their medical costs — as well as waiting periods for municipalities to reenroll in the State Health Benefits Program after leaving and more rule-setting authority for the Treasury.
“Failure to reform will lead to ongoing price increases and employer exits, and eventually a complete and disorderly collapse of the plan,” the report says.
Alternatively, the state could unwind the local part of the program and leave local governments to find health coverage through group insurance funds while the plan phases out.
“Phasing out the plan in an orderly, supported, and equitable manner will mitigate further destabilization and align the State’s policy approach with prevailing market conditions and local preferences,” the report says.

The goal is to deter drivers from passing them at pickup and drop-off stops.
New Haven has more than 300 school buses that drive 17,000 kids every day.
Mayor Justin Elicker, who has two young daughters, said he’s seen close calls with drivers and students trying to get on or off the bus.
“People are either not paying attention or they’re just deciding to drive right on through,” Elicker said. “And that is putting our children at risk in the city.”
If the Board of Alders passes the bill, passing the bus could result in a $250 fine.
“Drivers that run through these stop signs will receive a $250 ticket,” Elicker explained. “They will have 30 days to appeal that ticket. The footage will be reviewed by a city representative and another individual to make sure that we are properly levying these fines on people.”
The money collected will go toward roadway safety improvements. Elicker said that as long as the legislation passes, they aim to have the cameras installed by fall.
The proposal was celebrated by city and school officials, as well as by a first student driver and driver trainer.
“A lot of cars or drivers want to try to beat buses, which obviously leaves our kids in dangerous situations,” Richard Johnson said. “So this act is definitely something that we look forward to.”
Connecticut didn’t allow cameras on the outside of school buses until 2024. Bridgeport was one of the first cities to install them. As of February, they had ticketed more than 10,000 drivers.

“Not a single dime has been collected. Let me repeat that, not a single dime has been collected by these folks behind me, the true victims and survivors, nor on behalf of their attorneys. Not a single dime has been offered by the state of Michigan to step up to do the right thing,” attorney Ven Johnson told reporters, arguing the state’s response to residents seeking accountability through the courts had been to “defend, delay, deny.” 
Johnson recounted the past 5 years of legal proceedings, as residents impacted by the flooding seek damages from the Department of Environment Great Lakes and Energy and the Department of Natural Resources, alleging the state knew the dam was not safe for continued operations, but still authorized the dam operator, Boyce Hydro, to raise the water levels within the lake created by the dam.

The state attributes the dam’s failure to “historic levels of rainfall.” More than 11,000 people and 2,500 structures were damaged due to flooding, with the state’s initial estimate for damages coming out to $250 million. 
While a federal judge later found Boyce Hydro responsible for the dam’s failure, ordering the dam’s former owner Lee Mueller to pay $119 million in environmental damage, Johnson argued the state had yet to properly respond to the complaint filed by residents shortly after the dam collapsed. 
He pointed to an order filed by Court of Claims Judge Douglas Shapiro in October 2023, which notes “this case was filed over three years ago and that no Answer has ever been filed and that no discovery has yet occurred.” Shapiro called the state’s repeated requests to reverse a previous order, which partly denied the state’s effort to resolve the case without bringing it to trial, “time-consuming and unsuccessful.” 
While Court of Claims Judge James Robert Redford last week denied another request to resolve the case in favor of the state without going to trial, Johnson predicted the state would appeal the decision, noting that the government retains an automatic right of appeal. Johnson said he would be objecting to that request, as would the attorneys standing beside him at the conference. 
“Sadly, this is a months, plural, long process,” he said.
Johnson repeatedly compared the state’s legal approach to the way it handled legal proceedings in the Flint Water Crisis where the state was ordered to pay $600 million to Flint residents and property owners whose water was contaminated.
“There’s your blueprint for how the state of Michigan deals with infrastructure failure. No one went to jail, no one was prosecuted, and it was the Civil lawyers who did what they did and exactly what we’re doing in this case to try to bring some semblance of justice,” Johnson said. “That took them eight and a half years before the State of Michigan stepped up and began to take responsibility and pay for the damage….But even so, that litigation, in many respects, is ongoing even today.”
While the state pursued several state officials, including Republican former Gov. Rick Snyder for their role and response in the Flint water crisis, the efforts failed to return any convictions after the Michigan Supreme Court ruled in 2022 the charges were invalid. 
The residents pursuing the state for the dam collapse are scheduled to go to trial in January 2026, Johnson said. However, if the case is allowed to proceed, he expects the state will take the case all the way to the Michigan Supreme Court. 
In the meantime, Mike and Lisa Callan, whose home was destroyed by the flooding, said the burden is getting greater and greater each year. 
“We have a couple mortgages we’re still paying on this property. And, you know, now, now we have a water assessment coming. You know, my water assessment is about $48,000 for a piece of property that has absolutely, you know, nothing there,” Mike Callan said. 
Carl Hamman, a member of the Sanford Village Council, warned that residents could lose their homes over the assessment fees the state is requiring to rebuild the Edenville, as well as the Sanford Dam, which was located downstream.
“If they’re living on —and I’m on Social Security — If you’re living only on Social Security, I can’t afford another $5,000 a year tax. Can’t do it. I’ll have to walk away from the place that I’ve been at for 35 years,” Hamman said.
Kevin Carlson, another attorney working on residents’ behalf, said the dam failure was not just a natural disaster but a failure of government and a breach of trust.

“What the state officials knew here, by January of 2020 at the very latest, was that the Edenville Dam did not meet the minimum safety requirements for a dam to continue operating in the state of Michigan…. The people behind me, the people that live downstream from this dam, they didn’t know that,” Carlson said.
“They couldn’t take matters into their own hands and start evacuating early. They count on the state acting behind closed doors to know that when a dam is unsafe for continued operation, there’s one thing you shouldn’t do to it: load up the lake behind it with more water. That’s what the state authorized the dam operator to do.”
Danny Wimmer, a spokesperson for the Michigan Department of Attorney General, which is representing EGLE and the DNR, said the failure of the dam was tragic, but noted it was not a state-owned dam and that survivors of the flood had already sued the dam owner and forced liquidation of their assets. 
“Despite the claims of plaintiffs’ attorney Johnson today, the litigation still pending in the Court of Claims is nothing like the Flint water litigation, and there is no appeal pending in it,” Wimmer said.
“Plaintiffs in this litigation already lost their lawsuit against the county governments because they did not have evidence to back up their allegations.  We expect the same thing will happen in the Court of Claims. The plaintiffs do not have the evidence to support their allegations. Instead, the evidence confirms that the state agencies are not responsible for the dam’s failure,” Wimmer said, before noting the department’s sympathies lie with those affected by the dam failures.

(Kyle Martin/For the North Dakota Monitor)Colleagues of North Dakota Rep. Cindy Schreiber-Beck are remembering her as a stalwart advocate for education, aviation and agricultural issues.
Schreiber-Beck, R-Wahpeton, died Sunday at age 70. She was first elected to the North Dakota Legislature in 2014 and served as vice chair of the House Education Committee during the legislative session that adjourned earlier this month.
Schreiber-Beck’s expertise on K-12 education, higher education, aeronautics and agricultural issues was unparalleled, said her seatmate, Rep. Alisa Mitskog, D-Wahpeton. 
“She truly represented her constituents, set aside partisan politics and she really went to work for the people she represented,” Mitskog said Tuesday.
In a statement, State Superintendent Kirsten Baesler said Schreiber-Beck was a trusted legislative adviser, confidant and K-12 education advocate.
“Rep. Schreiber-Beck was tireless in her work to produce better education policy, and she had the welfare of students and their families foremost in her mind,” Baesler said.
Schreiber-Beck volunteered as executive director for the North Dakota Agricultural Aviation Association for nearly 40 years. She and her late husband, Gerry Beck, operated Tri-State Aviation in Wahpeton.
In March, Schreiber-Beck was inducted into North Dakota’s Aviation Hall of Fame by the North Dakota Aeronautics Commission for her significant contributions. She served for 25 years on the North Dakota Aeronautics Commission and was a member of a governor’s task force that established North Dakota’s Unmanned Aerial Systems test site.
In a statement, Gov. Kelly Armstong said she embodied the truest essence of public service, volunteerism and giving back to the community.
“Cindy Schreiber-Beck served the citizens of North Dakota with a quiet strength and determination that touched so many facets of life, from agriculture and aviation to education and community development, and it was an honor to call her a friend,” Armstrong said.
Armstrong directed all U.S. and North Dakota flags to be flown at half-staff from dawn to dusk on the day of Schreiber-Beck’s interment. 
Funeral services for Schreiber-Beck will be held at 4 p.m. May 28 at the Fargo Air Museum.
The District 25 Republican Party executive committee will appoint a successor to complete her term, which runs through 2026.
Mitskog said she’ll remember fondly that Schreiber-Beck had a bit of a sweet tooth.
“I’ll never walk past a bowl of candy without thinking of her. She loved candy … and I think that kind of helped drive her energy,” she said.

Found in people and animals worldwide, they are linked to cancer and other health effects.","In summary
California has no health standards for these chemicals in fish, so activists are urging action. Found in people and animals worldwide, they are linked to cancer and other health effects.



Contaminants known as “forever chemicals” have been discovered in San Francisco Bay fish at levels that could pose a health threat to people who eat fish caught there, according to new research published today.
Linked to an array of health conditions such as cancers, heart disease and pregnancy disorders, per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances resist breaking down in the environment. Used by industries to make waterproof coatings, firefighting foams, food packaging and more, these chemicals have contaminated people and animals everywhere around the globe, including newborns.
Researchers from the San Francisco Estuary Institute found the chemicals in striped bass, largemouth bass, leopard shark, white croaker, white sturgeon and other fish collected between 2009 and 2019 throughout San Francisco Bay. 
Recreational and subsistence anglers catch striped bass and the other fish from boats, shores or piers, but they are not sold commercially. Many Asian immigrants, other people of color and low-income people fish in the bay to feed their families.
California has set health advisories for other contaminants in fish, but not for these “forever chemicals.” Based on Massachusetts’ advisory — the most stringent in the country — 83% of the fish tested are considered unsafe to eat daily, and a third of the fish would not be safe to eat even in amounts of half a pound a week, the researchers said.
The chemicals seep into soil and wash into waterways that flow into the bay from landfills, airports, industrial sites, military bases and sewage treatment plants. 
 “All along the shoreline of San Francisco Bay, especially along the Carquinez, we see how many polluting industries are there. Yet people still fish there and, because of finances, many people eat that fish,” said LaDonna Williams, a program director with the Bay Area-based environmental justice nonprofit All Positives Possible. “Do you just close your eyes and pray over your food? … That’s a heck of a decision to have to make.”
The findings, published in the scientific journal ES&T Water, build upon earlier reports that “forever chemicals” are among the cocktail of contaminants in San Francisco Bay.
The chemicals are likely contaminating ocean fish throughout California, but no statewide studies have been conducted. 
“We know already that (these chemicals) are impacting all of us,” Miguel Méndez, an environmental scientist who was a co-author of the study, said in a press release. “But we also know that there’s a lot of communities in the Bay that fish, and a lot of these communities tend to be underrepresented and more marginalized in the Bay.” 
State officials have already posted signs at San Francisco Bay piers to warn people to limit or avoid consumption of certain fish because of other contaminants, including mercury, a potent neurotoxin that is a legacy of the Gold Rush.
Rebecca Sutton, managing senior scientist at the San Francisco Estuary Institute and an author of the study, said those warnings are likely protective for “forever chemicals,” as well.

But fishing and environmental groups say California needs to set guidelines for what levels of the chemicals are unsafe, which will determine advice for how much people may eat.
Wesley Smith, senior toxicologist with California’s Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment, told CalMatters that the agency is developing guidance for perfluorooctane sulfonic acid, known as PFOS, although there is no timeline yet.
About 91% of the San Francisco Bay fish samples tested with the most advanced methods contained PFOS, used in some upholstery, carpets, cookware and firefighting foams beginning in the 1940s. It was phased out in the United States in the early 2000s because of potential health effects.
Smith said the other states that took early action may have been concerned about high levels found in some areas. “We’re in a better position to move forward” in California, he said, because of the work by other states and the new analysis released today.
Smith advised people to follow the warning signs and eat smaller and younger fish to reduce their exposure.
Levels of the chemicals in San Francisco Bay fish were similar to those found in marine fish in some other harbors nationwide, but generally lower than freshwater fish caught in rivers, streams and lakes. The researchers tested the fish for 40 of the chemicals — a tiny fraction of this vast class — and found 20 in fish collected in 2009, 2014 and 2019. 
Chris Shutes, executive director of the California Sportfishing Protection Alliance, said in addition to setting advisories for these contaminants, state officials should prevent them from getting into the water in the first place. 
A bill in the Legislature authored by state Sen. Ben Allen, a Democrat from El Segundo, would phase out the sale of certain products that have some forever chemicals intentionally added, such as ski wax, dental floss, products for children, cookware and food packaging. California has previously banned it in certain fabrics, cosmetics and food packaging. 
“These results also show how critical it is to phase out non-essential uses” and also “improve monitoring and limit how much” gets into waterways, Tasha Stoiber, a senior scientist at the Environmental Working Group who has investigated the chemicals in freshwater fish, said in an email.
Fish caught in the southern reaches of the bay, from Redwood City to Milpitas and San Jose, were especially contaminated — with more than 80% exceeding Massachusetts’ threshold for one meal per week, compared to 8% in other parts of the bay. 
Tides don’t thoroughly flush out the runoff and treated sewage that carry the chemicals into the southern portion of the bay, home to one of the largest wastewater treatment facilities in the West. 
As old “forever chemicals” are phased out, new ones are still leaching into the environment. The research team found one chemical that has never before been documented in marine fish. 
No one knows how many people eat fish caught in the bay. Though nearly a quarter million anglers from Bay Area counties purchased licenses to fish in California in 2024, no one had tallied all people who fish from shorelines, piers, jetties or breakwaters — and there are no official counts of people whose families would go hungry if they didn’t. 
One 25-year-old survey from the San Francisco Estuary Institute reported that Asian men make up a higher proportion of Bay Area anglers compared to the region’s demographics. Another study, farther upstream, reported Southeast Asians ate the most fish caught in the Delta, followed by African American and Hispanic anglers, who were exposed to much higher levels of mercury than recommended.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/062124-Pier-7-Fishing-LE-CM-16.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-05-20 11:05:08.790804

(Getty Images)Minnesota authorities would no longer be able to charge people with major drug crimes solely on the basis of the dirty water in their bongs — thanks to a provision in the 192-page judiciary and public safety bill that was sent to Gov. Tim Walz over the weekend. He’s expected to sign it. 
Under current law, quantities of bong water greater than four ounces can be treated like the pure, uncut version of whatever substance the bong was used to smoke. That can lead to massive criminal penalties: 4 ounces of bong water used to consume methamphetamine, for instance, can trigger a first-degree felony charge carrying up to 30 years in prison and a $1 million fine.
The new language removes that provision and specifies that for charging purposes, a drug mixture “does not include the fluid used in a water pipe or any amount of a controlled substance that is dissolved in the pipe’s fluid.” The change would apply retroactively to August 2023, bringing it in line with a broader drug paraphernalia decriminalization bill that went into effect at that time.
In practice, prosecutors virtually never charge bong water offenses because most people intuitively understand that 8 ounces of dirty bong water is not the same thing as 8 ounces of pure methamphetamine. 
“Counting dirty bong water as pure drugs is like counting a beer bottle full of backwash and cigarette butts as 80-proof whiskey,” as one attorney colorfully characterized it to the Reformer earlier this year.
But it does happen: The issue drew national attention last year after a northwest Minnesota prosecutor levied first-degree drug charges against a Fargo woman, Jessica Beske, on account of the water allegedly found in her bong.
Because of the retroactive provision, that case would be thrown out if Walz signs the bill.
“The ACLU-MN is glad to see the legislature fixed this loophole that allowed rogue prosecutors to put people suffering from addiction in prison for smoking drugs out of a bong,” said Alicia Granse of the American Civil Liberties Union, which is representing Beske in court. “Ms. Beske and others like her can no longer be subjected to this cruel and unusual treatment.”
Minnesota became the butt of national jokes after the state supreme court ruled in 2009 that bong water could be legally considered a drug. The justices relied, in part, on the testimony of a Minnesota State Patrol officer who claimed that drug users keep bong water “for future use… either drinking it or shooting it in the veins.” 
Legislators attempted to decriminalize small amounts of bong water the following year, but then-Gov. Tim Pawlenty vetoed it in order to project a “tough-on-crime” image in advance of a planned presidential run.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-1199909224-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-05-20 11:05:08.790804

Kasper Juul Eriksen, now 32, left his home in Aalborg, Denmark, as a teenager in 2009 and spent a year in the U.S. as a high school exchange student in Starkville, Mississippi.
He and a local teenager, Savannah Hobart, fell in love. After he returned to Denmark’s fourth-largest city, he and Savannah maintained their relationship for four years, across an ocean and seven time zones.
Kasper immigrated to the U.S. in 2013 and got work as a welder – a job he has held steadily since then. He and Savannah married in 2014 and settled outside Starkville in the tiny town of Sturgis, soon starting a family.
For years, Kasper went through the process of trying to become a U.S. citizen, and Savannah Eriksen – now homeschooling their children and pregnant with their fifth baby, due in August – said her husband’s move toward citizenship appeared to be on track. He received notice last September that his naturalization application was being reviewed, and records from the U.S. government raised no questions about his paperwork, Savannah said.
Kasper and Savannah Eriksen went to Memphis, Tennessee, on April 15 so he could be interviewed about naturalization, and she said they were met by ICE agents.
“Kasper was detained for a paperwork miscommunication from 2015, and I was sent home with no explanation and no idea where my husband had been transported,” Savannah Eriksen said in a statement she released late Monday to Mississippi Today.
Kasper is among an unknown number of immigrants who have been detained since President Donald Trump began his second term in January. Some of the detainees had entered the U.S. without authorization, while others entered with temporary visas or, like Kasper Eriksen, were in the process of becoming naturalized citizens.
Savannah said she and her husband were told in April that his paperwork problem was with an application for removal of conditions on his residency – a form used by an immigrant married to a U.S. citizen.
After Kasper was taken into custody in Memphis, Savannah made the three-hour drive back to Sturgis by herself and “to say I couldn’t control my emotions would be an understatement,” she said.
“The next 24 hours would, without a doubt, (be) the most frightening and stressful I have ever experienced, as I pined for my husband and some kind of communication to confirm his safety and whereabouts,” Savannah said.
She said that before the April appointment, her husband had never been told about any paperwork miscommunication, either through online messages or during interviews in the naturalization process.
She later learned that Kasper was being detained at the LaSalle Detention Center in Jena, Louisiana.
Kasper’s attorneys have filed petitions to seek his release, and they met with him May 15 to review those. A judge will decide whether he will be let out, Savannah said he does not have a court date.
“Kasper is a fully integrated, productive member of society,” Savannah said. She said he has “an impeccable work ethic,” holds a driver’s license and has paid taxes since being employed in the U.S.
“While Kasper embodies all the positive qualities of a hard-working man in pursuit of the American Dream, he never forgets his family and friends,” she said. “He spends time with us and takes the time to give each of his children the attention and fatherly love they deserve.”
She said friends and family in Mississippi and Denmark are supporting the family with “prayers, financial assistance and positive, uplifting attitudes.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/20074535/att.ltlp0zjjglX27g8FfO488DMt-TX33IfElNT04XpXvmQ.jpg,,,2025-05-20 11:05:08.790804

DemasThe U.S. Supreme Court has declined to hear a lawsuit filed by nearly a dozen Michigan Republican lawmakers seeking to roll back voting rights measures passed by voters in 2018 and 2022.
The suit, filed in 2023 in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Michigan, argued that because the Elections Clause of the U.S. Constitution, found in Article I, Section 4, provides for state legislatures to regulate the times, places, and manner of holding federal elections, measures passed by citizen-led petition initiatives are unconstitutional as they infringed on the state Legislature’s role within state election law.
The U.S. Supreme Court’s refusal to take the case was the third, and now final, rejection after the lawsuit was initially dismissed by U.S. District Court Judge Jane Beckering, an appointee of former President Joe Biden, in April 2024 for a lack of standing, a decision which was then affirmed by the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in December 2024.
The lawsuit was sponsored by Michigan Fair Elections and the Great Lakes Justice Center and named Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson and Michigan Director of Elections Jonathan Brater as defendants.

Benson hailed the decision not to take up the case as a “victory for the people of Michigan,” saying the U.S. Supreme Court had correctly upheld the right of Michigan voters to amend the state constitution.
 “In recent years, voters in Michigan have overwhelmingly supported ballot initiatives to create a citizen-led independent redistricting process, to guarantee at least nine days of early voting for every statewide election, and to make voting more accessible for every eligible citizen. Today’s action ensures that the will of the voters will stand on these and other issues important to the people of our state,” Benson said.
Proposal 3 of 2018 and Proposal 2 of 2022 both passed with at least 60% of the vote and guaranteed the rights to same-day voter registration, nine days of early voting, absentee voting, among other rights. After voters approved the constitutional amendments, the Legislature passed legislation implementing the measures.
The suit sought not only to halt the changes brought on by the voter-passed initiatives, but also prohibit the future use altogether of citizen-led petition initiatives when they pertain to state election law.
“We also have procedures in place at the state level to amend election law,” state Sen. Jonathan Lindsey (R-Coldwater), one of the 11 lawmakers who filed the suit, said at the time. “However, these processes were violated in 2018 and 2022 when an alternative amendment process was used without regard to federal constitutional requirements. This lawsuit challenges recent attempts to subvert our constitutional process and will protect against such actions in the future.”
The legal argument behind the lawsuit, known as the independent state legislature theory, was mostly rejected by the U.S. Supreme Court in June 2023 when it ruled in Moore v Harper. 
In that case’s 6-3 majority opinion, Chief Justice John Roberts wrote that there were limits to state legislative power in such matters, effectively repudiating the claim that only state legislatures had the power to make election rules, thus providing state and federal courts, and by extension, state constitutions, a role in that process.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/IMG_8050-2-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-05-20 11:05:08.790804

Hillel at the University of Delaware has launched a $12 million capital campaign to build a new, state-of-the-art Jewish student center, unveiling the ambitious project at a campus event on Sunday that drew students, alumni, university leaders, and community members.
The “Building the Jewish Future” campaign aims to fund a modern facility that will serve as the cornerstone of Jewish life on campus.

The project has already raised $8 million, bolstered by three lead gifts exceeding $1 million from Stuart and Suzanne Grant, the Kristol Family, and the Book Family. A $500,000 challenge match has also been announced to help maintain fundraising momentum.
“This new facility represents a critical investment in Jewish student life at the University of Delaware,” said Donna Schwartz, Executive Director of Hillel at UD. “As engagement in Hillel’s programs continues to grow, we need a center that can accommodate diverse activities, foster meaningful connections, and serve as a beacon of Jewish life on campus. Together, we’re ensuring a vibrant Jewish future at UD.”
Hillel International President and CEO Adam Lehman headlined the kickoff event, which was held at the Trabant University Center. He moderated a panel of current Jewish students who reflected on their campus experiences, particularly in the months following the events of October 7, 2023.
“We know from our work at the University of Delaware and campuses across the country just how important it is for Jewish students to have dedicated, welcoming spaces where they can fully express their identities, engage in Jewish life, and find community,” Lehman said. “This new facility will ensure that Jewish Blue Hens have an amazing place to call home for decades to come.”
The proposed building will replace the existing Kristol Center for Jewish Life and include a large event hall with capacity for 250 people, smaller study and meeting rooms, a rooftop lounge, and a Beit Midrash – a traditional Jewish learning space.
Construction is expected to begin in October 2025, with completion anticipated by the end of 2026.

Ohio state Rep. Tex Fischer, R-Boardman, introduced a bill last week that would require Ohio State football games to kick off at 3:30 p.m. or later if the Buckeyes are playing a top-10 ranked team in the Associated Press poll.
“A few weeks ago, I said it would be a crime for FOX to put Ohio State vs Texas at noon,” Fischer said in a post on X, formerly known as Twitter. “Promises made, promises kept!”

The Ohio State Buckeyes kick off their season against the Texas Longhorns in Columbus on Aug. 30. The time of the game has not been released, but it will air on Fox and is expected to be a noon game.

The game will be a rematch of the Cotton Bowl from earlier this year, which the Buckeyes won 28-14 — eventually going on to win the National Championship by defeating the Notre Dame Fighting Irish.
The Ohio Attorney General would slap a $10 million fine against either the host team’s athletic conference or the television network broadcasting if a game was played starting at noon — “whichever party scheduled the earlier start time,” according to the bill.
Ohio State has played a lot of noon games in recent years on Fox Big Noon Kickoff. The Buckeyes played five Big Noon Kickoff games during their last season. Former Ohio State football coach Urban Meyer joined the Fox Big Noon Kickoff in 2019 for two seasons and returned in 2022 after coaching the Jacksonville Jaguars for a year.
The Ohio State-Michigan game, which is traditionally played at noon, would be an exception, according to the bill.
Ohio Sen. Bill DeMora, D-Columbus, is also trying to use legislation to change how Buckeye fans can watch the games. Ohio Senate Bill 94 would ban state universities from entering into or renewing contracts to broadcast a game exclusively on a streaming service.
Ohio State has exclusively streamed some of their football games in recent years on the streaming service Peacock.

In April, the Wells Police Department became the first local agency in Maine to contract with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement under what’s called the 287(g) program, which has divided the community. 
After the 287(g) program was discontinued in 2012 due to the discovery of discriminatory practices such as racial profiling, President Donald Trump revived it to bolster ICE’s capacity by deputizing local police officers to detain immigrants, an authority otherwise generally reserved to federal authorities. 
Wells community divided over ICE agreement with local police

Participation is growing across the country. As of Monday, ICE had signed 588 agreements with agencies in 40 states. Six states have laws or policies that prohibit participation, according to ICE.
Wells remains the only local agency in the program in Maine. Monmouth Winthrop Police Department, a combination of departments that serve central Maine communities, applied for the program but withdrew its application after community pushback.
While immigration is a federal matter by law, work on the local level is key. An estimated 70% of ICE arrests nationwide over the past decade have been handoffs from state or local authorities. 
The effect of both bills, LD 1259 and  LD 1971, would be to prohibit state and local law enforcement agencies from carrying out the work of federal immigration authorities.
LD 1259 would do so by explicitly prohibiting contracts with such authorities, while LD 1971 would place restrictions on enforcement activities absent such formal agreements, which is the case for the majority of police departments in Maine that currently have local discretion regarding when to involve federal officials.

A fine point was placed on that subjectivity when Sen. Rachel Talbot Ross (D-Cumberland) questioned Kennebec County Sheriff Ken Mason, who testified against both bills on behalf of the Maine Sheriffs Association’s Legislative Policy Committee, about general police protocols for when to involve federal agents, in light of a routine traffic stop in Waldo County leading to two immigration detentions. 
“At what point in that dichotomy of events is the decision made to contact Border Patrol and why?” Talbot Ross asked.
Mason responded, “I have to rely on my deputies and the supervisors that are working the road that day to make a judgment call on if they believe they need to call somebody.” 
Proposals 
The text of LD 1259 is succinct. Sponsored by Rep. Ambureen Rana (D-Bangor), the legislation would prohibit state or local law enforcement agencies or officers from entering into contracts with federal immigration enforcement authorities. 
LD 1971, sponsored by Rep. Deqa Dhalac (D-South Portland), would restrict the scope of immigration-related work of individual law enforcement officers and state employees regardless of federal contracts. 
Specifically, LD 1971 would prohibit state and local law enforcement agencies from “stopping, investigating, interrogating, arresting or detaining” a person for immigration enforcement purposes. This would include in response to a hold request, immigration detainer or administrative warrant issued by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. 
It would also prevent law enforcement from holding someone solely for immigration enforcement purposes for longer than 48 hours and establish clear protocols during custody, including requiring law enforcement to inform incarcerated people of their rights before an interview by an immigration authority. 
The bill specifies that it would not prohibit a law enforcement agency from arresting, detaining or performing other law enforcement duties due to reasons not solely based on the person’s immigration status. 










Home rule is wonderful until it comes to our constitutional rights, which our federal authorities are violating right now.


– Rep. Ambureen Rana


Other than law enforcement, LD 1971 would prohibit state employees from inquiring into immigration status unless the inquiry is required by law or necessary to provide the service sought by the resident.
Proponents say that allowing local police to carry out federal immigration enforcement would erode public trust and safety.
Lisa Parisio, policy director at the Immigrant Legal Advocacy Project, Maine’s only state-wide immigration legal services organization, said ILAP’s clients have already reported that they’ve decided to not call the police when they wanted to out of fear for their own safety and that they are scared to continue serving as a witness in court. 
Some of their clients have also reported that they’re not pursuing higher education out of fear of immigration enforcement, which Parisio described as a loss to Maine’s future economy. 
Many who testified focused on cost. Proponents said the bills would protect local tax dollars from being strained to carry out federal responsibilities.
Under 287(g) agreements, ICE is responsible for the cost of training and information technology infrastructure, however the local law enforcement agency bears all other costs, including personnel expenses such as salary and overtime, benefits and lawsuits, according to the general memorandum of understanding. 
Rep. Elizabeth Caruso (R-Caratunk) said she appreciated this local control argument but asked Rana, in that spirit, why not leave the decision of whether to contract with federal immigration authorities up to local communities? 
“I believe that we shouldn’t be tying the hands of our local law enforcement by allowing the federal government to pressure them into these agreements,” Rana responded. “Home rule is wonderful until it comes to our constitutional rights, which our federal authorities are violating right now.”
Many proponents also highlighted this latter point, that they do not want local police to be implicated with a federal agency that has been accused of disregarding due process.
Immigration detention increase reveals expanded federal operations in Maine

Auburn Police Chief Jason Moen, who testified against both bills on behalf of the Maine Chiefs of Police Association, said he reviewed information about the 287(g) program and decided against his department participating. However, he does not think the blanket ban on such agreements in Rana’s bill is the right approach, nor the restrictions on cooperating with federal authorities for immigration matters in the other bill.
“It disrupts long standing partnerships among local, state and federal agencies and will prevent local law enforcement from exercising discretion in critical situations,” Moen said.  
Moen and Mason from the Maine Sheriffs Association were the only two people to testify against the bills on Monday. Other groups submitted testimony in opposition, including the Maine County Commissioners Association to LD 1259. 
The association’s legislative policy committee co-chairs, Stephen Gordon and Jean-Marie Caterina, wrote that the legislation could put at risk federal funding that county jails receive to detain people accused of violating federal law.
“These funds help defray county jail operating costs, which is good for local property taxpayers who are asked to fund the great bulk of the cost of operating county jails,” they wrote.  
As Maine has seen an uptick in immigration detentions, some immigrants rights advocates have raised concern about the financial incentives prisons and jails have to assist with the Trump administration’s goal of expanding space for immigration detention. 
The Democratic proposals come after Republicans presented a conflicting bill last month that would prevent local agencies from adopting any policies that restrict them from assisting in the enforcement of federal immigration law. 
None of these bills have received committee votes yet and there is only a month left until lawmakers are expected to conclude their work for the first year of Maine’s two-year Legislative session. Rana told Maine Morning Star that the intention is for the Legislature to make its decisions on the topic this year.

This image is from the 2025 law enforcement memorial ceremony at the Capitol. (Tim Carpenter/Kansas Reflector) TOPEKA — The Kansas Prisoner Review Board responded to a backlash of criticism by rescinding a decision to authorize parole for a Winfield Correctional Facility inmate sentenced to life in prison in the shooting death of a Kansas Highway Patrol trooper.
The Kansas Department of Corrections issued a statement confirming the state review board, which had approved release of Jimmie Nelms in March, met May 16 and voted to reverse an order providing for Nelms’ conditional release.
Corrections spokesperson David Thompson said the board “rescinded its previous decision to grant parole and decided to deny him release at this time.”
In May 1978, Nelms shot KHP Trooper Conroy O’Brien, 26, during a traffic stop on the Kansas Turnpike near Matfield Green. Nelms was captured after a shootout with another KHP trooper.
Nelms, 78, was convicted of premeditated felony murder and sentenced to two life terms in prison, but became eligible for parole in 1993. He appeared before the state’s parole board nine times, Thompson said.
The original decision by review board members Carolyn Perez, Jeannie Wark and Mark Keating was sharply criticized by KHP Col. Erik Smith, Attorney General Kris Kobach and Kansas State Troopers Association president Sage Hill.
Smith, who said KHP consistently opposed Nelms’ release, said the state’s legal framework allowing parole of someone sentenced to life behind bars was flawed. He said there was “no conceivable world in which the release of a convicted cop killer – an executioner – is acceptable.”
Hill said the original decision to parole Nelms was “disgraceful and disgusting,” and review board members should feel “profound shame” for deciding Nelms ought to be freed.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Kansas-law-enforcement-memorial-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-05-20 11:05:08.790804

With the help of a neighbor, the Devas were able to get out of their house Saturday night with some valuables and are staying with friends while their dog, Marcel, stays with a different neighbor up the road. They will be unable to move back into their home for nine months to a year.“We’re a little bit in shock, but just trying to kind of take it an hour at a time,” Deva said Monday.The Deva family is among those recovering from a weekend storm that caused damage to buildings and roads and downed numerous trees.In the storm’s aftermath, Hartford’s fire marshal conducted nearly 30 safety inspections on homes in town, Town Manager John Haverstock said Monday.More than 1.5 inches of rain fell at the nearest National Weather Service reporting site in Quechee during the Saturday storm. The microburst event came after the NWS had issued a severe thunderstorm warning, which predicted gusty winds, large hail and severe flooding, NWS meteorologist Marvin Boyd said Monday.Flooding and downed power lines caused by the rain, hail and wind closed several roads, especially in White River Junction, Quechee and Lebanon.

The flooding was a result of the “volume of water and debris” coming into the village from Route 5 and Fairview Terrace being “too great for the stormwater system to handle.”Seven roads in Hartford were closed on Saturday, according to a social media post from the Hartford Emergency Communications Center. As of Monday morning only Pomfret Road remained closed for Green Mountain Power to do line work, Haverstock said.“We’re not currently aware of any disastrous impact on infrastructure that would require emergency repairs or unusual cleanup costs for the municipality,” Haverstock said.In downtown White River Junction, the volume of rain caused water to pour into cocktail bar Wolf Tree, though owner Max Overstrom-Coleman said the impact on the business “wasn’t all that serious.”At about 6:20 p.m., an employee texted Overstrom-Coleman “there’s so much water flowing in from the ceiling it’s raining inside the bar.”Despite the deluge, “it was a couple hours of hairiness and cleaning up and then we resumed Saturday night service,” by 8:30 p.m. Overstrom-Coleman said. The most damage was to paperwork stored in the basement. Customers even remained in the bar through the crisis and kept “really great” spirits, he said.In Lebanon, Fire Chief Jim Wheatley said the department managed an unusually high 20 storm-related calls in three hours.A crew from the New Hampshire Department of Transportation prepares to repair damage on the side of Route 10 in West Lebanon, N.H., on Monday, May 19, 2025.

There was no severe damage to streets or infrastructure that will require long-term repairs.The storm also disabled the municipal fire alarm monitoring system in the city’s downtown. A notice issued through the LebAlert notification system asked that residents in the downtown not assume emergency services have been notified when a fire alarm sounds. This system was down until about noon Monday, Wheatley said. During that time there were no emergencies in the area that would have triggered the system.Saturday evening there were nearly 1,100 people without power in Woodstock and 700 in Hartford, with outages also reported in Bridgewater, Hartland, Strafford, West Windsor and Weathersfield, according to Green Mountain Power.

Glenn Youngkin speaks with members of the media in Virginia's Capitol on Jan. 13, 2025.  (Photo by Charlotte Rene Woods /Virginia Mercury)Gov. Glenn Youngkin directed state leaders to develop resources to track incidents of antisemitism and anti-religious bigotry at Virginia’s schools through an executive order announced Monday evening. 
Executive Order 48 expands on his administration’s efforts and work by the legislature to combat prejudice against Jewish students at all levels of Virginia’s education system. 
According to the executive order, surveys conducted by the Combat Antisemitism Movement (CAM), a commission established by the governor in 2022, found 554 recorded antisemitism incidents in Virginia over the past year, with most of them occurring in Virginia’s schools.
“No one should be unsafe in the classroom or on campus or feel targeted because of their religion or heritage. This executive order reaffirms and strengthens the commonwealth’s commitment to safe educational environments free from discrimination and continues our actions against antisemitism and anti-religious bigotry in public schools and institutions of higher education,” Youngkin said in a statement. “On day one, I signed Executive Order 8 establishing the Commission to Combat Antisemitism. We have made tremendous strides implementing their recommendations, but our work is far from done.” 
Under the executive order, the governor directed the Secretary of Education, the Virginia Department of Education (VDOE), and the State Council of Higher Education of Virginia (SCHEV) to develop resources that will help local school divisions, colleges and universities prevent, track, report and follow up on incidents of antisemitism and anti-religious bigotry. 
The governor also directed the Secretary of Education and the Secretary of Public Safety & Homeland Security to establish a working group to design a comprehensive reporting and tracking mechanism for alleged incidents targeting Jewish students. The working group — which will include representatives from VDOE, SCHEV, the Department of Criminal Justice Services and stakeholders from the Jewish community, among others —  must provide recommendations for executive, legislative, and budgetary actions to the governor and General Assembly by Sept. 1. 
Between April 2024 and April 2025, CAM found the number of harassment cases increased from 50 to 158 and vandalism from 19 to 62, Youngkin’s order stated. Three assaults were also identified in April of this year, while none were reported in 2024. 
The order also states that these trends have placed Virginia 11th in the nation for the number of reported antisemitic incidents, most of which occurred in Virginia’s public schools and universities.
Anti-war protests roiled Virginia college campuses  after Hamas, a militant group, unexpectedly attacked Israel near the Gaza Strip on October 7, 2023, killing 1,200 people and taking over 250 hostages. Israel struck back with a full-scale war campaign that has left over 52,000 Palestinians dead to date.
Both Hamas and Israel began exchanging hostages and prisoners between January and March and the groups are still negotiating a ceasefire agreement. In the meantime, federal lawmakers, including Virginia U.S. Sens. Tim Kaine and Mark Warner, are urging President Donald Trump’s administration to act on delivering food and emergency aid to civilians.
With Gaza facing starvation, Virginia Sens. Warner and Kaine press for U.S. action

The violence and hostages taken led to a string of campus protests, encampments, and arrests at Virginia’s colleges and universities in the months to follow at the University of Mary Washington, Virginia Commonwealth University, Virginia Tech, and the University of Virginia.
In total, more than 125 students from five Virginia institutions of higher learning were arrested at on-campus demonstrations against the Israel-Hamas War in 2023.
Virginia lawmakers have sought answers in hopes of determining if the demonstrations and universities’ responses to them warrant potential policy changes. Despite the committees being formed a year ago, no action has been taken.
In March, the U.S. Department of Education warned 60 higher education institutions, including George Mason University and the University of Virginia, that they could lose federal funding, after the federal agency claimed the institutions have not kept Jewish students safe based on a backlog of complaints.
After George Mason responded to the December 2023 complaint, the institution said the Office of Civil Rights within the Department of Education has requested no further information after providing the office with an update of its efforts to combat harassment and discrimination.

Studies show that extreme precipitation and flooding are increasing in the Northeast and that coastlines are becoming more vulnerable due to changing frequency and intensity of storms and severe rain.
The post Flooding in Massachusetts drains money, energy, and resources appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.","FOR OVER 50 years Lenny Linquata has owned a stretch of harbor and land on the waterfront where he runs the Gloucester House restaurant, the 7 Seas Whale Watch, and a charter boat company. He inherited it from his family, which, he said, has been living in the area for over 100 years.  One to three times a year, the parking lot that sits in between the businesses floods. The businesses used to as well, but over the past 20 years, Linquata has done several renovations to raise the elevation of his businesses.  “We do it because of need and because of anticipation,” he said. “Obviously we can see the water level rise.” Linquata, like many other waterfront businesses and homeowners, has been dealing with damaging coastal storms that result in property loss and flooding.   The state has identified the entire coastline as an “at risk” area for coastal flooding and storm surges. And, about a fifth of residential land in Massachusetts is in a Federal Emergency Management Agency designated flood plain.  As extreme precipitation increases in the Northeast, flooding both along the coast and inland is threatening the safety of residents across the states and becoming more costly. In July 2023, Vermont experienced near-record flash and river flooding that resulted in two deaths and almost $100 million in damage. In Massachusetts, severe flooding caused damage in Worcester and Bristol counties, which received more than $7 million from FEMA. According to the state’s 2023 ResilientMass Plan, Massachusetts experiences a substantial flood event once every three years.  Flooding is expensive for both individuals and the government– as critical infrastructure including schools, hospitals, highways, and utilities find themselves increasingly located in flood plains. On average, FEMA has spent $46 billion a year on flood damage over the last decade. Massachusetts estimates the cost of annual flood damage will increase to $9.3 million by 2030.  The threat of flooding has put Linquata and his businesses in a unique situation. He needs to have his buildings, such as the one from which he runs his harborside restaurant, to be high enough to avoid flooding, but also needs to have some of them, like his charter boat and whale watching businesses, to be low enough to the water for accessibility.  “Our facilities have to be mostly hanging over the water, and they have to be workable enough that they can’t be built so high out of the water,” he said. “We attempt to keep raising them out of the flood plain.” Thus far this plan has worked for him. When he knows bad weather is coming, he doesn’t leave anything that could damage his facilities on the ground level.  But as flooding worsens, help from the federal government is waning. The Trump administration announced on April 4 that it was ending the Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities program – pulling back approximately $882 billion in funding meant to help municipalities prepare for extreme weather events and other effects of climate change. The administration announced in late April that it was cutting 20 percent from FEMA’s workforce. At the same time, the agency is removing climate-related tools, like ones that predicts coastal erosion, from its website.  One Massachusetts lawmaker is trying to create a program through which the state would buy properties at risk of flood damage or allocate funds to help property owners secure their homes to help reduce monetary loss. Sen. Bruce Tarr, a Republican from Gloucester, proposed a special commission to consider the creation of a loan program for properties prone to flooding. It would allow Massachusetts to create its own state buyout program, similar to the FEMA managed retreat program on the national level. “This bill would provide an important means of access to the resources that homeowners would need to be able to be proactive, either by elevating the home [or] using other methods that make it more resilient,” Tarr said. The legislation would also allow the state to purchase property that can’t be made resilient, he added.  Tarr said this bill aims not only to fill the gaps left by FEMA’s program but to take pressure off the municipal tax base.  Tarr has filed this bill in every legislative term since 2019. He believes it’s not moving out of committee because “there isn’t the same sense of urgency with every legislator.” “I don’t think we’ve come to the full realization of how much of a threat this situation is,” he said. “That is not to say that they are unsympathetic. I very much believe there’s an interest in trying to respond, but I don’t think there’s been a feeling or urgency, and maybe a feeling that these threats are far enough in the future that we don’t need to yet develop this type of a plan.” “We need to shift the model that we currently have,” he added. Last year, Gov. Maura Healey announced $5.2 million in state grants to support coastal communities dealing with the impacts of climate change. The Office of Coastal Zone Management is funding 16 projects to facilitate shoreline management, erosion control, and infrastructure resilience. Some communities on the coast are creating their own solution to flooding programs.  In August 2024, Boston launched the Office of Climate Resilience to address climate change’s effect on the city and its residents. Chris Osgood, the office’s director, said that the city has a plan that includes training residents on how to deal with rising water. “We are a city one-sixth of which is built on landfill and or filled tidelands and as a result of as a result of that, there are a number of low-lying areas along the coastal front, and so if left undressed, that means that the sea level rise and storm surge that we’re expecting would have a significant impact, not just on waterfront properties, but on significant sections of our city,” Osgood said.  The strategy also includes improving the city’s messaging system and working on the Office of Emergency Management’s near-term flood forecasting system.  Midterm strategies include projects that lower the risk of flooding in neighborhoods of concern. So far, the city has completed coastal restoration projects in Piers Park in East Boston and Langan Park in the North End to enhance the coastline.  The city’s long-term strategy is a coastal storm risk management study being done with the US Army Corp of Engineers, which has “the opportunity to unlock potentially millions of dollars worth of funding over decades,” according to Osgood. The study is on track to be submitted to Congress in 2028.  The town of Salisbury, which is located between a beach and a river, is another example of an area especially prone to flooding. Local officials added tens of thousands of tons of sand to the beaches to help protect houses from erosion and flooding. The dunes were quickly washed away, according to Salisbury resident and former selectman Chuck Takesian, and it left the town more vulnerable to flooding and the elements.  “[The dunes] were placed strategically on a slope that scientists recommended, so we just plop the sand down,” he said. “When the waves hit it, it started to erode the dune.”  It initially cost the town $600,000 to install the dunes, just for one storm to wash them away in less than a week, according to NBC Boston. The state later stepped in, allocating $1.75 million for a project to restore the dunes.  As a flooding victim, Linquata hopes that the government is looking to the future when addressing flood-related issues. “Building structures to keep water out is only a temporary solution,” he said. At the same time, he acknowledged the issues that come with living on the water.  “A person makes that choice,” he said. “If a person makes that choice, there’s a risk that goes with that choice.” The post Flooding in Massachusetts drains money, energy, and resources appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Flooding.jpg?fit=768%2C1024&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-05-20 10:05:46.239341

The Louisiana […],"A utility crew restores power at a New Orleans intersection after Hurricane Francine in September 2024. (John Gray/Verite News)NEW ORLEANS – The recent end to a state-led energy efficiency program combined with massive layoffs last month at the federal agency that provides electric bill assistance to low-income households have residents of greater New Orleans worried about how they are going to cool their homes during the hottest months of the year.
The Louisiana Public Service Commission, which regulates electric utilities for most of the state,  eliminated an energy efficiency program that it had been working on for over a decade in mid-April. In early April, the Trump administration fired all of the Low Income Energy Assistance Program’s staff, leaving the future of the program in jeopardy.
Without state-level plans to increase energy assistance, spending on electricity will probably rise, experts said. And with LIHEAP in the lurch, people might not be able to access assistance they need to pay those high bills.
Logan Burke, the executive director of the Alliance for Affordable Energy called the LIHEAP cuts “outrageous,” especially because there are already few avenues for energy bill assistance. Burke said that Louisiana spent 7% of its LIHEAP funds on weatherizing homes last year, and that if LIHEAP doesn’t continue, then there will be no low-income weatherization or efficiency programs in the state.
“The problem here is that those are the minimal backstops that people have depended on for decades — the LIHEAP dollars — both for bill assistance and weatherization of housing, and without them, we simply lose billions of dollars of bill assistance and efficiency upgrades in low income housing,” Burke said.

Local LIHEAP administrators are silent on how the layoffs will affect residents or the future funding. The Louisiana Housing Corporation — which is in charge of distributing funds to parish organizations that then go through applications and work with residents to provide aid — did not respond to phone calls. Neither did JeffCAP, Jefferson Parish’s LIHEAP distributor, or Total Community Action in New Orleans.
State scraps energy efficiency program
Even though the average unit cost of electricity is lower in Louisiana than much of the rest of the country, Louisianians use the highest amounts, leading to high bills, said Logan Burke, executive director of the Alliance for Affordable Energy, and average rates have only been increasing in recent years. Between 2018 and 2024, the base rate for energy bills in Louisiana increased 40%, and is expected to increase 30% in the next 15 years, according to analysis from the financial consulting firm BAI Group. Extreme weather, old housing infrastructure and Louisiana’s reliance on natural gas, a volatile market, are all partly responsible for the high prices, experts said.
“A lot of our housing stock is old and simply isn’t good at retaining heated and cooled air,” Burke said. “So a lot of our energy is just wasted around leaks and cracks around our windows and doors.”
For the past 14 years, the Louisiana Public Service Commission had been working on an energy efficiency program that would have helped residents identify ways to consume less energy by making every unit of power go further — through renovations such as increased insulation in homes or upgraded thermostats, Burke said. But the commission abruptly voted to dissolve the program less than a month before contractors were slated to report to the commission about how the program would work. Republican commissioners said the administrative costs of the program would be too high.
The decision frustrated residents of the greater New Orleans area who struggle to pay their energy bills and were looking for state support to lower costs.
“Because if you go around sealing up all these cracks and holes in these old houses, don’t you think now they’re going to use less to heat and cool their homes?” said Dorginia Lucas, a Metairie resident. “That’s why I would drop it too if I was them. ‘Why would I help you lower your bill?’ That’s how I look at it.”
Lucas said she has been working since 14 years old, but still struggles to pay her utility bills, which range between $249 to $440. She said dealing with Entergy’s billing system is frustrating and overwhelming.
A recent report by the Louisiana Association of United Ways, a coalition of nonprofits that connect residents with health and financial aid resources, found that wages haven’t been increasing at the same rate as basic necessities in recent years, making household costs difficult to cover, even in families with steady incomes. And utility assistance has been one of the most sought-after aid requests over the past decade in Orleans Parish (with an exception in 2021 after Hurricane Ida), according to caller data from counseling service center Vialink.
The need for energy assistance has grown
Entergy distributes funds to nonprofits for its utility assistance program, “The Power to Care,” that aids seniors and people with disabilities. The New Orleans Council on Aging distributes those funds to residents in Orleans Parish.
Howard Rodgers, the executive director of the New Orleans Council on Aging, said there is a “tremendous need” for assistance paying utility bills in the city. Rodgers said seniors particularly need assistance because they might rely on benefits and need to pay for medication, which might lead them to deprioritize utility payments to the detriment of their health.
The New Orleans Council on Aging helps around 10,000 to 15,000 people every year through “The Power to Care” program, Rodgers said, and most funds come from charitable donations that Entergy matches. But the program has also changed in recent years. Due to high demand, the Council on Aging no longer accepts walk-ins for utility bill assistance. Additionally, those seeking help have a $500 cap on assistance every year. Rodgers said this allows the council to provide assistance to more people.
That might not go too far for many residents. A 2023 Verite News analysis found that the average Entergy bill in New Orleans was $179 in 2022.
And consumer advocates worry that the situation could get worse. Last year, the New Orleans City Council voted to approve the sale of Entergy New Orleans’s gas business utility to a company backed by private equity. Energy advocates and community members spoke out against the sale, saying that it might increase rates for energy users. Louisiana’s investments in exporting liquified natural gas abroad could also lead to higher energy costs at home, according to a Department of Energy report from last September.
Jannie Yarbrough, a retired New Orleans resident, said she lives alone and pays around $185 to $200 per month, a squeeze on fixed retirement income. Yarbrough said the city and state could be doing more to lower energy costs.
Yarbough said she could ask her daughter to help out, but doesn’t want to depend on her.
“I’m blessed that I have a daughter that could pay, but I’m not trying to depend on my child,” Yarbrough said.
Despite the rising costs of gas, public assistance pathways for utility payments are also dwindling at the local level. Last July, the city’s Office of Community Development shuttered its emergency rental and utility assistance program after four years. The office didn’t respond to requests for comment.
Entergy has its own energy efficiency program, but it still gets paid for funds it may lose from lower energy energy consumption — a program called “Quick Start,” according to the Alliance for Affordable Energy. Quick Start will expire at the end of the year, and on May 19 the Louisiana Public Service Commission voted to initiate a three month process to look at and make changes to the program and another that helps public entities with energy efficiency.
Under an independent, state-run energy efficiency program, Entergy wouldn’t be able to earn back potential profits it lost from energy efficiency upgrades.
Rodgers said the Council on Aging is anticipating a higher demand for utility assistance since the LIHEAP layoffs. He said he has already spoken to Entergy employees about the possibility of the end of LIHEAP. An Entergy New Orleans spokesperson did not respond to questions about if and how assistance pathways might change if LIHEAP ended, but said the company’s rates are consistently below the national average and that customers can contact the utility for bill management resources.
“We won’t know what to do until it happens,” Rodgers said. “We can think about it, plan for it, but then we are just going to have to be reactionary when that happens.”

Over 150 participants joined the Delaware Breast Cancer Coalition (DBCC) virtually on May 14 for the organization’s 27th Annual Breast Cancer Update, themed “The State We’re In.” 
The Zoom-based event brought together healthcare professionals, advocates, and community members to explore pressing issues in breast cancer care, including racial disparities, access to screening, and advances in prevention and treatment.
The program opened with a presentation from Dr. Scott Siegel, who outlined the disproportionate impact of Triple Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC) on Black women in Delaware. He noted that Black women are 40% more likely to die from breast cancer, with lower screening rates and a higher likelihood of late-stage diagnosis.
 “The greatest opportunity to reduce disparities,” he stated, “is by addressing prevention.” Dr. Siegel also highlighted geographic hotspots for late-stage breast cancer and introduced targeted strategies like deploying community health workers and using precision public health tools to close the equity gap.
Kendra Flores, another speaker at the event, underscored the evolving role of genetic testing in risk assessment and treatment decisions.
 “Genetic differences are what makes us, us,” she said, encouraging patients to revisit genetic testing every two to three years. She also highlighted the importance of interpretation services and introduced the Tyrer-Cuzick model for evaluating hereditary risk.

Dr. Karen Louie shared national screening statistics and updated recommendations, noting a steady decline in breast cancer deaths since 2014. She recommended early and enhanced screening protocols for individuals at high risk, and discussed prevention strategies including lifestyle changes and surgical options.
Zachary Bernard, the 2025 DBCC Grant Recipient, presented research from The Chanpyon Project, which seeks to improve breast cancer screening rates in Sussex County’s Haitian community. Bernard identified transportation issues and misinformation as key barriers.
 “The integration of credible messengers and culturally tailored outreach was key to overcoming barriers,” he said.

Nutritionist and breast cancer survivor Dee Iraca offered practical advice for reducing modifiable risk factors through diet and lifestyle. Her session emphasized mindful eating, gut health, and the impact of sleep quality, and concluded with a live cooking demonstration. She also addressed soy consumption, referencing research that links early-life intake with reduced risk of breast cancer.
A range of sponsors, including Delaware Health and Social Services, Beebe Healthcare, Delaware First Health, and Gilead Oncology supported the event.
 “The Delaware Breast Cancer Coalition is profoundly grateful for the generous support of our sponsors for the 27th Annual Breast Cancer Update,” said DBCC CEO Francesca Vogel. 
“Your commitment to our mission empowers us to provide vital resources, education, and support to individuals and families affected by breast cancer.

OTTAWA COUNTY — Local, state and national officials are warning that unless Michigan environmental officials can fast-track PFAS regulations to allow for harbor dredging this year, it could end up costing Ottawa County residents millions.
The problem arose when the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy (EGLE) implemented a new policy that requires testing for PFAS chemicals in sediment prior to being removed from federal harbors and channels.
The new requirement has caused confusion for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, which said it cannot proceed with dredging Ottawa County’s Grand Haven inner harbor until EGLE determines how PFAS will impact the silt and sediment to be dredged.
“EGLE has not been clear regarding the terms of this policy, the extent to which this policy change could disrupt harbors and shipping throughout our state and the Great Lakes system, the relevant PFAS thresholds and disposal requirements, and the timing of implementation,” said U.S. Rep. Bill Huizenga, who represents Michigan’s Fourth Congressional District, which includes the southern half of Ottawa County. “If these matters are not properly addressed, the communities I represent could face serious economic harm.”
 How we got here

PFAS, or per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, are a group of manmade chemicals used in various products and industries, including firefighting foams, stain repellents, and non-stick cookware.
Other sources can come from industrial sites, such as power plants, as in Grand Haven. The coal-fired J.B. Sims Plant, which closed in 2020 and was demolished in 2021, left coal ash on the site, which contains contaminants like mercury, cadmium, arsenic and PFAS.
Exposure in humans can lead to a range of health problems, including increased cholesterol, changes in the immune system, potential developmental delays and increased risk of certain cancers. There’s also evidence suggesting a link between PFAS and thyroid disease, liver damage and reproductive issues such as decreased fertility.
As the chemicals became known to state environmental regulators — there are seven known PFAS sites in Ottawa County — policies were developed to help identify and monitor new contamination sites.
That led to a new policy from EGLE’s Water Resources Division in 2018 to require harbor sediment be tested for PFAS prior to dredging.
Dredging is the process of removing sediments and debris from the bottom of water bodies to maintain navigable waterways, deepen channels for larger vessels, and support various infrastructure projects.
The U.S. Corps of Engineers’ Detroit District maintains a navigation system of 81 harbors and channels on the Great Lakes. Some harbors, such as Muskegon, require annual dredging, while others, such as Grand Haven’s inner harbor, might be dredged every two to four years, depending on factors such as river sediment accumulation, coastal erosion and water levels.
“We have to keep the channel dredged,” Grand Haven Mayor Bob Monetza told WGHN in April. “It gets full of sediment and gets shallow in places where boats can get hung up, or they might have to come in with lighter loads.”
The Grand River is typically kept at a depth of about 23 feet.
Every five years, harbors must apply for their Clean Water Act Section 401 Certification through the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Grand Haven was due to apply for its re-certification in November, but when the location was one of 17 harbors in Michigan identified with nearby PFAS-contributing sites — the former Sims site is about 2.5 miles from the outer harbor — EGLE implemented the new PFAS testing standard for the site.
“It kind of came out of nowhere, but they want us to start sampling the river bottom for PFAs, because there’s PFAs in the river in the sediment that washes downstream from farther upstream,” Monetza told WGHN.
The “inner harbor” generally refers to the area closer to land, while the “outer harbor” is further from shore, where breakwaters or other structures are found to protect the harbor from strong waves and currents.
Meanwhile, the state has yet to establish PFAS standards for the sediment testing, causing confusion between the agencies about which levels are acceptable to allow dredging to proceed as well as who pays for the process.
Huizenga, in a letter to Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, said the Corps said at the Great Lakes Navigation meeting in November that the new testing requirements will reduce the number of harbors that are dredged annually and could drive up costs by up to 70%.



Standards for PFAS levels and disposal are still being circulated for review and have yet to be made available by the state. Even if the testing process is sorted out and performed, Monetza said it could take six months to a year to confirm the plan for Grand Haven.



“They’ll take a long period of time to analyze and decide what they’re going to do, what kind of permits they’ll issue,” he said.
The Corps also announced it was pushing back the Grand Haven project until 2026, prompting deep concerns from local, state and federal officeholders.
“This is the equivalent of writing a speeding a ticket when there is no posted speed limit,” Huizenga, a Republican, said on his website.
Liz Wilkinson, operations manager at the Corps’ Grand Haven office, described the delay as “unlucky timing.”
“It was just kind of unfortunate, unlucky timing that Grand Haven needed to be coordinated right at about the time that EGLE felt like they were ready to start doing this testing with PFAS. We had it planned for this year. We had it budgeted for this year because we knew it was needed,” Wilkinson told The Grand Haven Tribune last month.
 Officials warn of economic impacts

U.S. Rep. Hillary Scholten wrote a letter in April urging Whitmer of the economic impacts of not dredging Grand Haven’s harbor. The congresswoman, a Democrat, represents Michigan’s Third Congressional District, which includes the northern half of Ottawa County.



She said Grand Haven’s harbor is “an economic powerhouse” that supports over 450 jobs totaling $29.5 million in wages annually, as well as producing a regional impact of $88.8 million per year.



“A missed dredging cycle will come at a high price. Delays will directly affect our partners across the state who rely on materials to complete transportation projects and agriculture operations, with road-building materials, concrete, asphalt, and fertilizer expected to increase in cost by more than $1 million annually,” Scholten said in the letter.
She said lighter loads and more freighter trips will result in price hikes for consumers that could reach $3 to $5 million a year.
“If we see delayed dredging, goods being shipped through Grand Haven may increase in cost by roughly $3 to $5 million annually — costs that will likely be passed through to consumers,” Scholten wrote. “In the instance that Grand Haven becomes unnavigable for commercial vessels, it is understood that neighboring harbors do not have the capacity to accept those supplies.”
The Corps announced in April it was actually moving up the dredging schedule for Holland Harbor after a shoal — a submerged ridge or bank of sand or gravel that lies close to the water’s surface — developed over the winter across the entrance to the harbor, which could have caused the shipping industry to lose $1.4 million to $1.9 million per year due to ships having to carry lighter loads, according to WGVU Public Media.
King Co. Inc., based in Holland, will dredge about 12,400 cubic yards of sediment hydraulically. The project will cost $344,480 out of a three-project contract that also includes Grand Haven and St. Joseph harbors.
Ottawa County Commissioner Josh Brugger, who represents Grand Haven, Spring Lake and Ferrysburg, also wrote to Whitmer urging the state to find a solution.
Monetza, Spring Lake Mayor Richard Carlson, Spring Lake Township Supervisor Jerry Rabideau and Spring Lake Village President Mark Powers also signed onto Brugger’s message.


“We wish to underscore the message that, without a timely resolution, this major port cannot be maintained, and our local economy may be significantly harmed,” Brugger wrote. “We are appealing for your assistance to expedite the process.”

Scholten said time is of the essence.
“At a time of grave economic uncertainty and rising prices due to tariffs for the industries, we do not need to add to the increased production costs. This problem is still solvable,” she said. “When it comes to the shipping, construction, and agricultural industries, time is not a luxury we have.”

The Census Bureau's Vintage 2024 estimates released last week found that about four in five Bay State municipalities counted more residents on July 1, 2024 than a year earlier.
The post Census shows recent growth in most Mass. cities and towns appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.","MOST MASSACHUSETTS cities and towns experienced a slight growth in residents from 2023 to 2024, boosting the state’s population amidst continuing concerns about outmigration, according to new US Census Bureau data.The Census Bureau’s Vintage 2024 estimates released last week found that about four in five Bay State municipalities counted more residents on July 1, 2024 than a year earlier, fueling the nearly 1 percent statewide population growth over the same span that officials previously announced.Boston, the state’s largest city, led the pack in total growth, with 8,855 new residents pushing its population to more than 673,000, the data show. That’s a rate of about 1.3 percent.Some smaller communities expanded at higher rates. Stoneham added 1,452 people over the one-year period, a nearly 6.3 percent growth rate that led all 351 cities and towns. Among larger municipalities with at least 50,000 residents, the most significant population change was in Revere, which grew 2.94 percent.Sixty-one communities lost population year over year. The biggest loss, both in terms of raw total and percent change, was Concord, whose population shrunk 181 people or roughly 1 percent.Secretary of State William Galvin’s office said most of the towns with population decreases were concentrated in western Massachusetts or Barnstable County.



It appears Massachusetts is part of a larger regional trend.“In 2024, the Northeast experienced population growth after years of steady decline, with rates ranging from an average growth of 0.1 percent in cities and towns with fewer than 5,000 people (a shift from the 0.3 percent average decline in 2023) to 1.0 percent average growth in cities with populations of 50,000 or more — five times higher than their growth rate during 2023,” the Census Bureau wrote in a news release last week.Nationally, the largest average population growth was in the South, the Census Bureau said, while the western part of the country also saw increases and the Midwest experienced “modest population growth.”The new municipal data build on statewide totals released in December. The Census Bureau counted 7,136,171 people living in Massachusetts as of July 1, 2024, an increase of nearly 70,000 or close to 1 percent over a year earlier.Thousands of people continue to leave Massachusetts for other states, but newly incoming immigrants have more than made up for it in recent years, the data show. From July 1, 2023 to July 1, 2024, the Census Bureau reported that about 27,500 people decamped Massachusetts for another state — down from 36,500 the prior year and 54,800 the year before that.In each of those years, international migration to the Bay State surpassed 72,000, climbing to 90,200 from July 1, 2023 to July 1, 2024.The UMass Donahue Institute previously called the 2023-to-2024 trend the Bay State’s largest annual population increase in 60 years. The Pioneer Institute later suggested the growth was linked to an increase in humanitarian migrants who are now being more accurately counted.Beacon Hill has been closely watching migration patterns, especially as business groups and others warn of people leaving Massachusetts due to the state’s high cost of living.Galvin’s office echoed the Donahue Institute analysis last week, attributing the year-over-year growth to slowing domestic outmigration to other states as well as “record levels of international migration.”“Accurate population counts are crucial for state and local governments, because they dictate federal funding for things like schools, transportation, and health care,” Galvin, a Democrat who is the state’s 2030 US Census Liaison, said. “If people are living in Massachusetts, using those resources, and contributing to our local economy, we must push back against any efforts to exclude them from the count.”From July 1, 2020 to July 1, 2024, the Census Bureau’s Vintage series counts an increase in the Bay State’s population of about 141,000 people or 2 percent.The post Census shows recent growth in most Mass. cities and towns appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Screenshot_20-5-2025_9240_www.statehousenews.com_.jpeg?fit=1024%2C799&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-05-20 10:05:46.239341

The newly refurbished Mississippi Sports Hall of Fame Monday held a celebration of something Mississippians do as well as well as anyone anywhere. I am writing, of course, of college baseball, played here and supported by Magnolia State fans as well as – and perhaps better than – anywhere else.
Southern Miss’s JB Middleton, one of the best pitchers in college baseball, took home the Boo Ferriss Trophy, which goes annually to the state’s best player. It was a day for hard-throwing, small-town right-handers at the Hall of Fame. Middleton, a junior from Yazoo City, won the trophy named for the late Dave “Boo” Ferriss, another right-handed pitching ace from Shaw. Roy Oswalt, from Weir, who won 163 games pitching for four Major League teams, was the featured speaker. 

Rick Cleveland
Middleton, expected to be a high choice in the upcoming Major League Draft, won over Delta State right-hander Drake Fontenot and three sluggers: Southern Miss second baseman Nick Monistere, Mississippi State third baseman Ace Reese and Ole Miss third baseman Luke Hill.
Ferriss, a Boston Red Sox Hall of Famer, surely would approve of Middleton’s amazing numbers produced this spring. USM’s Friday night ace won nine games, lost only one and had an earned run average of 2.05. In this college baseball era of soaring offensive numbers, Middleton allowed opponents to hit only .167. Perhaps most impressive of all was his strikeouts-to-walks ratio. He fanned 104 batters and walked only 23. He is the state’s only semifinalist for the Golden Spikes Award, which goes annually to the nation’s best amateur baseball player.
“JB’s a true Friday night ace,” Southern Miss coach Christian Ostrander said. “You get the ball in his hand, you’ve got a chance to win … obviously, we wouldn’t be where we are without him.”
The Golden Eagles, 41-13 and winners of 15 straight headed into the postseason, also wouldn’t be where they are without Monistere. The former Northwest Rankin star and Mississippi high school player of the year Monday was named the Sun Belt Conference’s most outstanding player after a regular season in which he slammed 18 home runs, knocked in 66 runs and batted .332.
“To have two of the five finalists for this prestigious award speaks volumes,” Ostrander said. “We’ve got a lot of really good players having great seasons this year.”
The three other Ferriss finalists also produced eye-popping numbers:

Reese, a Texan and a sophomore transfer from Houston, was also named first team All-SEC and the league’s Newcomer of the Year on Monday. The sophomore hit .369 (a whopping .402 in SEC games) with 21 home runs and 66 runs batted in.
Hill, a second team All-SEC selection, hit .345 with eight home runs and 35 RBI and led the SEC with 12 stolen bases in league play.
Fontenot, Delta State’s Friday night ace and the Gulf South Conference’s Pitcher of the Year, won nine games and lost three with an ERA of 2.50. At one point he set a school record with 39.1 consecutive innings of scoreless baseball.

Oswalt regaled the awards luncheon crowd with stories of his fascinating career, during which he had back-to-back 20-win seasons with the Houston Astros and was the Most Valuable Player of the 2005 National League Championship Series. 
He told about how Weir Attendance Center never had a baseball team or a baseball field until he came along with his 90 mph fastball as a 14-year-old. “My daddy was a logger and he cut down trees and cleared the area that became our baseball field,” Oswalt said. Weir played 17 games that first season. Oswalt pitched 15 of those, all complete games.

Long before, he pitched in the Major Leagues, Roy Oswald was a legend in Weir. Credit: MSHOF
He also told a story about how, as a minor leaguer, he recovered from a serious shoulder injury in a most unorthodox fashion. His throwing shoulder was aching badly at the end of the 1999 season and he thought for sure the injury would require major surgery. Then, he got back home to Weir with hunting season about to begin.
“I was working on my hunting truck that had an engine that was missing,” Oswalt said. “I was fooling around with some spark plug wires and got shocked. Man, I mean, I got shocked. The current shot up from my hand and to my shoulder. I felt it throughout my whole body. It shocked the fire out of me, but once I recovered from the initial shock I realized my shoulder didn’t hurt anymore. It was fine after that.”
To his credit, Oswalt did not advise any of the Ferriss Trophy finalists to try the same treatment should they ever suffer a sore arm.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/19173753/JB-Middleton.jpg,,,2025-05-20 09:02:39.074162

Durant, who has served the Red Clay community for 17 years, was recognized for her trauma-informed, relationship-based approach to student support. Her work emphasizes emotional regulation and wellness, helping students thrive both in and out of the classroom.
Among the initiatives she’s led at Richey Elementary are morning emotional check-ins and classroom regulation stations — spaces equipped with tools such as breathing tracers, yoga cards, and fidget items designed to help students manage stress and return to learning.

The bilingual morning check-in system, featuring the school mascot, allows teachers to assess students’ emotional states as they arrive each day. Students use a feelings chart to express how they’re doing, giving staff early insight into who might need additional support.
“As more students began arriving at school dysregulated, I recognized the need for both a daily emotional check-in and accessible Tier 1 regulation supports throughout the day,” Durant said.
Each fall, Durant visits every homeroom to teach students how to use the stations effectively.
She says this proactive approach has helped students build emotional awareness and develop self-management skills — a sentiment echoed by staff at the school.
“Jaclyn is the heart of our school community. She brings a tireless work ethic and a profound sense of empathy to her role each day,” said Richey Principal Gregg Johnson. “Whether she is supporting students through personal struggles, helping families navigate challenges outside of school, or connecting them with critical community resources, her work is consistently rooted in care, equity and dignity.”
Durant’s recognition is part of the Delaware Department of Education’s Behavioral Health Professional of the Year program, which honors school counselors, psychologists, nurses, and social workers who make significant contributions to student mental health.
As the state honoree, Durant will receive a $3,000 award from the Department of Education, along with $5,000 for use on student-related initiatives. She also received a $2,000 award from her district for being Red Clay’s nominee.",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/unnamed.png,,,2025-05-20 09:02:39.074162

(Bryce campaign photo)Randy Bryce, the former iron worker who ran unsuccessfully for Congress in Wisconsin’s First District in 2018, is taking another shot at the seat, focusing again on a pitch for voters to send an everyday worker to Washington.
Bryce announced Tuesday he would seek the Democratic nomination to run against Republican incumbent Bryan Steil in 2026.
Bryce said he expects the top issues in the race to be preserving Social Security and other safety net programs, resisting  President Donald Trump’s steep tariffs and attacks on immigrants and pushing back against the general climate of fear as Republicans enact the Trump agenda. 
“I cannot sit and just watch this happen,” Bryce said in an interview Monday. “And with Trump it’s even worse now, with people literally being afraid.”
Bryce’s first 2026 campaign video, launched Tuesday morning, hearkens back to the 2018 campaign, when “one man stood up to Washington,” in the words of the opening narration. “He’s not a politician or a billionaire. He’s something much more rare in Congress, someone who actually works for a living.”
The video puts Trump and his policies front and center, and it depicts the 2026 campaign as finishing a job that Bryce began in his first run for the seat.
When the president’s image first appears, the narrator says, “as old enemies come out of the shadows…” A follow-up shot shows a welder — Bryce — in a darkened workshop, and the narrator says, “we need him one more time.”
“I’ve never left the job unfinished,” Bryce tells the camera. “For 20 years, I’ve helped build Wisconsin with these hands while they shipped our jobs overseas. I stayed right here fighting for working families. Trump promised to bring manufacturing back. Eight years later, we’re still waiting.”
Bryce made national headlines with the 2018 race — a  campaign he launched the year before with the intention of running against the district’s 20-year incumbent, then-U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan.
Ryan, who by then was U.S. House Speaker, unexpectedly declined to run for an 11th term however. Since then Bryce has claimed credit for having “chased Paul Ryan out.”
Steil, a corporate lawyer who was once a Ryan congressional aide, ran in Ryan’s place after handily overcoming five primary election challengers.
Bryce’s campaign was widely seen as energetic and novel for the district, which has been in Republican hands since the 1994 election. With the exception of Rob Zerban in 2012, Ryan’s Democratic challengers since 2004 garnered only about a third of voters, ranging from 30% to 37%. In 2018, Bryce finished with 42%. Since that election, Democrats have cleared from 40% to 45% in the 1st CD.
Since that campaign Bryce has headlined a fundraising operation raising money for progressive political candidates, many of them with working-class backgrounds akin to his.
Bryce is entering the 2026 campaign midway through the first year of a Trump term. Progressive and Democratic Party groups who asked if he would run again pointed out that his last campaign had roughly the same timing in Trump’s first term, Bryce told the Wisconsin Examiner, and the decision to run has “been gradually building.”
Cuts to the Veterans Administration is another issue that helped push him to run, said Bryce, a U.S. Army veteran. The agency is one of several that have been disrupted by the DOGE operation (the “Department of Government Efficiency,” although it is not an official U.S. government department) that until recently was run by billionaire and Trump supporter Elon Musk.
The campaign video plays up Bryce’s longtime social media nickname, “IronStache” — trading on the thick mustache he has sported for decades. While it shows flashes of Steil’s face and includes snippets of voters who are criticizing the incumbent, neither the narration nor Bryce mention the incumbent by name.
In the interview, Bryce said in addition to working with the union and grassroots progressive groups that rallied behind him in his first race, he would make an appeal to disaffected Trump voters who are being harmed by current federal policies.
“I want to go places where Democrats normally haven’t gone,” he said. “I want to bring more people together.”
Steil is “listening to his leadership [in Congress] and his donors, he’s not listening to the people that voted for him,” Bryce charged. “And he’s not doing anything to stand up to Trump. The Constitution was drawn up to stop somebody like Trump. But Congress isn’t doing their job. They’re helping enable whatever Trump wants to go on.”

Dunbar sponsored a resolution asking the state's congressional delegation to oppose Medicaid cuts. (Photo by James Brooks/Alaska Beacon)The Alaska Legislature has voted to urge the state’s congressional delegation to oppose cuts to Medicaid, as the state faces a potential annual loss of $194 million in federal spending and tens of thousands more uninsured residents.
The House passed Senate Joint Resolution 15 on Sunday by a vote of 27-13, and the Senate approved the final version 14-6 on Monday.
The joint federal-state program is the largest health care payer for lower-income Alaskans and a major source of nursing care for people with a wide range of incomes. The U.S. House of Representatives is considering making $625 billion in cuts over the next 10 years. 
The health-focused foundation KFF estimated that Alaska would see a loss of federal payments under the current proposal equal to $194 million this year, or 19% of federal Medicaid spending in the state. 
And state enrollment would decline by between 24,000 and 40,000, with a midpoint estimate of 32,000 fewer Alaskans enrolled in the program. 
The Senate Health and Social Services Committee sponsored the resolution. Sen. Forrest Dunbar, D-Anchorage and the committee chair, noted roughly 1 in 3 Alaskans is enrolled in the program. He referred to his family history. 
“My grandfather fought in World War II, and towards the end of his life, my mother moved him up to Fairbanks to get long-term care,” Dunbar said. “He had to have round-the-clock care; it was about $8,000 a month, which at the time was a lot of money — now it’s even more expensive. And the VA didn’t cover all of that care. We had to enroll him in the Medicaid program. And there are thousands of stories just like that.”
Under the current U.S. House proposal, the two biggest cuts would be the result of instituting work and reporting requirements for Medicaid enrollees and increasing the complexity of applying for and renewing Medicaid. 
Dunbar noted that Medicaid pays for a significant share of revenue at major health care providers, citing estimates of 25% of payments to Providence Alaska and 41% of payments to the Alaska Native Tribal Health Consortium.  
Sen. Löki Tobin, D-Anchorage, emphasized that the program enrolls most of Alaska’s children, including through school-based programs, and is a major source of health care for Alaska Natives. 
The resolution asks U.S. Sens. Lisa Murkowski and Dan Sullivan and U.S. Rep. Nick Begich to oppose the proposed cuts “to protect the state’s health care system, communities, citizens, and economy.”
The resolution said  “Medicaid plays a crucial role in supporting the state’s small businesses and entrepreneurs by providing access to affordable health care coverage for employees, which helps prevent illness, reduces absenteeism, and improves productivity,” and that “ by ensuring workers have access to necessary medical services, Medicaid enables small businesses to retain a healthier, more reliable workforce, ultimately contributing to economic stability and growth in the state.”
Rep. Genevieve Mina, D-Anchorage, led the effort to pass the bill in the House and questioned whether the state can afford to take on a greater share of Medicaid spending. 
“Given our current fiscal situation, I don’t think that’s going to be realistic, in terms of delivering health care services for people who need it,” she said. 
All 21 members of the multipartisan House majority voted for the resolution, along with six minority-caucus Republicans: Reps. Jeremy Bynum of Ketchikan, Bill Elam of Nikiski, Elexie Moore of Wasilla, David Nelson of Anchorage, Mike Prax of North Pole and Justin Ruffridge of Soldotna. The other 13 minority-caucus members voted against it. 
One resolution opponent, Rep. Julie Coulombe of Anchorage, proposed an amendment to the resolution that supported “efforts to identify and eliminate waste, fraud and abuse within the Medicaid system.” Coulombe’s amendment passed.
When the amended version of the resolution returned to the Senate, Dunbar criticized the added language, which he described as a “red herring.” He also said that congressional efforts are not targeting waste, fraud and abuse, and could actually undermine some investigations of these issues. But he called for the Senate to pass it despite the added language, due to the overall goals of the resolution. 











“I would hope that whatever decision is made at the federal government, that the floor doesn’t drop out on states like Alaska — but if they’re going to decide to reduce things, that we’re given some time to adjust to that.” 


– Alaska Gov. Mike Dunleavy



	Twelve of the 14 Senate majority members voted for it, with Nikiski Republican Sen. Jesse Bjorkman and Fairbanks Democrat Scott Kawasaki the only majority members to vote no. Among minority-caucus Republican senators, four voted no, while Sens. Mike Cronk of Tok/Northway and James Kaufman of Anchorage voted for it. 
While resolutions like these do not go before Gov. Mike Dunleavy, when the governor was asked about his view of Medicaid and other federal cuts at a new conference on Monday, he acknowledged that the federal government is facing a growing national debt. 
“My concern is that Alaska may end up losing money in this process,” he said. “I would hope that whatever decision is made at the federal government, that the floor doesn’t drop out on states like Alaska — but if they’re going to decide to reduce things, that we’re given some time to adjust to that.”

Amid pledges from Democratic legislative leaders to make California more affordable, there is persistent evidence that the state’s high cost of living won’t get better anytime soon. 
The latest comes from California’s housing department, which recently released its annual report detailing how much households can earn in each of California’s 58 counties to be eligible for various government programs, including housing assistance programs.
One striking takeaway? Earning a six-figure salary as a single person without dependents is considered “low income” in five counties — all in Northern California.
Residents making an annual income of up to $109,700 who are living in Marin, San Francisco, San Mateo, Santa Clara and Santa Cruz counties are considered low income, according to the California Department of Housing & Community Development. Topping the list is Santa Clara County, the home of Silicon Valley’s tech industry, which designates $111,700 as low income. 
For a three-person household — say, two parents with one child — earning a combined six-figure salary is also considered low income in an additional 11 counties: Alameda, Contra Costa, Los Angeles, Monterey, Napa, Orange, San Diego, San Luis Obispo, Santa Barbara, Sonoma and Ventura counties.
This wasn’t always the case, as SFGATE points out: Five years ago, $78,550 was considered low income for a single-person household in Santa Clara County, a difference of $33,150, or 42%, compared to now. Indeed no California county in 2020 considered a six-figure salary low income; with $97,600 standing as the low-income ceiling for Marin, San Francisco and San Mateo counties. 
The report comes as both the federal and state government plan to cut or shift funds for social safety net programs; rising insurance costs drive up rents; electric bills in California remain some of the highest in the country; and inflation is “projected to accelerate” under President Donald Trump’s tariff policies.

CA cities and counties clash over homelessness

Though Gov. Gavin Newsom’s disputes with local governments over homelessness often grab headlines, disagreements between counties and cities also have the potential to upend the livelihoods of unhoused people who depend on local support.
As CalMatters’ Marisa Kendall explains, the saga between the city and county of Los Angeles and their soon-to-be-dissolved joint homeless services authority underscores the friction between local governments, which are sometimes at odds with each other when it comes to funding and responsibility. It’s a kind of clash that’s happening elsewhere in California, such as San Diego and Stanislaus counties.
Established in the 1990s, the Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority provided services to some of L.A. County’s 75,000 homeless people. After two audits found that the joint agency failed to properly track spending and outcomes, the county’s Board of Supervisors voted last month to rescind more than a third of the agency’s funding, or more than $300 million. L.A. County officials say they plan to create a new agency that is more efficient and will have more accountability measures. 
L.A. Mayor Karen Bass and a city councilmember blasted the move, saying it would “create a monumental disruption” and risk “worsening our homelessness crisis.”
Days after county supervisors conducted their vote, members of the L.A. City Council said they should consider pulling out of the agency too.
Cities, which provide shelter beds, do not have behavioral health departments, which are provided by counties, along with other key mental health and addiction treatments. The dismantling of L.A.’s joint agency has left programs in the region figuring out how to separate funds they receive from both the city and county.

Fear among ESL students under Trump

More than 290,000 students take free English as a Second Language courses in California’s community colleges. But as the Trump administration cracks down on immigration, educators are reporting a heightened level of anxiety that discourages ESL students from going to class, writes Delilah Brumer of CalMatters’ College Journalism Network.
Non-credit ESL courses have been growing in popularity in recent years: From the 2018-19 academic year to 2023-24, about 30,000 more students in California enrolled in these courses. This is a boon for community colleges, which receive state funding through ESL courses and are still struggling with enrollment after the pandemic.
But in January Trump issued several executive actions to increase deportations, including authorizing the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement to make arrests at schools and other “sensitive locations.” For the roughly 100,000 California college students who do not have permanent legal status, fears about ICE have led some to either attend classes online or not show up at all.

Jessica Buchsbaum, City College of San Francisco’s ESL department chairperson: “We’ve definitely heard that students may be afraid to come to school. In an environment when there’s so much hate directed at immigrants, we are here to serve this population. These are people who bring incredible energy and hope to our communities.”

But those partnerships can be fraught.,"In summary
California cities and counties are supposed to work together to help their homeless residents. But those partnerships can be fraught.


For three decades, the city and county of Los Angeles managed California’s biggest homelessness crisis together.
They had equal say in big funding decisions, and worked in tandem to coordinate housing programs through a joint city-county agency called the Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority. 
But after scathing audits criticizing the homeless authority, the county is blowing up that joint agency and starting over — despite the objections of LA Mayor Karen Bass. Now, questions remain about how the shakeup will affect the more than 75,000 unhoused people living in LA County. 
It’s the most dramatic recent example of a phenomenon playing out all over California. Cities which supply shelter beds, and counties, which provide crucial mental health and addiction treatment, can’t effectively address homelessness unless they work well together. But all too often, they don’t. 
In multiple cities, mayors are publicly attacking their counties for failing to pull their weight. In San Diego, a 150-bed shelter created as a partnership between the city and county is in jeopardy, as both sides squabble over who should pay for what. In the San Joaquin Valley, the city of Turlock is refusing to let Stanislaus County fund a shelter there. A state bill that would have forced counties to pay for half the cost of city-run homeless shelters faced fierce pushback from counties, and was swiftly gutted.
There’s no shortage of evidence on why working together is beneficial. Cities don’t have behavioral health departments, or funding for those services. So when residents of city homeless shelters need mental health or addiction treatment, which they often do, that falls on the county. 
The League of California Cities and the California State Association of Counties even released a report in 2018 highlighting the importance of cities and counties addressing homelessness together. 
There is no mandate from the state that lays out how much of the responsibility should fall to a city and how much should fall to a county. Especially in tight budget years such as this one, cities don’t want to pay for services they could pass on to the county – and vice versa. And neither wants to take the blame for falling short as they struggle under the immense challenge of getting people off the street. 
While both sides bicker, the fate of real shelters that provide lifelines for real people hangs in the balance. 
“The lack of partnership between cities and counties around people living in shelters is a major problem,” said Sen. Catherine Blakespear, a Democrat from Encinitas, whose Senate Bill 16 would have forced counties to shoulder half the cost of city shelters until it was amended in a way that weakened her proposed requirement.
LA County overhaul
The Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority formed in the 1990s as a result of a series of lawsuits claiming that homeless Angelenos couldn’t access county services. The joint agency was supposed to fix that problem by forcing the city and county to work together.
City and county officials have pointed out some of the good that came out of that partnership. The two entities are working together to improve the way they share client data across homelessness and mental health systems. They have a joint team of outreach workers that can go anywhere in the county without being restricted by the boundaries of its 88 cities, which in addition to Los Angeles include Long Beach and Glendale. 
Last year, the city of LA saw a 10% decrease in street homelessness — the first double digit decrease in at least nine years. 
LA County voters showed they were willing to pay more to address homelessness when they backed a sales tax to fund those programs in 2017 and in 2024. The new money forced the homeless services authority to grow quickly. Things didn’t go smoothly.

Two critical audits since November found the agency was failing to properly track spending and outcomes. The LA County Board of Supervisors voted last month to pull more than $300 million – more than a third of the joint agency’s funding — and more than 700 employees out of the joint authority and into a new county agency.
After that, in quick succession, the head of the joint agency said she would resign and a federal task force announced it would investigate the agency for fraud. The LA City Council is considering pulling its funding as well.
The result will be a complete overhaul of how the county administers its homelessness programs, scheduled to take about a year.
While the problems at the homeless authority were obvious, the county’s gutting of the joint agency — done over the objections of Mayor Bass — created more friction between the city and county.
In a letter to the county before the vote, Bass and Councilmember Nithya Raman warned pulling funding from the joint agency would “create a monumental disruption in the progress we are making and runs the serious risk of worsening our homelessness crisis.”
The county’s vote to do it anyway “felt like a breaking of a relationship that was moving towards greater trust,” Raman, who chairs the city’s Housing and Homelessness Committee, said in an interview.  
Now, Raman said, programs that received city and county funds through the joint agency,  such as a $170 million program that provides two-year rental subsidies, are scrambling to figure out how to separate the city and county funds. She’s also worried about shelter programs falling through the cracks during the transition.
“How are we going to make sure those shelters stay in place?” Raman asked. 
The new agency will have heightened accountability measures – something multiple audits found that the old joint-agency lacked. The agency will report to the county annually on its progress, and quarterly on an online dashboard, said Cheri Todoroff, executive director of the county’s Homeless Initiative.
By operating within the existing county infrastructure, the new agency will benefit from tools the county has been using for decades to account for spending and monitor progress, said Sarah Mahin, director of the county’s Housing for Health program, which will be a model for the new agency. 
LA County Supervisor Lindsey Horvath, who spearheaded the plan to create the new agency, said the intention isn’t to keep the city out of its homelessness efforts, but to be more efficient by consolidating homeless services that are being provided across more than a dozen different county departments. The county also will review all existing contracts, and cancel the ones that aren’t delivering results, she said. 
“The city will be as involved as they choose to be,” Horvath said.

In this year’s state of the city speech, San Diego Mayor Todd Gloria attacked his county counterparts for their “inaction” in helping unhoused people suffering from mental illness and addiction. Last month, he put the county on blast again in his email newsletter, saying it must “step up” to save a homeless shelter.
“Generally speaking, I would say where the city is responding to this with an all hands on deck approach, I don’t think the same can be said for my county or for other counties,” Gloria said in an interview with CalMatters. 
That tension came to a head with a dispute over the Rosecrans Shelter, where 150 people sleep in bunk beds inside a giant tent set up in the parking lot of the county’s psychiatric hospital. The city runs the shelter and the county provides behavioral health services, the land and utilities, via a connection to the neighboring hospital. 
The county is preparing to demolish a vacant building on that site, which will sever the shelter’s connection to water, sewer and power.

Now, the fate of the shelter residents is up in the air. Gloria wants the county to pay to reestablish the utilities, which is estimated to cost as much as $2 million. He also wants the county to relocate the shelter residents, most of whom are struggling with mental illness or addiction. They can’t stay at the shelter during the demolition, he said – it will be too disruptive.
Spencer Katz, director of strategic initiatives for San Diego County Supervisor Terra Lawson-Remer, disagrees. There’s no reason people can’t live at the shelter during the demolition, he said.
“With respect to the mayor, who’s neither an expert on demolition nor on behavioral health, that claim simply doesn’t hold water,” he said. 
Lawson-Remer has proposed using $800,000 in leftover federal COVID recovery funds to pay for the utility connections, Katz said, and she wants to work with the city to find the rest of the money. 
But Gloria has proposed closing the shelter, as he stares down a $258 million budget deficit. 
The city and county have until July 1, when their current agreement expires, to find a solution. 
Newsom calls out Turlock mayor
Meanwhile, in the San Joaquin Valley, another city-county dispute over homelessness caught the attention of Gov. Gavin Newsom.
“Truly a ridiculous lack of local leadership – an absolute moral failure,” the governor said last month on X.
He was talking about the city of Turlock, which has refused to allow Stanislaus County to support an existing homeless shelter in the city. The county awarded nearly $270,000 in state funding to the 50-bed shelter. But the money was contingent on the cooperation of the city, which would have to write a letter of support and allocate a token $1 to the program. 
The city said no. 
“It’s not about the dollar — it’s about accountability,” Turlock Mayor Amy Bublak said in an interview with CalMatters. The shelter is open at night, but during the day, the people who sleep there have nowhere to go – and nowhere to use the bathroom, Bublak said. As a result, the nearby businesses are complaining of public urination and other disruptions, she said. The mayor asked We Care, the organization that runs the shelter, to keep its bathroom open during the day, but they weren’t able to come to an agreement, she said.

Stanislaus County Supervisor Terry Withrow called the city’s refusal “pretty disappointing.” The people in the shelter need help, he said, and closing the program won’t make them go away. 
“I don’t know how you can turn your back on these individuals and just let them die out there,” he said. 
We Care did not respond to a request for comment. In a statement to CBS13, We Care said it might be forced to shut down the shelter without that funding.
Bill would have made counties pay more
The bill introduced by Blakespear, the Encinitas state senator, would have required counties to cover half the cost of operating city-run homeless shelters in order to be eligible for state homelessness funding. Counties came out in force against that mandate, and Blakespear removed it from the bill.
That was a disappointment for San Jose Mayor Matt Mahan. He’s leading a push to open about 1,000 new temporary housing units this year, mostly in converted motels and tiny homes – and he wants Santa Clara County to provide case management services to the residents.  
“We have basically reached our limit,” Mahan said. “We can’t defund core city services that are already understaffed. So if the county doesn’t step in…We can’t scale anymore, which means we leave thousands of people outside.”
Santa Clara County Supervisor Susan Ellenberg said the city and county already work together on many shelter programs. But she objected to forcing the county to pay for services.
“Without having any control over the number of shelters or tiny homes that the city decides to build,” she said, “we don’t have control over our budget.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/012821-LAHSA-GETTY-CM-01.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-05-20 09:02:39.074162

Under Trump, some are skipping class",Delilah Brumer,,,,,https://calmatters.org/education/higher-education/college-beat/2025/05/ice-in-schools-california/,"California's ESL courses gained 30,000 students over the past six years. As the Trump administration revokes student visas and escalates immigration raids, that growth is at risk.","In summary
California’s ESL courses gained 30,000 students over the past six years. As the Trump administration revokes student visas and escalates immigration raids, that growth is at risk.


They speak Farsi, Cantonese, Spanish and at least two dozen other languages. Some earned master’s degrees in their home countries, while others never finished middle school. At California’s community colleges, more than 290,000 students take free, non-credit English as a Second Language classes.
As immigrants, many of these students enroll in the classes to integrate into American life, advance in their jobs, support their children or build community. The classes have grown in popularity in recent years — an enrollment bright spot for the state’s community college system, which has struggled to fully rebound to pre-pandemic student counts. 
But as news of international student visa revocations and reports of Immigration and Customs Enforcement raids during President Donald Trump’s second term spread across the state, many community colleges have seen some of these students switch to online learning, or stop showing up to class altogether.
So far there’s no statewide data on 2025 enrollment in non-credit ESL courses at California’s community colleges. But several anecdotes from professors and enrollment numbers from individual community colleges paint a similar picture: A heightened fear of ICE is driving students away. In the San Fernando Valley, one professor has lost about 15% of her enrollment this semester. In San Marcos, several classrooms abruptly transitioned from mostly in-person instruction to walls of Zoom squares.
As the semester goes on, ESL professors are offering “Know Your Rights” cards to students and informing their classes of the community college system’s pledge to not participate in federal immigration enforcement efforts. They’re also continuing to connect their students with campus resources such as food pantries and tutoring centers.
ESL classes have expanded post-pandemic
Los Angeles Pierce College began offering non-credit ESL in 2021, and last year the college hired a full-time professor to boost the program. Enrollment in the classes skyrocketed from about 50 in 2021 to more than 350 in 2024. Dennis Solares, the adult education coordinator at Los Angeles Pierce College, said that students seeking to improve their job opportunities drove the recent ESL enrollment growth.  
“We offer an opportunity that can help them communicate more, get acclimated with the community and get better jobs,” Solares said.
The classes attract a diverse swath of students. Azucena Hernandez, 42, enrolled in ESL at Palomar College in San Marcos so that she could better support her three kids with day-to-day tasks. She started as a monolingual Spanish speaker, but after several semesters she can comfortably have conversations in English.
Hernandez now volunteers in the beginner levels of ESL as a peer instructor. She said her most important takeaway from these courses is “the family made at school.”
“Every day we are learning something new, and there is companionship,” Hernandez said. “We are united to learn.”

Hernandez’s professor, Sheri Cully, has taught ESL for more than 40 years. She prioritizes civic engagement and real-world learning in her classes. One long-term project that her students work on is maintaining a community garden and advocating for its affordability and accessibility at local government meetings. Cully said she admires her students’ work ethic and resilience.
There were 30,000 more students enrolled in non-credit ESL courses across California’s community colleges during the 2023-24 academic year compared to the 2018-19 academic year, according to state data. The growth has been driven by several factors, including heightened demand for workforce training as the state’s economy expands and the college system’s push to expand ESL after the pandemic, according to a written statement to CalMatters from the California community college system’s chancellor’s office.
ESL courses bring state funding to community colleges based partially on enrollment, so several colleges have been working to continue this expansion after enrollment dropped during the pandemic. But student fears about immigration enforcement may thwart those efforts.  
Fears of ICE entering schools
An estimated 100,000 college students live in California without permanent legal status, and 3.3 million Californians live in mixed-status households, according to data from Equity Research Institute, a USC research group. Some of these students question whether coming to class is worth the risk of entering a public campus where ICE has access, and they have opted to take courses virtually. But not all students have access to a computer or Wi-Fi at home, and some older students may not be comfortable with the technology required for college courses.
Jessica Buchsbaum, the ESL department chair at City College of San Francisco, oversees a  program serving about 6,000 students, ranging from teenagers to octogenarians. She said the non-credit ESL enrollment was “growing intensely in the fall semester, but it has now softened.”
“We’ve definitely heard that students may be afraid to come to school,” Buchsbaum said. “In an environment when there’s so much hate directed at immigrants, we are here to serve this population. These are people who bring incredible energy and hope to our communities.”

In January, the Trump administration threw out policies implemented in 2011 that limited the ability of ICE agents to arrest people at churches, schools and other areas designated as “sensitive locations.” A statement from the Department of Homeland Security said the change was necessary so “criminals will no longer be able to hide in America’s schools and churches to avoid arrest.”  
California’s community colleges are public campuses, meaning they are limited by federal laws from attempting to prevent ICE agents from coming onto or near spaces that are generally considered open.
Over the years, the California community college system has supported immigrant students, such as offering Dream Resource Centers and connecting students with nonprofit legal services. The system has pointed college administrators to a 2017 state law that prohibits campus police departments from “generally providing personal information… about an individual for immigration enforcement purposes, including, but not limited to, the individual’s home address or work address, unless that information is available to the public.”
The chancellor’s office refused an interview request from CalMatters for this story. In a written statement, the office said, “The mission of the California Community Colleges is to educate and provide social and economic mobility to all Californians seeking to improve their workforce and workplace skills as well as improve their English language literacy.”
ESL professors provide support and students keep learning
Rachel Cerdenio is an ESL professor at Los Angeles Pierce College and the daughter of immigrants from the Philippines. She said the years she spent watching her parents struggle to navigate life in the United States without strong English skills spurred her to teach ESL.

For Cerdenio’s intermediate courses, she created a curriculum focused on connection to the college and student success. She recently assigned students to visit a campus resource like the student health center or the library, ask questions about it and share the information with their classmates.
“I wish my parents had the experiences that I am giving my students now,” Cerdenio said. “I want them to succeed, and I want them to be part of the campus and know about the resources that are here.”
Solares has given presentations in adult education courses, including Cerdenio’s classes, about immigrant students’ rights and the resources available to students, regardless of their immigration status.
“We had a huge influx of students, but with the change in politics students are naturally scared, and so there’s students who choose not to come to classes anymore,” Solares said. “The vibe is more tense. It’s more scary. But we support the students, and we equip the professors to support their students.”

(Jerod MacDonald-Evoy/Arizona Mirror)In submitting her updated budget proposal in March, Arizona Gov. Katie Hobbs lamented the rising costs of the state’s school vouchers program that directs public dollars to pay private school tuition.
Characterizing vouchers as an “entitlement program,” Hobbs said the state could spend more than $1 billion subsidizing private education in the upcoming fiscal year. The Democratic governor said those expenses could crowd out other budget priorities, including disability programs and pay raises for firefighters and state troopers.
It’s a dilemma that some budget experts fear will become more common nationwide as the costs of school choice measures mount across the states, reaching billions of dollars each year.
“School vouchers are increasingly eating up state budgets in a way that I don’t think is sustainable long term,” said Whitney Tucker, director of state fiscal policy research at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a think tank that advocates for left-leaning tax policies.
Vouchers and scholarship programs, which use taxpayer money to cover private school tuition, are part of the wider school choice movement that also includes charter schools and other alternatives to public schools.
Opponents have long warned about vouchers draining resources from public education as students move from public schools to private ones. But research into several programs has shown many voucher recipients already were enrolled in private schools. That means universal vouchers could drive up costs by creating two parallel education systems — both funded by taxpayers.










School vouchers are increasingly eating up state budgets in a way that I don't think is sustainable long term.


– Whitney Tucker, director of state fiscal policy research at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities


In Arizona, state officials reported most private school students receiving vouchers in the first two years of the expanded program were not previously enrolled in public schools. In fiscal year 2024, more than half the state’s 75,000 voucher recipients were previously enrolled in private schools or were being homeschooled.
“Vouchers don’t shift costs — they add costs,” Joshua Cowen, a professor of education policy at Michigan State University who studies the issue, recently told Stateline. “Most voucher recipients were already in private schools, meaning states are paying for education they previously didn’t have to fund.”
Voucher proponents, though, say those figures can be misleading. Arizona, like other states with recent expansions, previously had more modest voucher programs. So some kids who were already enrolled in private schools could have already been receiving state subsidies.
In addition to increasing competition, supporters say the programs can actually save taxpayer dollars by delivering education at a lower overall cost than traditional public schools.
One thing is certain: With a record number of students receiving subsidies to attend private schools, vouchers are quickly creating budget concerns for some state leaders.
The rising costs of school choice measures come after years of deep cuts to income taxes in many states, leaving them with less money to spend. An end of pandemic-era aid and potential looming cuts to federal support also have created widespread uncertainty about state budgets.
SD Senate rejects property tax credits for nonpublic education options

“We’re seeing a number of things that are creating a sort of perfect storm from a fiscal perspective in the states,” said Tucker, of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.
Last year, Arizona leaders waded through an estimated $1.3 billion budget shortfall. Budget experts said the voucher program was responsible for hundreds of millions of that deficit.
A new universal voucher program in Texas is expected to cost $1 billion over its next two-year budget cycle — a figure that could balloon to nearly $5 billion by 2030, according to a legislative fiscal note.
Earlier this year, Wyoming Republican Gov. Mark Gordon signed a bill expanding the state’s voucher program. But last week, he acknowledged his own “substantial concerns” about the state’s ability to fund vouchers and its public education obligations under the constitution.
“I think the legislature’s got a very tall task to understand how they’re going to be able to fund all of these things,” he said in an interview with WyoFile.
Voucher proponents, who have been active at the state level for years, are gaining new momentum with support from President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans.
In January, Trump ordered federal agencies to allow states, tribes and military families to access federal money for private K-12 education through education savings accounts, voucher programs or tax credits.
Last week, Republicans on the House Ways and Means Committee voted in favor of making $20 billion available over the next four years for a federal school voucher program. Part of broader work on a bill to extend Trump’s 2017 tax cuts, the measure would need a simple majority in the House and the Senate to pass.
Sweeping private school voucher program tucked inside U.S. House GOP tax bill

Martin Lueken, the director of the Fiscal Research and Education Center at EdChoice, a nonprofit that advocates for school choice measures, argues school choice measures can actually deliver savings to taxpayers.
Lueken said vouchers are not to blame for state budget woes. He said public school systems for years have increased spending faster than inflation. And he noted that school choice measures make up a small share of overall state spending — nationally about 0.3% of total state expenditures in states with school choice, he said.
“Public schooling remains one of the largest line items in state budgets,” he said in an interview. “They are still the dominant provider of K-12 education, and certainly looking at the education pie, they still receive the lion’s share.
“It’s not a choice problem. I would say that it’s a problem with the status quo and the public school system,” he said.
Washington, D.C., and 35 states offer some school choice programs, according to EdChoice. That includes 18 states with voucher programs so expansive that virtually all students can participate regardless of income.
But Lueken said framing vouchers as a new entitlement program is misleading. That’s because all students, even the wealthiest, have always been entitled to a public education — whether they’ve chosen to attend free public schools or private ones that charge tuition.
“At the end of the day, the thing that matters most above dollars are students and families,” he said. “Research is clear that competition works. Public schools have responded in very positive ways when they are faced with increased competitive pressure from choice programs.”
Public school advocates say funding both private and public schools is untenable.
Trump’s school choice push adds to momentum in statehouses

In Wisconsin, Republican lawmakers are considering a major voucher expansion that would alter the funding structure for vouchers, potentially putting more strain on the state’s general fund.
The state spent about $629 million on its four voucher programs during the 2024-2025 school year, according to the Wisconsin Association of School Business Officials, which represents employees in school district finance, human resources and leadership.
The association warns proposed legislation could exacerbate problems with the “unaffordable parallel school systems” in place now by shifting more private schooling costs from parents of those students to state taxpayers at large.
Such expansion “could create the conditions for even greater funding challenges for Wisconsin’s traditional public schools and the state budget as a whole,” the association’s research director wrote in a paper on the issue.
In Arizona, Hobbs originally sought to eliminate the universal voucher program — a nonstarter in the Republican-controlled legislature. She has since proposed shrinking the program by placing income limits that would disqualify the state’s wealthiest families.
That idea also faced Republican opposition.
Legislators are now pushing to enshrine access to vouchers in the state constitution.
Marisol Garcia, president of the Arizona Education Association, the state’s 20,000-member teachers union, noted that vouchers and public education funds are both sourced from the general fund.
“So it almost immediately started to impact public services,” she said of the universal voucher program.
While the union says vouchers have led to cutbacks of important resources such as counselors in public schools, Garcia said the sweeping program also affects the state’s ability to fund other services like housing, transportation and health care.
“Every budget cycle becomes where can we cut in order to essentially feed this out-of-control program?” she said.

(Photo: Trevor Bexon/Nevada Current)The Nevada State Legislature has only a fortnight remaining before it must gavel out, which means it’s crunch time for the hundreds of bills still trying to make it to Gov. Joe Lombardo’s desk.
Friday, May 16 marked the 103rd day of the session and the deadline by which most bills had to pass out of a committee. The bills subject to Friday’s deadline had already passed one chamber of the Legislature, meaning their next step is to get a floor vote in whichever chamber hasn’t already voted on it. The deadline for passing that full floor vote is this Friday, May 23.
Meanwhile, there is an avalanche of bills exempt from standard deadlines. Some of these bills are chugging along. Others are languishing in inaction and likely already dead inside, though their sponsors may still be holding out hope.
We know it’s a lot to follow, so here’s the Nevada Current’s status check on the dozens of noteworthy bills we have covered so far this session. We’ve included links to our previous coverage and links to the official legislative website where you can find out more about each bill.
This time around, we’ve broken out the bills that appear stuck in a budget committee. The rest of the bills are organized by subject. We’ve also added dates to give you a sense of how long each bill has been wherever it is.

 Bills stuck in budget committees

One common joke among the halls of the Legislature is that Senate Finance and Assembly Ways and Means are the committees where bills go to die. That may especially be true this year because of a souring economic outlook and the potential for major federal cuts causing further financial damage later this year.
Here’s a look at bills that have been referred to these budget committees and not seen recent action.

Senate Bill 54* would require the state’s Department of Health and Human Services to apply for a federal waiver and amend the state Medicaid plan to cover medical respite care for people experiencing homelessness. Referred to Senate Finance on April 21.
Senate Bill 172* (Sen. Edgar Flores, D) seeks to bolster protections for farm workers and amend overtime pay laws to include agriculture workers. Referred to Senate Finance on April 16.

Senate Bill 391* (State Sen. Dina Neal, D) would establish a corporate landlord registry and cap purchasing power for corporate owners. Referred to Senate Finance on April 21.
Senate Bill 431* would apply the state’s live entertainment tax to tickets resold by third-party vendors and dedicate some funding to transit. Referred to Senate Finance on April 21.
Assembly Bill 191* (Assemblymember Natha Anderson, D) would give graduate assistants the right to collectively bargain for better pay and conditions. Referred to Assembly Ways and Means on April 14.

 Headed to Lombardo’s desk

As of Monday afternoon, only four bills had actually made it to the governor’s desk — a bill funding the session, a bill covering a budget shortfall in the Secretary of State’s Office, a bill designating Jan. 27 as International Holocaust Remembrance Day, and the “emergency egg bill” designed to help reduce egg prices. Lombardo signed them all.
However, four bills have passed both chambers and should soon head to Lombardo. Most prominently: Assembly Bill 530, which would allow the Clark County Commission to extend fuel revenue indexing (FRI) an additional decade beyond its current sunset date.
The bill passed both chambers with bipartisan support. The Senate vote on May 12 was 14 yeas, 6 nays. Republicans Ira Hansen and John Steinbeck voted with Democrats in support. (Democrat James Ohrenschall was excused.) The Assembly vote in April was 39 yeas, 3 nays. Republicans Jill Dickman, Danielle Gallant, and Gregory Hafen were opposed.
Lombardo vetoed a similar bill in 2023. Once AB530 formally arrives at his desk, he will have 5 days to sign or veto.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/03-27-2023-Nevada-Legislature-73-scaled-e1680489664606-1024x652.jpg,,,2025-05-20 09:02:39.074162

(Photo by Eesha Pendharkar/ Maine Morning Star)Democratic U.S. Rep. Jared Golden will run for a fifth term representing Maine’s 2nd Congressional District. 
There has been speculation that the former Marine could make a run for the Blaine House. He said in the campaign announcement Tuesday that he “considered many options for how best to continue serving the people of Maine.” However, he believes “the surest way to restore balance in Washington is for Democrats to win back the House of Representatives.”
“I also know the path to the majority runs through Maine,” he added. 
Last November, his race against Republican Austin Theriault drew national attention as the majority party looked to regain the seat that covers a broad, rural stretch of the state. The National Republican Congressional Committee has already said it is targeting Golden’s seat in the 2026 election as a “prime pick-up opportunity.” 
With the election 18 months away, Golden said he is focused on his current responsibilities to his constituents and family. When he isn’t in Washington, Golden lives in Lewiston with his wife and two daughters. 
Former Gov. Paul LePage announced earlier this month that he will be seeking the Republican nomination to run for the 2nd District. 
Golden, who often votes across party lines, said he is “going to do what it takes to make sure no one like Paul LePage blusters his way into Congress.”
During his last reelection campaign, Golden wrote an op-ed that drew pushback from members of his own party for saying that if elected he would work with President Donald Trump. 
Though he stands with his party on reproductive rights, environmental protections and labor, Golden has supported more funding for the construction of the U.S.-Mexico border wall as well as U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. He also backed a Republican measure to require voters to provide proof of U.S. citizenship when registering to vote, something Democrats have said will suppress turnout, and has been a strong supporter of tariffs and said in early April that he was pleased Trump is “building his tariff agenda on the foundation of a universal 10% tariff like” Golden himself has proposed. 
During debates last fall with Theriault, Golden defended his change of heart to support a ban on assault weapons after the October 2023 shooting in Lewiston.

(Alex Cochran for Alabama Reflector)The account of what happened during a 2018 incident between an incarcerated man and three Alabama Department of Corrections (ADOC) officers at Donaldson Correctional Facility differs according to the parties involved.
But the results are inarguable.
The prisoner was rushed to UAB hospital with multiple injuries, including broken ribs, broken vertebrae and a collapsed lung, according to findings by a U.S. magistrate judge.


 
May 19: The Alabama Department of Corrections has settled over 90 lawsuits alleging corrections officers used excessive force, costing the state millions of dollars.
May 20: Even as the prison population has declined, use of force incidents in Alabama’s prisons have soared. and some corrections officers named in lawsuits alleging excessive force involved have not only held onto jobs, but been promoted.
May 21: The anatomy of one inmate’s allegations against a corrections officer, and the aftermath.
May 22: Who’s paying for these settlements? You are. Who’s getting the most money from this litigation? Attorneys defending corrections officers.


The injured man spent three nights in the hospital. In 2020, he sued the three officers for excessive force. The officers didn’t deny that they’d used force, but denied that it was excessive.
ADOC’s internal use of force report about the incident noted that the prisoner weighed 145 pounds, and one of the officers involved — the one who kneeled on the prisoner’s back — weighed about 300 pounds.
The officers said that the prisoner had refused an order to enter a cell. One officer then sprayed him with a chemical agent called “Sabre Red.” They said the prisoner then refused to lie down. So another officer “took him to the floor,” and the prisoner “continued to resist and engage in combative behavior.” This version of the story was used to justify the 300-pound officer “forcefully” kneeling on the man’s back, sending him to the hospital.
The ADOC supervisor who investigated the incident concluded that the use of force was necessary.
“Officers used a minimum amount of force to gain control of the situation,” he wrote in his report.
In 2021, U.S. Magistrate Judge Herman N. Johnson determined the evidence could support a finding of excessive force, and wrote the officers’ statements “cannot be reconciled with plaintiff’s verified claim that he was already handcuffed and that offers beat him, as assessed in combination with the extent of his injuries.”
Lawyers from the Alabama’s Attorney General’s Office representing the three officers negotiated a settlement of the case for $40,000, one of 94 settlements paid in excessive force claims against ADOC officers since 2020.
ADOC would not comment on specific lawsuits against officers. The Alabama Attorney General’s Office, which handles litigation involving ADOC, did not respond to multiple requests for comment.
The consistent details inside the recent surge in complaints against ADOC officers mirror the DOJ’s conclusion in 2020 that the state’s seeming indifference in addressing and preventing uses of force in its prisons “fosters a culture where unlawful uses of force are common.”
And despite a prison population with 4,000 fewer incarcerated people than a decade ago, uses of force inside the prisons have increased 47% during that time, according to ADOC’s own internal data.

The highest number of incidents, 2,659 across the entire system, was reported in 2020. Beginning in March 2020, ADOC facilities were locked down because of COVID, with limited movement, and no outside visits or educational programs.

ADOC does not report use of force statistics publicly, but the Reflector obtained the data through an open records request. Three maximum-security prisons reported more than 300 use of force incidents, an all-time high, in 2020. Donaldson Correctional Facility in Bessemer reported 348. Limestone Correctional Facility in Harvest reported 308, and Tutwiler Prison for Women in Wetumpka 329.
“So much of this violence by officers is senseless and unnecessary,” said former ADOC Warden David Wise, who retired from the agency in 2010 after working in the prisons for 28 years. “There’s not a convict in that system that if he refuses an order, that I can’t put in a cell without hurting him.”

Use of force vs. excessive force

ADOC policy around use of force is governed by an administrative regulation that the agency will not release publicly, but the Reflector obtained a copy.
Correctional officers are allowed to use physical force against men and women in Alabama prisons as a means of control. Force can include the use of batons, chemical sprays or electronic devices like tasers, or physical control defined as “the use of empty-hand techniques to gain control and compliance of resistance and/or combative subject.” The DOJ defines empty-hand techniques as “takedowns” unlikely to cause injury, and can include strikes or kicks.
But DOJ drew a distinction between legal uses of force that may be justified in a prison setting and ADOC’s large number of incidents it deemed unjustified under the legal standard.
In findings sent to Alabama leaders in July 2020, the DOJ said that excessive force was “used frequently” in 12 of the state’s 13 major correctional facilities for men. The report cited 17 specific incidents, as well as two that ended in deaths.
The state has argued the DOJ’s lawsuit was based on “vague and conclusory allegations” and denied the findings.
“An excessive force claim requires allegations plausibly suggesting that officials applied force ‘maliciously and sadistically for the very purpose of causing harm,’” wrote William Lunsford, the lead attorney representing the state in a motion asking the court to dismiss the lawsuit. “Plaintiff’s barebones allegations fall far short of this standard.”
Former ADOC Warden Wise said officers are trained to use the minimum force necessary, and could de-escalate almost every situation by just using their voice.
“Ninety percent of the time, that’s how I got out of coming to blows with inmates. I talked to them, reasoned with them,” he explained. “I also let them know real quick that there was no way they were going to win. Usually, if you let him think about that for a minute, he’ll do what’s right. Every once in a while you come across an inmate acting like Hercules, but that’s very rare.”

According to ADOC’s use of force policy, officers are allowed to use physical force if a prisoner is aggressive, for self-defense, the protection of others and property, to prevent escape, quell a disturbance or “when an inmate exercises physical resistance to a lawful command.”
Wise said that last justification, when an incarcerated person disobeys a lawful command, is where some officers push the bounds of what’s legal and necessary.
“Some of them take that to say, ‘OK, well you disobeyed my command. I can whoop your ass.’ That’s not the way it’s supposed to go,” he said. “If they use proper strategy and do what they’re taught in the academy, there should be very few incidents and lawsuits.”

Repeat offenders

The largest excessive force settlement paid since 2020 was in a lawsuit filed by the mother of Steven Davis, whose son was beaten to death by a group of officers, including Roderick Gadson, who was promoted to lieutenant after Davis’ death.
An internal investigation determined the officers’ use of force was justified because they said Davis brandished two prison-made weapons and did not comply with their demands to drop the weapons. Some witnesses disputed this account, saying that officers continued to beat Davis after he dropped the weapons.
The Alabama Attorney General’s Office declined to press criminal charges against the officers and the state never admitted wrongdoing. But attorneys for the officers agreed to a $250,000 settlement in August 2024.
Another case with Gadson at the center involved a beating incident in the same cell block of Donaldson prison in which Davis was killed, three months before his death. The victim, who survived, was taken to UAB hospital via ambulance with multiple injuries, including a broken leg and nose, and fractures in his hand that required surgery. Lawyers representing ADOC agreed to settle that case for $10,000.
A review of liability trust fund data and court records identified 10 officers at the center of excessive force lawsuits that settled after 2020 who are still working for the agency, according to payment records available in the Open Alabama checkbook database maintained by the Department of Finance. ADOC confirmed  employment of the 10 officers as of March 6, 2025.
Gadson is one of five officers identified in this review who was promoted after being named in an excessive force lawsuit leading to a large settlement.
Messages seeking comment on Gadson were sent to the Alabama Attorney General’s Office and Steven Herndon, an attorney who represented Gadson in the Steven Davis civil suit.
Attempts to reach Gadson directly were unsuccessful.

Accountability

David Gespass, an attorney who has represented incarcerated people in litigation against ADOC, views the agency’s excessive force problem as one in which “repeater beater” officers are not held accountable, even when these officers are sued repeatedly for harming prisoners.
“They get defended,” Gespass said. “They don’t have to pay for defense. They don’t have to pay if there’s liability found, so the problem is that ADOC just doesn’t do anything about these guys.”










They get defended. They don't have to pay for defense. They don't have to pay if there's liability found, so the problem is that ADOC just doesn't do anything about these guys.


– David Gespass, attorney


In response to the question of what actions ADOC takes when multiple excessive force lawsuits are filed against an officer, ADOC’s spokesperson Kelly Betts wrote that the agency keeps a close eye on litigation, and that “trends are monitored and discussed with the appropriate stakeholders.”
She said ADOC investigates all uses of force and if there is a question about whether the force was justified, the case is presented to a “use of force review board,” which ADOC established in 2024.
Betts wouldn’t name review board members, but said the board includes all ranks of security staff and meets “as necessary.” Consequences of the reviews follow “State Personnel’s progressive discipline guidelines” and Betts wrote that cases constituting criminal acts are handled by ADOC’s Law Enforcement Services Division and referred to the local district attorney for prosecution.
But Betts could not say how many referrals ADOC has made to prosecutors in excessive force cases. “ADOC does not currently track that data,” she wrote in response to a request for the number of cases sent to the local district attorney since 2020.

Litigation process

The 1996 federal Prison Litigation Reform Act or PLRA sought to curtail unnecessary or frivolous prison lawsuits by severely restricting the ability for prisoners to file any claim. It made it much more challenging for incarcerated people to succeed in court, and resulted in a sharp decline in lawsuits filed over prison conditions.
Still, prisons are litigious environments. Incarcerated people across the nation file civil rights complaints against officers and prison staff, but 80% of such cases filed in 2021 resulted in a pre-trial decision in favor of the defendants, according to data compiled by University of Michigan Law Professor Margo Schlanger for IncarcerationLaw.com.
A lawsuit will typically only reach settlement after passing complicated procedural requirements, and then passing a court’s scrutiny to not dismiss the case for lacking a plausible claim.
Several attorneys who have represented incarcerated Alabamaians said in the last few years, courts are dismissing fewer excessive force complaints at the preliminary stages because of the extent of the injuries, and because of video evidence from prison surveillance cameras.
Betts said settling a case is not an admission of wrongdoing.
“Cases may settle for a multitude of reasons, the most common one being the cost of continued litigation and/or trial,” Betts wrote in an email response to questions about the record number of excessive force settlements. “Often, a settlement is reached to save taxpayer money. It’s usually cheaper to settle than it is to take a case all the way to trial.”
But former ADOC Warden Wise said the record number of excessive force cases resulting in paid settlements should be a red flag to leaders in Montgomery.
“You should have enough confidence to be able to, even when there is a lawsuit, defend it, not settle it,” Wise said. “And the system needs that money, not for lawsuits, it needs that money to make it better.”

(Getty Images)Five years after medical cannabis became available in Utah after being legalized by voters, the program, while still controversial, keeps on growing. This year, the state counted over 100,000 medical cannabis card holders, a new peak in the program’s five-year existence.
Members of the Utah Patients Coalition, a plant medicine advocacy group which lobbied hard to help pass the 2018 referendum that allowed the medical cannabis program in deeply conservative Utah, see the milestone as a demonstration that the system to obtain a card is getting easier to navigate. 
Even now that a major 2025 cannabis bill has gone into effect and eliminated a system that allowed for a cheaper, more accessible way to obtain a card, the group remains hopeful for the future of medical cannabis in the state.

“The growth in 2025 has been encouraging, just because we have seen a lot of patients struggling in the past. And every year we go back to the legislative session, we go back to our platforms with education, and just try to remove some of those barriers,” Desiree Hennessy, executive director at the Utah Patients Coalition, said on Monday.
One of the 2025 general session’s routine bipartisan medical cannabis bills, sponsored by Minority Whip Jennifer Dailey-Provost, D-Salt Lake City, and Sen. Evan Vickers, R-Cedar City, went through several iterations and proposed allowing more medical cannabis pharmacies in the state. But, it didn’t make it to a vote on the Senate floor, ultimately failing. 
However, SB64, another bill sponsored by Vickers, passed, containing a provision that Utah Patients Coalition considered “a heartbreaking loss.” 
Up until this month, pharmacies were allowed to partner with clinics that have medical providers qualified to prescribe medicinal cannabis to host “card drives,” a sort of pop-up clinic in pharmacies’ parking lots in which doctors could see patients and issue cards, often at a discount. 
Those partnerships allowed cards, which are good for up to a year, to go from a regular $200 to about $75, Hennessy said.



Let us know what you think...


 


“This year, we lost the ability to allow pharmacies to do that. So now no longer can somebody write a card within 500 feet of a pharmacy unless they’re in their own business,” she said. “And so it’s really not going to hurt anybody that’s middle class or higher, but these patients struggling with finances that used these card drives.”
That was one of the last additions to Vickers’ bill. He explained on the Senate floor that the bill’s authors didn’t feel like the pop-ups were appropriate, and patients should be going to a doctor’s office for medical advice.
“If someone is a qualified medical professional, they can’t go to a pop-up tent in front of the marijuana pharmacy to give cards. We want to make sure that we are not producing a recreational environment,” SB64’s House floor sponsor, Rep. Walt Brooks, R-St George, told House members about the change.   
But, with that loss, also came some flexibility on who gets to recommend medical cannabis to a patient. Now, medical providers who are licensed to prescribe controlled substances can recommend the treatment, which according to a Department of Health and Human Services April report is mostly used to treat pain. 
According to Hennessy, that change would improve patient accessibility. 
“Patients can go to their regular care physician, hopefully not get charged any more than a co-pay, and have this medical cannabis conversation with their doctor,” she said. 
While advocates celebrate the numbers, the program remains a contentious point among Utahns, with some still protesting the annual technical bills, arguing that the state shouldn’t allow cannabis at all.
But, ultimately, Hennessy hopes that medical cannabis patients get to be treated like those receiving any other treatment. Especially, she said, since the program has been demonstrated to lower rates of opioid use and opioid-related deaths, according to a study by Management Science Associates in partnership with Dragonfly Wellness, a medical cannabis pharmacy. 
“We do believe that there’s a lot of good that can come out of using medical cannabis as a first-line drug, and not as a second or third or fourth when everything else fails,” Hennessy said, “but we could use this first and treat a lot of conditions with a lot less risk than other medications that patients are now using.”

Snow melt from the Rocky Mountains contributes about 85% of the total water flow in the Colorado River, but those flows will likely be lower than usual this summer, according to federal data. 
Across the Rocky Mountains the snow season had a strong start, then came one of the driest winters on record, followed by rapid snow melt that bodes poorly for river flow in the summer.
Mountain ranges across the Rockies didn’t reach peak snowpack in April, and only hit about 63% of average peaks. 
With less snow, runoff into Lake Powell is expected to be cut nearly in half this year, according to the Colorado Basin River Forecast Center. Water levels in Lake Powell, the nation’s second largest reservoir, directly impact Lake Mead because streamflow to Lake Powell is eventually released to Lake Mead.
Combined storage in Lake Powell and Lake Mead is down 920,000 acre-feet from this time last year, or enough water to supply about 1.8 million single-family homes for a year. 
 A “dreadful winter” means a high likelihood of “extreme and exceptional drought” is in store for areas of Southern Nevada, according to the Nevada Water Supply Outlook prepared by the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Natural Resources Conservation Service.
“In 2023 it was a great runoff year with a really big snow pack. But we’re not going to see anything like that this year,” said Jeff Anderson, a USDA hydrologist and water supply specialist.
Water supply estimates for the seven Colorado River Basin states were reduced in April after rapid and early snowmelt wiped out snowpack in the region.
Rapid snow melt across Utah, Colorado, and New Mexico, pushed some basins from above-average snowpack to snow drought conditions in under a month, with snow disappearing up to four weeks early, according to the U.S. Drought Monitor. 
“The snow pack has melted much quicker than normal,” Anderson said. “It dropped much quicker than the normal drops.”
“Oftentimes the snow packs don’t start to melt as early as they started this year. It’s like a locomotive. Once the snow pack absorbs enough energy from the sun and from the temperature and starts to melt, it’s very difficult to stop that process,” he said. 
As snowpack melts, it recharges ecosystems and replenishes reservoirs that provide drinking water for millions of people and irrigation water for millions of acres of farmland. But early melt means water leaves the region before the summer when it’s most needed. The quicker snow melts the more likely it is to evaporate too. 
Less snowmelt making its way to the Colorado River is part of a larger trend. Colorado River streamflow has shrunk by about 20% since 2000, with further declines projected due to climate change.
Stalled talks and a problematic pipeline
The seven Colorado River Basin states that depend on the river’s water are currently working on setting rules for sharing a dwindling water supply after 2026, when current operating guidelines are set to expire.
But negotiations over water allotments in the country’s two largest reservoirs, Lake Powell and Lake Mead, have stalled.
Two consecutive winters with robust snowpacks gave states that rely on the Colorado River a few more years of stability, but with a dismal water year approaching tensions appear to be growing.
Colorado River negotiators — one from each of the seven states that use Colorado River water — will not be speaking at a major water law conference in June, despite having appeared together at the conference for the last few years.
That divide has come up at the other annual appearances, too. In December, negotiators opted to split into two separate panels at the Colorado River Water Users Association conference in Las Vegas after appearing together for years.
The two camps – the Upper Basin states of Colorado, Utah, Wyoming and New Mexico, and the Lower Basin states of California, Arizona and Nevada – have been at an impasse since March after submitting two competing proposals for managing the river.
One of the biggest sticking points between the two basins is whether or not Upper Basin states should absorb mandatory water cuts during dry years, despite using significantly less than their 7.5 million acre-feet Colorado River allocation year-after-year.
Historically, Lower Basin states have used nearly all their 7.5 million acre-feet Colorado River allocation under the 1922 Colorado River Compact, while Upper Basin states use about 4.5 million acre-feet annually, significantly less than their total allocation.
Lower Basin states argued all seven states should share water cuts during dry years under the new post-2026 guidelines. If they don’t, downstream states warned they could face water cuts they can’t feasibly absorb.
If the states can reach an agreement by May, then the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation can consider the proposal as part of its longer process. In the absence of a seven-state agreement on how to manage the basin’s water supply, the Bureau of Reclamation would move forward with its own management options.
Bronson Mack, a public outreach coordinator for the Southern Nevada Water Authority, said Nevada’s Colorado River negotiator, John Entsminger, is actively attending closed-door meetings and working towards compromise. However, details from those meetings have been scant.
Another fissure among states appeared after House Republicans approved a last-minute amendment to sell off nearly 11,000 acres of public land in Utah that appears to follow the pathway of the planned Lake Powell pipeline, a decades-long and highly controversial attempt by Utah to pipe water from Lake Powell.
In a joint statement, U.S. Representatives Greg Stanton (D-Ariz.) and Susie Lee (D-Nev.) said they were “alerted by Arizona and Nevada water managers that the public land to be sold in Utah could be used to develop” the controversial water pipeline from Lake Powell to Washington County, Utah.
The office of Utah Republican Rep. Celeste Maloy – who proposed the amendment – denied the allegation, as did the Washington County Water Conservancy District, which pointed to a detailed list of intended uses for the proposed land disposal, including water projects, public infrastructure, housing, recreation and an airport expansion.
That reasoning doesn’t fly with some of the state’s public land and environmental advocates, including Kyle Roerink, executive director of the Great Basin Water Network.
“There are quite a few striking similarities,” Roerink said. “We believe that this is much more than a coincidence.”
The project has yet to clear several federal hurdles, and needs a new environmental impact statement — officials in the area say the project is no longer a priority.
Roerink noted that Utah officials have also not ruled out the Lake Powell Pipeline and have continued to pursue the paper water rights that the pipeline would feed.
“This throws an even bigger wrench in a situation that is already rife with conflict, and it underscores that some states continue to believe that water exists, when in reality, we all know it doesn’t,” Roerink said.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/DSC00097-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-20 08:01:40.314515

She had lost her home, her car and her job. Her two children had moved in with other family members.
“I didn’t have nothing. Everything that I had within those two weeks of coming home was what I found in donation bins,” recalled Lariz, who was incarcerated for three years. She added: “I was so worried about, ‘How am I going to get to these different programs? Where am I going to sleep at?’”
  Karina Lariz received cash assistance through a nonprofit program upon her release from a California prison. (Photo courtesy of Karina Lariz)
After her release, Lariz spent two days at a motel before moving into a transitional home. She also participated in a job training program.
Then came an unexpected lifeline: direct cash payments through a nonprofit program called the Returning Citizens Stimulus. It’s run by the Center for Employment Opportunities, an organization that offers reentry support and services to formerly incarcerated people in 28 cities.
With the money, Lariz, 35, was able to buy clothes for job interviews, cover groceries and public transportation fare, and begin rebuilding her life and relationships. The money, totaling nearly $2,500 over three payments, helped her gain footing in the weeks following her release — a period often marked by high risk of recidivism and reincarceration.
“It liberated a lot of stress,” she said.
Now, a new independent evaluation of the initiative suggests that short-term aid may have positive long-term effects. The study comes as some states are considering whether direct financial support is an effective — or appropriate — tool for reducing recidivism.
In 2022, Lariz landed a job with the very organization that helped fund her reentry. She now works as a program associate on the organizing team at the Center for Employment Opportunities, where she helps others leaving prison.
Nearly four years after her release, Lariz is married and again living with her two children.
“If I didn’t have that support, I would have not pushed myself to do half of the things that I did,” Lariz said.
‘They change each other’: For 20 years, SC inmates have helped train racehorses

She is one of more than 10,000 formerly incarcerated people across 28 cities who received support through the Center for Employment Opportunities’ stimulus program, which launched in April 2020.
The national organization works with local agencies to distribute up to $2,750 in cash over 60 days, contingent on participants completing basic milestones, such as creating a resume or attending a job readiness workshop. More than 80% of participants complete their milestones and receive the full payments.
People leaving prison often face staggering rates of joblessness, homelessness and food insecurity. Most program participants used the funds to cover food, rent, utilities or public transportation fare. Some participants also used the money to pay off credit card and medical debt.
“The basics of survival are this acute challenge in those early days of reentry, and then you layer on that sort of the big structural challenges,” said Sam Schaeffer, the executive director and CEO of the Center for Employment Opportunities. “Just putting food on the table, just getting to work, just getting that set of interview clothes is so critical.”
The new study supports that assessment.
According to the study — which was conducted by MDRC, a research organization focusing on poverty reduction — participants were significantly less likely to violate parole than peers who did not receive payments. Within the first six months after release, parole violations fell by more than 41%, with violent parole violations dropping by 64%. The study evaluated the outcomes of people who were released in 2020 in Los Angeles and Alameda counties in California.



South Carolina’s falling re-entry rate
The center does not operate a program in South Carolina, which has a recidivism rate that’s among the nation’s lowest. Fewer than 1 in 5 inmates return to prison within three years of release, according to the state Department of Corrections.
The state’s three-year return rate used to hover at roughly one-third.
Former prisons Director Bryan Stirling, who last month was sworn in as acting U.S. attorney, has recounted that when he took the helm of Corrections in 2013, people who completed their sentence were simply dropped off at the bus station in their prison uniform.
Eight years later, state officials touted being a national leader in fewer felons returning.
The rate has continued to fall since. In 2024, South Carolina’s rate remained the lowest among states that report three-year re-incarceration numbers, according to an annual report from Virginia’s prisons agency.
Officials attribute the Palmetto State’s improvement to programs that help people re-enter society. But that does not include cash payments.
Instead, the state has expanded job training and work programs in prison — which allow inmates to earn income and save for rent while still incarcerated — and partnered with community groups that help them adjust upon release. That includes lining up free transitional housing and reconnecting inmates to family.
In February, a coalition of historically Black colleges announced an expansion of a program that allows people to earn a degree while they’re incarcerated in South Carolina.
People also leave prison with a month’s supply of their prescription medications and the ability to easily get refills, which is vital for both their medical and mental health. Without their medications, they’re more likely to struggle and reoffend, said Department of Corrections spokeswoman Chrysti Shain.
While recidivism rates are reported differently by states, which can make direct comparisons misleading, South Carolina’s figures certainly show the state’s own record has improved.
Between July 2011 and June 2024, the state’s average daily prison population fell from about 22,900 inmates to 16,300, according to Corrections’ latest accountability report.

Roughly 77 million Americans — or about 1 in 3 adults — have a criminal record, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. That includes records of arrests, charges and criminal convictions. Formerly incarcerated people often face stigma and major barriers in the job market.
They also often return home without savings or financial resources and earn less than half as much as peers who have never been incarcerated over their careers, according to a 2020 report by the Brennan Center for Justice, a left-leaning law and policy institute at the New York University School of Law.
 Legislation and pilot programs

A bill introduced in the New York legislature earlier this year would create a reentry fund to offer cash payments of $425 each month for up to six months for eligible residents leaving prison. The bill has been stalled in committee since January and is unlikely to pass before the legislature adjourns in June.
Some critics say that the proposed New York program is a redundant and unrestricted handout for people with criminal records, and question whether limited public safety funds should support individuals already eligible for state services, including Medicaid, food assistance, job placement programs and housing aid.
“This is just one more element of what is an overall theme by the Democrats here in Albany to coddle criminals and put their priorities over the priorities of victims and law-abiding citizens,” New York state Sen. George Borrello, a Republican, told Stateline.
‘Transformative’: More college programs are slowly coming into prisons

This isn’t the first time states have considered offering stipends to people leaving prison.
Most recently, legislators in Colorado in 2024 and North Carolina in 2023 proposed bills that would have provided monthly payments to formerly incarcerated individuals.
Neither bill made it out of its originating chamber, but both bills proposed up to $3,000 in support.
In Colorado, the pilot program would have offered money for basic living expenses to those who enrolled in workforce training programs following incarceration in a state facility.
In North Carolina, the proposal would have provided monthly stipends for housing, food, clothing and transportation for up to six months after release.
Similar pilot cash assistance programs have launched in New Haven, Connecticut; Gainesville, Florida; and Philadelphia.
The Gainesville program, which ran from January 2022 to February 2023, had 115 participants. They received $1,000 in the first month, followed by monthly payments of $600.
An impact report released in February found that participants experienced greater financial security, reduced mental stress and lower rates of recidivism.
 Potential savings

In 2022 — the most recent year with available data from the federal Bureau of Justice Statistics and the U.S. Census Bureau’s annual survey of state and local government finances — state governments spent $58 billion to incarcerate more than 1 million people in state facilities.
How many inmates return to prison? Inconsistent reporting makes it hard to tell.

Forty-four percent of all state prison admissions in 2021 were people who violated the terms of their parole or probation sentences, according to a 2024 report by the Council of State Governments Justice Center. On any given day, 1 in 4 people in state prison were incarcerated due to supervision violations — costing states more than $10 billion collectively.
Some critics maintain that the most effective way to prevent crime is to punish those who break the law.
“We do not do enough to hold people accountable,” said Borrello, the New York state senator who opposes the bill that would create a reentry fund in his state. “I really don’t give any credence to [supporters’] thoughts on whether or not they think this is going to save money down the road.”
For people such as Karina Lariz, though, the impact is personal and profound.
“I’ve been able to redefine and find who I am today, like the real Karina — not the Karina that grew up in trauma and all the problems that I had before incarceration,” she said.

(Brian Lyman/Alabama Reflector)A bill that would have made it easier for parents to exempt their children from vaccine requirements failed to advance out of the Alabama Legislature this year.
SB 85, sponsored by Sen. Arthur Orr, R-Decatur, would have allowed parents to claim religious exemptions from vaccines for their children without requiring them to state a reason. The bill would have also required public colleges and universities to provide medical and religious exemptions to vaccine or testing requirements.
But despite the bill’s failure to become law, one lawmaker said he’s committed to reintroducing the bill and feels confident it will pass in the next session.
“I plan to bring it back and continue to fight. We’re going to keep chipping away until we feel like we’ve got our liberties back,” said Rep. Mack Butler, R-Rainbow City, who introduced a companion bill in the House, in a phone interview Monday.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The bill would have allowed parents or guardians to object to vaccination or testing requirements by submitting a written statement stating that the vaccination or testing conflicts with their religion as valid grounds for exemption from any school enrollment vaccine or testing requirement. It also specified that no additional forms, fees or documentation could be required of the parent, guardian or child for enrollment in any public K-12 school. The bill would have also extended these provisions to public colleges and universities.
Alabama’s measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) vaccination rate among kindergartners was 93.8% in the 2023-2024 school year, under the 95% rate set by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to achieve herd immunity. An ongoing outbreak in West Texas that started with two unvaccinated school-age children in January has now spread to at least 29 other states.
Orr said in a phone interview Friday that an amendment added by Sen. Bobby Singleton, D-Greensboro, which he said proponents of the bill did not like, likely kept the bill from advancing in the House. The amendment would have required a student claiming a vaccine exemption to submit a board-approved physical evaluation form or the Alabama High School Athletic Association’s Preparticipation Physical Education form, but it did not have an enforcement mechanism or sanctions for not submitting the form.
“Among the proponents, they were not happy with the Singleton amendment put on in the Senate,” Orr said. “And among the opponents, they still want to stay with the status quo, which is a bit unnecessary, in my opinion.”
Orr added that the House seemed reluctant to take up controversial bills toward the end of the session, adding that Butler would have to be asked for the specific reasons the bill didn’t make it to the House floor.
The bill passed the House Health Committee two weeks before the session ended, giving it enough time to be considered by the House, but Butler said that tension between the House and Senate toward the end of the session only allowed a number of priority bills to be passed.
“I don’t think it was a priority either. The Back-the-Blue (package) was the big priority there at the last minute, which we did get across, but we have got to do a better job of waiting until the last minute on everything,” Butler said.
Apriell Hartsfield, Kids Count director for VOICES for Alabama Children, who opposed the bill in its House committee hearing, said Monday that she was concerned about the potential impact on children’s health and safety if similar legislation becomes law in the future. 
She said that declining vaccination rates can threaten community health, potentially leading to outbreaks and increased risk for everyone. She added that fewer vaccinated people lead to a higher risk for others, especially those who are immunocompromised or too young to be fully immunized.
“Our biggest concern are the most vulnerable of the children, and those are the children who are immunocompromised, so that they cannot, medically and for health reasons, get the immunizations, and then, of course, the youngest children, those who are too young to be fully immunized,” Hartsfield said.
She said the existing process already allows parents to claim a religious exemption for required vaccines, and safeguards are in place to help public health officials address outbreaks effectively.
Butler said he was concerned about the alleged adverse effects of vaccines, particularly the COVID-19 vaccine, saying that “we’re seeing so much, so many adverse effects from mainly the COVID vaccine, and now they’re still pushing that out.” While rare adverse reactions related to the COVID-19 vaccine have been reported, such as anaphylaxis or myocarditis, the vaccine is considered safe, and these reactions are significantly less common than the severe health risks of a COVID-19 illness.
Hartsfield said that discussions on the COVID-19 vaccine and school-required immunizations shouldn’t be grouped together and that it’s essential that parents and guardians understand the decades of research behind immunizations required in schools. She said that parents can’t truly make an informed decision “if we are reducing not just the accessibility to the vaccinations, but the accessibility to the information.”
“A lot of the misinformation that’s out there, a lot of these things have been debunked over and over and again. It is the right of the parent to choose, but I think it’s important that parents know what they’re choosing, and that is where public health helps with that,” she said.
Hartsfield also pointed to the economic impact that limiting vaccine access could have on the state and communities, saying that non-immunized children exposed to measles must be out for 21 days, which could impact working families. She also said that a measles outbreak or even a single case in a child care setting, which already faces challenges, could force closures.
“Alabama is right in the middle of states that have outbreaks. We don’t have one yet, but as Dr. Scott Harris has said, it’s really not a matter of if but when this is going to happen in Alabama,” she said. 
There were 1,024 confirmed measles cases across 30 states as of May 15, according to the CDC, where 96% of individuals are unvaccinated or have unknown vaccination status.

(Ralph Chapoco/Alabama Reflector)A group of judges, legislators and agency staff will explore ways to fund the state’s court system in lieu of relying on fines and fees imposed by the courts.
Members of the Court Cost Task Force convened the first meeting on Monday at the Alabama Supreme Court to review possible alternative funding streams to pay expenses for a court system that has been chronically underfunded.
“Most court costs, which you will see in just a minute, are going to non-court entities,” said Sarah Hicks Stewart, chief justice of the Alabama Supreme Court, who presided over the meeting. “By that, I mean non-judicial branch people. The vast majority of court costs are not going to court.”

Non-court entities are receiving their funding from the fines imposed by the courts that are not tied to the state’s criminal legal system, Stewart said.
The group plans to issue a report near the start of the 2026 legislative session in January outlining recommendations to the Legislature to mitigate the issues that arise when courts impose fines and fees on individuals who need access to the courts.
Courts receive a significant portion of their operational expenses from fines and fees that judges impose. But the revenues collected go to pay for programs that are not necessarily tied to the court system.
Revenues that are disbursed to agencies are also not enough to cover the full cost of operating and must rely on other sources. Fines and fees also disproportionately affect the state’s most vulnerable populations.
According to data obtained from the Alabama State Bar website, courts collected about $480 million from court fines and fees imposed by the courts. Of that, about $26.5 million went on to pay for expenses for court operations.
The majority, about $312 million or 67%, went to third parties. Some of it is in the form of restitution for criminal cases. About $160 million went to judgments while another $118 million was disbursed toward the Alabama Central Disbursement Division Child Support Unit to process child support payments. Almost $1.5 million went toward child support payments.
About $126 million are disbursed to non-court expenses, such as the General Fund budget, which receives money from sales taxes from the internet. According to the Alabama State Bar Association’s website, the General Fund budget receives almost $75 million of the fines and fees that are paid to the courts.
There are also disparities in the fines and fees that courts impose that people will pay depending on the county.
Constitution Act 96 is supposed to prohibit the Alabama Legislature from enacting any laws “regulating costs and charges of courts, or fees, commissions or allowances of public officers” to specific counties and not all the counties in the state.
But fines and fees imposed on people by courts differ depending on the county because local officials convince state lawmakers to sponsor legislation to impose additional costs that fund different programs within those counties.
“Our Legislature is very clever to figure out that if they have a local act with statewide constitutional implications, then they could trump that statewide constitutional Act 96,” Stewart said. “That is how they are all presented now, something that the state votes on as constitutional amendments, and that is how the local acts are continuing to get passed.”
An increasing number of bills get enacted that increase the filing fees which then pose problems for people who require access to the criminal justice system.
“You have got the filing fees that are collected upfront with civil filings,” Stewart said. “We have some places in which that number is so high right now that it is really becoming an access to justice issue for people who can afford to file something with that particular county.”
Collecting payments on civil filings is easier because they are imposed on the front end, before individuals may access court. A larger problem is collecting payments for criminal cases when the court orders fines and fees, as well as restitution payments shortly after a case has been adjudicated.
Brenda Ganey, the clerk of courts for Baldwin County, estimated that courts collect about 22% of the fines and fees that courts impose on defendants after they violate the law.
“To me, the low hanging fruit in all this is, how do we increase the 22% of collections, because that is money sitting there right now that, no matter what you change, no matter what you make uniform across the board, we are leaving 78% of potential money,” said Rep. Chris Blackshear, R-Smiths Station, vice chair of the House Ways and Means General Fund Committee and who attended the meeting.
J. Langford Floyd, a former judge who helped Stewart with the research, said that would be “blood out of a turnip.”
“Usually your criminal defendants are your lower income to no income people,” he said. “They are also the 20,000 that are sitting in the state penitentiary that have no way to pay it, and don’t really care about paying as long as they are in the state penitentiary.”
“If there could be some incentive for the defendant to pay what they owe, then that would make collection easier,” said Robert E. Wilters, the vice president of the Alabama District Attorneys Association.
Legislators such as Blackshear and Sen. Will Barfoot, R-Pike Road, said that additional revenue options, such as raising taxes, were not an option they would consider.
“Why is it so difficult to do what is right,” Blackshear said. “And that is to not break the law. Don’t do the crime. That is the simple solution.”
The group will meet again during the summer to further discuss ideas.

Joe Lombardo had promised to veto. The bill was one of 31 declared dead Friday.
Similar to a bill vetoed by the governor two years ago, Assembly Bill 346 would have legalized the prescribing, dispensing and administering of medication designed to end the life of terminally ill patients. Lombardo in 2023 became the first governor to veto such legislation, and a day after AB346 was heard by a legislative committee last month vowed to veto it again.
Despite Lombardo’s position, the legislation did continue to move through the Legislature. The full Assembly voted on it, where it passed 23-19. The vote did not fall on party lines. It was referred to the Committee on Health and Human Services but never received a committee hearing.
Other notable bills that died Friday:

Senate Bill 143 (State Sen. Rochelle Nguyen, D) would have authorized the Joint Interim Standing Committee on Natural Resources to evaluate and review the excessive use fees and other water conservation efforts that impact turf and tree canopy. The bill passed the Senate unanimously and was heard by Assembly Natural Resources on May 5. But it was never given a committee vote.


Senate Bill 218 (State Sen. James Ohrenschall, D) would have adopted the Uniform Antitrust Pre-Merger Notification Act, requiring companies to submit to the state attorney general the same notices and information they are already required to provide federal agencies prior to mergers or acquisitions. The bill passed the Senate on party lines, with the 13 Democrats in support and the eight Republicans in opposition. It was referred to the Assembly Committee on Commerce and Labor but never given a hearing.
Assembly Bill 119 (Assemblymember Steve Yeager, D) sought to crack down on paramilitary organizing and activities. It passed the Assembly on party lines, with the 27 Democrats in support and the 15 Republicans in opposition. It was referred to the Senate Committee on Government Affairs but never given a hearing.
Assembly Bill 291 (Assemblymember Jovan Jackson, D) would have made changes to the record sealing process for people with multiple past convictions. The bill passed the full Assembly on party lines. It was given a Senate Judiciary hearing in late April but never given a committee vote.
Assembly Bill 437 (Assemblymember Jill Dickman, R) would have established a Fair Access to Insurance Requirements (FAIR) plan, an “insurance of last resort” for properties unable to find coverage elsewhere. The bill’s death was tied to an April 23 deadline, but missed the Current’s publication time, so we’re mentioning it here. The bill made it to the floor of the Assembly but languished on the Chief Clerk’s desk and was never given a floor vote.

The future of the workshop is uncertain after lawmakers did not pass a $2.5 million appropriation to help with rebuilding (photo submitted).On the night of Dec. 17, a devastating fire swept through the Scenic River Industries sheltered workshop in Salem, throwing about 30 people out of work and upsetting recycling efforts in the area.
A temporary replacement was donated about a month later to the organization, which provides taxpayer-supported employment to people with developmental disabilities. But its capacity was severely reduced and its future was in serious doubt.
The building owned by the Dent County Disabilities Board was insured, but not enough to rebuild to modern standards, said Shawn Bolerjack, board chairman. And while the board receives about $280,000 a year from its tax levy, it can’t afford to divert money from its other services.
But Bolerjack was comforted when he learned help was on the way in the form of state funding. 
Freshman state Rep. John Hewkin, a Republican from Cuba, and veteran state Rep. Don Mayhew, a Republican from Crocker, worked to add $2.5 million to the capital improvements budget, and the money was still in the bill when the Senate approved it the morning of May 9.
But that afternoon, Republican leaders in the Missouri House refused to bring it up for a final vote, and the money was lost.
“We were surprised and disappointed to hear that they killed the bill,” Bolerjack said in an interview with The Independent.
In all, more than 60 projects added by lawmakers, in addition to more than 20 sought by Gov. Mike Kehoe, will not be funded. The list of projects included money for eight hospitals around the state, a new nuclear reactor at the University of Missouri to make cancer treatments and a new mental health hospital in Kansas City.
Outrage over the surprise move doomed a stadium funding plan Kehoe presented to lawmakers the next week and soured relations between the House and Senate in the session’s waning days. 
But for people counting on the funding to make these local projects work, the news was devastating.
 Rep. Don Mayhew, R-Crocker, address the Missouri House on May 8, 2023 (Tim Bommel/Missouri House Communications).
Two hospitals that saw promised state money disappear, including one in Salem, were counting on the funds to keep the doors open.
Hewkin and Mayhew secured $6.8 million toward a $20 million project for roof and heating system repairs, as well as other deferred maintenance, at Salem Memorial District Hospital. Without the money, Hewkin and Mayhew said the hospital will likely close.
“I’ve been poor,” Hewkin said. “You do the best you can do with what you have, and so when you do that for so long, things eventually get to a point where it’s got to be fixed, whether we have the money or not. Salem Hospital finally just got to the point where something was going to have to be done with those kinds of systems.”
Phelps Health System, which operates out of Rolla, pledged $6.5 million to the project, Mayhew said, as part of an affiliation plan announced last year. Without the state money, Mayhew said, the affiliation plan will probably be scrapped.
“They can probably stay open for a while,” he said, “but it’s a downward spiral.” 
The other hospital in danger of closing is Pemiscot Memorial Hospital in Hayti, which was in line for $1.2 million in the capital improvements budget to buy a new electronic medical records system, hospital board chair Jonna Green said.
“This money would not have simply lined our bank account,” Green said. “It would have enabled us to bill more efficiently while also reducing the chance of human error. We originally understood there was another $700,000 that was initially proposed to assist with operations, but it never made it into (the appropriation bill). We could have used it, but we were happy to receive the $1.2 million…until we didn’t.”
Both hospitals are losing money on inpatient services, according to data compiled by Saving Rural Hospitals. Pemiscot Memorial was in the black on its full range of operations, which include pharmacy services and long-term care, while Salem Memorial was not.
A new records system will mean fewer billing errors and fewer employee hours dedicated to accounting systems, Green said.
The loss of the money “won’t cause us to close, but it would in the long term,” Green said. “We can’t keep operating as we are now.” 
 Special session

Most of the time, the adjournment of the regular legislative session would mean waiting a year for another chance to influence the appropriation process. But Kehoe has already said he will call lawmakers back on a bill to spend state tax money on new and improved stadiums for the Kansas City Royals and Chiefs.
For those with projects in the construction funding bill, Kehoe held out the prospect of a lifeline that could get them the money this year.
“I’ve heard and listened to quite a few senators and representatives from both sides of the aisle on that very same issue, and I understand what their concerns are,” Kehoe said. “And I think it’s fair to say everything is on the table of what that special session might look like.”
 Andrew Ashelman fills jars with milk paint at Scenic River Industries Inc., a sheltered workshop in Salem. A fire destroyed the workshop’s facility in December and the future is uncertain after lawmakers did not pass a $2.5 million appropriation to help with rebuilding (photo submitted).
For his area, Bolerjack said, the appropriation bill is more important than incentives for sports teams.
“We’re hoping Gov. Kehoe will call a special session because there are too many important capital improvement projects in this bill to keep it waiting, including the sheltered workshop in Dent County,” he said.
The path for a stadium plan could be greased by the appropriations. Kehoe revealed his proposal to divert state tax money to stadium bond payments just two days before lawmakers went home.
It won 108 votes in the Missouri House but died in a bipartisan Senate filibuster. But Kehoe shouldn’t take the House for granted in the special session, Mayhew said.
“The governor still has a pretty tall job of selling it, regardless of what the House vote came out as,” said Mayhew, who was absent during the stadium vote. “It’s a pretty hard sell in my area for a stadium and or for any money related to a stadium.”
Another chance to get the projects funded would be a sweetener that helps get the stadium plan passed, Hewkin said.
“In my heart, I feel that there’s a possibility that we haven’t visited this for the last time, and that we still have a chance,” he said. “It’s my hope that maybe we’ll be able to get (appropriations) also in that special session.”
In the Senate, Kehoe will have to navigate both those with objections to state support for any professional sports team and those who blocked his bill because the House did not vote on the capital spending bill. And, to add another layer of difficulty, the Senate adjourned in acrimony when Republican leaders invoked the rule to shut off debate, unused since 2020, to repeal a voter-approved paid sick leave law and put an abortion ban on a statewide ballot.
One of the biggest boosters of the Chiefs and Royals, Democratic state Sen. Barbara Washington of Kansas City, said when the session ended that she could not support a stadium funding bill if the capital improvements bill is not part of a special session.
“Those things are more important to me and to my colleagues than the Chiefs,” Washington said.
State Sen. Lincoln Hough, a Springfield Republican who chairs the Senate Appropriations Committee, said he’s not inclined to revisit the stadium proposal in a special session without a construction budget bill.
“I’m not saying the Chiefs aren’t important. I’ve been a pretty big proponent of saying we need to do what we need to do to keep them,” Hough said. “But unless it’s all included, there’s no point in it and we better have some assurances on the front end that the House isn’t going to do what the House did last time.”
During the filibuster, Hough said he was spurred to opposition in part after House Republican leaders said they spiked the appropriation bill because the overall budget spent too much, then enthusiastically backed a stadium proposal that will cost hundreds of millions of dollars..
“I don’t think there’s any point in calling a special session on anything, given the way this place is working or not working,” Hough said.
 Rural hospital losses

According to Missouri Hospital Association data, there are 12 rural hospitals in the state that have closed since 2014, with the Center for Health Care Policy and Payment reform showing nine more at immediate risk of shutting down.
The loss of each rural hospital means miles of extra driving for life-saving emergency care after injuries or medical events like heart attack or stroke. If Pemiscot Memorial closes, the closest Missouri hospital is a 45-minute drive away in Sikeston, Green said.
“We have Petersburg and Blytheville (in Arkansas), who are, say, 30 miles away,” Green said. “But the problem with that is, they don’t really like to take Missouri Medicaid and out-of-state patients.”
Bolerjack said he is concerned about the possibility Salem Memorial will close. 
“The hospital is a critical access hospital for our community and communities nearby,” he said. “It would definitely hurt us.”
The Salem hospital is an important resource when someone has an emergency while visiting tourist sites such as the Ozark Scenic Riverways, Mayhew said. There is a helipad at Akers Ferry Access, and a ground transport can be done in under 30 minutes.
“Without Salem Hospital, you’re probably a two hour ride in an ambulance,” Mayhew said.
The six other hospital projects cost a total of $12 million. They are in Clinton, Butler, Milan, Memphis, St. Joseph and Louisiana.
The bill had major state projects that were important for Kehoe as well. There was $50 million to support the University of Missouri’s project to build a new research reactor and $55 million for a new livestock display and stalling barn at the Missouri State Fairgrounds.
But it’s the small items that members were ready to showcase as examples of their ability to get things done in Jefferson City that mean the most to individual lawmakers.
“Anytime there’s cuts and things like that, sometimes it’s your ox that gets gored,” Hewkin said. “Most people don’t mind cuts, as long as it’s not their program.”
Hewkin said he has learned a lesson regardless of how the special session goes. 
While the items included in the construction budget died, 248 more legislative earmarks, costing $418 million of general revenue and $550 million overall, found a home in the $53.1 billion in spending that was approved.
So while he lost the money for Scenic River Industries, state Senate President Pro Tem Cindy O’Laughlin secured a $2 million grant for Handi-Shop Inc., the sheltered workshop serving Mexico in Audrain County.
That money was inserted into the Department of Education operating budget, which also includes $32 million for operating grants to the almost 90 Missouri sheltered workshops. There is $45 million in direct grants to hospitals and health care centers in the Department of Social Services budget.
“I’m hoping in my heart that there’s a chance that we still get a chance to get some of that done this year in a special session,” Hewkin said. “But if not, then next year, I’ll be standing at the appropriations door very early and asking to get my appropriation in there so we can take care of those people.”

(Photo by Dana Wilson/Bureau of Land Management/Flickr)State wildlife agencies have a big job.
While the federal government protects animals listed under the Endangered Species Act, states are tasked with keeping the vast majority of other species out of the “emergency room.” Habitat loss, pollution and climate change are making that job much more difficult.
At the same time, states are finding it harder to count on the hunting and fishing revenues that have long funded most of their work. Agencies say they have more challenges than ever before, and less money to take them on.
In many states, lawmakers are rethinking the long-standing model for wildlife management. They’re considering new funding sources to make the agencies less reliant on license fees. They’re asking wildlife managers to expand their work beyond traditional “game” species, adding protections for threatened insects and other animals. And some are scrutinizing the commissions that have long governed wildlife management.
Some of the proposals have seen broad support from outdoors lovers who want to strengthen their wildlife agencies. Others have drawn opposition from sporting groups, who fear the new focus will diminish hunting and fishing opportunities.
“We’re seeing quite a bit of action this year,” said Logan Christian, wildlife and habitat specialist with the National Caucus of Environmental Legislators, a forum for state lawmakers. “We definitely have noticed that states are working on strengthening their wildlife agencies.”
As Stateline previously reported, New Mexico enacted the most sweeping overhaul this year. It renamed the Department of Game & Fish as the Department of Wildlife, giving it a more explicit focus on non-game species. Budget writers provided $10.5 million in new funding over the next three years to help threatened species. And lawmakers created a new process for appointing the agency’s commissioners, with guidelines ensuring a diversity of expertise and experience.
Wildlife advocates in other states say the New Mexico overhaul was a game changer. But lawmakers elsewhere are taking a more piecemeal approach.
Spending on saving
Numerous states are reconsidering their wildlife agencies’ funding model.
“There’s definitely a growing awareness that the current management system is outdated and really unfit for 21st century challenges,” said Michelle Lute, executive director of Wildlife for All, a nonprofit focused on overhauling state wildlife governance. “State wildlife agencies are seeing that they can’t rely on hunting and fishing license fees to be able to do this work.”

Earlier this year, lawmakers in Utah enacted a new tax on wind and solar projects that will help fund the state’s wildlife agency. The revenue could double the department’s funding to protect non-game species, from $5 million to $10 million.
“We have a funding model in place for game species,” said Paul Thompson, administrator of the Species Protection Account with the Utah Division of Wildlife Resources. “Funding to work on some of our native species programs has been really hard to come by.”
The new revenue could allow the agency to invest in more biologists, conservation easements, watershed restoration projects and native fish hatchery programs. State Rep. Casey Snider, the Republican who sponsored the bill, argued that the clean energy sector should pay because its development is harming Utah’s habitat.
“Wind and solar projects have an outsized impact on [non-game] species, and they have not been contributing financially,” he said.
But industry leaders said the law will threaten the state’s energy development.
“[The measure will] severely strain the economics of an existing project and send a negative message to developers and the financial institutions that provide capital for these projects,” said Theresa Foxley, chief of staff to rPlus Energies, a renewable developer, in testimony to lawmakers.
Lawmakers in Oregon are considering an increase to the state’s tax on hotel and short-term rental stays to help fund non-game wildlife work. The proposal would bring in about $30 million annually. State Rep. Ken Helm, the bill’s Democratic sponsor, said the state wildlife agency’s division to manage non-game species “has come and gone over the last 30 years as funding is available.”
Growing concerns about climate change and biodiversity have created urgency to find a stable funding source, he said. Helm said the lodging tax is a logical source, because the state’s tourism industry is centered on the outdoors. He noted that Oregon’s natural resources agencies receive only a tiny fraction of the state’s general revenue.
Travel and tourism groups oppose the bill, arguing it could drive visitors elsewhere. Helm has also proposed a bill that would bring in wildlife funding through an income tax increase.
He said his message to fellow lawmakers was: “I’ve given you two ways to get the money we need for this agency. Nobody’s been able to come up with a better idea. Just pick one.”
The bill was heard in committee earlier this month, but has not yet advanced.
Meanwhile, lawmakers in Hawaii approved a “green fee” — a lodging tax increase of 0.75% that Democratic Gov. Josh Green’s office estimates will bring in $100 million annually to help protect the state from climate change. While the fund is not explicitly focused on wildlife, it’s expected to contribute to efforts such as coral reef restoration and watershed protection that will benefit important habitats.
State Rep. Amy Perruso, a Democrat who was among the advocates for a green fee, said the COVID-19 pandemic was a wakeup call.
“With the absence of tourists, we saw a lot more fish in the ocean, everything about the environment was so much more healthy because we didn’t have 10 million extra people,” she said. “If we’re going to do something to protect the environment, [tourism] is a logical connection.”
Washington state was among the first to significantly invest in non-game conservation through state tax revenue, with legislation enacted two years ago. The budget passed by lawmakers this session continues that work, with $14 million set aside for biodiversity and species recovery each of the next two years.
Lawmakers in Kansas and North Carolina also proposed using more general fund revenue for wildlife work, although those measures have not advanced.
‘Invertebrates are wildlife’
In other states, lawmakers are focused on expanding their wildlife agencies’ mission to more non-game species. Last year, Colorado gave wildlife managers the authority to manage insects and other invertebrates, as well as rare plants.
“Invertebrates are wildlife, and their conservation benefits the entire ecosystem, including the species [state wildlife officials] traditionally managed,” said Richard Reading, vice chair of the Colorado Parks and Wildlife Commission. “They do everything from creating our soils to filtering our water to pollinating the food we eat.”
Reading also serves as vice president of science and conservation at the Butterfly Pavilion, an insect zoo. He noted that studies are showing that many invertebrate species are in rapid decline. In addition to expanding the agency’s authority, lawmakers provided funding for six staff members to take on the additional work.
A similar bill in Nevada, focused on invertebrates, advanced through the Assembly’s natural resources committee.
“There’s definitely concerns about declines in pollinator species,” said Assemblymember Howard Watts, a Democrat who sponsored the bill. “Our wildlife agency can and should take proactive action to do research, surveys and habitat improvement to keep these species off the [endangered species list].”
Watts said the bill would allow wildlife managers to consider insects in state plans to protect imperiled species. He said the Nevada Department of Wildlife has requested an entomologist position if it’s asked to take on the additional species. Beyond that, he said, the measure would not require additional money, as it’s focused on voluntary, proactive work, rather than additional regulations.
Another bill in Pennsylvania would expand wildlife managers’ authority to include insects. That measure has been approved by the House Environmental and Natural Resources Protection Committee.
Sporting groups have largely been supportive of efforts to provide new funding sources to manage non-game species. But some are skeptical of plans to expand agencies’ mission without an increase in revenue.
“Most hunters and anglers understand that healthy game populations are dependent on ecosystem integrity,” said Devin O’Dea, Western policy and conservation manager with Backcountry Hunters & Anglers, a nonprofit focused on public lands. “But when you take a model that’s been developed with the intent of enforcing regulations for fish and game species, expand that scope without funding and additional capacity, it’s a recipe for something to fall off the plate.”
Governance
Meanwhile, some legislators want to rethink the commission model that oversees wildlife governance. Critics say that governors often select commissioners who are hunting guides, farmers and political donors. Once appointed, they enact wildlife policies to suit their economic interests.
Florida state Rep. Anna V. Eskamani, a Democrat, drafted a bill that would overhaul the state’s Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission. Her proposal would increase the board from seven to nine members. It would designate seats for scientists, conservationists, local officials, farmers, hunters and anglers.
“The commission has made decisions not based on science or conservation, but based on developers or landowners that engage in agricultural practices,” she said. “We tried to strike a balance to ensure there are voices with an environmental background, with a conservation and wildlife background, with an academic background.”
The bill did not advance, but Eskamani said grassroots support is building for systemic changes in wildlife management.
Some sporting groups are more wary of commission overhaul proposals.
“We have seen examples where proposed changes to commissions were politically motivated or motivated by anti-hunting and anti-angling interests,” said Kent Keene senior manager for Western states and agriculture policy with the Congressional Sportsmen’s Foundation, a group that promotes hunting and fishing priorities on Capitol Hill. “When those changes are focused on science-based needs, then the sportsmen’s community has a long history of supporting those steps to ensure we are protecting our heritage.”
Some hunting and fishing groups have emphasized that the expanded mission should come with additional funding, so agencies aren’t stretched thin. Keene noted that hunters and anglers pay an excise tax on the purchase of gear, which provides an important funding source for wildlife agencies. Some have proposed a similar “backpack tax” on gear for hikers, birdwatchers and others.
Another proposal in New Hampshire would give the wildlife agency’s executive director the authority to make policy decisions, relegating the Fish and Game Commission to an advisory body. That bill did not advance.

LaMonica Mciver are the Trump administration's attempt to silence its critics.,"Democrats say the charges against Rep. LaMonica Mciver are the Trump administration's attempt to silence its critics. (Courtesy of McIver's office)The Trump administration’s move to charge Rep. LaMonica McIver with assaulting law enforcement during a protest outside a migrant jail in Newark earlier this month was met with sharp criticism by Democratic lawmakers Monday.
Rep. Rob Menendez (D-08), who was with McIver at the protest, said she is owed an apology by the Trump administration.
“Every American should see this for what it is: the weaponization of the justice system in a shameful attempt to bully and intimidate those of us who stand in the way of the president’s agenda,” Menendez said.
Rep. Bonnie Watson Coleman (D-12), who was also with McIver that day, called the charges “baseless.”
“This prosecution is wrong and alarming, as it is just one more example of the Trump administration ignoring the rule of law and attempting to run roughshod over the other branches of government — here, the Congress,” Watson Coleman said.
The three Democrats say they were the migrant jail, Delaney Hall, on May 9 to inspect the facilities as part of their oversight role. Newark Mayor Ras Baraka, a Democrat, was also there as part of a dayslong push to inspect the facility, which he claims opened illegally without proper city permits.
When federal agents moved to arrest Baraka, McIver and others surrounded him, and video shows she pushed past one of the agents. Baraka was arrested and charged with trespassing and released from detention later that day. When acting U.S. Attorney Alina Habba announced the charges against McIver Monday, she said she was dismissing the charge against Baraka. Baraka said he expects McIver to be vindicated.
Sen. Andy Kim (D) called the charges against McIver the Trump administration’s attempt to “intimidate those who dare speak against them or expose the truth.”
“The Congresswoman was in the process of conducting oversight, which is her right and responsibility. It’s important that we stand up to protect that right, and I’m proud to join my colleagues to stand beside her to ensure that the people of our state can never be silenced,” Kim said.
Habba’s statement announcing the charges said congressional oversight is important but “not an issue in this case.” McIver assaulted, impeded, and interefered with law enforcement, Habba said, and her “conduct cannot be overlooked by the chief federal law enforement official in the State of New Jersey.”
“It is my Constitutional obligation to ensure that our federal law enforcement is protected when executing their duties,” Habba said.
It’s not clear when McIver is due in court. As of Tuesday morning, Habba’s office had not released any charging documents in the case.
The American Civil Liberties Union joined Democrats in criticizing Habba for charging McIver and demanded the charges be dropped.
“The Trump administration’s political charges against Congresswoman McIver is a method more suited for authoritarianism than American democracy. Elected officials represent the people, not the administration’s interests. They have every right to exercise their legally authorized oversight responsibilities for expanded immigration detention in New Jersey,” Mike Zamore, the group’s national director of policy and government affairs, and Amol Sinha, executive director of the ACLU of New Jersey, said in a joint statement.

(Photo by Jemal Countess/Getty Images for MoveOn)Acting U.S. Attorney Alina Habba said Monday she is charging Rep. LaMonica McIver with “assaulting, impeding and interfering with law enforcement” during the arrest of Newark Mayor Ras Baraka outside a migrant jail in Newark 10 days ago.
Habba also announced her office is dropping Baraka’s misdemeanor trespassing charge “for the sake of moving forward.” Baraka called for federal prosecutors to dismiss the case after a court hearing in Newark on Thursday.
The stunning development has McIver accusing the Trump administration of attempting to “criminalize and deter legislative oversight” and Habba saying that congressional oversight is “not an issue in this case.”
“No one is above the law — politicians or otherwise. It is the job of this office to uphold justice impartially, regardless of who you are,” Habba said in a statement Monday evening. “Now we will let the justice system work.”
McIver, a Democrat who first joined Congress in September, said the charges are purely political.
“This administration will never stop me from working for the people in our district and standing up for what is right,” she said in a statement. “I am thankful for the outpouring of support I have received and I look forward to the truth being laid out clearly in court.”
The charges against McIver stem from a May 9 protest outside Delaney Hall, the new migrant jail in Newark. In the days prior, Baraka had attempted to gain access to the facility, which he claims is operating illegally without proper city permits.
McIver and two other New Jersey Democrats, Reps. Rob Menendez and Bonnie Watson Coleman, joined Baraka that day, saying they wanted to inspect the jail. Members of Congress are permitted to conduct unannounced visits ofproperties by or for the Department of Homeland Security.
When federal agents moved to arrest Baraka, chaos ensued. Video shows McIver and other protestors surrounding the mayor.
While Baraka was still in federal custody that day, McIver told reporters that she was the one assaulted by federal agents.
“We did not get one apology, we did not get one explanation. I personally, who was assaulted on camera, did not get one apology from any ICE administrator, no call from Homeland Security, nothing,” she said.
Department of Homeland Security officials later posted video of the melee to social media, focusing on a moment where McIver pushes past a federal agent.
McIver said in her statement that she, Menendez, and Watson Coleman were lawfully conducting oversight of the facility and that the visit “should have been peaceful and short.”
“Instead, ICE agents created an unnecessary and unsafe confrontation when they chose to arrest Mayor Baraka,” she said.
Habba’s statement says she attempted to address these issues without bringing criminal charges and gave McIver “every opportunity to come to a resolution, but she has unfortunately declined.”
The three House members have faced backlash from Republican lawmakers who have introduced a resolution that would strip them of their committee assignments, and at least one representative has called for McIver to be expelled from Congress. U.S. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem accused the three Democrats of “lawlessness.”
Habba’s statement says she has invited Baraka to tour Delaney Hall.
“The government has nothing to hide at the facility, and I will personally accompany the mayor so he can see that firsthand,” she said. “The citizens of New Jersey deserve unified leadership so we can get to work to keep our state safe.”
Habba was present in court last week for a 20-minute status conference on Baraka’s charges. Lawyers for Baraka said he was let onto the property by a staff member, and that Baraka was arrested outside the property. Monday was a deadline for federal prosecutors to deliver certain information pertaining to Baraka’s arrest.
Baraka, who is one of six Democrats running for his party’s nomination for governor, said in a statement that he is “glad” Habba has agreed to dismiss the charge he faced and said he plans to speak to her about “issues on which we can cooperate.”
“I understand that the U.S. Attorney has chosen to charge Congresswoman LaMonica McIver with assaulting law enforcement. Congresswoman McIver is a daughter of Newark, past Newark Council President, a former student of mine, and a dear friend.  I want to be clear: I stand with LaMonica, and I fully expect her to be vindicated,” he said.
Habba, a personal lawyer for President Donald Trump who became the state’s U.S. attorney in March, has targeted other New Jersey officials. Last month, she said she launched an investigation into Gov. Phil Murphy and state Attorney General Matt Platkin — which she called “a warning for everybody” — over a 2019 directive barring state, county, and local police from cooperating in federal immigration arrests and enforcement.

I want to speak directly to Canadians and reaffirm Vermont’s support for your country and the shared values that unite us.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Treasurer Mike Pieciak: Extending a hand to our northern neighbors.","This commentary is by Mike Pieciak, Vermont state treasurer.Let me start as directly as I can: I’m sorry, Canada. You didn’t elect our president, but you’re paying the price for his policies. In Vermont, we’re feeling the consequences too. Trump’s reckless tariffs are more than economic burdens; they’re straining relationships that have taken decades to build. They’re making life harder for communities on both sides of the border, undermining the trust and goodwill that have defined our partnership for so long. In this moment of division, I’m here to say: Vermont chooses a different path. We choose to stand with Canada.Vermonters elected me as treasurer to grow our state’s economy, lower costs and create new opportunities for financial success. For generations, our state’s deep ties to Canada have played a crucial role in this work — supporting economic partnership, lifelong friendships and trust across borders. Today, as tariffs and divisive rhetoric threaten to drive our countries apart, I want to speak directly to Canadians and reaffirm Vermont’s support for your country and the shared values that unite us. Canada is Vermont’s top trading partner, supporting billions in economic activity that benefits Canadians and Americans alike. For small businesses, our economic partnership creates unique opportunities to thrive and expand into new markets. It has helped lower costs for critical industries like housing, clean energy and maple syrup production.The Trump tariffs betray this partnership without consideration for the everyday Canadians and Vermonters who will face higher prices and less opportunity. Meanwhile, the administration’s rhetoric has undermined generations of respectful relations — damaging friendships, dividing families and making both of our countries less safe. Many Canadians have responded, understandably, by boycotting American-made products and canceling planned visits to the U.S. For Vermont’s small businesses and rural communities that rely heavily on Canadian tourism, this presents an existential challenge.Canadians have every right to feel betrayed. Here in Vermont, we share that same deep frustration as the Trump administration jeopardizes our economy and our ability to meet Vermonters’ basic needs.But let’s be clear: breaking our longstanding partnership won’t hurt President Trump or force him to change course. It will kill jobs, hurt businesses and livelihoods — making people angrier, lonelier and less trusting of the world. It will create enormous suffering for families on both sides of the border,Our relationship long predates President Trump, and I have faith that it will endure long after. The best way forward, for both of us, is to hold fast to the bonds we share. Across our state, Vermonters are doing just that — extending a hand to the Canadian people.Right now, Jay Peak Resort is welcoming Canadian visitors by accepting Canadian dollars at the same value as U.S. dollars. The Vermont Brewers Association is doing the same for their annual brewers’ festival this summer — giving Canadians more value for their money when they visit the Green Mountain State.On May 10, I traveled to Montreal with dozens of fellow Vermonters to meet with local residents and spend our money at Canadian businesses. We did this to send a simple but powerful message to Canada: You matter to Vermont. We value you. We support you. We believe in each other.Canadians and Vermonters didn’t choose this fight, but we do get to choose our friends. And in Vermont, we’re choosing to face these challenges with our neighbors to the north. We’re asking Canadians to consider choosing Vermont, too.Read the story on VTDigger here:  Treasurer Mike Pieciak: Extending a hand to our northern neighbors.",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Commentaries_featured-image-25.png,,,2025-05-20 07:08:18.976649

A new study suggests that direct financial aid reduces parole violations and eases reentry. (Photo courtesy of the Center for Employment Opportunities)When Karina Lariz was released from a California prison in September 2021, she had only the clothes she was arrested in — stretched out and weathered by time. She had lost her home, her car and her job. Her two children had moved in with other family members.
“I didn’t have nothing, everything that I had within those two weeks of coming home was what I found in donation bins,” recalled Lariz, who was incarcerated for three years. She added: “I was so worried about, ‘How am I going to get to these different programs? Where am I going to sleep at?’”
After her release, Lariz spent two days at a motel before moving into a transitional home. She also participated in a job training program.
Then came an unexpected lifeline: direct cash payments through a nonprofit program called the Returning Citizens Stimulus. The Center for Employment Opportunities, an organization that offers reentry support and services to formerly incarcerated people in 28 cities, runs the program.
With the money, Lariz, 35, was able to buy clothes for job interviews, cover groceries and public transportation fare, and begin rebuilding her life and relationships. The money, totaling nearly $2,500 over three payments, helped her gain footing in the weeks following her release — a period often marked by high risk of recidivism and reincarceration.
“It liberated a lot of stress,” she said.
Now, a new independent evaluation of the initiative suggests that short-term aid may have positive long-term effects. The study comes as some states are considering whether direct financial support is an effective — or appropriate — tool for reducing recidivism.
In 2022, Lariz landed a job with the very organization that helped fund her reentry. She now works as a program associate on the organizing team at the Center for Employment Opportunities, where she helps others leaving prison.
Nearly four years after her release, Lariz is married and again living with her two children.
“If I didn’t have that support, I would have not pushed myself to do half of the things that I did,” Lariz said.
She is one of more than 10,000 formerly incarcerated people across 28 cities who received support through the Center for Employment Opportunities’ stimulus program, which launched in April 2020.



If I didn’t have that support, I would have not pushed myself to do half of the things that I did.


– Karina Lariz, cash assistance recipient



The national organization works with local agencies to distribute up to $2,750 in cash over 60 days, contingent on participants completing basic milestones, such as creating a resume or attending a job readiness workshop. More than 80% of participants complete their milestones and receive the full payments.
People leaving prison often face staggering rates of joblessness, homelessness and food insecurity. Most program participants used the funds to cover food, rent, utilities or public transportation fare. Some participants also used the money to pay off credit card and medical debt.
“The basics of survival are this acute challenge in those early days of reentry, and then you layer on that sort of the big structural challenges,” said Sam Schaeffer, the executive director and CEO of the Center for Employment Opportunities. “Just putting food on the table, just getting to work, just getting that set of interview clothes is so critical.”
The new study supports that assessment.

According to the study — which was conducted by MDRC, a research organization focusing on poverty reduction — participants were significantly less likely to violate parole than peers who did not receive payments. Within the first six months after release, parole violations fell by more than 41%, with violent parole violations dropping by 64%. The study evaluated the outcomes of people who were released in 2020 in Los Angeles and Alameda counties in California.
Roughly 77 million Americans — or about 1 in 3 adults — have a criminal record, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. That includes records of arrests, charges and criminal convictions. Formerly incarcerated people often face stigma and major barriers in the job market.
They also often return home without savings or financial resources and earn less than half as much as peers who have never been incarcerated over their careers, according to a 2020 report by the Brennan Center for Justice, a left-leaning law and policy institute at the New York University School of Law.
Legislation and pilot programs
A bill introduced in the New York legislature earlier this year would create a reentry fund to offer cash payments of $425 each month for up to six months for eligible residents leaving prison. The bill has been stalled in committee since January and is unlikely to pass before the legislature adjourns in June.
Some critics say that the proposed New York program is a redundant and unrestricted handout for people with criminal records, and question whether limited public safety funds should support individuals already eligible for state services, including Medicaid, food assistance, job placement programs and housing aid.
“This is just one more element of what is an overall theme by the Democrats here in Albany to coddle criminals and put their priorities over the priorities of victims and law-abiding citizens,” New York state Sen. George Borrello, a Republican, told Stateline.

This isn’t the first time states have considered offering stipends to people leaving prison.
Most recently, legislators in Colorado in 2024 and North Carolina in 2023 proposed bills that would have provided monthly payments to formerly incarcerated individuals. Neither bill made it out of its originating chamber, but both bills proposed up to $3,000 in support.
In Colorado, the pilot program would have offered money for basic living expenses to those who enrolled in workforce training programs following incarceration in a state facility. In North Carolina, the proposal would have provided monthly stipends for housing, food, clothing and transportation for up to six months after release.
Similar pilot cash assistance programs have launched in New Haven, Connecticut; Gainesville, Florida; and Philadelphia.
The Gainesville program, which ran from January 2022 to February 2023, had 115 participants. They received $1,000 in the first month, followed by monthly payments of $600. An impact report released in February found that participants experienced greater financial security, reduced mental stress and lower rates of recidivism.
Potential savings
In 2022 — the most recent year with available data from the federal Bureau of Justice Statistics and the U.S. Census Bureau’s annual survey of state and local government finances — state governments spent $58 billion to incarcerate more than 1 million people in state facilities.

Forty-four percent of all state prison admissions in 2021 were people who violated the terms of their parole or probation sentences, according to a 2024 report by the Council of State Governments Justice Center. On any given day, 1 in 4 people in state prison were incarcerated due to supervision violations — costing states more than $10 billion collectively.
Some critics maintain that the most effective way to prevent crime is to punish those who break the law.
“We do not do enough to hold people accountable,” said Borrello, the New York state senator who opposes the bill that would create a reentry fund in his state. “I really don’t give any credence to [supporters’] thoughts on whether or not they think this is going to save money down the road.”
For people such as Karina Lariz, though, the impact is personal and profound.
“I’ve been able to redefine and find who I am today, like the real Karina — not the Karina that grew up in trauma and all the problems that I had before incarceration,” she said.

It is the largest hydropower producer in the U.S. and also part of the federal Columbia River Power System. (Photo courtesy of Bureau of Reclamation)Grand Coulee Dam is among the most powerful energy-generating dams on earth. It’s the bedrock of the federal Columbia River Power System — a network of 31 dams supplying more than half of the hydropower in the Northwest. Grand Coulee alone, overseen by the federal Bureau of Reclamation, generates one-quarter of that.
But critical operations at the dam are going understaffed following President Donald Trump’s orders, executed by the Office of Personnel Management, to cut probationary federal employees, freeze new hiring at federal agencies and offer incentives to get employees to retire and resign early. It’s a problem at several agencies that oversee the system, which have lost hundreds of employees and could collectively lose hundreds more by fall, and it has regional electric utilities concerned about the safety, reliability and future of the region’s power transmission.
“These are not D.C. policy-maker jobs. These are jobs on the ground, serving the people of the Pacific Northwest with clean, reliable power,” said Scott Simms, president of the Public Power Council. The nonprofit industry group represents consumer-owned utilities in six states, all of which rely on power from the Columbia River dams.
“It actually takes quite a few human beings to run these giant hydro projects on a daily basis,” Simms said. “So that is the prevailing concern in the short term: making sure that the right people are in certain jobs, and also that there’s coverage, because these are 24/7 jobs.”
 Hundreds of employees gone

The Bureau is not the only player in the basin’s energy delivery system that’s suffering. The Army Corps of Engineers, which also manages the dams, could lose more than 300 employees in the next few months, according to Tom Conning, public information officer for the Corps’ Northwestern Division. Employees of the branch had until May 1 to accept a deferred resignation and be put on paid administrative leave and have until Sept. 30 to officially resign.
The Bonneville Power Administration, or BPA, which markets and delivers the dams’ hydropower across the region, has lost 200 employees, according to recent testimony from U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright at a May 7 House Committee on Appropriations budget hearing.
Cuts have cost the Bureau of Reclamation about 25% of its staff so far — around 1,400 people — according to reporting in Politico, and staffing levels at Grand Coulee Dam are about 70% of what they should be, according to Simms.
“We understand they were behind in being fully staffed as it was, and then the workforce reductions came into play,” he said of Grand Coulee.
Bureau officials did not respond to the Capital Chronicle’s request to either confirm or correct the figures.
“While we do not comment on personnel matters, we are committed to enhancing workforce management and are collaborating closely with the Office of Personnel Management to embrace new opportunities for optimization and innovation,” Michael Coffey, a regional public affairs officer at the Department of the Interior, said in an email.
Trump’s orders, meant to cut federal spending, have not had any impact. Analyses by the Wall Street Journal, Reuters and CBS News found the Treasury’s daily spending is up billions from the same period last year.
When it comes to BPA, staff who’ve been offered incentives to resign and retire won’t make any difference. Their salaries are not taxpayer funded, but ratepayer funded, and the agency sends a profit each year to the U.S. Treasury.
Simms said 90 more BPA jobs had been rescinded as part of the federal hiring freeze, a number confirmed by a source familiar with BPA. The agency initially lost more than 100 probationary employees under a Trump executive order in February, but has since been able to bring them back.
The 290 job losses at BPA so far account for nearly 10% of the agency’s staff, and the agency is already hundreds of employees short, according to Energy Secretary Wright’s testimony.
 Hand-in-hand

All three agencies — Reclamation, Corps and BPA — collaborate to maintain and manage the Columbia River Power System.
“So they work hand-in-hand. If you don’t have reliable hydro projects, then you don’t have a stable, workable grid, right?” Simms said. “There’s craftspeople, there’s welders, there’s electricians, there’s all kinds of folks who are involved in the operation of any dam.”
The Corps is also grappling with the possibility of losing at least 325 employees in the next few months, according to Conning. That’s mostly due to resignations and early retirements.
“These reductions cut across all aspects of our operations, from senior managers, administration staff, park rangers, maintenance workers, etc.,” he said in an email. “Additionally, existing vacancies are complicating our ability to fully support various missions (like recreation).
Corps’ districts in Portland, Seattle and Walla Walla, Washington, have temporarily limited or closed some recreation areas to maintain public safety and services, he added.
Simms said the long-term concern for all of these agencies in the Northwest is not funding but having employees with the skills to preserve and improve the system. BPA and the agencies are years behind in the region as far as investing in grid expansion and connecting to new green energy projects, reporting from Oregon Public Broadcasting and ProPublica recently found.
Simms likened the predictable outcome to that of deferring maintenance on your car.
“Essentially your car is due for service and you just continue to ignore the warning light. You’re going to pay the consequences if you continue to ignore that warning light,” he said. “That is what we’re worried about in the longer term: making sure that we’ve got the right people to do the needed work. It’s not a money problem, it’s actually a people problem.”
Simms said the Public Power Council has been working with both sides of the aisle in both chambers of Congress to advocate for more investment in the region’s hydropower system and its employees.
At the May 7 Congressional budget hearing, Energy Secretary Wright said he was aware BPA’s staffing could not go lower.
“I don’t think we have room to reduce headcount there anymore,” he said. “There’ll be no more shrinkage in head count at Bonneville Power.”
Simms said federal leaders likely need to go further.
“I think we’re going to have to get our heads around the idea of probably paying incentive payments and retention payments the way we’ve seen at the FAA for air traffic controllers, the way we’ve seen it for the USDA for food inspectors, the way we’ve seen it at the Forest Service for fire mitigation personnel,” he said. “I think we’re going to be in a place where we’re going to have to use those kinds of tools to attract and retain the people that we need for these critical positions.”

In June 2021, Connie Kathary asked her mom to go on a walk. Though she knew she’d be accepted, it took the then 14-year-old more than 20 minutes to work up the courage to tell her mom that she’s transgender. She still laughs at the significance of choosing Pride Month for the conversation.

“I walked her outside. We were just talking about stuff, and I told her, ‘Yep, I’m a girl.’ And she was very accepting,” Connie said. With a laugh, she added, “At first, I was a bit upset, because she didn’t give me, like, the fanfare, because I’ve always been a real attention whore.”

Since then, Connie has had to overcome the legal complexities of changing her name and the search for medical providers who could offer her the treatment she needed. Finding treatment took more than a year. And then, three months after her treatment started, Connie had to contend with a new challenge — an Indiana state law banning minors from receiving gender-affirming health care.

As she and her family scrambled for solutions, Connie, like many other transgender youth under 18, found help across the border in Illinois.

Indiana is among 26 states — many in the Midwest and South — that have outlawed youth gender-affirming care statewide since 2021. In Illinois, political leaders have moved in the opposite direction.

Gov. JB Pritzker signed the Patient and Provider Protection Act into law in 2023, after lawmakers passed it following the overturning of Roe v. Wade; it solidified access to abortion and gender-affirming care in Illinois and protects physicians who treat out-of-state youth like Connie.

Today, Illinois lawmakers and advocates say that law is more important than ever. In addition to states passing increasingly strict bans on gender-affirming care, Donald Trump, in his second term as president, is advancing numerous federal policies affecting transgender people. This includes executive orders seeking to prohibit transgender women from competing in women’s sports and ban the use of federal funding on gender-affirming treatment for individuals under 19.

A judge has temporarily blocked the order banning the use of federal funds on gender-affirming care, and Illinois state Rep. Kelly Cassidy, a chief sponsor of Illinois’ shield law, said the Trump directive has not impacted access to care in Illinois. “I think that’s the most important thing people need to know: His signature on that paper changed nothing (in) regard to access to care in Illinois today or tomorrow,” she said.

Cassidy said Illinois’ law is among the strongest in the country, though it hasn’t been tested. She said lawmakers are “bracing for that, but we’re bracing for it with a solid litigation strategy and the belief that we can slow the harms, we can minimize the harms.”

In the two years since the law’s passage, Illinois has become a critical refuge for transgender youth, providers and families say. Planned Parenthood of Illinois said around 7% of their gender-affirming patients come from out of state – an increase since nearby states have restricted care – seeking estrogen and testosterone therapy, a treatment for gender dysphoria. As defined by Mayo Clinic, gender dysphoria is “a feeling of distress that can happen when a person's gender identity differs from the sex assigned at birth.” Complications include discrimination, difficulty maintaining relationships and mental health concerns such as anxiety, depression and self-harm.

In Indiana, Connie would have had to wait four years — until she turned 18 — to start gender-affirming care, a treatment that experts say can ease depression, anxiety and suicidal thoughts in transgender youth.

“If I didn’t transition, I’m not even sure I would still be here,” Connie said. “There is probably a universe out there where I didn’t transition, which, I don’t want to think about it, but that’s the thing — you have to.”

Starting the journey

With her mom, Julia, and her dad, Greg, in her corner, Connie took the first steps in her transition journey: changing her name and gender in the legal system. While the school responded quickly to Julia’s request, the full legal process took over a year.

In the months before the court hearing, Connie elected to start attending therapy. It wasn’t required, Julia said, but it helped the legal process run smoother. “Sometimes a county that may not be as accepting as (our) county is, the judge might ask for a letter from a therapist,” she said. “Kind of like, ‘Prove to me that you’re not just changing anything for the heck of it’ or whatever. People do think that. They think … that you just get on a whim.”

It was after her name was changed in the legal system that Connie decided to pursue gender-affirming hormone therapy. She recalls facing a lot of skepticism during this time.

“You have to go through a few different doctors, where they can be like, ‘Are you sure?’ ‘Are you sure you’re sure?’ ‘Are you sure?’ ‘You sure?’” she said.

While a statewide ban was not in place at the time, Connie still faced limited options. Julia said that Connie’s pediatrician – albeit supportive – could not prescribe medications due to the hospital’s Catholic policies. She was referred to Riley Children’s Hospital in Indianapolis, where she spent a year waiting for an appointment. When the time finally came, she was able to receive medication — a feminizing hormone therapy of spironolactone and estrogen — the same day.

“It’s really about the bureaucratic hoops you have to jump through, because it could really be so easy,” Connie said. “I’m not saying it should be ‘say it and then immediately get a prescription’ … I’m just saying it shouldn’t be that hard.”

In 2023, Indiana Republicans were at the forefront of a national move to restrict transgender rights. Hundreds of protesters, including the Katharys, jammed the Indiana Statehouse when a state House committee considered Senate Bill 480, a law prohibiting gender transition procedures and treatments for children, even if the patient’s parents approve of the treatment.

The bill passed committee on an 8-5 vote three months after Connie began treatment. The primary sponsor of the legislation, Republican Sen. Tyler Johnson, said in a statement that the measure would protect “vulnerable Hoosier children.” Johnson, an emergency physician from northeast Indiana, said he had “compassion” for children experiencing gender dysphoria and said they deserved counseling, but he questioned the need for medical treatment.

“Since these procedures have irreversible and life-altering effects,” he said, “it is appropriate and necessary for our state to make sure these procedures are performed only on adults who can make the decisions on their own behalf.”

Despite more Statehouse protests, Republican Gov. Eric Holcomb signed the law in April 2023. The ACLU of Indiana sued almost immediately, leaving Connie and her family to anxiously await updates.

The initial news was promising. In June 2023, a judge issued a temporary injunction that blocked the law from taking effect, giving them a brief sense of relief. But in February 2024, a panel of the Chicago-based Seventh Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals lifted the injunction, and the Katharys received a heartbreaking email from the ACLU notifying them that “care can no longer be provided in Indiana.” Initially, a grandfather clause left those receiving treatment with six months to continue treatment, but when the injunction was lifted, so was the clause.

With Connie running low on medication, Julia said she immediately signed her up on Planned Parenthood of Illinois’ online patient portal.

Crossing state lines

One month later, Julia and Greg called off work, signed Connie out of school, and drove from Indianapolis to Flossmoor, Illinois, a suburb 30 minutes south of Chicago. Connie spent the 170-mile car ride watching a season of “Invincible” and wishing for a visit to Six Flags.

“I think the thing that makes me mad about the whole thing is, like, as a taxpayer in Indiana — me and Greg both — we pay our taxes here in Indiana, we work here in Indiana,” Julia said. “We were told we can’t parent our child and make health care decisions for her without driving outside the state.”

Despite frustration, they said they made sure to enjoy themselves on the trip.

“Besides the fact that I really should not have had to do that, it was a really fun day in my mind,” Connie said. “The part of me that has to think about this stuff is like, ‘I shouldn’t have had to do that.’ Then the part of me that just wants to be a kid is like, ‘Yeah, no school, driving up to Chicago, all right!’”

Illinois’ political leaders have worked for years to make the state a friendly destination for transgender patients. Cassidy, a Chicago Democrat, has been on the forefront of those efforts. She is a long-term advocate for LGBTQ+ and reproductive rights. Her partner is nonbinary. She’s the only openly gay member of her chamber. These experiences made becoming the chief sponsor for Illinois’ shield law a fight she was not going to back away from, she said.

Cassidy said the legislation ensures there is Medicaid coverage of gender-affirming care, prevents Illinois from participating in investigations when other states seek to penalize those who are traveling to access health care, and protects the Illinois licensure of medical professionals who are dually licensed.

Edwin Yohnka, director of communications and public policy for the ACLU of Illinois, said it was “designed to ensure that no one who is providing lawful health care in Illinois is subject to punishment as a result of having provided that care.”

“As we see, other states not only implement these bans but then also try to enforce their bans from their state in Illinois,” Yohnka said.

Cassidy feels it’s important that decisions impacting bodily autonomy are made without governmental interference.

“Ultimately, I have never had a lawmaker question whether I needed my two heart surgeries,” she said. “They saved my life, and so did my abortion, but I’ve had to justify that.”

Local protections

Protections for transgender patients extend to the local level in Illinois, too. In the small college town of Carbondale, a bodily autonomy ordinance protects autonomous medical decisions, including gender-affirming care.

“It’s expressly written … that anyone in the city of Carbondale who is caught working with some law enforcement agency attempting to extradite someone for coming here to exercise their right to health care, they'll be held liable,” Carbondale City Councilmember Clare Killman said. “The individual who is cooperating with an outside law enforcement agency will be held liable. And no member of Carbondale city staff, Carbondale Police Department included, is authorized to comply with, say, an extradition order.”

Killman is the first openly transgender person to be elected to a city council in Illinois. As a teen growing up in Missouri, Killman said she wasn’t accepted and was forced into conversion therapy. At 17, she fled what she called a “dire situation” and moved to Carbondale. Today, she considers herself an “interstate refugee.”

“It's not like I can come here and be declared a refugee and seek asylum, but Carbondale essentially did that for me, where they opened their arms and they integrated me, and I was able to build a life here,” she said.

Like Cassidy, Killman questions whether state and federal authorities should be able to override an individual’s medical care decisions. She praises Illinois for deferring that right to the individual, regardless of what is being done at the national level.

They’re supposed to.” (Capitol News Illinois photo by Carly Gist for the Saluki Local Reporting Lab)[/caption]

“Illinois affirms your right to own your body, and so instead of kicking something back to the states, instead of the federal government mandating one way or the other, Illinois is giving people the choice,” she said. “They're not sending it back to themselves to regulate. They're giving a choice to people.”

Mallory Klocke, director of gender-affirming hormone therapy at Planned Parenthood of Illinois, said the organization has seen an increase of transgender youth traveling from out of state.

“As a program director, I review all the records of people who have already initiated care and are transferring their care to us,” Klocke said. “So I’ve definitely seen lots of people coming in from Indiana (and) people as far as Texas or Florida.”

From 2017 through 2021, 121,882 children ages 6 to 17 in the U.S. were diagnosed with gender dysphoria, according to a research analysis by Reuters Investigates and Komodo Health Inc. That’s less than 0.1% of the nation’s total population, yet the majority of states in the Midwest and South have passed laws banning medical practice for transgender youth in recent years, according to the Movement Advancement Project, an independent, nonprofit think tank.

To Charles Kolesar, a clinical director at CHOICES Center for Reproductive Health, open access in Illinois is crucial. CHOICES, which offers gender-affirming care to transgender people ages 16 and up, opened in Memphis, Tennessee, in 1974 and expanded to Carbondale in 2022.

For older adolescents, the Carbondale clinic is now their only option. Tennessee banned health care workers from providing hormones, puberty blockers and other treatments to trans youth in 2023 with the passage of Senate Bill 1, which is currently being challenged in the U.S. Supreme Court. 

“For whatever reason, places like Tennessee, it’s like their top agenda is to shut down gender-affirming care,” Kolesar said. “I mean, it’s a bizarre fixation, but yeah, I think it’s critical for places like Illinois to have the access so people can receive the care they need.”

No easy feat

While Connie was able to travel to Illinois for care, she knows not every young person in Indiana comes from a family that is supportive of their desire to transition, or has the means to travel out of state. She worries about what it means for them.

“A majority of my family is accepting and they love me, but not all people have that,” Connie said. “And the way that this (Indiana) law is made, there’s going to be blood on their hands — there’s probably already — and I think they’re evil for that.”

For many families, traveling out of state is no easy feat. Connie and her family have had to drive six-plus hours roundtrip for doctors’ appointments and rely on a network of friends and family to pick up her prescriptions from Illinois pharmacies.

Nadine McSpadden, director of advocacy and general counsel at IYG, a nonprofit organization that serves LGBTQ+ youth in Indiana, said traveling for care requires many expenses.

“You have to have a working vehicle. You have to be able to pay the gas money. You have to be able to take time off of work. You have to be able to take your child out of school. You might have to drive far enough that you have to pay for a hotel overnight, and then, of course, there’s potentially an insurance issue. Are you insured at all? If you are insured, is your insurance going to cover this out-of-state provider and whatever treatment it is you’re going to be receiving? … So it’s becoming a very cost-prohibitive exercise for a lot of these families to provide what is truly life-saving care for their kids,” she said.

The visits can also be frequent. Kolesar said patients at CHOICES come in around every three months when they first start receiving care.

“When you initiate hormone therapy, people have to have lab work,” he said. “They have to be monitored typically for liver, kidney function, that kind of stuff. … So it’s a big commitment for parents to have to follow through and support their child that way, especially when they’re having to travel and all the expense of traveling and taking time off work and that kind of thing.”

According to McSpadden, the bans have much more than just a financial impact.

“It’s hard to even describe how emotionally taxing it is for these youth and their families to feel like your own state government has such low value and esteem for your well-being that they would make it this hard for you to get the basic medical care that you need to just live your life,” McSpadden said. “Youth feel scared and isolated and stigmatized, and their parents feel, I think, a little bit panicked about how they’re going to be able to continue caring for their kids in the way that they feel like they need to as parents, because it’s becoming so challenging in so many ways.”

A recent study published in Nature Human Behavior found that anti-transgender state laws led to an increase of suicide attempts among transgender and nonbinary youth. The study, which surveyed 61,000 transgender and nonbinary youth and controlled variables such as state differences, race and age, found that suicide attempt rates increased by up to 72% among those age 13 to 17 living in states with anti-trans bans compared to those without.

“For a lot of trans and nonbinary people, being on hormone therapy is part of how they’re able to feel good in life,” Klocke, the Planned Parenthood of Illinois director, said. “Sometimes, if people have, like, medical conditions like high blood pressure or diabetes or things like that, if people feel more at home in their bodies, they’re able to manage their other medical conditions more easily and with more confidence than they might otherwise. And so stopping those hormones for young people risks people’s well-being, and oftentimes, it can risk their lives. And that’s something that we have seen time and time again.”

Connie received gender-affirming hormone therapy for around a year before Indiana outlawed it. Klocke said if patients abruptly stop receiving treatment, it can be “really, really rough.”

“When you change your hormone levels, that can be challenging,” they said. “Ask anybody who has gone through puberty if hormonal shifts affect their mood, and they will probably tell you yes. And when that’s not an active choice by a person, that can be even harder.”

A glimpse forward

Connie turned 18 in December, a critical milestone for her since the Indiana ban on transgender care is specific to minors.

“I mean, I’m glad I don’t have to go to Illinois anymore for my meds,” she said from her home in Indianapolis.

But the days of traveling to Illinois aren’t in the rear-view mirror just yet. While Connie is now able to retrieve prescriptions from Indiana pharmacies, Julia said they did not feel it was safe to switch her care back to Indiana. Trump’s rhetoric and the changing policies at the state and federal level toward transgender people still loom large. But Connie is still a senior in high school, and like anyone else at that age, she’s thinking about her own future.

At the end of the month, she’ll don a cap and gown and graduate. Senioritis hasn’t been easy, she said, but she’s looking forward to starting the next chapter of her life. She’s proud to be open and give her voice to this cause, but she longs for a day that she’ll be interviewed for more than just her gender identity — perhaps for her creative writing skills, which she plans to study in college.

“I really don’t think I should have to be a model or like a symbol,” she said. “I don’t want to be that. I just want to, you know, live my life.”

Emergency services calls skyrocketed, and health outcomes deteriorated.
Trey Caldwell, the area’s Republican state representative, said his office found at least three people died after long ambulance rides. “They would have survived,” he said, “if they could have gotten immediate emergency care right then and there.”
But hope for the community dotted with dairy farms arrived in 2023, when construction started on a new hospital. Breaking ground required state and federal law changes, funding from former President Joe Biden’s administration and, perhaps most importantly, seed money from the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Rural Development agency.
“The last thing you want to do is saddle that hospital with a lot of debt,” Caldwell said. “That USDA funding mechanism was massive. It really helped move the needle.”
But former agency officials worry fewer projects like the hospital could be built in rural America as the Trump administration and Elon Musk’s DOGE have targeted Rural Development for large staffing cuts.
With fewer employees in rural communities assisting local leaders with their funding needs, there is concern Trump’s chainsawing of the federal workforce could leave rural America without a robust safety net.
“We invest in so many businesses in rural America, and when you have fewer businesses, you have fewer jobs and fewer economic opportunities,” said Basil Gooden, who led Rural Development during Biden’s last year in office. “It’s not going to happen overnight. It’s going to take a little while before people realize things have really broken.”
In a statement, the USDA said Biden officials left the USDA “in complete disarray, including hiring thousands of employees with no sustainable way to pay them. … Fortunately, President Trump is taking strong action to support farmers.”
Rural Development is how the federal government ensures rural areas aren’t left behind as those residents move to cities for higher living standards. It funds broadband infrastructure and helps lifelong renters buy homes in population-losing communities.
Former agency officials said keeping rural areas attractive is essential to national security. Consumers have grown accustomed to the convenience of fully stocked grocery store shelves and freezers, and the country’s fuel supply increasingly uses ethanol grown in Midwestern corn fields. To keep the supply chain running, some people have to live in areas often bereft of modern-day necessities, such as hospitals or high-speed internet.
Investing in rural communities is critical to ensure a long-term agricultural workforce, especially as the average age of U.S. farmers increases rapidly. That means the people growing America’s food and fuel need access to quality grocery stores, childcare and health care.
“Farming ranks among the most hazardous occupations, making access to emergency medical services and hospitals a critical infrastructure need,” said Bette Brand, who led the agency during Trump’s first term. “Ensuring that rural families can live and work safely is fundamental to maintaining a stable food supply and sustaining agricultural productivity.”
The number of projects Rural Development has funded each year has trended downward for years, but it began to nosedive in 2021, agency data shows. Biden officials pointed to the loss of about 2,000 agency employees, out of a total of about 6,000, during the first Trump administration.
“Our investments have gone down because we just don’t have the staffing that we used to have,” Gooden said. “We don’t have the people on the ground. That’s very detrimental.”
Gooden hired about 800 more staffers during his tenure, he said, but they were probationary employees, the classification the administration has targeted for dismissal. More than 500 of the employees were let go in the administration’s mass terminations at the USDA in February.
To date, more than 1,500 Rural Development staffers have left, the USDA said — likely leaving the agency with fewer staffers than at the end of the first Trump administration. That’s roughly 10% of the 15,000 total USDA employees who have left the department.
Brand said the agency made meaningful gains in efficiency in Donald Trump’s first term. Continuing to improve efficiency, DOGE’s stated goal, is important, she said, but the recent job cuts risk destabilizing rural communities, which have largely supported Trump’s candidacies.
“There’s a persistent undercurrent of stress among federal employees that’s slowing the pace of loans and program implementation,” she said. “That doesn’t mean change isn’t needed, but the way it’s executed matters.”



She likened the agency to an ocean liner that’s left port. “It’s as if the agency is mid-voyage — charting a course and making progress — and someone dropped anchor without warning,” she said. “You don’t stop a ship of that size without consequences. The abruptness disrupts momentum, strands key personnel and risks throwing off balance the very systems rural communities rely on. Reform is necessary, but if the process causes collateral damage to people who are simply doing their jobs, it could create long-term harm.”



Brand added reforms must produce lasting results to justify the disruption.
“If you’re going to put the agency — and the communities it serves — through this kind of turbulence, the outcomes better be meaningful and durable,” she said. “Otherwise, the cost to individuals and local economies may never be recouped.”
In an early March speech, Brooke Rollins, Trump’s agriculture secretary, announced she would release a plan to restore rural prosperity in the “coming weeks.” No plan has been released yet, but she said it would improve the agency’s efficiency.
On Trump’s 100th day, Rollins released her own list of accomplishments, which included taking “leadership to make rural America prosper again.” It linked to her previous statement about her unreleased plan. In a statement to Investigate Midwest, the USDA said “more information … will be released soon.”
Rollins also said the USDA would “invite the private sector” to participate in the endeavor, and she specifically mentioned satellite internet. Musk owns Starlink, which provides satellite internet. The White House has said Musk has pledged to avoid potential conflicts of interest, according to NBC News.
Across the country, only 55% of farms have broadband access, and Starlink has been pushed as an alternative in rural areas because it relies on satellites instead of traditional cable infrastructure. But the federal official who led the government’s broadband program pilloried Starlink in a resignation letter in March, according to Politico.
“Stranding all or part of rural America with worse internet so that we can make the world’s richest man even richer is yet another in a long line of betrayals by Washington,” the official, Evan Feinman, wrote.
Asked if the USDA saw a conflict of interest in Rollins pushing satellite internet, the department did not answer directly. It said its programs are “technology neutral” and it will allow communities to decide what technology “is best for their project.”
In her March speech, Rollins added her plan will “restore more power to … local leaders who know (their) communities better than anyone in Washington.”
It’s unclear how Rollins’ plan differs from Rural Development’s existing role. The agency was designed to spur private investment in underserved areas, with the USDA acting as a lender of last resort that cannot compete with banks. Former officials said local communities largely drive what projects are funded.
The federal employees working in state Rural Development offices are also members of the communities in which they operate.
For instance, in South Dakota, local developers have received grants to update rural water systems. “It’s South Dakotans doing the work, and it’s South Dakotans who care about making sure that they’ve got clean water for their community,” said Nikki Gronli, a Biden political appointee who led the agency’s state office.
“We are a place that is often forgotten,” she added. “I think the best people to do the work here are South Dakotans because they care. It’s personal for them. I don’t see some large developer coming from Chicago or L.A. that’s going to want to invest in South Dakota with our small population.”
Out of 39 people in the South Dakota office, nine were fired in February and a few others have accepted retirement offers, Gronli said. In a matter of months, the office has been reduced to 26 staffers.
USDA Secretary Brooke Rollins speaks during a roundtable at the agency’s headquarters on May 7, 2025, in Washington D.C. (Tom Witham/USDA.
Recently, Rollins said federal workers who assist farmers with direct loans would not be terminated, according to the North Dakota Monitor. Employees with the Farm Service Agency, a separate USDA division from Rural Development, or those on the “frontline or with the farmers” would be spared, she said.
When asked if Rural Development was included in the definition of “front line,” given its importance to farmers’ lives, the USDA pointed to an April 22 declaration in which Rollins exempted “national security and public safety” positions from the hiring freeze.
“As the memo states, ‘Food Security is National Security,’ and Secretary Rollins will not compromise this critical work,” the USDA said in a statement.
The memo lists dozens of positions that are exempted, including firefighters and food inspectors. None are related to Rural Development.
 First Trump administration instituted agency cuts

Trump has often declared his love for farmers and rural communities, but, like now, his first administration targeted Rural Development for job cuts.
Months into the first Trump administration, then-Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue proposed restructuring the USDA, including abolishing the undersecretary for Rural Development position.
In the USDA hierarchy, an undersecretary is just below the department’s top leader. Several undersecretary positions exist, and they can be seen as commitments to important aspects of the USDA’s mission. Undersecretaries oversee farm production, food safety and natural resources, for example.
Perdue established an undersecretary of international trade, a priority of the first Trump administration. At the time, advocates worried the move signaled less investment in rural America.
The administration’s hiring freeze, implemented in January 2017, also affected Rural Development, and the agency reduced headcount by consolidating administrative duties, such as human resources.
Leadership at the agency turned over a few times before Brand was tapped to head it in early 2020, right before the COVID-19 pandemic started. “That leadership transition made it difficult for us to stay on target on some of these bigger priorities,” she said.
In her new role, Brand fielded complaints from state offices. “You would hear it quite often from states that said, ‘Well, I need more people. I need more help,’” she said. “But the real question was whether the issue was staffing levels or whether better technology and systems could help existing staff be more effective.”
She said modernizing operations was key to meeting demands. In her opinion, if IT systems were stronger, field staff could spend more time in the field.
When the pandemic forced the department to work remotely, Brand, who worked for decades in the farm credit industry, worried about customer service, but, she said, “our customers didn’t notice a difference.”
Although Trump and Musk have alleged that many federal employees are lazy, Brand had the opposite experience during Trump’s first term. During the pandemic, one employee in a rural area did not have high-speed internet at his house. However, he could connect to broadband at the end of his long driveway. He built a shack there so he could work remotely, Brand said.
 Trump actions reverse Biden staffing additions

When Biden officials took over the agency, they heard a similar complaint as Brand: “One of the things I heard right away from one of our veteran employees was we need more people,” said Gronli, South Dakota’s former state director.
As the pandemic still raged, Robert Lyons, a political appointee in Washington, joined the USDA’s office in late 2021. Following the previous administration’s reduction in staff, “there were less people doing more work,” he said. “Everyone was rolling up their sleeves and doing what felt like two to three jobs.”
Many employees did not document their overtime, Lyons said. “We had to tell them, ‘Hey, we need Congress to understand that when they allocate funding, this is the amount of work that’s actually going into processing these grants and meeting with the community,’ ” he said.
Fewer staffers, especially at the state level, could translate into frustrating experiences on the ground.
Bert Cunningham, the city manager of Bowie, a town of about 6,000 in north Texas, said he recently applied for a grant to extend a waterline. He had little personal interaction with agency employees, which delayed the process as he tried to navigate the agency’s website. “It’s all email with Rural Development,” he said.
The attractive part is that the USDA offers better terms than banks or other lenders, Cunningham said. It could forgive up to 40% of a loan, he said.
Eventually, Cunningham found an engineering firm that frequently works with the USDA. He said that approach has been more successful.
In the last year of Biden’s presidency, the agency pushed to hire more workers in state offices. Many of them were younger workers who, the thought was, would become the next generation of Rural Development leaders as USDA’s older workers naturally retired.

After Trump was elected, members of his transition team asked Rural Development leaders questions focused on its workforce: How many worked remotely? Where were they located? In the opinion of Gooden, Biden’s last head of Rural Development, the questions were not focused on the agency’s mission.
“That was surprising to me,” he said. “Whenever I go into an organization, I want to know what keeps folks up at night.”
Soon after inauguration day, Trump officials illegally placed a freeze on funding that Congress, the branch of government that controls America’s purse strings, had appropriated. The flow of Rural Development funding stopped.
As payments to farms stopped, state offices had little information to share. In response to the rejection of a reimbursement payment for a Maryland farm in early February, a Rural Development staffer said, “We will need to wait and see if the hold will be lifted, for now we cannot process the reimbursement,” according to records submitted in a lawsuit against Trump’s funding freeze.
On April 15, a judge ruled the USDA’s freeze was illegal and ordered funding to resume. At a May 7 Congressional hearing, Rep. Rosa DeLauro, a Connecticut Democrat, said funding for several programs, including for broadband, were still frozen. Rollins did not dispute it.
She said the USDA was complying with court orders and funding for many programs would be made available by the end of May.
 Proposed cuts to Medicaid could imperil new hospital

Oklahoma has long struggled with health care access. By 2020, Oklahoma had the second-highest uninsured rate in the country, according to Oklahoma Watch, and Tillman County had one of the highest uninsured rates in the state. About 18% of its several thousand residents had no insurance.
The first step, then, in bringing a new hospital to the area was Oklahoma’s expansion of Medicaid access. In June 2020, voters approved a ballot initiative that increased how much a family could make and still be eligible for the program. Since 2021, an additional 330,000 people have received benefits, according to the state.
Expanding Medicaid was a “godsend” for rural hospitals, said Rich Rasmussen, the Oklahoma Hospital Association’s president. It opened up a new revenue stream, as the state now reimburses hospitals for care at a level closer to private insurance. “Medicaid has the ability to close the gap for these rural hospitals,” he said.
But another obstacle presented itself at the federal level, said Caldwell, the Oklahoma state representative.
Because facilities in rural areas primarily serve small populations with many low-income and senior patients, they often require federal grants to remain operable. To qualify for the funding, the facilities must be designated as “critical access hospitals.” They need to provide 24/7 emergency care. They also need to be at least 35 miles from another critical access hospital.
The hospital’s location was too close — by several hundred feet, Caldwell said.
“We started looking at all the loopholes about the road requirements,” he said. “We started putting together a plan.”
He lobbied James Lankford, Oklahoma’s Republican U.S. Senator, who began pushing for a rule change, Caldwell said. Chuck Schumer, the current Senate minority leader for the Democrats, also advocated for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to loosen its rules, as rural New York hospitals had faced similar problems, according to his office.
In 2022, CMS clarified the distance requirement for critical access hospitals. Originally, hospitals needed to be at least 35 miles apart via a “primary road.” The definition was narrowed down to be more specific, which allowed the future hospital in Tillman County to be eligible for federal funding.
At the same time, revenue streams to build the hospital were secured.
Caldwell and a few other state representatives shepherded legislation that increased funding for rural hospitals. Money from the American Rescue Plan Act, a Biden economic stimulus to address the COVID-19 pandemic, was also tapped.
U.S. Rep. Tom Cole, a Republican that represents Tillman County and chairs the powerful appropriations committee, wrangled $6 million for the $15 million project from Rural Development. The agency’s state lead, Ken Corn, a Biden appointee and a former state senator, was also a “huge help,” Caldwell said. Corn declined to comment.
Cole said the state Rural Development office was instrumental in jumpstarting the hospital.
“I’m hardly an advocate for the Biden administration,” he said, “but the local people that we had working in the ag department were critical to this. Oklahoma is not an area that Joe Biden was going to do particularly well in, and yet the USDA stepped up.”
Caldwell said it’s his understanding the hospital’s construction has not been affected by the Trump administration’s funding freeze. Comanche County Memorial Hospital, which will run the new Tillman County facility, said the project “remains fully supported.”
But another Trump initiative could affect the hospital’s long-term viability.
Trump has advocated for slicing Medicaid funding to pay for tax cuts for the wealthy. On Monday, House Speaker Mike Johnson released the GOP’s tax plan, which includes Medicaid cuts. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated 8.6 million people would lose health care under the proposal, according to the Associated Press.
If Medicaid is slashed, that would erase a significant income source for all hospitals, impact their financial sustainability and scuttle any new projects under development, Rasmussen said. Not only would health care access suffer, but local communities would lose many jobs, further hurting their economies.
“These small hospitals would not be able to survive without that program,” he said.
Asked about cutting Medicaid, Caldwell, who chairs the state’s appropriations committee, said it was a significant concern because the state would face a budget shortfall.
Medicaid access is “in our state constitution,” he said. “If the feds pull back, we will be legally obligated to make it whole. We’ll have to find cuts in other spots of the budget.”
Speaking before the GOP’s budget was released Monday, Cole said reining in government spending was necessary to deal with the government’s budget deficit. The potential effect on the Tillman County hospital “depends on how the cuts are done,” he said.
“Everybody worries about” cuts to Medicaid, Cole said, “but this gets down to focusing on things that are essential, and I’m comfortable that that’s what we’ll do.”
Comanche, the hospital, said Medicaid cuts would have a “minimal” effect. “A significant portion of Tillman County’s population is eligible for Medicare, which is reimbursed under a different structure,” a spokeswoman said. “As a result, the hospital’s financial outlook remains stable.”
While Congress debates Medicaid cuts — and the potential fate of the Tillman County hospital — Caldwell takes pride in the work he and others did to revive a hospital. He drove by it recently, and the construction “warmed my heart,” he said.
“It’s going to save people’s lives,” he said. “There are going to be people over the next 50 years who get to spend extra time with their loved ones because that hospital is there.”

North Carolina’s gun violence crisis continues to grow more dire by the day. According to the most recent data, someone dies in our state from a gunshot wound every five hours. Think about that for a minute: that’s more than four lives lost every day.
Amazingly, however, state legislative leaders are determined to pour more gasoline on the fire.
As the latter days of the 2025 session approach, four bills on the fast track would make it even easier than it already is for just about anyone to carry a hidden, loaded weapon.
Two would allow concealed weapons in private schools. Another would make concealed carry permits good for the rest of the owner’s life. And another would allow anyone 18 or older to carry without a permit.
The bottom line: As a group of community leaders made clear last week in an event organized by North Carolinians Against Gun Violence, these bills are a recipe for even more deadly mayhem. It’s essential that lawmakers stop, listen to their constituents, and find an offramp from the dangerous road they’re headed down.

(Courtesy of Nathan Hill)A program that lets Idaho parents and spouses serve as paid caregivers is set to end in two months.
The federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, last week approved the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare’s request to end Idaho’s program.
The program, called the Family and Personal Care Services program, allows spouses and parents to be paid caregivers for their family members with disabilities. Nearly 1,200 Idaho children were enrolled in the program in October, a number that has spiked in recent years. 
‘That impossible juggle:’ How Idaho parents of disabled kids are bracing for care program’s end

The program was federally approved during the pandemic as a way to reduce COVID’s spread and address a shortage in the typical disability caregiver workforce. In November, Idaho health officials announced plans to seek to end the program, saying fraud and abuse contributed to higher program costs and enrollment levels, the Idaho Capital Sun previously reported. Last month, CMS temporarily extended Idaho’s program, which was set to expire in March. 
Disability advocates and families who participate in the family caregiver program worry kids with disabilities couldn’t get the care services they need without the program, the Sun previously reported. Idaho has a shortage of direct care workers, the typical caregivers that work in relatively low-paid, demanding jobs, according to a watchdog report by the Idaho Office of Performance Evaluations.

 CMS gave Idaho two months to end the program

In a letter on May 15, CMS approved Idaho’s request to end the family caregiver program within 60 days. After that, Idaho will no longer have the power to pay spouses and parents as disability caregivers.

But broader caregiver services that are usually provided by direct caregivers will remain in Idaho. And families in need of caregiver services have options, Idaho health officials say. 
Idaho will keep the family caregiver program in place for the next two months, Idaho Medicaid Deputy Director Juliet Charron at the Department of Health and Welfare told the Sun in an interview Monday.
“We think that’s the right thing to do — to ensure that families have enough time to become aware and to work with their provider agencies,” Charron said.
The next 60 days, she said, will be focused on “communication, connecting families to provider agencies, helping them navigate that, and working through the transition.”
Idaho officials encourage families to reach out to direct care agencies they’ve worked with in the past to see if they have availability, she said.
“CMS determined Idaho’s amendment maintains beneficiary access to needed personal care services through other Medicaid authorities and aligns with the state’s goals of simplifying service delivery and strengthening its oversight of the state Medicaid program,” a CMS spokesperson told the Sun.
 Idaho families have other options, health officials say, like using other family members as caregivers

Family members who aren’t spouses and parents of their loved ones in need of caregiver services can become trained to work as caregivers, Charron said. And spouses and parents who served as caregivers under the program ending can still work as caregivers for other families in need, she said. 
“If they have another family member, a trusted neighbor, a trusted friend who may want to do this kind of support for the family, that they connect with their provider agency to get that individual signed up and through the trainings,” Charron said. 
It just can’t be a “legally responsible individual” like a parent or spouse, she explained, but paid caregivers can be close friends or other family members, like a grandparent, or aunt or uncle. 
Idaho health officials are also seeing a rise in the number of direct care workers who provide disability caregiver services, following reimbursement increases from the Legislature, Charron said.
But those options won’t work for families, said Nathan Hill, a disability advocate who is a paid caregiver for his son with disabilities.
Direct care agencies don’t have enough staff to fill in, he told the Sun in an interview Monday. And having parents or spouses care for other kids with disabilities can create fraud, he said. 
“Nobody knows my child like me,” Hill said. 
And outside caregivers are hard to come by, and often don’t stay long, he said. 
Instead of looking to end the family caregiver program, he said Health and Welfare should’ve asked the Idaho Legislature for more funds to run it. 
And he said he’s still skeptical of Health and Welfare’s claims of fraud and abuse within the family caregiver program, saying the agency hasn’t produced evidence of substantial amounts of fraud. 
Charron, with Health and Welfare, said investigations are ongoing. 
“I can’t comment on specifics of ongoing investigations and anything referred to the Attorney General’s Office. But what I can tell you is that investigations are continuing. And we do have identified instances of fraud, waste and abuse that we are addressing through appropriate channels,” she said. 
 Public comments on Idaho’s attempt to end family caregiver program reflected broader worries

Everyone who submitted public comments on Idaho’s request to end the family caregiver program opposed ending the program, CMS wrote in its letter approving Idaho’s request. 
Most public commenters said allowing parents and spouses to become paid caregivers “improved the quality of care for beneficiaries,” CMS wrote.
Nearly a third of public commenters wanted Idaho to continue the family caregiver program “because the income provides financial stability for families,” CMS wrote. “Parents of individuals requiring (caregiver services) described challenges maintaining other types of employment due to inconsistent coverage from traditional (caregivers).”
A quarter of public commenters worried about poor outcomes and possibly losing progress if they were forced to switch from family caregivers to traditional caregivers, CMS wrote.

(Courtesy Duke Energy Indiana)
The state agency tasked with protecting utility consumers has asked regulators to reject Duke Energy Indiana’s “ill-advised” plan to retire two coal-powered units — and replace them with new natural gas units — at the Cayuga Generating Station in west-central Indiana.
The project would add more than 470 megawatts to the aging facility’s 1005-megawatt capacity. Cayuga has operated for 55-plus years and is the oldest coal-fired facility in Duke’s Hoosier fleet.
But it also comes with an estimated $3.3 billion price tag that financing costs could balloon to $5.3 billion, according to Duke. The company is one of the “big five” investor-owned regulated monopolies.
“Between 2026 and 2032, the average estimated rate impact is about 5.4%. A future rate case following that time period will determine the project’s base rate impact,” Spokeswoman Angeline Protogere said in a Monday statement to the Capital Chronicle.

If approved, Duke estimates that the first tracker filed would add $1.87 to the typical residential customer’s monthly bill. But that amount would rise as construction continues — with the Office of Utility Consumer Counselor (OUCC) estimating a total impact of $19.37 monthly.
Duke contends the pay-as-we-go approach will “smooth out” the impact to its Hoosier customers and save them an estimated $812 million over the life of the revamped facility.
In addition to requesting denial, the office asked that the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission direct Duke to consider alternatives: extending the existing units’ lifespan or converting them to natural gas.
Adding a decade to that lifespan would cost $430 million in maintenance and compliance, per Duke — and wouldn’t grow capacity. Neither would conversion.
Protogere said the utility’s Hoosier service area has gained nearly 116,000 customers since adding its last major generation facility in 2013. She added that “Indiana’s economy has been growing, and we have an obligation to meet that demand.”
Agency pushes for a “no”
In testimony filed this month, OUCC Electric Division Director Brian Latham said the investment is particularly “ill-advised” because President Donald Trump and Indiana Gov. Mike Braun are “resoundingly reexamining” the environmental factors driving the shift away from coal.
Latham further testified that technological advancements, like small modular nuclear reactors, could render the project “obsolete”  before its planned decades-long lifespan has elapsed.
The consequences of the project becoming a stranded asset are “much greater” than the costs of the alternatives, Electric Division Assistant Director Cynthia Armstrong said.
Duke’s Protogere rejected such arguments, emphasizing the “near-term need for additional power.” She wrote that “waiting to see” how regulations and technology “might evolve isn’t an option.”
Although Duke Managing Director Nathan Gagnon has testified that the new natural gas units are more affordable than conversion, Electric Division Utility Analyst John Hanks argued his cost comparisons were faulty, making retirement and replacement “look more attractive.”
OUCC Natural Gas Division Utility Analyst Jared Hoff, meanwhile, contended that Duke “inappropriately understated” its plan’s operational costs by not discussing three elements: expenses for natural gas itself, transmission via the Rockies Express Pipeline system and CenterPoint Energy Indiana North’s construction of a connector pipeline. They’re part of separate proceedings.
As Indiana manufacturing grows, ‘we clearly don’t have enough electricity,’ governor warns

Hoff estimated Duke undercounted natural gas spending by $300 million; pipeline-related estimates were redacted as “highly confidential.” He noted that Duke has entered into transmission agreements with both entities, but an executed construction contract hasn’t yet nabbed commission approval.
Other office witnesses accused Duke of overstating indirect and transmission upgrade costs and not fully evaluating some bids, while another said the utility company should choose the lesser of two options when it proposes profit margins for financing cost recovery.
Hoosiers weigh in
More than 2,000 public comments — in support and opposition — were additionally filed.
“We need much more capacity to allow for growth of industry,” wrote Bedford resident Bradford Dykes, while Terre Haute mechanical construction company Freitag-Weinhardt called the project a “sound investment in Indiana’s energy future.”
The Indiana State Building & Construction Trades Council applauded the expected 550 construction jobs, plus long-term operations jobs and increased property tax revenue for Vermillion County.
In other comments, Hoosiers railed against rising bills.
“People have to choose whether to pay for groceries, medicine or their electric bill(s),” plus “whether to run their air conditioning or suffer through the heat,” wrote Valparaiso resident Marissa Barnes. “We heard as much through the public hearings for Duke’s 2024 rate case, and that was before folks saw their Duke bills increase by $19/month from the rate hike they just got.”
“There won’t be any AC in hell when you people get there,” wrote Marty Wyatt, who accused regulators of taking bribes. He didn’t identify his place of residence.
Others professed support for coal’s retirement at Cayuga but were unsatisfied with natural gas as the replacement — “another fossil fuel,” wrote Bloomington resident Christine Glaser.
Citizens Action Coalition and Reliable Energy, two groups often on opposite sides of the energy debates, also opposed the plan. The latter called the office’s recommendation a “major victory for Indiana ratepayers.
Duke is scheduled to file rebuttal testimony May 29.

After a pair was discovered nesting in Wyoming, scientists hope to learn more about the eastern owls' behavior and their implications for native raptors.
The post Researchers tag Wyoming’s first barred owl near its Grand Teton nest appeared first on WyoFile .","Jackson researchers had been attempting to trap the male barred owl for more than a week, but the wary raptor was proving elusive. First, the owl swooped in for the bait mouse but glanced off the trap. The next time, he performed evasive flight maneuvers and escaped. 
Then on Thursday, they set up a different trap in the Teton County forest habitat, this time with dho-gazza nets — fine mist nets designed to envelop raptors that unknowingly fly into them. 
“And then, literally out of nowhere, the female came in and got caught,” said Bryan Bedrosian, conservation director at the Teton Raptor Center. 
His team affixed the female with a GPS tracker. And like that, the bird became the first-known barred owl tagged in Wyoming. To Bedrosian’s knowledge, it’s also the first barred owl tagged in the Rocky Mountains.
The tagging comes two years after the pair became the first documented nesting barred owls in Wyoming, news that ruffled some scientific feathers. Though they are eastern birds, barred owls have expanded their range westward through the boreal forests of Canada and down into the Pacific Northwest, where they have outcompeted the imperiled northern spotted owls and created significant management conflicts.

Wyoming raptor experts and others are wary about the impact the adaptable and aggressive barred owls could have on native species like great gray owls. 
Those concerns prompted the Teton Raptor Center to initiate the tracking project. Bedrosian and his team aim to tag the female’s wily mate, along with any chicks that hatch from a nest the pair is currently tending. The goal is to gather data on the birds’ movement and behavior to see if and how it’s impacting other raptors.
“I’m not suggesting we do anything right now, but with any invasive species, it’s always easiest to do action at the beginning rather than being reactionary later,” Bedrosian said. Information gathering is step one. 
Potential competition
Barred owls are similar in size to great horned owls, but lack the distinctive “horns.” They are similar in profile to great gray owls, but are smaller and have black eyes in contrast to the great grays’ yellow ones. 
In Washington, Oregon and California, their negative impacts on federally protected northern spotted owls have prompted wildlife authorities to classify them as invasive. Barred owls, which are territorial and eat a variety of prey, have edged out the more shy and specialized spotted owls. 
The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has wrestled with the issue for years, even resorting to killing barred owls to help prevent further damage to the declining spotted owls. Those conflicts stirred up concern after the nesting pair was documented in Wyoming by nature photographer Tom Stanton.

But Wyoming, unlike the PNW, has limited data.
The relationship between barred and spotted owls in the Pacific Northwest is “one of the most extensively studied cases of competitive exclusion in the history of wildlife ecology,” said Wyoming Fish and Game Nongame Bird Biologist Zach Wallace.
Meanwhile, Wallace said, “next to nothing is known about potential competition between barred owls and great gray owls.”
The Wyoming project, he said, is a good step toward filling in that information gap. That’s why his agency helped support the application for a grant that’s helping to fund it. 
The National Park Service is also in the loop on the project and monitoring the situation, Bedrosian said. 
Data gathering 
Barred owl sightings are not unheard of in Wyoming — the 2023 report is just the first documentation of a nesting pair. What scientists are trying to understand now is what the nesting birds do year round, and if others are present in the state and pose competition to other owls. 
Teton Raptor Center is approaching the questions with a multi-pronged strategy. One prong involves analyzing years of historic acoustic data in the region.
The center also received grants from the Wyoming Governor’s Big Game License Coalition, the Jackson Hole Community Foundation and the Jackson Conservation District to help monitor the birds with GPS transmitters, satellite trackers and acoustic recorders. 

Tom Stanton first glimpsed evidence that barred owls had successfully bred in Wyoming on June 28, 2023, when two fluffy chicks poked their heads from the tree cavity. Their mother watched from the cavity. (Thomas Stanton) 
The team this spring placed recorders in roughly 200 spots in the Grand Teton National Park vicinity — those recorders yielded proof that at least one other individual, likely a bachelor male, has been in the region.
The final piece is the tracking. The hope is to tag each member of the nesting family, Bedrosian said. The owls produced three chicks in 2023, but their nest failed in 2024. They are nesting again currently, though it’s unknown how many eggs they have. 
But if they get trackers on all of the owls, ecologists can better understand their territory, where they spend the winter months, where their offspring go and if there is competition with other species. 
“One of the biggest concerns is the potential impact on other species that aren’t used to this generalist, very aggressive predator,” Bedrosian said. 
“Where this bird has been located is a historic great gray owl territory that is now vacant,” he continued. “And so did the barred owls push out the great gray? We don’t know. But if you take evidence from the Pacific Northwest with the spotted owls, it doesn’t look good.”

Without proper teacher training and enforceable policies, literacy becomes a privilege when it should be available to all K-12 students, write three mothers of children with dyslexia.
The post The tragedy of dyslexia in Wyoming appeared first on WyoFile .","In Wyoming, reading is not a guaranteed right — it’s a privilege. For children with dyslexia, the state’s failure to provide timely, evidence-based support has created a crisis. Education should level the playing field, but in Wyoming, only families with legal knowledge and financial means can secure necessary services. For many, the system’s failure is not just inadequate — it’s tragic.

Opinion

A hidden crisis
Dyslexia affects 10-20% of the population and is the most common learning disability. Yet Wyoming’s schools lack a structured, evidence-based approach to identifying and supporting dyslexic students. Without early intervention, these children fall behind academically and suffer emotionally, while their needs go unrecognized.
A system that favors the privileged
Wyoming lacks strong dyslexia laws and consistent policies. Many students are never screened and teachers are not required to use evidence-based methods. Families with resources can pay for private evaluations, legal help and tutoring. Those without are left behind — especially in rural communities — trapped in a cycle of illiteracy.
Deliberate indifference
This is not just a moral failure — it is a legal one. Wyoming school districts are violating federal law. By failing to provide appropriate accommodations and evidence-based interventions for students with dyslexia, they are in direct violation of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act and the Americans with Disabilities Act. These laws exist to protect the rights of students with disabilities.
The Wyoming Department of Education and the school districts have actual knowledge of the educational needs of students with dyslexia. They are aware of what these students require to access education equally, yet often fail to act or respond with reckless indifference. Parents repeatedly voice concerns and file complaints, but many are ignored, dismissed or forced into lengthy legal battles. This deliberate inaction, despite clear evidence and expert recommendations, constitutes more than neglect — it is a violation of students’ civil rights.
The harm is well known: When schools deny timely, structured literacy instruction, dyslexic children fall further behind, experience emotional distress and lose confidence. Families, when they can afford to, are spending tens of thousands of dollars on private services — services that are supposed to be provided under federal law at no cost to them. Meanwhile, students from low-income or rural communities are left without recourse, further entrenching inequity.
Wyoming’s neglect is not only unethical — it is unlawful.
Dyslexia and potential
Dyslexia is not a marker of low intelligence. Many successful figures — from Albert Einstein to Stephen Spielberg to Bill Gates — have dyslexia. These children are bright and capable, but Wyoming’s inaction robs them of their future. If the state truly valued these students, it would invest in proper teacher training and enforce policies that ensure access to structured literacy.
A call to action
Wyoming must:

Mandate early and ongoing dyslexia screening for K-12 students.
Require teacher certification in International Dyslexia Association-approved methods in every school.
Establish legally enforceable dyslexia policies that ensure schools provide structured literacy instruction.
Remove financial discrimination for families seeking basic services for their children to read.

The state’s continued inaction sends a clear message: Literacy is not a right for all — it is a privilege reserved for those who can afford to fight for it. It’s time to make it a right for everyone. The state knows what works — so why isn’t it acting?

Civil rights advocates fear such a scenario if under a Republican bill that defines a riot as a public disturbance, an act of violence or a “clear and present danger” of property destruction or personal injury involving at least three people. A similar bill was introduced in 2017 by Rep. John Spiros (R-Marshfield). A new version is  (AB-88), authored by Rep. Shae Sortwell (R-Two Rivers) and Sen. Dan Feyen (R- Fond du Lac). 
People who say their property was damaged or vandalized during what the bill defines as a “riot” would also be able to seek civil damages from people or organizations that “provided material support or resources with the intent that such support or resources would be used to perpetrate the offense,” under the bill. It also prohibits government officials with direct authority over law enforcement agencies from limiting or restricting those agencies’ ability to quell vandalism or rioting, as defined by the bill.
  The Wisconsin Examiner’s Criminal Justice Reporting Project shines a light on incarceration, law enforcement and criminal justice issues with support from the Public Welfare Foundation.
Jon McCray Jones, a policy analyst at the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) of Wisconsin is concerned that the bill’s definition of a “riot” is too vague. “Using that definition, a riot could be three teenagers driving around in a car knocking off mail boxes,” McCray Jones told Wisconsin Examiner. “Technically, with this definition, a riot could be a food fight.” The bill’s language concerning people who “urge, promote, organize, encourage, or instigate others to commit a riot” is also vague according to McCray Jones, who says this aspect of the bill would open protest leaders and organizers up to criminal and civil liability, regardless of their involvement in rioting.
Sortwell and Feyen did not respond to requests for comment for this story. In written testimony before the Assembly Committee on Judiciary on May 7, both lawmakers said that riots have become more common in recent years. “We saw the destructive riots a few years ago in several metropolitan areas, including right here in Madison and Kenosha,” said Sortwell, referring to George Floyd-inspired protests and unrest in 2020. “Taking a walk down State Street, one would see busted doors and windows of businesses, products stolen, and a smashed statue of a Civil War hero. Several business owners, employees, and citizens had their lives upended.”
Feyen said that “peaceful protests are a cornerstone of our public discourse and will always be protected under the First Amendment, but a line needs to be drawn when those protests go from being peaceful to being destructive and violent.” Although the bill does not  mention specific protests, Feyen wrote, “stricter penalties are needed to deter protesters from crossing that line from protest to property destruction, vandalism, arson, and physical violence.” 
Although scenes of burning buildings and looted stores received a lot of news coverage in 2020, studies suggest that at least 96% of Black Lives Matter protests during the movement’s peak in May and June of 2020 were peaceful. Reports by TMJ4 found that 74.3% of the nearly 200 people who’d been placed on an intelligence list by police in Milwaukee county that year had never been charged with a misdemeanor or felony. Some reports, however, using data derived from insurance claims, estimate that as much as $2 billion in damage nationally occurred due to protests in 2020. 
Some residents of Kenosha – a city referenced by the bill’s authors – recall how months of non-violent protest in Kenosha after Floyd’s death were overshadowed by the unrest that  occurred in August 2020. The shooting of Jacob Blake by Kenosha officer Rusten Sheskey, which paralyzed Blake, led to days of protest and unrest, millions of dollars worth of property destruction, and ended when  then-17-year-old Kyle Rittenhouse fatally shot two people and wounded another, in what a jury later ruled was an act of self-defense.

During committee hearings on May 7, Sortwell said that the bill seeks to punish not only people who commit vandalism but also “those people who put together the riot.”
Several groups have either lobbied or spoken out against the bill. The Wisconsin Civil Justice Council submitted written testimony opposing the bill on the behalf of “16 business associations working together on civil liability matters.” The council said that the bill would allow for civil compensation for emotional distress stemming from property destruction, noting that emotional damages are generally limited. AB-88 would also allow for any civil compensation to include attorneys’ fees, which would be another departure from current law, the council wrote. Others spoke against the bill in person on May 7, pointing to the bill’s broad language and the chilling effect it could have on political movements. 
“This bill is just a blatant attempt to stop people from protesting,” said McCray Jones. “This is a way to silence organizers from fighting for political change and threatening the status quo in power.” Organizers could potentially be sued for anything that happens at a protest, or even just for transporting someone to a protest that later turns into a riot, as defined under the bill. 
What counts as urging or promoting a riot is broad enough to include common protest chants, like “no justice, no peace,” McCray Jones said. “And if you have ambitious or politically motivated district attorneys…politically motivated prosecutors, the vagueness of this bill could be weaponized … free speech now gets criminally turned into inciting a riot.” 
McCray Jones added that he wonders what a police figure like former Milwaukee PD Chief Harold Breier — notorious for targeting and surveilling Black, brown and LGBTQ communities — would have been able to accomplish had such a law been at his disposal.

As police departments develop their social media surveillance capabilities, it’s possible under the bill that making posts encouraging people to attend a protest could be seen as an attempt to “urge, promote, organize, encourage, or instigate” a riot under the bill. After the protests of 2020, some agencies that monitored protesters enacted new intelligence-gathering policies to help prevent broad, ideology-based surveillance.  
“I think that right now this moment gives us a very opportune chance to highlight the importance of protecting the privacy of protesters here in Wisconsin,” McCray Jones told Wisconsin Examiner. McCray Jones said he hopes debate about the bill  will become “a jumping off point to talk about not just data privacy for protesters, not just privacy from law enforcement for marginalized communities, but what does it look like to re-think our position on surveillance in the midst of this regime in D.C. that is blatantly ignoring due process, the rule of law, and civil rights.”",https://wisconsinexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/IMG_9439-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-05-20 07:08:18.976649

(Photo by Shirlaine Forrest/Getty Images)We’ve all heard about the nine Republican state Senators who decided they were going to start voting their conscience, only to be censured by their own party. As if they would somehow become contagious. 
This series of events reminded me of something I’ve been wondering about, which is: Why it has become so fashionable to present ‘liberals’ as if we are dangerous, scary people. It is now one of those labels that Republicans throw around in order to discredit a person’s character. It showed up on every other flyer that I received during the last election cycle. And of course it’s one of those terms, for example “communist,” that most people probably wouldn’t be able to define if you asked them, even liberals themselves.
So I thought about the qualities that most of my friends have in common. And the top thing on that list would probably be curiosity. I hang out with people who always want to learn more, whether it’s about you, or about the history of the region where they live, or about whatever hobby they’re interested in. And of course that also means that they are readers. Because what is the best way to learn? 
Another thing that most of my friends have in common is that they love people. They love meeting new people, they like to be in small groups where they can have discussions. They like to connect. And they like to help. I feel fortunate to know so many people who believe that helping others helps them become better people. And it also helps make the world a better place.
So far, I’m not seeing a lot to be scared of. But let’s keep looking.
Most of my friends love the arts. They love how music and films and dance and visual arts force them to look at things a little differently. They love how songs and movies make them feel something, whether it’s warm or frightening or confusing or ecstatic, the arts bring strong emotional responses into our lives in a way that is always unpredictable and surprising.
Most of my friends also love to be outside. They love what the earth has to offer. They like the challenge of a long bike ride, or a hike into the mountains. They like to hunt and fish, or float one of the incredible rivers that flow through our beautiful state. They value having access to the best that Montana has to offer.
A few days ago, Bruce Springsteen, who is only three years younger than Trump but looks at least 10 years younger, opened his latest tour in Manchester, England by sitting down at the front of the stage and delivering a calm, measured criticism of the current president. He didn’t make anything up or call him a bunch of juvenile names. He didn’t threaten him. He just laid out his opinion of the man’s actions in a way that was thoughtful and most importantly, factual. Here’s how he opened his speech, and it’s pretty brilliant:
“In America, my home, they’re persecuting people for their right to free speech and voicing their dissent. That’s happening now. In America, the richest men are taking satisfaction in abandoning the world’s poorest children to sickness and death. That’s happening now. In my country, they’re taking sadistic pleasure in the pain they inflict on loyal American workers. They’re rolling back historic civil rights legislation that led to a more just society. They’re abandoning our great allies and siding with dictators against those who are struggling for their freedom. That’s happening now. They are defunding American universities that won’t bow down to their ideological demands. And they are removing residents off American streets without due process of law and deploying them to foreign detention centers and prisons. That’s happening now.”
So maybe that’s it. It’s the honesty.
Most of my friends have never been convicted of a felony. Most of them have never been accused of rape, especially by multiple sources. Most of my friends wouldn’t think of referring to another country as a “sh–hole country.” They wouldn’t think to lump an entire race of people into one group and make sweeping generalizations about those people. Most of my wealthy friends wouldn’t think of rubbing their wealth in your face, or bragging about the fact that they don’t pay taxes, because they do. Most of them wouldn’t brag about going into the dressing room of a bunch of teenage girls while they’re getting ready for a pageant.
Most of my friends wouldn’t encourage people to beat the crap out of other people. Most of them wouldn’t make up lies on the spot just to make others look bad because they got their feelings hurt.
So the only thing that I can think of that makes liberals scary is that they try like hell to be honest, and if there’s one thing that scares Republicans at this moment in time, it’s the truth. Springsteen is fortunate to be huge enough that he can lose a huge chunk of his fan base without worrying about his career going off the rails. 
But of course that doesn’t stop Donald Trump from trying his damnedest to discredit the man. And among other things, that means hitting him over the head with the dreaded “liberal” label. It didn’t stop Springsteen from doing the same thing at his next few stops, to the dismay of many of his long-term fans, and as someone so accurately pointed out, have they not been paying attention to what this man has stood for from the beginning?
The saddest part about Trump’s tantrums is how utterly childish they are. He always resorts to the most basic insults, saying he never liked Springsteen and that he has no talent—a meaningless insult coming from a guy who pals around with Kid Rock and Ted Nugent. Trump has and always will resort to the lowest form of attack, and that is exactly why he is so threatened by someone like Bruce, who did just the opposite.
So I guess I’ll keep doing what most of my friends have been doing, trying to become better people, failing here and there, but always striving to improve. Telling the truth as well as we know how, without resorting to hissy fits when someone offers constructive criticism. And hopefully it will continue to scare the hell out of these people.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/GettyImages-2215118078.jpg,,,2025-05-20 07:08:18.976649

Kevin Dietsch/Getty ImagesFormer Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms is announcing Tuesday that she is entering the race for Georgia governor in 2026, the second Democrat to declare a run for the state’s top job.
Bottoms served as mayor of Atlanta from 2018 to 2022, but after a controversial first term decided against seeking reelection. Bottoms would later become a senior advisor to former President Joe Biden.
Bottoms said Monday that she was prepared for the role of governor after achieving historic pay raises for Atlanta police officers and firefighters and ensuring the vitality of small businesses, especially during the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic.
During her tenure as mayor, Bottoms faced several crises, from the pandemic to a citywide cyberattack.
She came under withering attack for her handling of protests after the murder of George Floyd in the spring of 2020, especially for allowing an armed encampment at a burned down Atlanta Wendy’s that didn’t end until a girl was murdered while riding in a car near the scorched restaurant.
One of the most important lessons Bottoms said she learned was the importance of being prepared for uncertain times.
“When I left as mayor of Atlanta, even in the midst of this historic economic downturn, we still had $180 million in our rainy day fund,” she said. “We didn’t lay off a single employee. We even gave our sanitation workers $500 additional pay each month, hazard pay during COVID. We didn’t raise taxes, we didn’t furlough employees, and it was because we planned ahead and we had a north star to always be able to deliver for our communities.”
Georgia’s 2026 election for governor is wide open with GOP Gov. Brian Kemp term-limited. A large number of candidates are expected to run and several have already thrown their hats into the ring.
Republican candidates who have entered the governor’s race or are considering running for governor include Georgia Attorney General Chris Carr, who announced his candidacy in November. Lt. Gov. Burt Jones is expected to run against Carr for the chance to oppose the Democratic nominee in November 2026.
Bottoms is the second Democratic candidate with name recognition to enter the race for governor. In May, Atlanta state Sen. Jason Esteves launched his campaign.
Meg Scribner, Esteves’ campaign manager, responded to Bottoms’ announcement by saying they are ready to take on any new challenger.
“Jason represents a new wave of Democratic leadership, and that is already energizing voters in Georgia,” Scribner said. “As a former teacher, (Atlanta) school board chair, small business owner, and state senator, Georgians can count on Jason to stay in the fight and build a winning coalition that will flip the Governor’s seat in 2026.”
Bottoms says her campaign will prioritize issues that are important outside of Atlanta. She said if she’s elected governor, she’ll push to expand Medicaid to cover health insurance for about 300,000 people, support small businesses and eliminate teacher income taxes.
“We all want safe and thriving communities,” Bottoms said. “We all want economic stability. We all want job opportunities. We all want access to quality public education. We all want access to quality health care.”
Bottoms said she’s ready to take criticism for not running for a second term leading the city of Atlanta.
She says points in her favor are the way she stood up to Trump in his first term during her first three years as Atlanta mayor.
Even though they disagree politically, Bottoms says she’s willing to work with any president.
“We can work with any administration that’s trying to do right by our communities, then I’ll be a leader that works alongside people, even if we don’t have the same political affiliation,” Bottoms said. “But to the extent that policies are coming out of the White House like they are now, that’s harming our communities, then I’m going to fight to the bitter end to make sure that Georgia has what it needs to thrive.”
Andra Gillespie, a political science professor at Emory University, said it’s important for Bottoms to have a strong turnout of Black voters in the primary and general election as well as winning support outside of Atlanta.
“She has the advantage of having led George’s largest city,” Gillespie said. “She has the advantage of having some support from Washington D.C. Democratic figures.
“I think some of the disadvantages are the fact that this would be her first campaign running for statewide office. It’s not that she’s a novice or an inexperienced candidate, but I’ve done research that would suggest that she would be better served if she held statewide office before the fact,” Gillespie said.
“For somebody like Sen. Esteves, he can test the water, but if it doesn’t look like it’s going well, he would have time to change if he needed to and return to the Senate,” Gillespie said.
According to Gillespie, the looming question among Democratic candidates is whether Stacey Abrams will make a third run after the governor’s mansion after narrowly losing to Kemp in 2018 and then more decisively in 2022.
Democrats need to resolve organizational problems to have a chance to beat a Republican for governor, Gillespie said.
“They’re all going to tout their own achievements and their own experience,” Gillespie said. “I think the larger question for Democrats is who is best positioned to run against whoever the Republicans end up nominating for office.”
In 2020, Gillespie sees a Republican opponent trying to pigeonhole Bottoms as a “woke’” candidate, challenged for her stances on COVID policies and handling of protests.
“I expect that somebody might try to use that against her, both in the primary and in the general election,” she said. “And then there’s also the (issue of) having been out of the political spotlight for, you know, a long period of time.”

Patrick Morrisey to serve as secretary of the West Virginia Department of Human Services. (Will Price | West Virginia Legislative Photography)On a Thursday evening in Parkersburg, a group of local residents gathered to discuss West Virginia foster care — a system that is struggling from top to bottom with thousands of kids in care.
A moderator asked foster and biological parents, child welfare workers, judges and others to describe their experience with the system. 
Their responses: “Challenging.” “Overwhelming.” “Traumatizing.” “Broken.”
“Nobody would listen. Nobody would talk to me,” said Lisa Easter, who had more than 50 foster children in her home in 25 years. 
Julie Jones stopped fostering after Child Protective Services went months without checking on a newborn baby in her care. She was mailed a blank birth certificate and worried if the state was aware of the child’s whereabouts. “I couldn’t do it any longer,” she said.
In the corner of the room, new Department of Human Services Secretary Alex Mayer listened as people described a frustrating system riddled with inconsistencies, staffing shortages, an overwhelmed judicial system, limited support and children who have been victims of it all. 
Mayer, who came from South Dakota, believes it can be fixed. It’s going to take time, he says, but work is underway. He is focused on accountability, transparency and putting in processes that aren’t in place for consistency. He wants more in-state programs that can help kids with behavioral health struggles. 
“It’s going to be incremental over time,” Mayer said. “I think it’s going to be a long road until we have everything addressed confidently … You’ll be seeing here shortly some really positive steps.”
A federal judge recently said West Virginia’s foster care system has suffered from “shocking neglect” and “bureaucratic indifference.” 
There’s a shortage of social workers, support services and safe homes for children in a state that is fastest to remove children from homes and terminate parental rights. Too many children have ended up living in hotel rooms, and the state spent $70 million last year sending foster kids to out-of-state group homes. 
“The thing that was shocking to me was the number of kids in care,” Mayer said. 
There are more than 6,100 children in West Virginia foster care, and the number has skyrocketed during the state’s drug crisis. The state’s high poverty rate has contributed to the number, too.
Gov. Patrick Morrisey appointed 37–year-old Mayer to oversee DoHS.
Mayer will have to grapple with pervasive foster care problems as the Trump administration proposes cuts to programs that serve families in poverty and help vulnerable kids. The state could see a decline in federal funding, impacting programs like Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program that are intertwined with child welfare. DoHS also oversees Medicaid, SNAP and more.
“Child welfare is a very intricate, complex system, and there’s a lot of different players, which … obviously increases the level of complexity,” Mayer said. “I’ve been really intentional and just trying to get out to learn the system.”

Mayer, who was adopted, spent time in the military before working at a residential facility that served people with severe mental illnesses He later worked in South Dakota’s state government, dealing with SNAP and child welfare. 
“Different steps in my life have led me down this path,” he said. “Over time, I think I’ve just developed this passion for solving problems, which I think has inherently then created this desire to support families and kids … I just have a passion for helping.”
He has spent the last few months traveling the state meeting with his staff, touring residential facilities and trying to understand how the system works. 
The federal government is continuing its oversight of West Virginia’s foster care system after it was flagged for sending too many children with disabilities to group homes. The state still sends children with disabilities to group homes and treatment centers at a rate three times the national average. 
Two-hundred and seventy children are in out-of-state facilities around the county — some miles away from their biological families — because the state doesn’t have enough in-state beds that can serve children’s complex needs. The state’s CPS workers are required to visit kids once a month. 
Mayer said he’s examining where the state could increase specialized care, like being able to serve children with aggressive or sexualized behaviors who aren’t able to be served in a traditional foster home.
“We don’t have placements for these kids. Well, that’s not an option anymore,” he said. “And, if those placements aren’t here … then we have to find a way to make that happen, because we want to keep kids as close as possible to their support network for a variety of reasons.”
There’s a shortage of foster families, and Mayer hopes to bolster recruitment and support services. 
He noted that a glaring shortage  of after school and summer programs for teens, which could be useful in helping working parents take in teenagers in foster care. Teens ages 13 to 17 are the most common age group in state foster care.
There’s also a need for creating agency processes that will breed consistently in decision making across the state, Mayer said. Child welfare cases involve a number of stakeholders — judges, attorneys, CPS workers and others — who all have an opinion and sometimes decision making about a child’s future. 
“I think our practice model is one of those pieces that needs some real work,” he said.
Earlier this year, Mayer pushed back on a Republican-sponsored bill, which ultimately failed, that would have mandated an outside audit of the foster care system. Mayer vowed changes to lawmakers without a study. 
Potential federal funding changes under Trump
West Virginia’s foster care system relies on federal and state funding, and there’s some unpredictability in spending due to kids fluctuating in and out of care and the rising price of out-of-state facilities. 
Lawmakers, who have struggled in recent years to get a handle on the agency’s spending, allocated more than $300 million to foster care in their recently-passed budget. Their 2026 budget bill mandated that DoHS spend some money on designated line items to prevent the agency from shifting money around to pay bills. But Morrisey vetoed that idea, saying it was too restrictive for DoHS. 
The Republican governor,  who wants to reign in state spending, also vetoed line item funding for programs that support babies born with Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome and foster children.
Mayer said that right now, he doesn’t think the department needs additional funding to tackle the crisis. It will likely rely on partnerships with the faith-based community, businesses and others that provide services to help children and families, he said.
“I think we just need to get more attention on what is it going to take?” he said. “I don’t know what that funding would be, or if it needs to be anything.”
The state’s federal funding could change since Republicans in Washington have proposed cuts to SNAP and Medicaid — a program that provides health insurance to West Virginia foster children and half of all children in the state. 
“We’ve been watching that really intently,” Mayer said regarding the potential federal changes.
This month, he has traveled around the state for additional foster care listening sessions in towns including Beckley, Burlington and Wheeling to hear from families, CPS workers and others. It’s important, he said. The outside firm leading the sessions will compile a report detailing problems and potential solutions.
“I’m kind of excited to see, you know, what we’re able to accomplish here,” he said.



DoHS responds to latest update in foster care lawsuit
A Better Childhood, a group representing children suing the state over its troubled foster care system, wants the lawsuit revived after a judge tossed the case in February. 
In an email, a DoHS spokesperson said, “We recognize that the only way to facilitate and bring about real change is to bring all of the key players together to openly and honestly discuss problems and develop real solutions.

Preserving biodiversity in the Badger State is a multi-faceted effort, merging legislative efforts with organized social gatherings to find creative solutions. 
Late last week, a package of bills was introduced to help shore up protections for pollinators. The package of seven bills has a range of policy objectives including:

Requiring state agencies and government entities to give preference to use native prairie and forage plants to benefit pollinators. 
Designating June 2025 as Pollinator Awareness Month in Wisconsin. 
Allowing a political subdivision to regulate pesticides for the purpose of protecting pollinators and pollinator habitats. 
Prohibiting people who sell plants from advertising or labeling the plants as good for pollinators if they are treated with certain insecticides.
Establishing a “Protect Pollinators” license plate program, similar to other conservation-focused license plate programs. 
Prohibiting the DNR from using any insecticide from the neonicotinoid class near any pollinator habitat located on DNR-maintained land. 
Designating Rusty Patched Bumble Bee as the state native insect and requiring the Wisconsin Blue Book to include information concerning that designation. 

The bills were announced in Menasha by Reps  Lee Snodgrass (D- Appleton) and Vincent Miresse (D- Stevens Point). Luke Schiller, executive director of the Heckrodt Wetland Reserve and Sara Walling, Clean Wisconsin’s water program director, attended the announcement. 
Pollinators are important not only to ecosystems, but also to the global economy. According to an article in Forbes, pollinators contribute between $235 billion and $577 billion in global food production. Pollinators come in all shapes and sizes and include bees, hummingbirds, butterflies and certain species of bats. Decades of overusing pesticides and habitat destruction have contributed to staggering declines in pollinator populations across the globe, and throughout ecosystems. 
The Department of Natural Resources (DNR) is seeking volunteers to monitor one of those pollinators, the Karner blue butterfly. Volunteers have been crucial  in tracking the endangered butterfly since 2018. Although the butterflies are found from Minnesota to Maine to Canada, Wisconsin has the largest remaining population. Karner Blue Butterflies are threatened by habitat loss fragmenting their range into isolated pockets and climate change. Open barrens, savannas and prairies are still abundant in Wisconsin, and are ideal habitats for the butterfly. 
“Volunteers will be able to identify Karner blue butterflies and help us collect data to look at how this species moves around the landscape over time,” Chelsea Weinzinger the DNR’s Karner blue butterfly recovery coordinator said in a statement. “Collecting this information improves our data and gives us a better statewide picture of how this species is faring.” The Karner is related to the northern blue butterfly, which some DNR researchers say they haven’t seen since 2010 in Wisconsin. 
Field trip opportunities are also available through the Natural Resources Foundation of Wisconsin. The field trips occur across the state and range from paddling wetland habitats to joining researchers in Beaver Creek Reserve to learn about the state’s smallest falcon species. Several field trips are also occurring in the Milwaukee-area, offering people the chance to canoe under tree canopies on the Milwaukee River, traverse urban habitats, explore hardwood forests and wetlands in the Mequon Nature Preserve   and much more.

(Kentucky Lantern photo by Sarah Ladd) Kentuckians living with addiction can call Kentucky’s help line at 833-859-4357. Narcan, which can help reverse overdoses, is available at pharmacies for sale and through some health departments and outreach programs for free. 
Even though overdose deaths have declined over the last three years, Kentucky still has one of the highest rates of opioid use disorder (OUD) in the United States, according to a national report released Tuesday. 
“The cost of addiction: Opioid use disorder in the United States” shows Kentucky is one of four states where the rate of opioid use disorder is higher than 2.5% of the population aged 12 or older. The others are New Hampshire, Nevada and Massachusetts. 
  Margaret Scott is a principle at Avalere Health. (Photo provided)
Margaret Scott, an author of the study from Avalere Health, said the estimate is based on the National Survey on Drug Use. The report doesn’t look at factors that might lead to higher or lower rates of cases. 
“We did rely on the national figures from the national survey, but this is self reported cases of opioid use disorder, so it is possible that individuals in those states are more likely to self report,” she said.  
In 2024, 1,410 Kentuckians died from an overdose, according to the 2024 Drug Overdose Fatality Report. In 2023, there were 1,984 overdose deaths, which was a decrease from the 2,135 lost in 2022. 
“It is encouraging to see the number of overdose deaths decreasing,” Scott said. “We’re still seeing 80,000 overdose deaths in the country. It’s hard to say what is contributing to that decline (in Kentucky), but we do know that OUD is still a significant problem.” 
Ben Mudd, the executive director of the Kentucky Pharmacists Association, said Kentucky does a lot right when it comes to diagnosing and treating addiction. 
“There’s been a huge focus on harm reduction and naloxone distribution and I think that is why we’ve seen the decrease in overdose deaths,” Mudd told the Lantern.  
But that intervention, which can reverse an overdose, “doesn’t necessarily stop new cases.” 
“Those cases still exist,” Mudd said. “There’s so much naloxone out there, people are educated, perhaps people aren’t using alone, things like that. All of those programs that have been put in place have led to fewer overdoses, but not necessarily a reduced number of people with opioid use disorder.” 
  A new report, “The cost of addiction: Opioid use disorder in the United States,” shows Kentucky still has one of the highest rates of opioid use disorder (OUD) in the United States. (Screenshot)
What does the report show? 
Tuesday’s report is mostly interested in the costs surrounding OUD and the economic impact of addiction. 
“Some of the costs that we estimated included things like lost income taxes based on the lost productivity for businesses as well as employees’ lost wages. We looked at property, client crime from OUD, as well as different types of costs to the state and local governments,” Scott said. “Those costs included things like Medicaid direct costs for substance use treatment, as well as those lost income taxes and corporate taxes, and then, of course, the criminal justice costs, which would include police presence, courts, jails, all of those things.” 
  Compared to other states, West Virginia, Ohio, Kentucky and Maine had the highest state and local spending on opioid use disorder as a proportion of state gross domestic product, according to a new report. (Screenshot)
In Kentucky, OUD costs big bucks, according to the report: 

Kentucky has one of the highest rates of opioid use disorder in the nation. 
Opioid use disorder costs Kentucky about $95 billion, with an average cost per case of $709,441. 
State and local governments bear more than $2 billion in costs, primarily driven by criminal justice expenses and lost tax revenue. 
The state/local per capita OUD cost is among the highest nationally, between $400-$500 per resident annually.  
OUD-related costs in Kentucky are more than 6% of the state’s gross domestic product.

“Our study shows that barriers to care include physician stigmatizing and expressing reluctance to treat OUD patients, inadequate provider education and training, geographic distances to treatment locations, and social stigma,” Scott said. 
  A new report, “The cost of addiction: Opioid use disorder in the United States,” shows Kentucky still has one of the highest rates of opioid use disorder (OUD) in the United States. (Screenshot)
Medicine treatment pays off in the long run, the report says, as it “has been shown to reduce cravings, increase abstinence from opioids and reduce morbidity and mortality, thereby making it a key component for addressing the economic and public health consequences of OUD.” 
Treatments can include medications and therapy. Methadone, buprenorphine and naltrexone are treatments approved by the Food and Drug Administration for OUD management.
“As states and local governments explore new strategies to reduce healthcare costs, encouraging public health, governments and payers to prioritize OUD treatments can lead to greater savings,” Michael Ciarametaro, managing director at Avalere Health, said in a statement. 
  Ben Mudd is the executive director of the Kentucky Pharmacists Association. (Photo provided)
This is especially true for the formerly incarcerated, who live “opioid naive” behind bars and may, upon release, take the same dose they did before being incarcerated and not have the resistance to handle it, Mudd explained. 
“If you’re incarcerated, you hopefully don’t have access to opioids. But when you leave that facility, many folks go back to the same routine that they were in before, the same environment they were in before,” he said. 
What is Kentucky doing to combat opioid use disorders? 
Kentucky has taken aggressive steps to treat and prevent addiction. The latest Drug Overdose Fatality Report showed that for 2024:   

$29.8 million was distributed in grant and pass-through funding from the state Office of Drug Control Policy. 
170,000 doses of Narcan were distributed.
84 syringe exchange program sites served 27,799 unique participants.
142,312 Kentuckians received addiction services through Medicaid. 
17,399 Kentuckians received treatment paid by the Kentucky Opioid Response Effort. 
17,984 Kentuckians received recovery services like housing assistance, employment services, transportation and basic needs services in their community paid by the Kentucky Opioid Response Effort. 
3,329 incoming calls were made to the KY HELP Call Center with 14,087 outgoing follow up calls. 
21 counties are certified as Recovery Ready Communities representing 1,495,518 Kentuckians. 

There’s still some stigma when it comes to seeking treatment, Mudd said. 
“There are folks, even within my profession, that think that this is just a pill mill,” Mudd said. A “constant turnover” of patients is a “real thing” and “a concern of health care providers across the state.”  
“It’s the nature of addiction and folks with OUD,” he said. “It’s hard to differentiate at the pharmacy counter: ‘Is this patient truly in recovery, or is this patient seeking this product so that they can sell it or trade it or whatever for illicit drugs?’ And that’s tough for pharmacists to make that determination.” 
Some won’t dispense the treatments, he said, while others say, “‘Hey, I want to make sure, just like Naloxone (Narcan), that we see this as a vehicle to help people. Some will use it, some will misuse it, some will divert it.’” 
Meanwhile, he said, the pharmacist association is focused on making sure pharmacies are “good access points” for treatments because, especially in rural areas, people may be able to access a pharmacy much easier than a doctor’s office. 
“If your prescriber, physician, nurse practitioner is 45 minutes an hour away, what we’re trying to do is break down those barriers,” Mudd said. “These products are not available at every drugstore in Kentucky. They’re not stocked at Walgreens. They’re not stocked at your local independent pharmacy. But we know those are good access points.”

(Antoinette Grajeda/Arkansas Advocate)The city of Pine Bluff will use a $500,000 federal grant to assess multiple brownfields in its downtown district and develop cleanup plans, the Environmental Protection Agency announced Monday. 
Brownfields are “a property, the expansion, redevelopment, or reuse of which may be complicated by the presence or potential presence of a hazardous substance, pollutant, or contaminant,” according to the EPA.
The funds will be used to conduct environmental site assessments throughout the city, with a focus on the Saenger Theatre, Hotel Pines and the former Pine Bluff Bus Terminal. Four cleanup plans and a revitalization plan will be prepared using the grant money, according to a news release. 
The grant is part of the EPA’s larger 2025 brownfields grant funding announcement, which saw the agency award more than $200 million. Pine Bluff was the only applicant in Arkansas to receive a grant during this round of funding.
Pine Bluff Mayor Vivian Flowers said the city is “extremely excited” to further its downtown revitalization plans, with the assistance of the grant. 
“We’re excited, and we’re going to make good use of those funds for the people of Pine Bluff,” Flowers said.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Lori Walker Guelache, director of the city’s Economic and Community Development Department, said the grant money will go toward figuring out redevelopment plans for the three priority properties and area-wide planning. The efforts downtown are part of a broader city revitalization plan.
A key component of the downtown revitalization efforts, Guelache said, is “understanding what’s feasible and how.” 
“The purpose of the assessment grant is to help come up with viable uses, to make sure that we understand what barriers there would be to the site in terms of environmental contaminants or anything like that,” she said.
The downtown area has “historic building stock” that has suffered from years of neglect. The city wants to work to change that, Guelache said. 
The assessments will likely reveal asbestos in Saenger Theatre, and there “could be” asbestos or lead paint in Hotel Pines or the former bus terminal due to their age, Guelache said. Surveyors will look at the historic uses of the buildings to determine what, if any contamination there will require remediation, she said.
The hotel’s current owners envision transforming it into a boutique hotel, Guelache said, while the Saenger Theatre could be used as a stage theater, movie theater or a combination of both.
Not only will this put the city closer to putting the properties back into use, Guelache said, but it will also help preserve unique aspects of downtown Pine Bluff’s history. 
An article republished in Arkansas Historical Quarterly referred to Pine Bluff as a “paradise of the South” for Black people in the late 1800s to early 1900s, Guelache said, because of the privileges that people of color enjoyed during that period. 
“While other communities had established racially segregated business districts, we have evidence in old city directories and old … maps that Pine Bluff — there were Black businesses operating beside white businesses on Main Street,” Guelache said. “It’s like, ‘Why preserve these buildings?’ Outside of who operated out of them, it’s the bigger story of why our downtown is important.”
By preserving and restoring to use historically and culturally significant buildings, the city hopes to highlight and showcase Pine Bluff’s past, Guelache added.

Two days before President Donald Trump announced dramatic plans for “reciprocal” tariffs on foreign imports, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy sold stock in almost three dozen companies, according to records reviewed by ProPublica.
The Feb. 11 sales occurred near the stock market’s historic peak, just before it began to slide amid concerns about Trump’s tariff plans and ultimately plummeted after the president unveiled the details of the new tariffs on April 2.
Disclosure records filed by Duffy with the U.S. Office of Government Ethics show he sold between $75,000 and $600,000 of stock two days before Trump’s Feb. 13 announcement, and up to $50,000 more that day.

ProPublica is a Pulitzer Prize-winning investigative newsroom. Sign up for The Big Story newsletter to receive stories like this one in your inbox.

Transportation secretaries normally have little to do with tariff policy, but Duffy has presented himself as one of the intellectual forefathers of Trump’s current trade agenda. As a congressman in 2019, his last government position before Trump elevated him to his cabinet post, Duffy introduced a bill he named the “United States Reciprocal Trade Act.” The proposed legislation, which did not pass, in many ways mirrors Trump’s reciprocal tariff plan. Duffy worked on that bill with Trump’s trade adviser Peter Navarro. Trump’s tariffs were “the culmination of that work,” Duffy posted online, referring to his own bill in the House.
Trades by government officials informed by nonpublic information learned in the course of their official duties could violate the law. However, it’s unclear whether Duffy had any information about the timing or scale of Trump’s reciprocal tariff plans before the public did.
Trump had repeatedly promised to institute significant tariffs throughout the campaign. But during the first weeks of his term, investors were not panic selling, seeming to assume Trump wouldn’t adopt the far-reaching levies that led to the market crash following his “Liberation Day” announcement.
In response to questions from ProPublica, a Transportation Department spokesperson said an outside manager made the trades and Duffy “had no input on the timing of the sales” — a defense that ethics experts generally consider one of the strongest against questions of trading on nonpublic information.
His stock transactions “are part of a retirement account and not managed directly by the Secretary. The account managers must follow the guidance of the ethics agreement and they have done so.”
“The Secretary strongly supports the President’s tariff policy, but he isn’t part of the administration’s decisions on tariff levels,” the spokesperson said.
The spokesperson dismissed the notion that knowledge of Trump’s coming tariffs could constitute insider knowledge because “President Trump has been discussing tariffs since the 1980s.”
Duffy is the second cabinet secretary to have sold stock at an opportune time.
AG Pam Bondi sold more than $1 million in Trump Media stock the day sweeping tariffs were announced

Last week, ProPublica reported that Attorney General Pam Bondi sold between $1 million and $5 million worth of shares of Trump Media, the president’s social media company, on April 2. A government ethics agreement required Bondi to sell the shares within 90 days of her confirmation, a deadline that would have given her until early May, but why she sold on that date is unclear. After the market closed that day, Trump presented his tariffs, sending the market reeling.
Following ProPublica’s story, at least two Democratic members of Congress called for investigations. Bondi has yet to answer questions about whether she knew anything about Trump’s tariff plans before the public did. The Justice Department has not responded to questions about the trades.
Disclosure forms for securities trading by government officials do not require them to state the exact amount bought or sold but instead to provide a broad range for the totals of each transaction.
Duffy’s disclosure records show he sold 34 stocks worth between $90,000 and $650,000 on Feb. 11 and Feb. 13. Per the ethics agreement he signed to avoid conflicts of interest as head of the Transportation Department, he was required to sell off stock in seven of those companies during his first three months in office. Cabinet members are typically required to divest themselves of financial interests that intersect with their department’s oversight role, which in Duffy’s case involve U.S. roadways, aviation and the rest of the nation’s transportation network. The ethics agreement was dated Jan. 13, and Duffy was confirmed by the senate on Jan. 28, meaning he had until late April to sell. His spokesperson said he provided his account manager with the ethics agreement on Feb. 7.
The stocks he sold in the other 27 companies were not subject to the ethics agreement. Those shares were valued somewhere between $27,000 and $405,000, according to the records. Among them were Shopify, whose merchants are impacted by the tariffs, and John Deere, the agricultural machinery manufacturer that has projected hundreds of millions of dollars in new costs because of Trump’s tariffs.
Other companies Duffy sold, like gambling firm DraftKings and food delivery service DoorDash, are less directly vulnerable to tariff disruptions. But even those companies will be impacted if Americans have less disposable cash to spend. Few stocks were not hit hard by Trump’s “Liberation Day” tariff announcements. The S&P 500, a broadbased index, fell almost 19% in the weeks that followed Duffy’s sales and 13% specifically after Trump unveiled the details of his reciprocal tariff plan. Since Trump unexpectedly walked back much of those initial tariffs, the market has rebounded.
There’s no indication that the cash from Duffy’s sales was immediately reinvested. He appears to have held on to parts of his portfolio, including a Bitcoin fund, treasuries, S&P 500 funds and stock in Madrigal Pharmaceuticals, an American biopharma company. (Duffy also purchased some Microsoft shares, one of the stocks he’s prohibited from holding, days earlier on Feb. 7, only to sell them on Feb. 11 with the rest of his sales.)
Trades by government officials informed by nonpublic information learned through their jobs could violate the Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge, or STOCK, Act. The 2012 law clarified that executive and legislative branch employees cannot use nonpublic government information to trade stock and requires them to promptly disclose their trades.
But no cases have ever been brought under the law, and some legal experts have doubts it would hold up to scrutiny from the courts, which in recent years have generally narrowed what constitutes illegal insider trading. Current and former officials have also raised concerns that Trump’s Justice Department and Securities and Exchange Commission would not aggressively investigate activities by Trump or his allies.
The president’s selection of Duffy to lead the Department of Transportation was somewhat unexpected. Duffy, who came to fame when he starred in the reality show “The Real World” in the late 1990s, had last held public office in 2019 during Trump’s first term when he served as a Wisconsin congressman.
As a lawmaker, Duffy introduced the bill that would have made it easier for Trump, or any president, to levy new tariffs, a role that had long been largely reserved for Congress. The bill would have allowed the president to impose additional tariffs on imported goods if he determined that another country was applying a higher duty rate on the same goods when they were coming from America.
The bill did not pass, but Trump has essentially assumed that power by justifying new tariffs as essential to national security or in response to a national emergency. His Feb. 13 announcement called on his advisers to come up with new tariff rates on goods coming from countries around the world based on a number of restrictions he said those countries were placing on American products — not just through tariffs, but also with their exchange rates and industry subsidies.
Even the public rollout of Duffy’s bill and Trump’s tariffs were similar. Duffy released a spreadsheet showing how other countries tariffed particular goods at a higher rate than the U.S. Trump also used a spreadsheet during his rollout to show that his new tariffs were the same or lower than the trade restrictions other countries had placed on American goods.
More recently, Duffy has been a booster of Trump’s trade policies.
“LIBERATION DAY!!We’re not gonna take it anymore!,” he tweeted two days after Trump unveiled his reciprocal tariffs on April 2. “This week, @POTUS took a historic step towards stopping other countries from ripping off the American worker and restoring Fair Trade. In Congress, I helped lead the US Reciprocal Trade Act with @RealPNavarro and the @WhiteHouse to expand the President’s tariff powers in his first term. I am so proud to have been able to share the culmination of that work, Liberation Day, with my family this week. Thank you at POTUS!”

(Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)Tennessee House Republican leadership could hit an impasse again in 2026 over a measure designed to restrict immigrant student enrollment in public schools.
With the bill on the skids in mid-April at the end of the legislature’s session, House Republican Leader William Lamberth asked the U.S. Department of Education whether $1.1 billion in federal funds would be jeopardized by his bill, which would enable school districts to check students’ immigration status and charge tuition. 
Lamberth had not received a response as of May 19, and whether the House moves forward with the bill in January “depends on the response we receive,” House Republican Caucus spokesperson Jennifer Easton said Monday in response to questions from the Lookout.
The Senate version of the bill passed in this year’s session despite public outcry. But if Lamberth continues to push the measure in 2026 as he said he would, he’s likely to run into a conflict with Rep. Jeremy Faison, chairman of the Republican Caucus.










That being said, I still strongly oppose the state passing a bill that puts children, who have zero decision making power, in the middle of a legal battle.


– House Republican Caucus Chair Jeremy Faison


Faison, of Cosby, told WBIR-TV’s “Inside Tennessee” he was a “big fat no” on the legislation and challenged the strategy of trying to put the measure before the U.S. Supreme Court, the Tennessee Journal reported.
Faison backed off his initial statement in which he called the bill a “political stunt,” saying he shouldn’t have questioned the motives of Lamberth, of Portland, and Sen. Bo Watson, of Hixson, who sponsored the bill.
“That being said, I still strongly oppose the state passing a bill that puts children, who have zero decision making power, in the middle of a legal battle,” Faison told the Lookout. 
The House version of the legislation would give school districts the option to check students to determine whether they have permanent legal documentation, differing from the Senate version, which would force districts to check students’ immigration status and require tuition.
Tennessee bill denying immigrant children right to an education dead for year

Faison said Monday he supports President Donald Trump’s efforts to secure the Southern border and wants to see Congress repair the nation’s immigration laws so states don’t have to debate policies dealing with federal issues. Yet, he said he never liked the bill dealing with immigrant students.
Faison reportedly said on WBIR that Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti told him the U.S. Supreme Court would never take up the immigrant student case, which was designed to overturn a 1982 decision that found all children should be allowed to enroll in public schools no matter their immigration status.
Federal Title VI prohibits discrimination based on race, color or national origins in programs that receive federal funds, and violating the law could put the federal funds in danger, according to a state financial analysis. Those deal with the Every Student Succeeds Act — which measures student success —, the Individuals with Disabilities Act, the Carl Perkins Act — named for the late Kentucky Congressman Carl Perkins, it funds career and technical education — and school nutrition.

(Getty Images)On Tuesday, May 20, Idahoans have a unique opportunity to shape the future of their communities by voting in local library district elections. 
While these elections may not garner the same attention as national contests, their outcomes have profound and lasting impacts on education, access to information, and community development across the state. Service on a library district board of trustees is important work, and it matters who is elected to fill library board positions.
 Why Idaho’s library districts matter

There are currently 69 library districts in Idaho. Library districts in Idaho are independent units of government with their own taxing authority, separate from county commissioners. Library districts are responsible for setting budgets and policies, and ensuring that library services meet the varying needs of the members of their communities. 
In a geographically large state like Idaho, with vast rural areas, library districts are essential for public library development and the crucial services they provide. Many Idahoans, especially those in unincorporated or rural areas, rely on these districts for access to library services. Without them, residents might find themselves without adequate resources for education, job training, contact with medical providers, and digital access. 
 The stakes are high

Recent debates in Idaho have highlighted the importance of library governance. Discussions around book content, access to information, and the role of libraries in communities have become increasingly prominent. Library elections across Idaho have gained attention due to efforts to ban certain books, censor library programming that some community members disfavor, and dissolve a library district. 
These issues underscore the critical role that library trustees play in upholding the values of intellectual freedom, inclusivity, and community service.
Libraries are more than just buildings with books; they are community hubs that provide resources for learning, connection, and growth. By voting in your local library district elections, you have a say in how these vital institutions are run.
Don’t miss this opportunity to influence the future of your community. Head to the polls on May 20 and cast your vote for the candidates who reflect your vision for Idaho’s libraries.

(Photo: John Partipilo)Seventy-seven years ago, the United States positioned itself as a world leader in human rights. World War II had ended, President Harry Truman sent former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt to the nascent United Nations where she was elected chair to the UN Commission on Human Rights and the U.S. became one of the first signatories on the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR).
Tennessee’s recent roundup operations in Nashville’s immigrant communities mark the state’s shameful turn away from core American values like human rights and constitutional protections.
ICE/THP roundups have left Tennessee communities reeling
Throughout the first two weeks of May, the Tennessee Highway Patrol (THP) collaborated with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in hundreds of traffic stops in Nashville’s immigrant communities, apparently racially and ethnically targeting drivers. 
“By all appearances, government officials racially and ethnically profiled residents, requested driver’s licenses, inquired about tattoos, left cars abandoned on roadways creating traffic hazards, and tore at least one mother from her children,” read a letter signed by all but three of the Davidson County legislative delegation to the heads of Tennessee’s Department of Homeland Security and the Highway Patrol.
The law enforcement operations have led to around 588 traffic stops and 103 people being detained. Despite information requests from Mayor Freddie O’Connell and Davidson County’s lawmakers, state and federal officials have not been forthcoming on who has been detained, where the detainees are, whether they’ve been officially arrested or charged with a crime, and what will happen to them next.
Immigration and Customs Enforcement “dragnet” in Nashville results in detentions

These developments have been concerning to many because, before the Trump era, state and local authorities rarely enforced immigration law.
Tennessee’s Republican lawmakers put out statements supporting the raids. They are also the ones to thank for making these raids possible, because last year the Republican supermajority passed legislation making it easier for state law enforcement to work hand-in-hand with federal immigration authorities. It’s also worth mentioning that, just in April of this year, the Tennessee General Assembly passed a bill that eliminated the Tennessee Human Rights Commission (THRC), which had safeguarded civil rights in the state since 1963.
Racially targeted dragnets violate human rights
One does not have to be an immigration rights advocate to be concerned about what’s happening in our communities. Detaining Tennessee residents for their skin color or for the neighborhood they live in violates their rights as enshrined in both the UDHR and the U.S. Constitution. 
The UDHR has 30 articles, but a few stand out today:
– Article 3: “Everyone has the right to life, liberty and security of person.”
– Article 9: “No one shall be subjected to arbitrary arrest, detention or exile.”
– Article 10: “Everyone is entitled in full equality to a fair and public hearing by an independent and impartial tribunal, in the determination of his rights and obligations and of any criminal charge against him.”
– Article 14: “Everyone has the right to seek and to enjoy in other countries asylum from persecution.”
These articles defend all humans from arbitrary arrest, detention, and exile while granting them the right to asylum and due process. Hispanic communities in Nashville are the descendants of families who left Latin America, often fleeing U.S. military intervention, CIA-backed covert operations and disastrous U.S.-led financial sanctions on their nations of origin. For these communities to be targeted again, this time on U.S. soil, is the height of cruelty.
The U.S. Constitution provides equal protection for all
The Constitution is even more explicit in the protections it offers to all persons residing in the U.S. Racial and ethnic profiling violate the Constitution’s Equal Protection Clause in the Fourteenth Amendment, which prohibits discrimination based on race.
THP claimed their operations with ICE were justified because they were “…public safety operation[s] that targeted areas of suspected gang activity with a history of serious traffic crashes.” But even if that were true, the Equal Protection Clause prohibits racial discrimination even in communities with high crime rates. 
Quoting D.C.-based legislative attorney April J. Anderson, “The Equal Protection Clause’s prohibition on intentional racial discrimination remains true even if members of a given race are responsible for more crimes in a particular neighborhood or commit more crimes of a certain type. Even if the evidence showed that police relied on racial profiling out of a perhaps ill-conceived notion that it helped fight crime, the Equal Protection Clause prohibits intentionally relying on race in policing, no matter the underlying rationale for the policy.”
The Fourth Amendment protects against unreasonable search and seizure and requires individual justification for law enforcement actions. The word ‘individual’ is the key word there, as dragnets, roundups, and other group-focused law enforcement operations have often been successfully challenged as Fourth Amendment violations. Again quoting Anderson, “It [the Fourth Amendment] does not specifically prohibit racial profiling, but courts would not consider stops and searches based solely on a subject’s race to be reasonable seizures because police have identified no individualized reason for suspicion.”
Tennessee is at a turning point
Racial profiling and ethnically motivated law enforcement actions have a long, gruesome history in the U.S.. Yet from the “Show me your papers” scandal in Maricopa County, Arizona to the Stop and Frisk policy in New York City, landmark court decisions were made, justice prevailed, and the protections offered by the Constitution were again held aloft as the supreme law of the land.
Tennessee is at a turning point. Will it ally itself with a presidential administration that, as recently as May 9, floated suspending habeas corpus?  Recent events suggest Tennessee officials want to play ball with the Trump Administration. Tennesseans need to remind elected officials they work for us, not the feds, because if constitutional protections don’t apply to the most vulnerable of us, then they don’t apply to any of us.

(Getty Images)Last week, a federal judge ordered “full restoration” of services at the National Institute for Occupational Health and Safety’s Coal Workers’ Health Surveillance Program. However, after the ruling, credit for getting those people back to work at NIOSH started going to U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. — the man who eliminated the positions in the first place.
In her ruling, U.S. District Court Judge Irene Berger said the federal Department of Health and Human Services could not legally end services with the surveillance program, and that doing so would “cost lives.”
In April, more than 200 jobs were eliminated at NIOSH as part of President Donald Trump’s Department of Government Efficiency Workforce Optimization Initiative, which aimed to reduce staffing at DHHS from 82,000 to 62,000 full-time employees. This affected the entire NIOSH facility in Morgantown, leaving no one in the United States who performs the same services for occupational safety and health, said Cathy Tinney-Zara, president of the American Federation of Government Employees Local 3040.
“We do the research to make everyone’s job safer,” she said.
West Virginia U.S. Sen. Shelley Moore Capito was the only member of the state’s Congressional delegation who spoke up against the job cuts. She requested a meeting with Kennedy, to ask him to bring back the NIOSH employees. 
Capito posted on X on the day of Berger’s ruling that, “The health and safety of our WV workers, including our miners, is of the utmost importance and I will always advocate for their wellbeing.”
Despite that comment, she’s not backing the Robert C. Byrd Mine Safety Protection Act that was introduced by Sen. Tim Kaine and Rep. Bobby Scott, who both represent Virginia. She’s not speaking out about delaying the Mine Safety and Health Administration rule that would have limited how much dangerous silica dust coal miners are exposed to while they work. She hasn’t supported federal legislation to increase monthly black lung benefits stipends for thousands of West Virginia coal miners and their families to keep up with rises in inflation.
On the same day as Berger’s ruling, job cuts were reversed for a Pittsburgh lab that certifies virtually all U.S. government-approved respirators in the country. When Pennsylvania Capitol-Star reporter Ian Karbal reached out to DHHS about the reversal, a spokesperson pointed to employees at the Coal Workers’ Health Surveillance Program getting back to work. 
They gave the credit, however, to Kennedy and, of course, the Trump administration. 
“The Trump Administration remains committed to supporting coal miners, who play a vital role in America’s energy sector. Under Secretary [Robert F. Kennedy Jr.]’s leadership, NIOSH’s Coal Workers’ Health Surveillance Program will continue to meet the needs of our nation’s miners,” a spokesperson for DHHS wrote.
West Virginia U.S. Rep. Riley Moore — who eventually began to care about the job cuts in Morgantown — credited himself and Kennedy for good news.
“This is a great win for West Virginia, and I can’t thank the Secretary enough for working closely with my office to make this happen,” Moore posted on X. “The work NIOSH does is critically important for our coal miners and their safety.”

This is a great win for West Virginia, and I can’t thank the Secretary enough for working closely with my office to make this happen. The work NIOSH does is critically important for our coal miners and their safety. https://t.co/ztXeLsnwVr
— Rep. Riley M. Moore (@RepRileyMoore) May 14, 2025

But that’s not what happened. 
The NIOSH employees only got their jobs back because Berger ruled it was illegal to end the program. And she heard from NIOSH employees and the case’s lead plaintiff, a coal miner named Harry Wiley, who presented “overwhelming evidence” that the work had been stopped — not just paused — without any plans or efforts in place to ensure it continued as mandated by Congress.
Mine safety and health lawyer Sam Brown Petsonk worked with Mountain State Justice and Appalachian Mountain Advocates to file Wiley v. Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., et al. 
Petsonk found Wiley, a coal miner who was diagnosed with black lung in November, to testify and lead the case. Wiley asked to use Part 90, which allows workers diagnosed with black lung to transfer to a less dusty part of a mine without facing retribution from a mine operator. To qualify, miners must have their black lung testing results certified by NIOSH. But those employees were all placed on administrative leave on April 1, leaving no one to approve his application or offer him free screenings to verify his claims.
“As the testimony before the Court made clear, that dust exposure will cause [Wiley’s] disease to progress until it becomes debilitating. Does [Kennedy] genuinely believe that a miner diagnosed with black lung is not being injured when the program designed to confirm his condition and provide him with workplace protections to prevent its progression is rendered inaccessible?” Berger wrote. “This Court does not share such a belief.”
Wiley risked the possibility of facing unofficial social reprimands from the coal mine he works at. He should feel insulted that people are thanking Kennedy — Kennedy didn’t make the decision to put NIOSH employees back to work, Berger did.
Our elected and appointed officials with one lone exception sat back while the government attempted to rob coal miners of the congressionally mandated rights their predecessors fought for. And those miners fight every day to survive an incurable disease without their help.
When you see campaign ads featuring coal miners start to circulate on TV next election, remember where this credit really belongs. Remember who actually fought for our coal miners.
Capito and Moore should be thanking Berger, Petsonk and Wiley for getting some NIOSH employees back to work. And they should be working to get the rest of the employees back on the job permanently as well. The mining research team in Pennsylvania is still on “temporary” administrative leave. This isn’t the end of the fight.

CENTRAL CITY — Pastor Jennifer Banks was still a relative newcomer to this Western Kentucky town on the night in September when she watched  through a security camera as a police officer brought a woman in a wheelchair to the church and “dumped her in our parking lot.” 
Banks’ husband, Zachary, rushed to the church in time to talk to the officer. 
“He’s like, ‘Man, I’m sorry. We didn’t have anywhere for her to go. We knew that y’all wouldn’t trespass her here, and we didn’t want to see her go to jail,” Zachary Banks recalls.
Mallie Luken, 70, a widow, was down to her last few dollars. She had asked her former pastor to drive her from the nearby county where she was living to Muhlenberg County because she remembered an old ad for the Central Inn, a motel in Central City, and thought she could afford a night there.
Jennifer Banks had met Mallie Luken the day before after getting a call from police about a “homeless woman” outside Arby’s. The officer told the pastor the woman had trespassed on multiple properties and asked if she could do something.

Banks gathered a plate of food and headed to Arby’s. She found Luken sitting outside in a wheelchair next to her dog Blaze. They prayed together. At that time, Banks had yet to consider using the Abundant Life Church as a shelter. The congregation was barely a year old and still buying the building from the Central City government. 
“I had to leave her there, because I didn’t have anywhere for her to go. And then the next day was when they dumped her in our parking lot,” Jennifer Banks said. 
Banks’ community was ill-prepared to respond to that kind of housing emergency. That realization has served as a catalyst for the Bankses and others in Muhlenberg County who want to fill gaps they see in services and housing. They have met resistance and support, as the Lantern will report over the next few days.
But on that night eight months ago, all Zachary Banks could do was take Luken a blanket.
She stayed there on the pavement under a stainless steel table, an experience made even worse because she was separated from Blaze after he bolted from an earlier thunder clap. As storms rolled through Luken thought of her parents. “To know that that’s your child laying under a stainless steel table,” Luken said. “I could have gotten electrocuted.” 
Looking back recently, she said, “I just didn’t care if I woke up in the morning,” mentioning how worried she was about Blaze. Luken thinks her search for the dog had prompted more calls to police about trespassing.
Seeing Luken in the parking lot, Zachary Banks thought of his mother. “It just broke my heart to see her just dumped out there and for us to not be able to have any resources to be able to do anything.” 
  Word got around that the parking lot at Abundant Life Church is a safe place to sleep without fear of arrest for trespassing. (Kentucky Lantern photo by Austin Anthony) IS THAT THE SHOWER?
An officer wrote in an email to church leaders that Luken was dropped off at the church at her request and that the local police department “currently does not have any type of resources to assist her.” The officer in his email asked the church for assistance to make sure Luken didn’t get into further legal trouble. 
Zachary Banks said he urged the officer to “stand up” for the church before the Central City city council and for the work the church was doing to help people experiencing homelessness. The officer told Zachary Banks he would try.

Luken soon found shelter thanks to help from Gwen Clements. Using money given by a concerned neighbor of the church, Clements checked Luken into the Central Inn. Within about a week, calling around to her connections, Clements found Luken an apartment at the public housing authority in Greenville, the Muhlenberg County seat. 
She contacted Luken’s daughter in North Carolina who wasn’t aware of her situation and learned the mother and daughter have a strained relationship. 
Luken was united with Blaze, and they are still together.
In a rural county with few resources for people without shelter, Clements is part of a loose coalition of people who see a growing need to help those experiencing homelessness. Clements grew up in Muhlenberg County and believes it is not unlike other rural communities suffering a shortage of housing. 
‘I feel for these people’
Earlier in 2024, Clements had started a Facebook group to advocate for more resources to help people struggling to secure a safe place to live. Clements, who moved back to Central City in the early 2000s, had a vision for what she wanted for the county: a community space that could serve as a warming center, shelter and kitchen, largely inspired by efforts of a nonprofit in Somerset. 
“In this county, if they would just open up more affordable housing. Most of the problems would be eliminated,” Clements said. “If we had public transportation for people to get the documents they need — nobody wants to take these people so that they can get the hand up and get on with their lives just by having a few pieces of paper in hand.”

Clements says her own experiences make her want to help. “I feel for these people. I’ve been in their situation, not knowing where I was gonna go next,” Clements told the Lantern earlier this year. “I want to be the person I needed during my dark times. I want to give hope to those who feel hopeless, show them someone cares about their needs.” 
“Sometimes it’s draining. Sometimes I leave my house at seven o’clock in the morning and don’t come back till it’s dark,” Clements said. “If you’re making a commitment, you gotta follow that commitment through till you’re done.” 

“While homelessness is often considered an urban issue, the number of unsheltered homeless individuals has rapidly risen outside of Lexington and Louisville, going from six hundred fifty (650) in 2019 to more than one thousand (1,000) in 2024.
“While homelessness has many causes, the Deputy Executive Director of Housing Programs for the Kentucky Housing Corporation stated that the lack of housing was a contributing factor, likening the housing situation to a game of musical chairs where certain people would simply be left out due to the lack of supply. 
“Those already vulnerable to homelessness, including seniors, people with disabilities, and those with low income, could be pushed into homelessness as a result of the housing shortage and rising home prices and rents.”

She helps people fill out birth certificate requests so they can get an identification card. Her Facebook group has become a clearinghouse connecting people who say they need help to those who want to provide it. She often fields several messages a day asking for food, clothing or enough money to stay at a local motel. Sometimes people she helps are dealing with unstable housing situations, getting close to the precipice of living without shelter. 
Some who need help grapple with addiction and other mental health issues. Some work or struggle to find work, having limited or no transportation to get them to a job. The county has a limited supply of affordable rentals amid a worsening housing shortage that is common across rural Kentucky. 
“Housing as a whole is very hard to come by, whether it’s affordable, whether it’s appropriate, whether it’s up to code, whether or not they get in there. I mean, it’s just hard all the way around,” said Kelsey Rolley, a services coordinator at Pennyrile Allied Community Services in Greenville. “It’s that much harder when you’re in a position like mine, where people come to you for help and then you don’t have any resources to refer them to, or you don’t have the means to be able to help immediately at that moment.”
Muhlenberg County, once bolstered by coal mining and famous for producing musicians, has an aging and declining population similar to other rural communities. Poverty rates are higher than the national and state averages, according to the U.S. Census. Central City has a population of a little more than 6,000 residents. About 1 in 4 of them live in poverty.
Michael Howard, the CEO of the regional ARCH Community Health Coalition in Western Kentucky, said finding a way forward beyond coal mining has been difficult and the housing shortage makes fostering new industries and jobs even more challenging. But, he said, the vast majority in Muhlenberg County would reply “No” when asked if homelessness is a local problem.
“They don’t realize that they’re already there. You know, they’re invisible,” Howard said. 
They’re not invisible to everyone, though. Next in the Lantern’s series: Jennifer and Zachary Banks and Abundant Life Church have a plan, backed by others in the loose coalition.

Driving from the Lantern’s office in Frankfort to my house in Lexington, I’m often snagged by a couple of red lights, where I avoid eye contact with the person standing on the corner holding a cardboard sign asking for money.
One of the luxuries of city life, I suppose, is keeping some people no closer than your peripheral vision — and thoughts.
That luxury is less available in small towns, where the person on the street is not anonymous but someone you once worked beside on the line at the poultry plant. Or someone who reminds you of your child or mother. Or someone who’s sleeping in your church’s parking lot.
Today we begin a series of stories from one such Kentucky place.
It’s a small place that looms large in the imagination because of its musical heritage. It inspired John Prine to sing “Oh, daddy, won’t you take me back to Muhlenberg County” in his anti strip-mining anthem “Paradise.” Not much more than 30 miles from the cradle of bluegrass music, Bill Monroe’s Rosine, Muhlenberg County contributed a guitar style — thumb-picking — made famous by native son Merle Travis, who also wrote the GOAT of coal mining songs: “You load 16 tons, what do you get? Another day older and deeper in debt.” Don and Phil Everly — the chart-topping Everly Brothers — trace their lineage to Central City.

Muhlenberg County is not extraordinary, though, in another respect: The struggle to come to terms with what it owes the people who many of us (me included) conveniently keep on the far outskirts of our minds. I’m confident we’d find similar stories and conflicts across Kentucky, in state capitols and all the way to the debates raging right now in Washington, D.C.
These very personal stories introduce us to people who don’t avoid eye contact, who see the “campers” and couch surfers and evicted as neighbors. And, most emphatically, not as eyesores or threats.
These stories are about a shortage of services and housing, made worse by a surplus of untreated addiction and trauma.
Reporter Liam Niemeyer and I are sorry that some officials were unwilling to talk to him. Liam reached out via email, phone messages and dropping by. And it’s not too late. Their perspectives are important; we need to hear them, especially those of people who hold elected office. I recognize that solutions are not obvious, simple or inexpensive.
We are able to tell such intimate stories because Liam has spent a lot of time getting to know the people and the place. We weren’t sure what the story would be in the summer of 2023 when, pursuing an idea sparked by a report in a local newspaper, Liam spent a day with several people in Muhlenberg County who lacked housing. He also began to meet local people who wanted to help. As he stayed in touch by phone and in person, we knew we had a story worth telling even as we wrestled with how to tell it.
I hope you will find our efforts worthwhile as you meet Mallie and Gwen, Courtney and Jennifer, Zachary and the cantankerous but lovably philosophical John Paul.

“His life was short, but powerfully transformative,” he said, talking about Malcolm’s lasting impact on movements from the Black Panther Party to Black Lives Matter.

Malcolm X was born on May 19, 1925, in Omaha, Nebraska. He spent his youth in Michigan, living in Lansing after his family moved there in the 1920s. He spoke at Wayne State University in 1963. Malcolm X was assassinated on February 21, 1965, in New York City.
The debate reflected key themes of self-determination, accountability, and collective action—values that were the most important to Malcolm X’s legacy.
Debaters Laila Sanford-McKisic and Kyla Canty of Renaissance High School argued in favor of grassroots investment, and Mamboge Njie of Renaissance High and D’Maiya Clark of Detroit School of Arts emphasized the importance of political power. 
“I want to make it very clear that this is not an either-or conversation; this is about strategy, about timing, about balancing where the money goes,” Njie said. Canty responded that “politicians will not save us,” emphasizing the strength of community-based work.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_9989-1024x678.jpeg,,,2025-05-20 06:01:20.058939

(Photo by Kayla Bartkowski/Getty Images)Private equity companies have gobbled up group homes and other services for people with disabilities, attracting the attention of state and federal regulators across the nation and alarming advocates.
People with intellectual or developmental disabilities have suffered abuse, neglect and even death while under the care of private equity-owned providers, according to a recent report from watchdog group Private Equity Stakeholder Project.
“Private equity firms are, more than many other types of investors, laser-focused on maximizing their cash flow, often trying to double or triple their investment over a relatively short period of time, usually just a handful of years,” said Eileen O’Grady, the report’s author. “The way that private equity firms will often do that is to cut costs.”
For companies that provide essential services for people with disabilities, she said, “those cuts can have really harmful impacts on people’s lives.”
In late 2023, Florida moved to revoke the license of NeuroRestorative, one branch of the private equity-owned health services company Sevita, which provides services for people with disabilities. State regulators cited repeat violations by NeuroRestorative and a failure to “protect the rights of its clients to be free from physical abuse.” Ultimately the state opted not to revoke the license and fined the company $13,000 in a settlement.
But in recent years regulators have documented instances of patient harm at Sevita’s affiliates in multiple other states, including Colorado, Indiana, Iowa, Massachusetts and Utah. In 2019, a U.S. Senate committee conducted a probe into the company’s operations in Iowa and Oregon following multiple reports of patient abuse and neglect.

“Any entity that receives taxpayer dollars, but especially those charged with caring for our fellow Americans who may have an intellectual disability, ought to be doing everything under the sun to ensure quality care and continually improve,” U.S. Sen. Chuck Grassley, an Iowa Republican, said in a statement in 2020 following his investigation.
In a statement to Stateline, Sevita did not address the sanctions directly, but avowed its commitment to providing services and supports to give people greater independence, regardless of their intellectual or physical challenges.
“Since 2019, when new ownership acquired the company, there has been significant capital investment to improve and expand our services, enhance facilities, implement robust training and new technologies, and strengthen our workforce — all with the goal of better serving our individuals and communities,” the statement said.
The disability care industry has proven increasingly attractive to private equity.
In recent years, a handful of large private equity-owned companies such as Sevita have snapped up hundreds of smaller providers of disability services — often community nonprofits, mom-and-pop businesses and religious organizations — and rolled them into larger corporations.
From 2013 to 2023, private equity firms acquired more than 1,000 disability and elder care providers, according to the report by the Private Equity Stakeholder Project. That’s likely an undercount because they’re generally not required to disclose acquisitions, the report said.
 Cash cow

Private equity firms use pooled investments from pension funds, sovereign wealth funds, endowments and wealthy individuals to buy a controlling stake in a company. They seek to maximize its value — often by cutting costs — and then sell it at a profit.
Most of Sevita’s revenue comes from providing disability services. It operates companies in 40 states under various brands, including Mentor Network, NeuroRestorative and REM.
Sevita is currently owned by private equity firms Centerbridge Partners and Vistria Group, which also own Help at Home, a home health company with more than 200 locations across about a dozen states.
Nearly all of Sevita’s revenue comes from Medicaid, according to a February 2025 report from S&P Global.

Through Medicaid and Medicare, the government pays for most services for people with intellectual or developmental disabilities. The two programs cover services such as group homes, adult day programs, in-home care, and physical and occupational therapy.
“Sevita has been owned by private equity firms for over a decade now, and has been under investigation and scrutiny at the federal and state level for basically that entire time,” O’Grady said.
In 2022, Iowa fined a NeuroRestorative group home $10,500 after a resident was left unattended in a liquor store and drank three-quarters of a bottle of vodka. The same year, Massachusetts temporarily removed Sevita’s license to operate group homes after regulators reported inadequate staff training and supervision, and a “myriad of issues that were uncovered onsite,” according to a Massachusetts Department of Developmental Services report.
The federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services has fined a NeuroRestorative facility in Utah four times since 2022. A February 2024 inspection report by the agency found the facility “failed to prevent abuse, neglect … and exploitation” of residents.
Last year, Florida fined another Sevita brand, Florida Mentor, for improper use of restraints. More issues have been documented in Sevita-owned locations in Arkansas, California, Colorado, Illinois, Indiana, New Hampshire and Nevada.
Meanwhile, Sevita’s owners, Centerbridge and Vistria, have collected nearly half a billion dollars since 2019 by loading Sevita and Help at Home with debt in order to pay dividends to investors, according to Moody’s, a financial services company.
Similar financial maneuvering contributed to the recent collapse of Steward Health Care, a private equity-owned hospital system that once had more than 30 hospitals nationwide. Steward has become a cautionary tale about the harm that profit-driven private equity firms can do to a state’s health system.
“Before Steward Health Care ultimately collapsed, executives spent years hiding their financial information from state regulators, putting patients and our health care system at risk,” Massachusetts Democratic House Speaker Ron Mariano said in a statement earlier this year announcing a new state law that beefs up reporting and financial requirements for private investors.
“That’s why ensuring that our institutions are equipped to monitor the health care landscape, and to guard against trends and transactions that drive up costs without improving patient outcomes, is so important.”
 David vs. Goliath

After two residents of a New Jersey group home died from choking on food in 2017, attorney Cory Bernstein became interested in private equity’s involvement in disability services. The residents had been living in homes operated by AdvoServ, a company then owned by the private equity firm Wellspring Capital Management. The state had cited AdvoServ more times than any other operator in New Jersey for abuse, neglect and unsafe conditions.
AdvoServ later ceased operations in 2019 after multiple state agencies, including in New Jersey, Florida and Maryland, launched investigations.










States just don’t really have the resources or tools to do what needs to be done.


– Cory Bernstein, staff attorney at the National Disability Rights Network


But even when state regulators are doing all they can to protect people with disabilities from substandard care, they’re limited in how much they can hold a company accountable, Bernstein told Stateline.
“It’s state-level oversight on a national entity with not much [help] coming from the federal side,” said Bernstein, who is now a staff attorney at the National Disability Rights Network, a membership organization of federally mandated state disability advocacy programs.
“States just don’t really have the resources or tools to do what needs to be done.”
A regulatory agency in Georgia might shut down all the group homes owned by a certain company, for example, but those regulators can’t do anything about the company’s abuses in, say, Montana. With branches in multiple states, a company is better able to withstand sanctions or even a loss of license in one state, he said.
“[States] are not set up to go up against a national operator with billions of dollars in resources in a regulatory or oversight battle,” Bernstein said.
Further complicating things for state regulators and for consumers is that a large services company such as Sevita might operate under multiple brand names, even in one state. It can be hard to parse out who owns a sanctioned business. Multiple brand names can also obscure a company’s monopoly on a particular regional market.

When Florida regulators reached a settlement agreement with Sevita’s NeuroRestorative last year, the state dismissed its proposed license revocation. O’Grady believes one reason the state chose to settle is the difficulty of finding alternative facilities to relocate the residents who would have been displaced from the 13 locations the company operated around the state.
“Because of that dearth of alternatives and the impotence of the state to act more fully, this company will continue to be allowed to operate,” she said.
Further complicating oversight: Large companies often operate various services that are overseen by different agencies. Group homes might be regulated under the state’s Medicaid program, while facilities that provide more intensive care might come under federal Medicare oversight.
There could be “two completely different oversight systems for facilities serving the same population in the same state with the same name,” Bernstein said.
 State solutions

Some states have moved to address problems with private equity involvement in health care by passing tighter restrictions on mergers and acquisitions of health care companies.
In Rhode Island, where private equity companies’ mismanagement of health care providers threatened the future of local hospitals, a robust oversight law allowed the state attorney general to impose conditions to protect the hospitals’ finances.
More states are following suit. In 2023 alone, 24 states enacted laws related to health system consolidation and competition, while this year at least half a dozen have considered legislation to check private equity-fueled health care mergers.

Among the dictates: limits on shower lengths and toilet flushes and no games, no fun, and no kids in the house.
The ad and its amusing absurdity probably came to mind for anyone who had seen it as they watched last week’s action in the North Carolina House of Representatives.
Everyone knows that legislative bodies must operate under a set of parliamentary rules and procedures. After all, maintaining order in a large group of opinionated and talkative politicians is no easy feat, and without rules governing things like how committees will operate, who can speak and when, and which motions will be considered and in what order, the potential for chaotic disorder is high.
  Former University of Alabama football coach Nick Saban is now a TV pitchman for various corporations. (Photo: Univ. of Alabama)
That said, when the rules become Saban-like – that is, so numerous, complex and restrictive that they make majority rule effectively impossible — they’ve gone too far and, as is explained below, that’s the case right now in the North Carolina House of Representatives.
What is a rule?
Interestingly, the idea of what constitutes a “rule,” when it will apply, and how it will be enacted and enforced is somewhat flexible and has evolved down through the decades.
In the U.S House of Representatives, there are rules that govern the basics of House operations, but there are also “special rules” that govern the consideration of individual bills and resolutions that are the province of the powerful Rules Committee.
Thus, while a bill can go directly to a floor vote after being approved by a substantive committee like, say, Education and Workforce, the common practice is for the Rules Committee to serve as the next step in the process. Operating as a gatekeeper, it will decide whether to issue a special “rule” that determines things like when the bill will be heard and how much time will be allotted for debate.
Across the nation, many state legislatures have their own versions of this set-up. In North Carolina, both the Senate and House have Rules Committees that have come to resemble the U.S. House version in recent years. While neither go to the trouble of issuing special “rules” to govern a bill’s consideration, in practice, both do act as gatekeepers, appendages of leadership, and the final arbiters of whether a bill will make it to the floor.
NC GOP lawmakers add more rules
With such an arrangement, you’d think Republican legislative leaders would feel secure in their ability to exert complete control over all details of the legislative process. As was made plain last week, however, as state House leaders rolled out their new state budget proposal in a series of appropriations subcommittee meetings and, at least in theory, opened it up to debate and amendment, that’s not the case.
As it turns out, the lengthy and detailed provisions of the existing House Rules – all of which were written and enacted by the GOP majority – were deemed insufficient. Instead, appropriations subcommittee chairs all commenced their meetings last week by unveiling yet another long list of new, additional and restrictive rules handed down from some unknown place that made the consideration of meaningful amendments all but impossible.
Somewhere, the Nick Saban commercial character was smiling.
Among the prohibitions:

no amendments to spend additional dollars were allowed unless they reduced another line item from a very restricted list by the same amount,
no amendments to increase overall spending,
no amendments that include Hurricane Helene related items,
no amendment dealing with fees,
no amendments to reduce or eliminate vacant positions (or the associated savings in salary and benefits).

What’s more all of these prohibitions were sprung on Democratic lawmakers as they entered the room and saw hundreds of pages of proposed law changes and spending items for the first time. They were allotted an hour or two to draft amendments.
Talk about no fun and no kids in the house.
Politics and appearances
Of course, as with so many restrictive legislative rules, the purpose of the new prohibitions has more to do with politics and appearances than dictating outcomes. Republicans have the votes to do whatever they want when it comes to passing legislation; what they designed the new rules to help them avoid was the possibility that they might have to go on the record in doing so.
Better to rule an amendment “out of order” pursuant to a restrictive rule, goes the thinking, than to risk casting a public “no” vote on something popular and logical like, say, a Democratic proposal to strengthen schools, help businesses devastated by Helene, or cancel a planned $2 million expenditure for moving the State Board of Elections into the building that houses its new overseer, state Auditor Dave Boliek.
The bottom line: In representative government, the majority is supposed to rule. In the North Carolina House a list of anti-democratic restrictions helps make sure that’s regularly not the case.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/NC-House-chamber-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-20 06:01:20.058939

According to the National Institute for Early Education Research’s State of Preschool Yearbook, Virginia has dropped by three spots to 26th in the country in offering preschool access for 3-year-olds, but maintained its 30th place ranking for preschool access for 4-year-olds.
Last year, nearly 10,000 parents in the commonwealth were seeking early childhood care and education services, primarily in the southern and central regions. However, Virginia has made strides enrolling an additional 824 students to its Virginia Preschool Initiative (VPI) and Mixed Delivery programs.
VPI is offered for free for four-year-old children and Mixed Delivery offers funding to private, community-based preschools to serve children at risk of entering school without the necessary skills.
Angela Mancipe, a parent of two from Chesterfield County, said finding a preschool spot for her oldest child during the pandemic was a challenge for her and her husband, considering the waitlist amid nationwide health concerns. While her son was able to land a spot six months later, Mancipe’s life changed after losing her job and becoming pregnant with her daughter, who was also able to be enrolled in a preschool program.
Mancipe recently accepted a part-time assistant teacher position at her daughter’s preschool to help bring in some income, which is housed within a church daycare. She’s fearful of losing her daughter’s spot, saying that when they were first searching for a preschool for her, some of their calls went unanswered. Like many families, the cost of their children’s care and early education is also a persistent challenge.
“It’s insane how much it costs to have your child in daycare,” Mancipe said. “We are very fortunate when it comes to being able to even live off of one income, but to pay double your mortgage to have your children in a safe and well cared for facility with good providers where they’ll get quality care and education, it shouldn’t be double your mortgage.”
 The state of early childhood education in Virginia

The National Institute for Early Education Research said in a statement that state initiatives “propelled” early childhood education in the United States to “historic highs” during the 2023-2024 school year, as preschools recovered from the impacts of the pandemic. 
“Yet, progress has been highly uneven from state to state. While many states advanced by enrolling more children in quality preschool, others lagged, funding no preschool or only low quality programs,” researchers stated. “As federal cutbacks in education and elsewhere are being implemented, it is notable that federal COVID-19 recovery funding played a crucial role in sustaining and advancing preschool, and other federal funds underpin state programs and decrease inequality among the states in access to quality preschool education.”
According to the report, the institute determined the commonwealth’s Virginia Preschool Initiative (VPI) program met five of the 10 quality standard benchmarks, and Mixed Delivery programs, which offer services for infants to preschoolers, met four out of 10. 
Virginia met the benchmarks for both programs by conducting a process to observe student and teacher behaviors in the classroom, meeting the staff-to-child ratio of 1:10 for 3- and 4-year-olds, and following a “comprehensive, aligned, supported and culturally sensitive” set of development standards.
The programs fell short of the requirements, including: that the lead teacher must have a minimum of a bachelor’s degree and specialized training in Pre-K; the assistant teacher must have a minimum of a Child Development Associate (CDA) degree; and the teachers must receive at least 15 hours per year of in-service professional development and training, individualized annual professional development plans and coaching.
Allison Gilbreath, senior director of policy and programs at Voices for Virginia’s Children, said in a statement to the Mercury that the report indicating the decline in preschool access is concerning, given that Virginia’s two preschool programs enrolled nearly 25,000 children last year.
“Investments in four-year-old classrooms are important — but they’re only one piece of the puzzle,” Gilbreath said. “To truly support families and providers, we need a coordinated early childhood system that strengthens access and sustainability across all age groups. A holistic approach is essential to meet the needs of children from birth to five.”
With the uncertainty regarding the national climate lawmakers and advocates are concerned that federal government funding cuts could jeopardize other early childhood care and education initiatives. 
“I am very concerned that progress made at the state level could be affected by cuts at the federal level,” said Del. David Bulova, D-Fairfax. “Early childhood care and education sets the foundation for years of learning and becoming a productive member of society. It is an investment worth protecting and expanding.”
Bulova carried a successful budget amendment to address the early childhood care and education program waitlist in January. Although the amendment did not eliminate the waitlist for the programs entirely, Bulova said it did make significant progress by reducing the Child Care Subsidy Program (CCSP) waitlist by 5,437 since the start of the year.
The waitlist currently stands at 3,278.
Mancipe said she and other parents appreciate the legislature’s work but would like to see it go further. One area she recommended lawmakers continue to address is creating a stable, adequate funding for childcare to support families and providers due to the high costs and staffing shortages.
“We are very thankful for their commitment for what they are doing and the efforts they are making,” Mancipe said. “I think we still have a long way to go.”
 Next steps

During this year’s two-month legislative session, the General Assembly and Gov. Glenn Youngkin approved proposals directing the state to develop a plan for mental health screenings and services for children under the age of 5, clarifying how publicly funded early childhood programs are excluded from specific oversight requirements and expanding the Early Childhood Care and Education Commission by one member, bringing the total to 32. 
The commission is tasked with providing recommendations for and tracking progress on financing Virginia’s comprehensive birth-to-five early childhood care and education system, or VQB5, to improve children’s school readiness and expand access to parents and support providers.
Lawmakers attempted to launch a $25 million Employee Child Care Assistance Pilot Program to expand access to childcare. However the amendment to the biennium budget measure was vetoed by Youngkin earlier this month.
Youngkin said while the commonwealth has made “historical investments” in early learning and child care this biennium, the effort is best considered “in a bill and at a smaller scale to determine program effectiveness and scalability.”
Another failed measure would have strengthened incentives for childcare providers to remain open during “nontraditional” working hours to better serve health care professionals, hospitality workers, first responders, military families, and others with unique needs, said Del. Phil Hernandez, D-Norfolk, who carried the bill.
“There was strong interest in this bill, but it did not advance due to the fiscal impact. We’ll return to this issue in the future,” Hernandez said in a statement to the Mercury.
Other proposals that failed to pass during the short session earlier this year would have increased funding for kindergarten readiness programs, expanded child care to certain qualifying child care providers at no charge and improved retention and recruitment of child care educators designating them as a priority group for the CCSP. 
Del. Elizabeth Bennett-Parker, D-Alexandria, who carried the retention bill, said as a mother of a 2-year-old she understands the challenge of finding affordable, quality childcare. 
“I want all Virginia families to be able to access affordable, quality early childhood education and care from birth. While we are not there yet, we have also made a lot of progress,” Bennett Parker said in a statement. 
She said one area the NIEER report does not cover is the additional 1,000 subsidy slots lawmakers added over two years in the biennium budget.
 Preserving Head Start equals ‘investing in our future’

One program that concerns advocates and lawmakers is Head Start. This program aims to provide all-inclusive education, health, and nutrition services to children whose families fall below the federal poverty line, which is currently around $30,000 for a family of four.
However, on Wednesday, Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert Kennedy Jr. testified that President Donald Trump’s budget would not eliminate the program. Yet some regional offices have been closed and funding has been frozen.
“Protecting and expanding Head Start is a foundational investment,” said Dawn Ault, executive director of the Virginia Head Start Association. “Any reduction or disruption would create childcare deserts where working parents would face impossible choices: leaving the workforce, relying on unreliable care, or falling into deeper financial hardship.”
Head Start was also one of the programs recommended to be eliminated by the authors of Project 2025, a conservative plan for how the country should operate if a Republican won the recent presidential election. In 2021, the authors wrote that the program negatively affected children and that the federal government should  discontinue it. 
However, Ault said an investment in Head Start benefits families and taxpayers. According to the Virginia Head Start Association, Virginia offers 52 Head Start and Early Head Start programs. 
“For every $1 invested in Head Start, we see up to $9 in long-term returns,” Ault said. “That’s not frivolous spending — it’s smart, conservative investing in our future.”

Primary season begins as early voting kicks off Friday and Virginians start shaping the 2025 ballot

The common logic is that you steer as far as you can to the right (for Republicans) or left (among Democrats) to rouse their base voters until they’re ready to chew barbed wire and spit out roofing nails.
Then, after the preseason scrimmage is over, it’s time to tack back toward the center — where the dispositive mass of Virginia’s electorate has repeatedly proved it resides — and, if you still can, appear less the wild-eyed zealot and more the measured, moderate and sane candidate of November.
But something weird is happening this year: folks with no primary opponent seem locked in primary mode, especially within the GOP, where the statewide nominations are already settled.
On the Democratic side, the only statewide candidate without a primary fight is former U.S. Rep. Abigail Spanberger, who has a bye into the November governor’s election. She and Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears, who is unopposed for the Republican nomination, will contend for history’s distinction as the first woman governor in Virginia’s more than 400 years.
There are a half-dozen Democrats — state Sens. Aaron Rouse of Virginia Beach and Ghazala Hashmi of Chesterfield County, former Richmond Mayor Levar Stoney, Prince William County School Board member Babur Lateef, lawyer and labor leader Alex Bastani and career federal prosecutor Victor Salgado — vying for lieutenant governor. None are known statewide and it’s anyone’s guess where that roulette ball lands. The victor will take on Republican John Reid, Virginia’s first openly gay statewide nominee who survived a homophobic attempt to blackmail him off the ticket that backfired spectacularly on the top echelon of Virginia’s GOP.
The GOP’s disgraceful bid to sandbag its openly gay lieutenant governor nominee

In the Democrats’ attorney general sweepstakes, Jay Jones, a former assistant attorney general in the District of Columbia and former House of Delegates member from Norfolk, is battling Henrico County Commonwealth’s Attorney Shannon Taylor. The winner will oppose Republican Jason Miyares, who is running for reelection.
The GOP nominees have the luxury of sniping at these down-ticket Democrats as they go after one another hammer and tongs until the June 17 primary. But the Democrats share a unifying theme. Each promises to shield Virginia from the varied predations of the Trump White House, whether it be reproductive or LGBTQ rights, mass layoffs of Virginia’s large federal workforce or protecting Medicaid, the federal-state program that provides health care for the poor.
Va. GOP congressman’s scrutiny on federal cuts, job losses needs company from other Republicans

That messaging is unlikely to change much after the primary, with good reason: Trump is historically toxic in Virginia. Every time he has either been in office or on the ballot, Republicans have paid the price in Virginia elections.
Trump himself is 0-3 in the commonwealth, losing to Hillary Clinton by 5 percentage points in 2016, Joe Biden by 10 in 2020, and Kamala Harris last November by 6.
Beginning in 2015 — when he descended the golden escalator into the lobby of his eponymous Manhattan skyscraper to announce his first presidential bid — and for the next five years, Virginia Republicans lost. They lost majorities in the state’s U.S. House delegation. They lost every election for statewide office. They lost control of the House of Delegates and the Virginia Senate.
By 2020, Democrats owned every statewide lever of elective political power in Virginia for the first time since 1968.
As soon as Trump was gone, GOP fortunes improved. In 2021, Republicans swept all three statewide executive offices and retook the House of Delegates majority. The ticket was led by Glenn Youngkin, a wealthy former hedge fund executive running for governor in the first election of his life as a fresh-faced, kinder, gentler Republican who judiciously distanced himself from Trump but is now a reliable Trump lieutenant.
Now, Trump is back, and if you thought the first term gave Virginia Democrats plenty to chew on, version 2.0 — supercharged by modern-day Croesus and chainsaw-wielding grim reaper of livelihoods Elon Musk — serves up a banquet.
And that puts this year’s GOP slate in a pickle.
Sure, they’re free to make Democrats account for years of out-of-control federal spending, and a border and immigration policy that the party couldn’t or wouldn’t address when it had the chance. Yes, the GOP is advancing the attack — as it has done for years, and with considerable success last year — that violent crime is on the rise (it’s not) and that “illegals” are driving it (they’re certainly not).
But what they’ve been unwilling to do so far, even though there are no nomination battles to wage, is put distance between themselves and Trump.
Republican candidates who were once stalwart globalist free-traders now sit either in meek acquiescence or voice throaty support for daunting tariffs the president has imposed unilaterally without the concurrence of Congress.
Not one has registered a notable protest over Trump unleashing Musk to eviscerate the federal workforce and curb federal government contracts, even though Northern Virginia has the richest concentration of them in the world with the possible exception of its nextdoor neighbor, the District of Columbia.
These candidates sit mute as the president openly defies the 14th Amendment to the Constitution which guarantees citizenship to all persons born on U.S. soil. They turn blind eyes when masked, unbadged federal agents, without warrants, arrest foreigners — both those here legally and illegally — and try to hustle them outside our borders, often without the due process of law.
Those aren’t conservative vs. liberal issues. Those have been foundational principles of our republic for nearly 250 years! They’re as elemental as our right to face our accusers in court, the right to be free from unwarranted government intrusion into our homes, the right to free speech and religion and the right to keep and bear arms.
But they dare not dispute their president who holds a death grip on what was once the Republican Party and now presumes a measure of almost imperial authority, unbounded by the courts, the Constitution, Congress — and certainly not centuries-old norms of decency and civility. They need look no farther into history than former Rep. Bob Good, R-Va., for a sobering lesson on the consequences of displeasing Trump.
Good, however, was felled in last year’s 5th Congressional District primary by Trump acolyte John McGuire. As Reid convincingly proved, the 2025 GOP statewide ticket is locked in, there are no primaries, and it’s time to move on.
Knowing that, let’s see if Republicans Earle-Sears, Reid and Miyares can reconnect with their party’s longtime creed and muster the character it takes to speak frankly about what Virginia voters — including persuadable moderates and more than a few Republicans — already recognize as the Trump administration’s gross abuses.
That would be so refreshing. It’s also the only hope the GOP has for avoiding a Virginia wipeout this November.

(Getty image)Last week saw the publication of two assessments of what’s wrong with child welfare in Rhode Island. Both missed the point.
On May 12, Kayla David, a vice president of a foster care agency, wrote a commentary for Rhode Island Current suggesting foster parents need more support in order to improve recruitment and retention because, she said, there’s a shortage of such parents.
The next day the state’s “Child Advocate” released a report that included some of the most horrifying cases of child abuse in Rhode Island since 2019. Some of the solutions offered were useful, such as bolstering drug treatment. But many of them were not, such as building more institutions. The Rhode Island House Committee on Oversight is scheduled to hear a presentation on the report on Wednesday.
In both cases, the authors ignored the elephant in the room, the problem at the root of all the others: Rhode Island’s fanatical devotion to tearing apart families. 
We know this because of something else that happened last week: The federal government released its most recent report showing how many children each state forced into foster care. As has been the case for decades, Rhode Island is an extreme outlier. Its rate-of-removal is more than double the national average when rates of child poverty are factored in.
Who are these children? Were they horrifically abused? In rare cases, yes. But in most cases: not even close.
In 87% of cases in which Rhode Island children were forced into foster care, there was not even an allegation of sexual abuse or any form of physical abuse. In 59% of cases, there was not even an allegation of any form of drug or alcohol abuse — not just no allegation of the horrific drug abuse cited by the Child Advocate, no allegation of any substance abuse of any kind.
David’s commentary portrayed foster parents as saviors, rescuing children who, until they came along, couldn’t sleep through the night, never heard laughter and were never listened to. But there also are many other foster children who cry through the night desperate to return to the parents they loved – and laughed with – and who desperately love them back; children who, even years after being reunited may dive under the bed or try to hide in the closet whenever there is a loud knock on the door for fear that they will be taken again; children taken because that family’s poverty was confused with neglect; taken because of what David herself called “unmet needs.”
Given the circumstances under which most children come into care it’s no wonder study after study finds that, in typical cases, children typically fare better in their own homes than with their erstwhile saviors.
So take another look and see if you can spot that elephant: Rhode Island does not have too few foster parents; Rhode Island has too many foster children. If Rhode Island took away children at a rate no worse than the national average, hundreds of spaces would open up in existing foster homes. 
And if caseworkers were not deluged with false reports, trivial cases, poverty cases and needless foster care they would have more time to investigate every case properly and be more likely to spot those relatively few children in real danger in time.










Take another look and see if you can spot that elephant: Rhode Island does not have too few foster parents; Rhode Island has too many foster children.


The solutions are not that complicated. Even small amounts of additional cash to ameliorate the worst effects of poverty significantly reduce what agencies call “neglect.” So imagine how much of this neglect we could eliminate if birth parents received $1,050 to $2,850 per-month per-child, tax-free. Because that’s what Rhode Island foster parents are getting to take care of those children, plus Medicaid coverage for each foster child, even “birthday and holiday stipends” – which begs the question: Would you want a child placed with someone who won’t buy that child a birthday present without the state paying for it?
Children can be taken from their own impoverished parents for inadequate supervision. Yet all foster parents, regardless of income, qualify for Rhode Island’s Child Care Assistance Program for any foster child under age 13.
The best foster parents know this. In her book, Memoirs of a Babystealer, Maine foster and adoptive parent Mary Callahan writes that almost every child she fostered could have remained safely in their own homes if their own parents had gotten the assistance she got as a foster mother.
As for the children with extraordinary behavioral health needs, the worst thing to do is to keep institutionalizing them as the Child Advocate’s report suggests. Instead, invest in wraparound programs that bring intensive help right into a family’s home or, when placement is really needed, a foster home.
But none of that is likely to happen until, at long last, someone in power in Rhode Island says: “Would you look at that? There’s an elephant in the room!”

(Photo by Dana Wormald/New Hampshire Bulletin)As they consider laws to encourage more housing this year, New Hampshire lawmakers have so far been more interested in the stick than the carrot. 
The Legislature has pushed forward a number of bills intended to overhaul zoning procedures that housing advocates say impede badly needed development. Some bills, such as ones to help expand accessory dwelling units and allow for “mixed-use” developments in commercial zones, represent the biggest state-driven changes to zoning laws in years.
But lawmakers are less focused on another policy tool: financial incentives. In its version of the budget, the House has stripped out funding for a program designed to encourage cities and towns to voluntarily change their zoning codes to be more housing friendly.
Now, pro-housing groups are pushing the Senate to restore at least some of that funding, arguing the zoning changes are only one piece of the puzzle. And the New Hampshire Municipal Association — which broadly opposes any bills that would override local zoning codes — argues financial incentives for towns should be the state’s sole approach. 
The Senate Finance Committee has an opportunity this month to dramatically reverse some of the House’s cuts. The Senate has already passed independent bills that together include $90 million of spending on housing — all of which could be added into the budget if desired. 
But the Senate is also grappling with projections suggesting lower-than-ideal business tax revenues, suggesting that it can restore some, but not all, of the House’s budget cuts in April. In total, the House cut $643 million from Ayotte’s budget; revenue projections from the Senate Ways and Means Committee suggest the body could restore only about half of that spending. 
An absence of funding
Nick Taylor, director of Housing Action New Hampshire, an advocacy group, notes the House-passed budget contains no new funding going toward affordable housing development. 
The House defunded the Housing Champion Program, which provides special grants to towns and cities that change their zoning codes to meet certain standards deemed friendlier to housing development. Under the program, towns that do so can receive state assistance for infrastructure funding and per-unit production grants.
Eighteen towns qualified in 2024, according to the New Hampshire Department of Business and Economic Affairs: Boscawen, Concord, Derry, Dover, Enfield, Farmington, Hinsdale, Hooksett, Jaffrey, Keene, Lebanon, Manchester, Nashua, Newport, Portsmouth, Rochester, Salem, and Somersworth.
Ayotte’s budget did not continue funding the program, which first passed in 2023. Instead, it extended the lapse date for the $5 million appropriated in 2023, allowing more time for the existing money to be distributed. But the House’s budget would end the program and redirect the unspent money.
House lawmakers also rejected proposals by Housing Action NH and others to increase the amount of funding going to the state’s affordable housing program — which helps to finance affordable housing projects — from $5 million per year to $10 million, and to double a tax credit program that funds the state’s Community Development Finance Authority from $5 million a year to $10 million. 
For lawmakers to focus only on zoning and not financing is a mistake, Taylor says. 
“Relaxing the regulatory piece is a big deal when it comes to allowing for more attainable market-rate options like (accessory dwelling units), like mixed-use development, (and) manufactured housing. But when you really get to the deeply affordable levels, you need the financing piece there too. And that is in danger of being left out of the equation this session.”
Brodie Deshaies, legislative advocate for the New Hampshire Municipal Association, agrees that more funding should be devoted to allow municipalities to craft pro-housing zoning codes that work for their residents. 
But the Municipal Association deviates from pro-housing groups by strongly opposing any state-passed laws to force cities and towns to change zoning.
“It seems zoning mandates are a priority, and that has no guarantee of more affordable housing, more workforce housing, even more housing in general,” he said in an interview. “Just because you’ve mandated that a municipality can’t have a specific zoning ordinance … what is a (landowner’s) incentive to build or to work with a developer to build?”
He added: “In the current Legislature, we’re seeing no collaborative process, no willingness to work with municipalities,” he said. “Instead, it seems very (strongly) working against municipalities.” 
Deshaies also predicted that though concern over the state’s housing crisis dominates New Hampshire polls, many residents will not like the zoning laws when they apply to their own towns. 
“I think a lot of residents and municipalities are going to look and say, ‘When I thought more housing, I was not thinking this,’” he said. 
A focus on regulations
Republican lawmakers who are pro-housing offer a different perspective. To them, the financial incentives championed by Housing Action and the Municipal Association are much less important than the regulatory reforms.
Rep. Joe Alexander, a Goffstown Republican and the chairman of the House Housing Committee, says that he supports the Housing Champion Program and would vote to fund it as a standalone bill. But he said the state can still pass meaningful legislation to boost housing without financial incentives.
Alexander pointed to a pair of bills moving to Ayotte’s desk that he said will have the biggest impact: House Bill 631, which would require municipalities to allow multi-family developments in commercial zones, such as shopping areas; and House Bill 577, which would allow homeowners to build a detached accessory dwelling unit by right and expand the size limitations to do so. Both bills would allow cities to set zoning requirements, such as appearance, for those developments. 
Lawmakers are also moving along Senate Bill 188, which would allow homebuilders to use third-party inspectors to approve new homes rather than wait for state inspectors, and House Bill 428, which would prevent towns from making new changes to the state building codes, Alexander noted. SB 188 is moving to a vote on the House floor with a positive recommendation from the Housing Committee, and HB 428 passed the Senate on May 15.
“I’m not necessarily thinking that if we throw money at it, it’s going to solve the problem,” Alexander said. “I actually truly think the free market is going to be able to build affordable homes if we cut the red tape, cut the spending. We’ll build affordable homes when there’s enough supply. The market will adjust.”",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/housing2zone-1024x799.jpg,,,2025-05-20 06:01:20.058939

Puskar/The Associated Press)In submitting her updated budget proposal in March, Arizona Gov. Katie Hobbs lamented the rising costs of the state’s school vouchers program that directs public dollars to pay private school tuition.
Characterizing vouchers as an “entitlement program,” Hobbs said the state could spend more than $1 billion subsidizing private education in the upcoming fiscal year. The Democratic governor said those expenses could crowd out other budget priorities, including disability programs and pay raises for firefighters and state troopers.
It’s a dilemma that some budget experts fear will become more common nationwide as the costs of school choice measures mount across the states, reaching billions of dollars each year.
“School vouchers are increasingly eating up state budgets in a way that I don’t think is sustainable long term,” said Whitney Tucker, director of state fiscal policy research at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a think tank that advocates for left-leaning tax policies.
Vouchers and scholarship programs, which use taxpayer money to cover private school tuition, are part of the wider school choice movement that also includes charter schools and other alternatives to public schools.
Opponents have long warned about vouchers draining resources from public education as students move from public schools to private ones. But research into several programs has shown many voucher recipients already were enrolled in private schools. That means universal vouchers could drive up costs by creating two parallel education systems — both funded by taxpayers.











School vouchers are increasingly eating up state budgets in a way that I don't think is sustainable long term.


– Whitney Tucker, director of state fiscal policy research at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities



In Arizona, state officials reported most private school students receiving vouchers in the first two years of the expanded program were not previously enrolled in public schools. In fiscal year 2024, more than half the state’s 75,000 voucher recipients were previously enrolled in private schools or were being homeschooled.
“Vouchers don’t shift costs — they add costs,” Joshua Cowen, a professor of education policy at Michigan State University who studies the issue, recently told Stateline. “Most voucher recipients were already in private schools, meaning states are paying for education they previously didn’t have to fund.”
Voucher proponents, though, say those figures can be misleading. Arizona, like other states with recent expansions, previously had more modest voucher programs. So some kids who were already enrolled in private schools could have already been receiving state subsidies.
In addition to increasing competition, supporters say the programs can actually save taxpayer dollars by delivering education at a lower overall cost than traditional public schools.
One thing is certain: With a record number of students receiving subsidies to attend private schools, vouchers are quickly creating budget concerns for some state leaders.
The rising costs of school choice measures come after years of deep cuts to income taxes in many states, leaving them with less money to spend. An end of pandemic-era aid and potential looming cuts to federal support also have created widespread uncertainty about state budgets.
Trump’s school choice push adds to momentum in statehouses

“We’re seeing a number of things that are creating a sort of perfect storm from a fiscal perspective in the states,” said Tucker, of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.
Last year, Arizona leaders waded through an estimated $1.3 billion budget shortfall. Budget experts said the voucher program was responsible for hundreds of millions of that deficit.
A new universal voucher program in Texas is expected to cost $1 billion over its next two-year budget cycle — a figure that could balloon to nearly $5 billion by 2030, according to a legislative fiscal note.
Earlier this year, Wyoming Republican Gov. Mark Gordon signed a bill expanding the state’s voucher program. But last week, he acknowledged his own “substantial concerns” about the state’s ability to fund vouchers and its public education obligations under the constitution.
“I think the legislature’s got a very tall task to understand how they’re going to be able to fund all of these things,” he said in an interview with WyoFile.
Voucher proponents, who have been active at the state level for years, are gaining new momentum with support from President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans.
In January, Trump ordered federal agencies to allow states, tribes and military families to access federal money for private K-12 education through education savings accounts, voucher programs or tax credits.
Last week, Republicans on the House Ways and Means Committee voted in favor of making $20 billion available over the next four years for a federal school voucher program. Part of broader work on a bill to extend Trump’s 2017 tax cuts, the measure would need a simple majority in the House and the Senate to pass.
Sweeping private school voucher program tucked inside US House tax bill

Martin Lueken, the director of the Fiscal Research and Education Center at EdChoice, a nonprofit that advocates for school choice measures, argues school choice measures can actually deliver savings to taxpayers.
Lueken said vouchers are not to blame for state budget woes. He said public school systems for years have increased spending faster than inflation. And he noted that school choice measures make up a small share of overall state spending — nationally about 0.3% of total state expenditures in states with school choice, he said.
“Public schooling remains one of the largest line items in state budgets,” he said in an interview. “They are still the dominant provider of K-12 education, and certainly looking at the education pie, they still receive the lion’s share.
“It’s not a choice problem. I would say that it’s a problem with the status quo and the public school system,” he said.
Washington, D.C., and 35 states offer some school choice programs, according to EdChoice. That includes 18 states with voucher programs so expansive that virtually all students can participate regardless of income.
But Lueken said framing vouchers as a new entitlement program is misleading. That’s because all students, even the wealthiest, have always been entitled to a public education — whether they’ve chosen to attend free public schools or private ones that charge tuition.
“At the end of the day, the thing that matters most above dollars are students and families,” he said. “Research is clear that competition works. Public schools have responded in very positive ways when they are faced with increased competitive pressure from choice programs.”
Public school advocates say funding both private and public schools is untenable.
Some states reexamine school discipline as Trump order paves go-ahead

In Wisconsin, Republican lawmakers are considering a major voucher expansion that would alter the funding structure for vouchers, potentially putting more strain on the state’s general fund.
The state spent about $629 million on its four voucher programs during the 2024-2025 school year, according to the Wisconsin Association of School Business Officials, which represents employees in school district finance, human resources and leadership.
The association warns proposed legislation could exacerbate problems with the “unaffordable parallel school systems” in place now by shifting more private schooling costs from parents of those students to state taxpayers at large.
Such expansion “could create the conditions for even greater funding challenges for Wisconsin’s traditional public schools and the state budget as a whole,” the association’s research director wrote in a paper on the issue.
In Arizona, Hobbs originally sought to eliminate the universal voucher program — a nonstarter in the Republican-controlled legislature. She has since proposed shrinking the program by placing income limits that would disqualify the state’s wealthiest families.
That idea also faced Republican opposition.
Legislators are now pushing to enshrine access to vouchers in the state constitution.
Marisol Garcia, president of the Arizona Education Association, the state’s 20,000-member teachers union, noted that vouchers and public education funds are both sourced from the general fund.
“So it almost immediately started to impact public services,” she said of the universal voucher program.
While the union says vouchers have led to cutbacks of important resources such as counselors in public schools, Garcia said the sweeping program also affects the state’s ability to fund other services like housing, transportation and health care.
“Every budget cycle becomes where can we cut in order to essentially feed this out-of-control program?” she said.

(Photo by Wichayada Suwanachun/Getty Images)The issue of drug pricing has been as pressing in Ohio as anywhere. President Donald Trump last week issued an executive order requiring drugmakers to offer their products as cheaply here as they do overseas.
But players in the industry say the order lacks detail about how it would make that happen. An Ohio expert said the order ignores the arcane, often self-serving way drug prices are inflated by myriad players in the United States — including the government itself. 
In Ohio, the cost of prescription drugs has been an issue of major contention the last several years, including lawsuits against drug middlemen known as Pharmacy Benefit Managers, who’ve been accused of vertical integration, inflating prices, and deterrence of competition.
Trump last Monday issued his executive order, Delivering Most-Favored-Nation Drug Pricing to American Patients. 
The order notes that the United States has less than 5% of the world’s population, yet Americans pay “three quarters of global pharmaceutical profits.” It accuses drugmakers of unfairly billing Americans for research and development while agreeing to lower prices demanded by governments of other developed countries.
“Drug manufacturers, rather than seeking to equalize evident price discrimination, agree to other countries’ demands for low prices, and simultaneously fight against the ability for public and private payers in the United States to negotiate the best prices for patients,” the order says. “The inflated prices in the United States fuel global innovation while foreign health systems get a free ride.”
The order instructs U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert Kennedy Jr. within 30 days to “communicate most-favored-nation price targets to pharmaceutical manufacturers…” Using that list, the government could import drugs selling more cheaply in other countries on a “case-by-case” basis, the order says.
However, there are about 20,000 different prescription drugs sold in the United States. The order doesn’t explain how, in just a month, anyone can gather and analyze global pricing data and decide which countries are  getting the best deal on each — much less set up and administer a “case-by-case” system on such a scale.
And there’s the much bigger question of what Trump means by “price.” That word can have many definitions in the inefficient health care system of the United States. 
There’s the list price — the price you would have to pay if you don’t have any insurance or other form of discount. But that’s not the price that is typically paid.
The drug middlemen known as pharmacy benefit managers, or PBMs, play a huge role in determining list and net prices in tens of millions of prescription drug transactions. 
The biggest three are part of giant health care conglomerates — UnitedHealth Group, CVS Health and Cigna-Express Scripts — that also own top-10 insurance companies. The big PBMs represent those insurers and other payers in prescription-drug transactions.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Two facts about the big PBMs are of great relevance to drug pricing: Combined, the big three handle almost 80% of the insured drug transactions. And they decide which drugs are covered by insurance, and which of those get the most favorable treatment — usually in the form of the lowest copayment.
That enables them to get drugmakers to pay them big — and growing — rebates in exchange for favorable treatment. Drugmakers have been shown to increase list prices to cover the often-nontransparent rebates.
“Because rebates are based on list prices, PBMs are incentivized to prefer drugs with higher list prices, even when cheaper generics and biosimilars are available,” Emma Freer of the American Economic Liberties Project wrote in an MSNBC column Tuesday.
For example, the Federal Trade Commission is suing the big PBMs over insulin practices it says benefitted both the PBMs and the three companies that manufacture almost all the insulin in the United States. It said the PBMs excluded cheaper drugs from coverage so it could chase bigger rebates from more-expensive alternatives. 
That would be a win-win for the drugmaker and the middleman. But it would be a big loser for the diabetic who has to make copayments based on inflated list prices, or who has to shoulder the full freight.
While Trump’s executive order accuses other countries of taking advantage of Americans, it’s silent on rebates.
The order is also silent on whether “most-favored-nation pricing” would be enjoyed by all Americans, or just those covered by government programs like Medicare and Medicaid.
Antonio Ciaccia, the Columbus, Ohio-based president of drug-pricing consultant 3 Axis Advisors, said the government also has a strong interest in high drug prices.
That’s because the federal government also gets huge amounts in drugmaker rebates. And that’s money it can use to justify other spending, or tax cuts.
For example, drugmakers are only allowed to pay rebates in Medicare because they’re exempted from the federal anti-kickback statute. Trump in 2020 issued an executive order that would have greatly narrowed the exemption, but it went nowhere.
Then, in 2022, an extension of anti-kickback exemptions under Medicare was slipped into an unrelated gun bill. Democrats and Republicans voted for the bill. Sen. Rob Portman, R-Ohio, gave a reason — the federal government stood to collect an estimated $180 billion in Medicare rebates over a decade.
Allowing rebates might cost Americans and their government more over the long run, but as budgets are written, they’re revenue that can be used for other things. In government circles, it’s known as a “pay-for.” 
In an email, Ciaccia said that giving government an incentive to chase rebates inflates drug prices and that works against Trump’s stated priorities.
“The biggest lie in the drug supply chain is that government wants lower prices for medicines,” he said. “What government actually wants is bigger discounts off the prices of medicines.” 
He added, “When public policy is explicitly designed to inflate drug prices and then soak discounts off those prices to fund ‘other’ things, if you actually lower the prices, those ‘other things’ are in big trouble. This is why the U.S. government can’t get enough of this addictive horse-trading of drug money for other priorities, which is why high prices reign supreme.”

(Photo by Graham Stokes for the Ohio Capital Journal. Republish photo only with original story.)With minimal debate last week, the Ohio Senate advanced a measure effectively prohibiting ranked choice voting in the state. ‘Effectively’ because state lawmakers actually can’t ban the practice. Instead, Senate Bill 63 threatens to withhold an important stream of state funding for any local government that embraces ranked choice.
The proposal’s sponsors are bipartisan, and although the bill passed easily the vote split the chamber’s Democrats. Five of the Senate’s nine Democrats voted no. The bill now moves to the Ohio House where there is no companion legislation.
Lawmakers’ arguments
State Sens. Theresa Gavarone, R-Bowling Green, and Bill DeMora, D-Columbus, sponsored the measure, and both made their pitch to fellow senators when it came up for a vote. Gavarone said she’s spent much of her time in office working on elections-related legislation.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
“Ranked choice voting flies in the face of that commonsense work by causing greater uncertainty and delayed election results that can take days or even weeks to settle,” she argued.
Gavarone said the process reduces turnout and creates confusion among voters and administrators. Apparently referencing a forthcoming article, she argued 1 in 20 voters mismark their ballot in some way.
She added that in 2024, several states with ballot measures enacting a ranked choice system rejected those proposals.
DeMora defended their bid to deprive ranked-choice municipalities of state funding.
“It doesn’t outlaw them, it doesn’t say they can’t do it. It just withholds state funds for those that do it,” he said. “May sound harsh, but it’s necessary. Ranked choice voting is expensive, confusing, and time consuming.”
DeMora noted Cuyahoga County elections officials have testified elections equipment around Ohio isn’t built to handle ranked choice elections. And he pointed to local elections in Portland, Oregon in which more than 100 candidates ran for city council and almost 20 ran for mayor.
“That’s not voter empowerment. It’s voter overload,” he argued, “The result — roughly 20% of all Portlanders, did not vote for any council candidate, and nearly 15% didn’t vote for mayor.”
Following the vote, Senate President Rob McColley argued that states that instituted ranked choice like Alaska have had buyer’s remorse. Although the vote was close, Alaska voters actually decided to keep their ranked choice system last November.
Still, McColley argued ranked choice “doesn’t do what it markets itself as doing.” He rejected the idea that through multiple rounds of counting, ranked choice arrives at a winner with majority support.
“What you’re doing instead is you’re saying this is the person that people ranked in their top however many choices,” he said. “It doesn’t necessarily mean it’s the best candidate, it doesn’t necessarily mean that a majority got it.”
Ranked choice supporters weigh in
As the bill moved through committee, ranked choice supporters far outnumbered those speaking in favor of the ban.
The group Rank the Vote Ohio helped organize that opposition and advocates for ranked choice around the state. They’ve made some inroads, but those successes have been modest.
Charter review committees in two cities, Cleveland Heights and Lakewood, have recommended putting a ranked choice charter amendment on the ballot. A handful of others are considering similar moves, and organizers are trying advance a charter amendment in Cincinnati.
Rank the Vote Ohio Executive Director Denise Riley said Gavarone and DeMora are presenting an incorrect account of ranked choice voting “to justify subverting the Ohio Constitution to suppress voters’ choices.”
“These senators have ignored the pleas from their constituents to stop spreading electoral disinformation, despite ample testimony refuting their lies,” she argued.
Riley pushed back on claims that ranked choice delays results.
“The majority of RCV jurisdictions,” she said, “release preliminary results the night of or day after the election, just as other cities do.”
Riley noted delays often have to do with allowing time for absentee ballots to arrive, not the time it takes to tabulate ballots
Riley rejected claims that procedure reduces participation, pointing to Maine’s nation-leading turnout in 2022 and a report published by the American Bar Association. She dismissed arguments about voter confusion noting several states in which exit polling showed voters understood what they were doing.
“Hopefully the Ohio House and Governor Mike DeWine won’t be tricked into subverting the Ohio Constitution based on lies,” Riley said.
For what it’s worth, the sponsors’ testimony was at times misleading. Although several states did reject ranked choice voting last year, two of those cited by Gavarone (Montana and Arizona) weren’t voting on ranked choice — they were considering different versions of open or so-called ‘jungle’ primaries.
That approach puts candidates from all parties on a single ballot with some number of top vote-getters advancing to the general election.
And DeMora’s complaints about voters not casting a ballot in a given race, known as an undervote, is at best disingenuous. He misspoke when it comes to Portland’s mayoral race — the analysis from OregonLive he relied on put the mayoral undervote at 11%, not 15%. Based on a comprehensive report from county election officials it appears that count includes undervotes and overvotes, where a voter marks two candidates at the same rank. The actual undervote was less than 7%.
Regardless, it’s not uncommon at all in local races for voters to leave a race blank. Consider the 2023 mayoral and city council races right here in Columbus. Roughly 15% of voters left the mayor’s race blank — the same amount DeMora mistakenly cited in Portland. And in Columbus’ city council races, the undervote was staggering. While Portland saw roughly 20% of voters leave council races blank, in Columbus the undervote ranged from 44%-77%.

(Photo by Dennis Tangney Jr./Getty Images)As the New Hampshire Senate considers the House-adopted budget for fiscal year 2026-27 — which includes a potential cut in support for the University System of New Hampshire — I want to express the importance of a strong university system for the state’s businesses. My own experience as a business owner in Portsmouth shows me that a strong, capable, and well-funded university can lead to thriving businesses and economies as well.
In 2003, I moved from Canada to Portsmouth to establish the company headquarters for a business called Interactive Visualization Systems, or IVS3D, which focused on seafloor mapping technologies. We quickly partnered with UNH’s Center for Coastal and Ocean Mapping (CCOM), a world-renowned research and education center for ocean mapping and hydrographic sciences, which operates as a formal cooperative partnership with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). CCOM was established 25 years ago to expand the scope of ocean mapping interaction and collaboration with the private sector, government agencies, and other universities.
What our company quickly discovered is the operational model and structure implemented at UNH has made the rapid transfer of research and development, or R&D, from research to industry not just possible, but incredibly successful. Without collaborative R&D through a public university, it is significantly more difficult — and sometimes not economically feasible — for private companies and industry to make that leap.
Our firm’s partnership with UNH resulted in the successful transfer of significant seafloor mapping and hydrographic technologies, which allowed our company to extend products with new capabilities and modules that broadened and strengthened our international market position. These technologies have led to significant economic activity, directly supported new jobs in New Hampshire, and directly or indirectly supported various areas of the blue economy — the economic activities related to the oceans and coasts.
IVS3D was awarded the Exporter of the Year in 2006 by the Software Association of New Hampshire and the New Hampshire International Trade Association. There is no doubt that our partnership with UNH’s Center for Coastal and Ocean Mapping was a significant factor in our firm’s success and in receiving this accolade.
It is clear that a strong university system allows continued industry collaboration and expertise, and helps to grow our state’s economy; it means new ideas and innovation right here in New Hampshire. Investing in our university system means investing in the many businesses and industries in our state. It’s vital to the future of our economy that New Hampshire lawmakers recognize the importance of adequately funded higher education.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/unhdurham-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-20 05:02:04.161425

Ohio state Rep. Tex Fischer, R-Boardman, introduced a bill last week that would require Ohio State football games to kick off at 3:30 p.m. or later if the Buckeyes are playing a top-10 ranked team in the Associated Press poll. 
“A few weeks ago, I said it would be a crime for FOX to put Ohio State vs Texas at noon,” Fischer said in a post on X, formerly known as Twitter. “Promises made, promises kept!”

The Ohio State Buckeyes kick off their season against the Texas Longhorns in Columbus on Aug. 30. The time of the game has not been released, but it will air on Fox and is expected to be a noon game. 
The game will be a rematch of the Cotton Bowl from earlier this year, which the Buckeyes won 28-14 — eventually going on to win the National Championship by defeating the Notre Dame Fighting Irish. 
The Ohio Attorney General would slap a $10 million fine against either the host team’s athletic conference or the television network broadcasting if a game was played starting at noon — “whichever party scheduled the earlier start time,” according to the bill. 
Ohio State has played a lot of noon games in recent years on Fox Big Noon Kickoff. The Buckeyes played five Big Noon Kickoff games during their last season. Former Ohio State football coach Urban Meyer joined the Fox Big Noon Kickoff in 2019 for two seasons and returned in 2022 after coaching the Jacksonville Jaguars for a year. 
The Ohio State-Michigan game, which is traditionally played at noon, would be an exception, according to the bill. 
Ohio Sen. Bill DeMora, D-Columbus, is also trying to use legislation to change how Buckeye fans can watch the games. Ohio Senate Bill 94 would ban state universities from entering into or renewing contracts to broadcast a game exclusively on a streaming service. 
Ohio State has exclusively streamed some of their football games in recent years on the streaming service Peacock.

(Photo by David DeWitt, Ohio Capital Journal.)This story was originally published by ProPublica, a Pulitzer Prize-winning investigative newsroom. Sign up for The Big Story newsletter to receive stories like this one in your inbox.

Just one year ago, JD Vance was a leading advocate of the Great Lakes and the efforts to restore the largest system of freshwater on the face of the planet.
As a U.S. senator from Ohio, Vance called the lakes “an invaluable asset” for his home state. He supported more funding for a program that delivers “the tools we need to fight invasive species, algal blooms, pollution, and other threats to the ecosystem” so that the Great Lakes would be protected “for generations to come.”
But times have changed.
This spring, Vance is vice president, and President Donald Trump’s administration is imposing deep cuts and new restrictions, upending the very restoration efforts that Vance once championed. With the peak summer season just around the corner, Great Lakes scientists are concerned that they have lost the ability to protect the public from toxic algal blooms, which can kill animals and sicken people.
Cutbacks have gutted the staff at the Great Lakes Environmental Research Laboratory, part of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Severe spending limits have made it difficult to purchase ordinary equipment for processing samples, such as filters and containers. Remaining staff plans to launch large data-collecting buoys into the water this week, but it’s late for a field season that typically runs from April to October.
Musk, Trump threats to NOAA could harm Great Lakes

In addition to a delayed launch, problems with personnel, supplies, vessel support and real-time data sharing have created doubts about the team’s ability to operate the buoys, said Gregory Dick, director of the NOAA cooperative institute at the University of Michigan that partners with the lab. Both the lab and institute operate out of a building in Ann Arbor, Michigan, that was custom built as NOAA’s hub in the Great Lakes region, and both provide staff to the algal blooms team.
“This has massive impacts on coastal communities,” Dick said.
Multiple people who have worked with the lab also told ProPublica that there are serious gaps in this year’s monitoring of algal blooms, which are often caused by excess nutrient runoff from farms. Data generated by the lab’s boats and buoys, and publicly shared, could be limited or interrupted, they said.
That data has helped to successfully avoid a repeat of a 2014 crisis in Toledo, Ohio, when nearly half a million people were warned to not drink the water or even touch it.
If the streams of information are cut off, “stakeholders will be very unhappy,” said Bret Collier, a branch chief at the lab who oversaw the federal scientists that run the harmful algal bloom program for the Great Lakes. He was fired in the purge of federal probationary workers in February.
The lab has lost about 35% of its 52-member workforce since February, according to the president of the lab’s union, and it was not allowed to fill several open positions. The White House released preliminary budget recommendations last week that would make significant cuts to NOAA. The budget didn’t provide details, but indicated the termination of “a variety of climate-dominated research, data, and grant programs, which are not aligned with Administration policy” of ending “‘Green New Deal’ initiatives.”
An earlier document obtained by ProPublica and reported widely proposed a 74% funding cut to NOAA’s research office, home of the Great Lakes lab.
Vance’s office didn’t respond to questions from ProPublica about how federal cuts have affected Great Lakes research. The White House also didn’t respond to messages.
Municipal water leaders in Cleveland and Toledo have written public letters of support on behalf of the lab, advocating for the continuation of its work because of how important its tools and resources are for drinking water management.
In a statement to ProPublica, staffers from Toledo’s water system credited the Great Lakes lab and NOAA for alerting it to potential blooms near its intake days ahead of time. This has saved the system significant costs, they said, and helped it avoid feeding excess chemicals into the water.

“The likelihood of another 2014 ‘don’t drink the water’ advisory has been minimized to almost nothing by additional vigilance” from both the lab and local officials, they said.
Remaining staff have had to contend with not only a lack of capacity but also tight limits on spending and travel.
Several people who have worked in or with the lab said that the staff was hampered by strict credit card limits imposed on government employees as part of the effort to reduce spending by the Department of Government Efficiency, which has been spearheaded by presidential adviser Elon Musk.
“The basic scientific supplies that we use to provide the local communities with information on algal bloom toxicity — our purchasing of them is being restricted based on the limitations currently being put in by the administration,” Collier said.
NOAA and the Department of Commerce, which oversees the agency, didn’t respond to messages from ProPublica. Neither did a DOGE official. Eight U.S. senators, including the minority leader, sent a letter in March to a top NOAA leader inquiring about many of the changes, but they never received a response.
The department described its approach to some of its cuts when it eliminated nearly $4 million in funding for the NOAA cooperative institute at Princeton University and emphasized the importance of avoiding wasteful government spending. ProPublica has reported on how the loss of research grants at Princeton and the more significant defunding of the NOAA lab it works with would be a serious setback for weather and climate preparedness.
A number of the staffing losses at the Great Lakes lab came when employees accepted offers of early retirement or voluntary separation; others were fired probationary workers targeted by DOGE across the government. That includes Collier, who had 24 years of professional experience, largely as a research professor, before he was hired last year into a position that, according to the lab’s former director, had been difficult to fill.
A scientist specializing in the toxic algal blooms was also fired. She worked on the team for 14 years through the cooperative institute before accepting a federal position last year, which made her probationary, too.
A computer scientist who got real-time data onto the lab’s website — and the only person who knew how to push out the weekly sampling data on harmful algal blooms — was also fired. She was probationary because she too was hired for a federal position after working with the institute.
And because of a planned retirement, no one holds the permanent position of lab director, though there is an acting director. The lab isn’t allowed to fill any positions due to a federal hiring freeze.
At the same time, expected funds for the lab’s cooperative institute are delayed, which means, Dick said, it may soon lay off staff, including people on the algal blooms team.
In March, Cleveland’s water commissioner wrote a letter calling for continued support for the Great Lakes lab and other NOAA-funded operations in the region, saying that access to real-time forecasts for Lake Erie are “critically important in making water treatment decisions” for more than 1.3 million citizens.
In 2006, there was a major outbreak of hypoxia, an issue worsened by algal blooms where oxygen-depleted water can become corrosive, discolored and full of excess manganese, which is a neurotoxin at high levels. Cleveland Water collaborated with the lab on developing a “groundbreaking” hypoxia forecast model, said Scott Moegling, who worked for both the Cleveland utility and Ohio’s drinking water regulatory agency.
“I knew which plants were going to get hit,” Moegling said. “I knew about when, and I knew what the treatment we would need would be, and we could staff accordingly.”
The American Meteorological Society, in partnership with the National Weather Association, spotlighted this warning system in its statement in support of NOAA research, saying that it helps “keep drinking water potable in the Great Lakes region.”
Collier, the former branch chief, said that quality data may be lacking this year, not just for drinking water suppliers, but also the U.S. Coast Guard, fisheries, shipping companies, recreational businesses and shoreline communities that rely on it to navigate risk. In response to a recent survey of stakeholders, the president of a trade organization serving Great Lakes cargo vessels said that access to NOAA’s real-time data “is critically important to the commercial shipping fleet when making navigation decisions.”
Because federal law requires NOAA to monitor harmful algal blooms, the cuts may run against legal obligations, several current and former workers told ProPublica. The blooms program was “federally mandated to be active every single day, without exception,” Collier said.
The 2024 bloom in Lake Erie was the earliest on record. At its peak, it covered 550 square miles. Warming temperatures worsen the size and frequency of algal blooms. While the field season was historically only about 90 days, Collier said, last year the team was deployed for 211 days.
As the shallowest of the Great Lakes, Lake Erie is typically first to show signs of problems. But it’s also an emblem of environmental stewardship, thanks to its striking recovery from unchecked industrial pollution. The lake was once popularly declared “dead.” A highly publicized fire inflamed a river that feeds into it. Even Dr. Seuss knocked it in the 1971 version of “The Lorax.” The book described fish leaving a polluted pond “in search of some water that isn’t so smeary. I hear things are just as bad up in Lake Erie.”

But the rise of agencies like the Environmental Protection Agency and NOAA, and labs like the one protecting the Great Lakes, along with legislation that protected water from pollution, led to noticeable changes. By 1986, two Ohio graduate students had succeeded in persuading Theodor Geisel, the author behind Dr. Seuss, to revise future editions of his classic book.
“I should no longer be saying bad things about a body of water that is now, due to great civic and scientific effort, the happy home of smiling fish,” Geisel wrote to them.
Early this year, headlines out of the Midwest suggested that “Vance could be a game-changing Great Lakes advocate” and that he might “save the Great Lakes from Trump.”
A 2023 report to Congress about the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative, a popular funding mechanism for projects that protect the lakes, including the research lab’s, described the lab’s work on harmful algal blooms as one of its “success stories.” Last year, with Vance as a co-sponsor, an act to extend support for the funding program passed the Senate, but stalled in the House. Another bipartisan effort to reauthorize it launched in January.
Project 2025, the plan produced by the Heritage Foundation for Trump’s second term, recommended that the president consider whether NOAA “should be dismantled and many of its functions eliminated, sent to other agencies, privatized, or placed under the control of states and territories.”
NOAA is “a colossal operation that has become one of the main drivers of the climate change alarm industry,” the plan said, and this industry’s mission “seems designed around the fatal conceit of planning for the unplannable.”
“That is not to say NOAA is useless,” it added, “but its current organization corrupts its useful functions. It should be broken up and downsized.”
When asked at his confirmation hearing in January if he agreed with Project 2025’s recommendation of dismantling NOAA, Howard Lutnick, head of the commerce department, said no.
One month later, the Great Lakes lab’s probationary staff got termination notices. That includes Nicole Rice, who spent a decade with NOAA. A promotion made her communications job vulnerable to the widespread firings of federal probationary workers.
In recent testimony to a Michigan Senate committee, Rice expressed deep concern about the future of the Great Lakes.
“It has taken over a century of bipartisan cooperation, investment and science to bring the Great Lakes back from the brink of ecological collapse,” Rice said. “But these reckless cuts could undo the progress in just a few short years, endangering the largest surface freshwater system in the world.”

(Getty Images)I have a dear friend who I have helped with different issues over the years. She is a disabled senior with limited eyesight, and she also has no car. I met her about 11 years ago, and while I am much younger we care about each other.
About four years ago, I recommended that she sign up for a program I had heard about — Section 8. That’s a housing assistance program funded by the federal government in which individuals in need — those who qualify — can apply and receive help in paying for a house or an apartment whose landlord takes the Section 8 voucher.
I told my friend: “You should sign up for this. It may take a while to hear from them but I think it’s a good program.”
I picked her up and drove her to the Topeka Housing Authority office, where she picked up an application.
It took a couple of years for her name to come up on the list, but she was approved. It was just in time because her rent at her apartment was about to go sky high, and she couldn’t afford to pay. Without the Section 8 voucher, who knows what she would have done.
That is why when I read about proposed budget cuts to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development totaling $32.9 billion, along with the idea of creating a grant program to send rental assistance funds to the states, my heart grieved over the precious lives this would affect.
The people who work at the Topeka Housing Authority are very special people, including the vice president of rental assistance programs, Annette Brown. They work hard to make sure those with limited incomes, the disabled and seniors find safe, affordable housing.
We are in a time when homelessness is at an all-time high. If anything, we need more funding for housing programs, including those beyond Section 8. I attended a meeting for the public in which the former executive director of the Topeka Rescue Mission discussed homelessness and how so many individuals who grew up traumatized or experienced trauma as adults often end up homeless. Barry Feaker has a true heart for the homeless and has dedicated his life to the issue.
People such as Theresa Douthart and Sehera Hays at the Topeka nonprofit organization Breakthrough House give of themselves to help assist clients to find housing. Robert Sanders, chair of the board of directors for Breakthrough House, works at the Topeka Rescue Mission and he helps the individuals there find employment and work on job skills. His work is vital and much needed.
When I think of the Section 8 program, I think of my good friend who might have had nowhere to go if she had not received her voucher. These people are good folks who need shelter. It’s time to make sure they get to stay in their dwellings and to continue to provide the funding they need to live a productive life.
The time is now to help those in need of a place to live. I worked as a volunteer writer at the international headquarters of Habitat for Humanity in 1997 for a brief time, and I saw people from all over come together to help those who I believe are God’s children.
Let’s be the light of Heaven to folks who would otherwise be homeless. Let’s offer hope. It’s needed more now than ever before.

(Photo by Evan Houk/ Maine Morning Star)It is now well-documented — such as this news story by the Pulitzer Prize winning ProPublica about actually purchasing a newspaper in Knox County to use as a source of misinformation — that the exorbitantly wealthy fossil fuel industry in Ohio is seeking to halt solar farms because they are competition.
As Jake Zuckerman reported for Cleveland.com in March: “Ohioans and their elected representatives have killed enough solar development to roughly power the state’s three largest cities in the three years since state lawmakers passed one of the nation’s most stringent restrictions on new solar development.”
But this is now poised to take a quantum leap due to a case at the Ohio Supreme Court. At issue is whether the Ohio Power Siting Board will be allowed to grant what is essentially “veto power” over solar projects to a small handful of local officials.
If granted, it will provide an almost perfect vehicle for causing the demise of solar projects across Ohio.
Here is how this policy translates into solar rejections. When decisions are given to only a few individuals, there is no longer any need to persuade a majority of the public — the way a democracy works.
Instead the “blitz” can be focused on just these few, making abuse extraordinarily easy. Solar advocates are becoming placed in an essentially impossible bind. If local officials are already “locked up” by excessive lobbying from fossil fuel interests, there now appears virtually no chance of prevailing.
It is not an exaggeration to call this a de facto “rigging” of the process.
A notorious example of this process at work is the Grange Solar Grazing Project. A count revealed a full 80% of public comments were in favor. Yet when a handful of local officials expressed opposition, this 80% majority — and the democratic process itself — got over-ridden and the project was rejected by power siting board staff.
Rural Ohioans oppose solar farms, right? Not so, developer finds

The Grange project was located in the home district of Ohio Senate President Rob McColley, R-Napoleon — a primary co-sponsor of the openly anti-solar SB 52 legislation.
This writer is not privy to details, but it stands to reason this juxtaposition generated major pressure on local officials. The pattern repeated again on April 17: “In yet another case of the state’s hostility to utility-scale projects, state regulators have unanimously rejected a 150 MW project outside Canton because of organized opposition from local officials.”
Due to an appearance of favoritism, the solar advocacy group Third Act Ohio legitimately asked the OPSB to explain why such authority was being handed to local officials.
While completely ignoring the question, this group was referred to “criteria” in a statute to guide decisions, and directed to a link.
When examined, this statute contained no requirement that a project meet approval of local officials. Instead, the group found a separate statute specifically FORBIDDING such.
The very title is “No Local Jurisdiction.”
There is a strong appearance that this action is being “manufactured out of thin air.” If reinforced by the state Supreme Court, the stage seems set for a sweeping shutdown of utility scale solar in Ohio.
Why does this matter?
Ohio is not just one state among many. It is the fifth most prolific producer of carbon emissions. Failure in Ohio would combine with a nationwide failure promoted by Trump and the Republican Party to inflict drastic global consequences.
Science warns that crossing a climate “tipping point” will unleash a continuing spiral of increasing temperatures, with little public awareness about the immense scale of harm that would bring.
When our current 1.5 degree C increase spirals toward a 3 degree C increase, a band around the earth paralleling the equator would dry up from massive drought. 
This area — called a “dead zone” because of its unlivability — would spread north and south. Tens of millions affected by collapsed food supply would escalate into the hundreds of millions.
On a matter affecting survival of life as we know it, the OPSB must not be allowed to become the proverbial “fox guarding the chicken coop” and tilt the process toward the vested interests it was supposed to regulate!

At the same time, states are finding it harder to count on the hunting and fishing revenues that have long funded most of their work. Agencies say they have more challenges than ever before, and less money to take them on.
In many states, lawmakers are rethinking the long-standing model for wildlife management. They’re considering new funding sources to make the agencies less reliant on license fees. They’re asking wildlife managers to expand their work beyond traditional “game” species, adding protections for threatened insects and other animals. And some are scrutinizing the commissions that have long governed wildlife management.
Some of the proposals have seen broad support from outdoors lovers who want to strengthen their wildlife agencies. Others have drawn opposition from sporting groups, who fear the new focus will diminish hunting and fishing opportunities.
“We’re seeing quite a bit of action this year,” said Logan Christian, wildlife and habitat specialist with the National Caucus of Environmental Legislators, a forum for state lawmakers. “We definitely have noticed that states are working on strengthening their wildlife agencies.”
As Stateline previously reported, New Mexico enacted the most sweeping overhaul this year. It renamed the Department of Game & Fish as the Department of Wildlife, giving it a more explicit focus on non-game species. Budget writers provided $10.5 million in new funding over the next three years to help threatened species. And lawmakers created a new process for appointing the agency’s commissioners, with guidelines ensuring a diversity of expertise and experience.
Wildlife advocates in other states say the New Mexico overhaul was a game changer. But lawmakers elsewhere are taking a more piecemeal approach.
 Dollars

Numerous states are reconsidering their wildlife agencies’ funding model.
“There’s definitely a growing awareness that the current management system is outdated and really unfit for 21st century challenges,” said Michelle Lute, executive director of Wildlife for All, a nonprofit focused on overhauling state wildlife governance. “State wildlife agencies are seeing that they can’t rely on hunting and fishing license fees to be able to do this work.”

Earlier this year, lawmakers in Utah enacted a new tax on wind and solar projects that will help fund the state’s wildlife agency. The revenue could double the department’s funding to protect non-game species, from $5 million to $10 million.
“We have a funding model in place for game species,” said Paul Thompson, administrator of the Species Protection Account with the Utah Division of Wildlife Resources. “Funding to work on some of our native species programs has been really hard to come by.”
The new revenue could allow the agency to invest in more biologists, conservation easements, watershed restoration projects and native fish hatchery programs. State Rep. Casey Snider, the Republican who sponsored the bill, argued that the clean energy sector should pay because its development is harming Utah’s habitat.
“Wind and solar projects have an outsized impact on [non-game] species, and they have not been contributing financially,” he said.
But industry leaders said the law will threaten the state’s energy development.
“[The measure will] severely strain the economics of an existing project and send a negative message to developers and the financial institutions that provide capital for these projects,” said Theresa Foxley, chief of staff to rPlus Energies, a renewable developer, in testimony to lawmakers.
Lawmakers in Oregon are considering an increase to the state’s tax on hotel and short-term rental stays to help fund non-game wildlife work. The proposal would bring in about $30 million annually. State Rep. Ken Helm, the bill’s Democratic sponsor, said the state wildlife agency’s division to manage non-game species “has come and gone over the last 30 years as funding is available.”
Growing concerns about climate change and biodiversity have created urgency to find a stable funding source, he said. Helm said the lodging tax is a logical source, because the state’s tourism industry is centered on the outdoors. He noted that Oregon’s natural resources agencies receive only a tiny fraction of the state’s general revenue.
Travel and tourism groups oppose the bill, arguing it could drive visitors elsewhere. Helm has also proposed a bill that would bring in wildlife funding through an income tax increase.
He said his message to fellow lawmakers was: “I’ve given you two ways to get the money we need for this agency. Nobody’s been able to come up with a better idea. Just pick one.”
The bill was heard in committee earlier this month, but has not yet advanced.
As states rethink wildlife management, New Mexico offers a new model

Meanwhile, lawmakers in Hawaii approved a “green fee” — a lodging tax increase of 0.75% that Democratic Gov. Josh Green’s office estimates will bring in $100 million annually to help protect the state from climate change. While the fund is not explicitly focused on wildlife, it’s expected to contribute to efforts such as coral reef restoration and watershed protection that will benefit important habitats.
State Rep. Amy Perruso, a Democrat who was among the advocates for a green fee, said the COVID-19 pandemic was a wakeup call.
“With the absence of tourists, we saw a lot more fish in the ocean, everything about the environment was so much more healthy because we didn’t have 10 million extra people,” she said. “If we’re going to do something to protect the environment, [tourism] is a logical connection.”
Washington state was among the first to significantly invest in non-game conservation through state tax revenue, with legislation enacted two years ago. The budget passed by lawmakers this session continues that work, with $14 million set aside for biodiversity and species recovery each of the next two years.
Lawmakers in Kansas and North Carolina also proposed using more general fund revenue for wildlife work, although those measures have not advanced.
 Mission

In other states, lawmakers are focused on expanding their wildlife agencies’ mission to more non-game species. Last year, Colorado gave wildlife managers the authority to manage insects and other invertebrates, as well as rare plants.
“Invertebrates are wildlife, and their conservation benefits the entire ecosystem, including the species [state wildlife officials] traditionally managed,” said Richard Reading, vice chair of the Colorado Parks and Wildlife Commission. “They do everything from creating our soils to filtering our water to pollinating the food we eat.”
Reading also serves as vice president of science and conservation at the Butterfly Pavilion, an insect zoo. He noted that studies are showing that many invertebrate species are in rapid decline. In addition to expanding the agency’s authority, lawmakers provided funding for six staff members to take on the additional work.
A similar bill in Nevada, focused on invertebrates, advanced through the Assembly’s natural resources committee.
“There’s definitely concerns about declines in pollinator species,” said Assemblymember Howard Watts, a Democrat who sponsored the bill. “Our wildlife agency can and should take proactive action to do research, surveys and habitat improvement to keep these species off the [endangered species list].”
Watts said the bill would allow wildlife managers to consider insects in state plans to protect imperiled species. He said the Nevada Department of Wildlife has requested an entomologist position if it’s asked to take on the additional species. Beyond that, he said, the measure would not require additional money, as it’s focused on voluntary, proactive work, rather than additional regulations.
State wildlife agencies focus on ‘hook and bullet’ work. Some see a new path.

Another bill in Pennsylvania would expand wildlife managers’ authority to include insects. That measure has been approved by the House Environmental and Natural Resources Protection Committee.
Sporting groups have largely been supportive of efforts to provide new funding sources to manage non-game species. But some are skeptical of plans to expand agencies’ mission without an increase in revenue.
“Most hunters and anglers understand that healthy game populations are dependent on ecosystem integrity,” said Devin O’Dea, Western policy and conservation manager with Backcountry Hunters & Anglers, a nonprofit focused on public lands. “But when you take a model that’s been developed with the intent of enforcing regulations for fish and game species, expand that scope without funding and additional capacity, it’s a recipe for something to fall off the plate.”
 Governance

Meanwhile, some legislators want to rethink the commission model that oversees wildlife governance. Critics say that governors often select commissioners who are hunting guides, farmers and political donors. Once appointed, they enact wildlife policies to suit their economic interests.
Florida state Rep. Anna V. Eskamani, a Democrat, drafted a bill that would overhaul the state’s Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission. Her proposal would increase the board from seven to nine members. It would designate seats for scientists, conservationists, local officials, farmers, hunters and anglers.
“The commission has made decisions not based on science or conservation, but based on developers or landowners that engage in agricultural practices,” she said. “We tried to strike a balance to ensure there are voices with an environmental background, with a conservation and wildlife background, with an academic background.”
The bill did not advance, but Eskamani said grassroots support is building for systemic changes in wildlife management.
Some sporting groups are more wary of commission overhaul proposals.
“We have seen examples where proposed changes to commissions were politically motivated or motivated by anti-hunting and anti-angling interests,” said Kent Keene senior manager for Western states and agriculture policy with the Congressional Sportsmen’s Foundation, a group that promotes hunting and fishing priorities on Capitol Hill. “When those changes are focused on science-based needs, then the sportsmen’s community has a long history of supporting those steps to ensure we are protecting our heritage.”
Some hunting and fishing groups have emphasized that the expanded mission should come with additional funding, so agencies aren’t stretched thin. Keene noted that hunters and anglers pay an excise tax on the purchase of gear, which provides an important funding source for wildlife agencies. Some have proposed a similar “backpack tax” on gear for hikers, birdwatchers and others.
Another proposal in New Hampshire would give the wildlife agency’s executive director the authority to make policy decisions, relegating the Fish and Game Commission to an advisory body. That bill did not advance.

(Getty Images)Nebraska’s veterans have served our country with honor and sacrifice, and they’ve earned every available tool to help them access the benefits they were promised upon returning home.
Unfortunately, a bill currently before the Nebraska Legislature, Legislative Bill 693, risks taking away important choices from veterans and making it harder for them to get the help they need. In fact, a federal court has already ruled a similar bill an unconstitutional denial of veterans’ free speech.
The system in the state is already struggling to keep up. Nebraska has more than 106,000 veterans, but the resources dedicated to helping them are limited. Many veterans report long wait times and difficulty getting appointments, along with inconsistent follow-up from overworked and understaffed Veterans Service Organizations (VSOs). Even those who manage to connect with a VSO often find the quality of assistance varies widely, with some officers lacking the training or resources to provide effective help.
For rural veterans, these challenges tend to be exacerbated, as many areas in Nebraska remain underserved, and the nearest VSO office is hours away. Special claims clinics, organized to help with backlogged cases, show just how much demand there is. In North Platte, 272 veterans showed up in just two days, and 214 new claims were started. That’s hundreds of people who hadn’t been able to get help until a pop-up clinic came to town.
Private companies and consultants, which are often veteran-owned businesses, have stepped in to fill this gap. They bring expertise while working on a contingency basis to help veterans with complicated cases or appeals. Many veterans have found success working with these professionals when other avenues fail.
Unfortunately, as with any industry, bad actors have also emerged that use predatory practices to take advantage of our veterans. LB 693 claims to solve this problem, but the real effect would be to cut off legitimate, valuable sources of help by prohibiting veterans from hiring a consultant for assistance with claims preparation.
Taking away the option to seek compensated help removes a vital lifeline for those who need specialized support, while stifling innovation in finding better ways to serve veterans who aren’t getting what they need from the current system.
Veterans in Congress and several other states have adopted or are considering pro-veteran policies that address predatory practices while allowing veteran-owned businesses to continue providing much-needed services. These policies ensure veterans are aware of free services available to them and also protect veterans from fraud, mishandling of data and excessive fees.
The right way to protect veterans is not to ban all paid assistance. If Nebraska truly wants to support its veterans, it should trust them to decide what kind of help is right for them. Blanket bans like LB 693 only limit choices and make it harder for veterans to get help. It would turn back the clock on veterans’ rights and limit the support they deserve.

,California,2025-05-20 07:01:00+00:00,CalMatters,Newsom’s budget cuts anger allies and leave the state’s chronic deficit unresolved,Dan Walters,,,,,https://calmatters.org/commentary/2025/05/newsom-budget-chronic-deficit-unresolved/,Major interest groups allied with the Democratic Party have been critical of Gov. Gavin Newsom's revised budget proposal since it was unveiled last week.,"When Gov. Gavin Newsom unveiled a revised state budget last week, he irritated — and perhaps alienated — major interest groups allied with his Democratic Party.
They flooded reporters’ email inboxes with critical reaction statements demanding that spending reductions he said were necessary to cover a substantial deficit and other aspects of the budget be blocked.
The loudest reactions came from advocates for the poor and elderly. They decried Newsom’s plan to scale back an expansion of Medi-Cal health care to undocumented immigrants that he had championed last year, as well as his imposition of $100 monthly premiums, elimination of some benefits, limits on at-home care and tighter qualifications for benefits.
“The 2025–26 budget proposal fails to marshal the resources needed to help vulnerable Californians meet basic needs like health care, housing, and food assistance,” the left-leaning California Budget and Policy Center said. “It also falls short in delivering the bold response needed from California’s leaders amid unprecedented federal threats and economic uncertainty.”
However, there were also adverse reactions from public employee unions over Newsom’s intention to hold down state worker raises and from city and county officials over a lack of grants for homelessness. Newsom’s intends to crack down on local governments he deems to be negligent.
Medical care providers dislike both Newsom’s Medi-Cal restrictions and his diversion of funds from a special tax on health care approved by voters last year meant to increase payments for treatment.
Environmentalists are angered by Newsom’s declared intention to fast-track a tunnel beneath the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta to increase water deliveries to Southern California.
Advocates of Proposition 36, a voter-approved measure to crack down on some crimes that Newsom opposed, decry his failure to include funds for implementation.
The wave of criticism and opposition puts the Legislature on the spot. Those who dislike the budget are demanding that legislators compel Newsom to scale back his proposals as they negotiate a semi-final version of the spending plan over the next four weeks to meet a June 15 deadline. Many legislators owe their careers to the budget critics, particularly unions and environmentalists, and don’t want to alienate them.
Newsom, on the other hand, is approaching lame duck status, with his gubernatorial career having just 19 months remaining. Politically, Newsom can afford to irritate those groups. However, his relatively brief remaining tenure also means he is beginning to lose his sway over legislators, particularly those who will still be in office after Newsom is gone.
Newsom is obviously hoping that by making budget cuts now to narrow the state’s chronic gap between income and outgo, he can avoid joining the list of ex-governors who left the state’s finances in disarray for their successors. Newsom inherited a state budget from predecessor Jerry Brown that was in pretty good condition, but over the last six-plus years, which included a pandemic, spending growth has outpaced revenue increases.
The Legislature’s budget analyst recently cited an average 9% annual increase in outlays since Newsom became governor, but just 6% in average revenue growth.
That has left the state with what budget mavens call a substantial “structural deficit” that the analyst, Gabe Petek, and Newsom’s own budget staff estimate to be “15 billion to $20 billion annually. If it went unaddressed, it would total $42 billion through 2028-29.
Even with the reductions Newsom proposes, projected 2025-26 general fund revenues of $207 billion are still $19 billion short of the $226 billion in spending he proposes. The gap will be covered by loans and transfers from special funds, shifting spending to other pots of money and various bookkeeping gimmicks.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/051425_Newsom-May-Budget_FG_CM_02.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-05-20 04:00:40.457360

Media were not permitted to witness death row inmate Benjamin Ritchie's execution and were instead restricted to the state prison parking lot. (Casey Smith/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Death row inmate Benjamin Ritchie was executed by lethal injection shortly after midnight Tuesday at the Indiana State Prison in Michigan City, according to Department of Correction officials.
The death sentence was carried out nearly 25 years after Ritchie shot and killed Beech Grove law enforcement officer William Toney. The condemned man had been on death row since his conviction in 2002.
Details about the 45-year-old’s execution were sparse. No independent media representatives were permitted to witness the process. 
A statement posted on the DOC website at 1:04 a.m. Central Time indicated that “the execution process” started shortly after 12:00 a.m., and that Ritchie was pronounced dead at 12:46 a.m. It’s not clear when exactly the execution drug, pentobarbital, was administered.
Ritchie’s last meal was the Tour of Italy from Olive Garden. His last words were: “I love my family, my friends, and all the support I’ve gotten. I hope they all find peace.”
DOC officials did not hold a press briefing or provide additional information.
In a late Monday order, the U.S. Supreme Court denied Ritchie’s request for an emergency stay.
Republican Gov. Mike Braun, following a unanimous recommendation from Indiana’s Parole Board, rejected the inmate’s clemency plea last week.
“Since Benjamin Ritchie’s conviction in 2002, his case has been heard and reviewed numerous times by both state and federal courts, including the Indiana Supreme Court and the U.S. Supreme Court, never resulting in an overturned sentence,” Braun said in an early Tuesday statement. “Ritchie’s final appeal for clemency was met with an unanimous recommendation from the State Parole Board that his execution proceeded as scheduled. Today, Ritchie’s sentence has been carried out as ordered by the court.”
No independent witnesses
The Indiana Capital Chronicle made numerous requests to be placed on Ritchie’s personal witness list but was denied.
A federal judge on Friday rejected a request by the Capital Chronicle and four other news outlets to pause a state law and DOC policy barring independent media witnesses.
News reporters are granted access to a designated area outside of the Indiana State Prison but are not permitted to directly witness the state’s actions — unless invited by the condemned to fill one of the five spots.
The Capital Chronicle confirmed Ritchie had four witnesses present at the execution, which included two of his attorneys. The fifth witness spot was left unfilled.
The inmate was also allowed to have a pastor present in the execution chamber.
It’s not clear who — or how many — witnessed the execution on Toney’s behalf. State law permits up to eight witnesses for the victim.

Outside the state prison Monday night, two dozen peaceful protesters — including multiple clergy members — gathered to pray and called on state officials to stop the execution.
In the hours preceding Ritchie’s execution, Rev. Richard Holy, of the Catholic Diocese of Gary, led the small group through scripture readings and songs.
Intercessions called for Ritchie and other death row inmates to know “(God’s) unending love and forgiveness.” Holy prayed, too, for Ritchie’s defense team; DOC personnel tasked with conducting executions; and “for all those impacted by acts of grave harm, especially the family, friends and colleagues” of Toney.
“May they and all victims of crime know your healing power and be transformed by your mercy,” Holy said.
Death Penalty Action, a nonprofit that advocates against executions, loaned to protestors the “Delaware Bell,” which the group has rung outside more than a dozen other executions.
The bell continued to echo outside the prison shortly after midnight, as Ritchie’s execution began.

(Casey Smith/Indiana Capital Chronicle)
Ritchie previously exhausted all of his post-conviction appeals but sat on death row for more than two decades.
Capital punishments were put on hold for 15 years in Indiana until state officials announced last year that they’d acquired pentobarbital to resume executions.
Ritchie was Indiana’s second execution in six months.
Convicted killer Joseph Corcoran was put to death in December. Capital Chronicle reporting revealed the state paid $900,000 for execution drugs, but officials won’t say how much was purchased. Senior Reporter Casey Smith attended that execution as part of Corcoran’s five witnesses.
Final pleas rejected
The underlying crime began as a police pursuit of a stolen van on Sept. 29, 2000. Toney, the Beech Grove police officer, later pursued Ritchie on foot. Ritchie ultimately fired four shots at Toney, who was hit just above his bullet-proof vest. The officer did not survive the shooting. 
Toney died just hours before his 32nd birthday. He was survived by his wife, Dee Dee, and two young daughters.
“Officer William Toney lost his life 25 years ago serving the community he lived in. Taking a solemn oath to uphold the constitution and the laws of this great state, that its citizens may lead a peaceful life,” the Beech Grove Police Department said in a Monday afternoon statement, ahead of Ritchie’s execution.
“His life was violently taken from him by an individual whose actions adversely affected the innocent and ripped at the very fabric that holds society together,” the statement continued. “While there is no peace in the execution, there is comfort in the realization that society has kept its promise to the men and women of law enforcement to hold those accountable for their reckless choices and damaging actions, so that those still serving find strength knowing that their service is not in vain.”
Indiana set to execute man who killed officer; family ‘needs closure,’ but lawyers say it’s unjust

Republican Indiana Attorney General Todd Rokita requested an execution date for Ritchie last fall. It wasn’t until April 15 that the state supreme court scheduled the lethal injection to take place before sunrise Tuesday.
“Early this morning, justice was served with the execution of Benjamin Ritchie, who was convicted of the heinous murder of Beech Grove Police Officer William Toney on September 29, 2000,” Rokita said in a statement.
“Today’s action ensures that justice was done to honor Officer Toney’s sacrifice for his community. With the Indiana Supreme Court’s decision to set his execution date and the state’s resolve to carry it out, we have reaffirmed our commitment to upholding the rule of law and protecting our communities. Let this serve as a message to those who would harm our men and women in law enforcement.”
Ritchie’s attorneys argued that brain damage from Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD), which was only recently diagnosed, had never been fully considered in court.
Defense counsel wanted to explore the FASD diagnosis before the Indiana Supreme Court, but the justices denied requests for a new hearing. 
The inmate’s lawyers separately sought a last-minute execution pause from the U.S. Supreme Court and the federal court for Indiana’s northern district.
Those requests were also denied.
Ritchie expressed remorse for the killing during a clemency hearing held earlier this month at the state prison.
“I was just a kid … I didn’t care about myself, I didn’t care about anybody — nothing,” he told the parole board. “I’ve ruined my life and other people’s lives, and I’m so sorry for that night.”
Six other men remain on Indiana’s death row. Three death penalty cases are additionally pending in central Indiana, including two involving police officer deaths.

Mike Dunleavy’s veto of the latest education funding bill, House Bill 57, following his recent veto of House Bill 69, cements the decline of Alaska’s public education system as the hallmark of his administration. 
Dunleavy has been notably absent from debates and legislative negotiations on education. Even Sen. James Kaufman criticized his failure to advocate for his own education policy priorities. All we’re left with is his record to sort though — and it speaks volumes.
The Dunleavy Decline
For more than a decade, Dunleavy has worked to undermine the foundation of our schools. Brick by brick, budget by budget, he has led a systematic campaign to weaken public education in our state. 
Two key inflection points brought us here: 

2014: The Legislature passed legislation by then-Sen. Dunleavy allowing correspondence school funds to be used for private school tuition. This opened the door to a steady redirection of public money toward private benefit, and the shunting of millions of dollars from our public schools.
2018-2025: As governor, Dunleavy froze the base student allocation and has kept it virtually flat through threats and vetoes, effectively starving education budgets year after year as costs rose. This has placed schools under incredible financial strain, compounded by the diversion of public dollars away from public schools.

The results of these policy choices are staggering:
A. Spending on correspondence programs surged.
From 2014 to 2024, over $580 million in public funds were diverted from neighborhood schools through correspondence allotments. The graph below shows Alaska’s annual correspondence program spending over the past two decades, charting both our estimate of the average as well as maximum per-student allotments. A sharp increase in this spending began in 2018, the same year Gov. Dunleavy started flat-funding public education.
While many families choose correspondence programs to homeschool their children — a valuable option for some — the lack of oversight has allowed public funds to serve as de facto vouchers for private and religious schools. Though this practice is now under legal challenge, the data shown here reflects the decade it was permitted. Further, it is unclear what results we are getting for this investment, because only about 12% of correspondence students take standardized tests.
In the graph, the blue line estimates annual state spending on correspondence allotments assuming each enrolled student received the estimated average allotment. The orange line assumes the maximum allotment per student. Together, they illustrate the range of public dollars funneled into the correspondence program with little accountability for their use.

B. Student achievement has declined.
Since the 2014 policy change expanding allowable uses of correspondence allotments, fourth and eighth grade reading and math scores in Alaska’s public schools have dropped, with sharper declines after Dunleavy began flat-funding public education. 
While many factors influence academic outcomes, this pattern raises serious concerns about the long-term impact of diverting public resources away from neighborhood schools, coupled with the erosion of buying power due to years of flat-funding education.

A governor who shifts blame, not budgets
While Dunleavy proclaims himself an education advocate, his record is one of destruction. He has bled our schools dry, then blamed the consequences — teacher shortages, ballooning class sizes, gutted programs, declining scores — on the very system he eroded. 
Real accountability means more than empty rhetoric — it means fulfilling your constitutional obligation to “establish and maintain a system of public schools open to all children of the state.” It means making good on your own policy promises — like funding the Alaska Reads Act — and giving educators the tools they need to do their jobs effectively. It means compensating teachers with the wages and benefits they need to support themselves and their families. Flat funding isn’t accountability. It’s abandonment. 
A crisis of commitment
After weeks of contentious debate, the Legislature passed the first education funding bill, HB 69, with 32 of 60 legislators voting in favor. Gov. Dunleavy swiftly vetoed it. After a failed override attempt, legislators then advanced HB 57, a revised education funding bill that incorporated many of the governor’s own stated priorities. It passed with 48 votes. 
Despite its bipartisan backing and clear compromises, the governor has vetoed yet another bill and threatened an additional line-item veto in the budget, relying on the same attacks he used to justify his previous education funding vetoes both this year and last.
To override the governor’s veto of HB 57, it would take 40 legislators to stand with Alaska’s students, educators, and communities. Blocking a line-item veto in the budget will take 45. 
The tipping point
Alaska is in crisis: underfunded schools, frozen federal support, rising costs, layoffs, and an economy driving families and young professionals out. Without sensible leadership, the exodus will only accelerate.
We cannot solve this with half-measures or hollow sound bites. 
HB 57 adds just $700 in per-student funding to the education budget, still far behind the inflation increases districts face. In our view, we can’t afford not to make this investment. 
The legacy of the Dunleavy Decline
To the lawmakers weighing whether to stand with the governor or with Alaska’s families — this is your moment of truth. 
You’ve seen the data. You’ve heard from your constituents. If you continue to support the Dunleavy Decline, it will be your legacy too.

Photo by Andrew VonBank/House Public Information Services.A narrowly divided Legislature adjourned Monday without completing a state budget for the next two years, ending the session just as it began: with rancorous finger pointing.
The session started with the Minnesota Supreme Court settling a dispute between Republicans and Democrats over control of the House, and now lawmakers are leaving with the biggest budget bills still outstanding, including health and human services, education and taxes.
The Legislature only passed nine budget bills out of some 20 in process, and now they will need a special session to do the rest.
Lawmakers are working to pass a $66 billion to $67 billion two-year budget that will fund everything from schools to parks to health care and services for people with disabilities. The state is grappling with a structural deficit that’s arisen from the rapidly increasing costs of special education and caring for an aging population. Given the Republican refusal to agree to any new tax revenue, lawmakers are looking to trim spending.
Most consequentially, Gov. Tim Walz and DFL leaders agreed — at Republicans’ behest — to remove undocumented adults from MinnesotaCare, the state’s subsidized health insurance for the working poor. Children will still be enrolled. The bill hasn’t passed yet, and DFL Caucus leader Melissa Hortman, DFL-Brookyln Park, told reporters Monday night that Democrats would fight it until the end.
“Until the last gavel drops on the last minute of passing a budget for the state of Minnesota, Democrats are going to keep fighting to try to get Republicans to relent on that demand,” Hortman said.
In between now and the special legislative session — date yet to be announced, though ideally before Memorial Day, they say — lawmakers will hammer out the bills in “working groups.” Because the lawmakers won’t be in session, these will be unofficial meetings that include House and Senate members of both parties. Legislative leaders have given the working groups until 5 p.m. on Wednesday to finalize their budget bills, after which Walz will likely call a special session, which leaders and Walz say should last just a single day.
Lawmakers will be back at the Capitol Tuesday morning to start the working groups.
“We have to finish this. We don’t have a choice,” House Speaker Lisa Demuth, R-Cold Spring said. “That is what Minnesotans expect us to do. We will be able to get that work done in a bipartisan fashion.”
Despite the Wednesday deadline, Hortman said the earliest a special session could occur is Friday, though next week is probable. If lawmakers can’t reach a deal by Friday, they will have to work over Memorial Day weekend, Hortman said.
Only Walz can call legislators back into session, but only lawmakers can adjourn once they are in special session.
In the hours leading up to midnight, rank-and-file lawmakers had little work to do because legislative leaders were meeting behind closed doors and making last-minute decisions on what bills they could pass in the few remaining hours.
Multiple members walked laps on the Capitol’s second floor, while Senate Minority Leader Mark Johnson played catch on the Capitol lawn. Rep. Joe McDonald, R-Delano, was spotted using an electric scooter to “have a little fun,” traveling from the bowels of the Capitol to the House members’ offices in the Centennial Office Building.
In a series of press conferences, lawmakers laid the blame on each other for failing to finish their work. House Democrats argued that Republicans were attempting to change the parameters of an agreement Walz and legislative leaders announced last week.
“Republicans keep moving the goal posts. None of the GOP demands are necessary to pass a state budget bill. All of them will make life harder and more expensive for Minnesota families,” said House DFL floor leader Jamie Long.
House Speaker Lisa Demuth, R-Cold Spring, said Democrats’ 23-day boycott at the outset of the session derailed lawmakers from finishing on time.
“Waiting 23 days of a stall out was not helpful,” Demuth said.
Walz on Monday afternoon told reporters he’s confident the larger budget bills will get done and said Minnesotans shouldn’t be concerned about the lack of progress.
“Against the backdrop of the dysfunction in D.C., this is a pretty remarkable thing to see — the most closely divided Legislature in Minnesota history working together in a fiscally responsible way,” Walz said.
Walz noted that June 1 acts as a perfunctory deadline: The state will be obligated to send lay off notices to state employees if there is no budget by then, and leaders want to avoid that.
The session kicked off in January with House Democrats refusing to appear at the Capitol,  seeking to to prevent Republicans from using a 1-seat, temporary advantage to take control of the House and potentially block a Democrat from being seated in a hotly contested election. The Minnesota Supreme Court was forced to intervene before the two sides agreed on a power-sharing agreement.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/GrWIrDDXsAANJ5v-1024x731.jpeg,,,2025-05-20 01:59:03.146891

Garmatz United States Courthouse in Baltimore. (Photo by Christine Condon/ Maryland Matters)The contentious debate over a 67-mile power transmission line proposed for Central Maryland reached a Baltimore courtroom on Monday, with three hours of arguments on eminent domain.
PSEG, the New Jersey-based power company building the line, sued more than 100 landowners along the proposed route of the Maryland Piedmont Reliability Project, who it said were refusing access to company representatives for environmental surveys.
The company asked U.S. District Adam Abelson to issue an order allowing it to conduct the surveys — including boundary studies, wetland delineations and forest evaluations — where property owners had refused.
It has said that it needs the surveys for its proceeding before the Maryland Public Service Commission, which will determine whether the construction of the line — planned to run through parts of Baltimore, Carroll and Frederick counties — can go forward.
But the property owners, represented by five different attorneys Monday, argue that the company can’t exercise eminent domain rights until it has earned its certificate from the PSC, and that entering properties for surveys constitutes a “taking” under eminent domain law.
Kurt Fischer, an attorney representing PSEG, said that “narrow” interpretation of the law would set the power line up for failure from the start.
“It simply is untenable to try to say that all these conditions have to be satisfied before you can take surveys,” Fischer said.
People power vs. electric power in feud over proposed transmission project

Fischer said the company has authority for the land surveys because it has secured a “designated entity agreement” with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, making it an entity that could conceivably earn the power of eminent domain from the Maryland PSC. Therefore, state law entitles it to complete the survey work.
But the landowners’ attorneys pointed to a provision in state law granting survey access to corporations “having the power of eminent domain.”
“‘Having the power’ means you have it right now,” said David Wyand, an attorney representing dozens of landowners.
He argued that in order to gain access to the properties to survey ahead of the PSC’s decision, the company would need to go to the Maryland General Assembly for a law change.
“They don’t want to go to the legislature for a fix,” Wyand said. “This should be a political solution — not a court solution.”
There could be more lawsuits to come. Fischer said that the 117 landowners named in the suit were “prioritized” because their properties likely host “flora and fauna” that can only be studied at particular times. But other landowners have refused access, and they could also face similar legal action, he said.
At times, Monday’s arguments also reached beyond eminent domain and into the state’s complex energy picture.
Attorneys for the landowners argued that there is wiggle room in a directive from the regional transmission grid, calling for the power line to be in service by June 2027, in part because the grid has reached agreement to keep two Maryland coal-fired power plants running through May 2029, meaning power needs will be met until then.
“The predictions about disaster are not reality,” said Harris Eisenstein, who represents the same set of landowners as Wyand.
Because the deadline can be adjusted, the power company failed to show that it would suffer irreparable harm if it didn’t get the order from the judge. If the project has to be scrapped for reasons outside PSEG’s control, the company can also recoup its costs by appealing to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, Eisenstein argued.
“They have an economic safety net,” Eisenstein said.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
But PSEG attorneys said reimbursement isn’t a guarantee. FERC can determine that costs weren’t “prudent,” and nix repayment. The agency also only reimburses 50% of any costs incurred by developers before it approves a start theto  project, said PSEG attorney Kenneth Thompson.
“There’s a guaranteed loss here,” Thompson said.
The order proposed by PSEG didn’t set many limitations on its access to properties, allowing any access up until the Public Service Commission issues its ruling, so long as the company gives 24 hours notice.
At least one respondent took issue with that proposal Monday. Attorney Jennifer Wazenski was representing the owners of River Valley Ranch, a youth camp and retreat center that hosts “the most vulnerable children” for activities including horseback riding, she said. The owners would take issue with characterizing “any entry by strangers as non-invasive,” Wazenski said.
But PSEG attorney Emily Wilson said the order is “a proposed order for a reason” and told Abelson that the company would be amenable to the court requiring a conference between attorneys to find acceptable times for surveys.
“It is not the company’s intention to have unfettered access to these properties,” Wilson said.
Wilson that the assessments mostly involve surveyors walking around the properties with tablets in hand, taking note of particular features. For the wetlands surveys, surveyors would take soil samples about 4 inches into the ground, before returning the sampled material “immediately.”
As demand for AI rises, so do power-thirsty data centers

The surveys will take “in the space of hours,” Wilson said, rather than “days and days.”
If there were damage associated with the surveys, the landowners could seek relief in court, but Thompson said PSEG would endeavor to remedy the problem so that landowners wouldn’t have to take that step.
“They want a good relationship with these folks. They don’t want to be in a World War III fight,” Thompson said.
Attorneys for the landowners have asked Abelson to dismiss the case altogether. Barring that, he ought to allow three to four months of discovery, followed by an evidentiary hearing in the fall, Eisenstein said.
“That’s what this case deserves,” Eisenstein said. “It’s an important case.”
Discovery would let the landowner’s attorneys take depositions from key personnel at PSEG, they said, to answer “unanswered questions” about the line’s route, and whether PSEG would face an “irreparable harm” if it did not get the surveys completed.
Otherwise, Abelson would be granting a preliminary injunction that would essentially decide the entire case right at the beginning, Eisenstein said.
“The toothpaste is out of the tube,” Eisenstein said. “That’s the end of the case.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_7527-1024x860.jpg,,,2025-05-20 00:59:32.580308

(Photo by William J. Ford/Maryland Matters)The University System of Maryland Board of Regents unanimously approved a resolution Monday that would let presidents in the system assess potential cost savings such as furloughs, reductions in salary and closing of schools for certain number of days.
But the resolution, approved by the board in less than 10 minutes during a virtual session, states any actions must be reviewed with the university system chancellor and “in consultation with appropriate employee organizations.”
The board also approved an amendment that would allow the Office of the Attorney General to review any proposal that seeks to reduce employment benefits to ensure that it complies with the Fair Labor Standards Act. This amendment was offered by board member William T. “Bill” Wood, who serves as the treasurer.
The resolution comes as the university system’s 12 institutions and three regional centers face a reduction of $155 million, or 7% of their budgets, in fiscal 2026.
The reductions came as the General Assembly attempted to close a projected $3 billion deficit on its way to approving a $67 billion spending plan last month for fiscal 2026.
It’s unclear exactly how many employees could lose jobs or how many vacant positions would go unfilled, especially as President Donald Trump (R) continues to threaten cuts in federal spending that would affect states.
Several Maryland institutions such as the University of Maryland Eastern Shore, one of the state’s four historically Black colleges and universities, have started announcing financial measures. Some of those include eliminating positions that have been vacant for at least three years, instituting “a hiring pause with some rare exceptions” and initiating telework Fridays for some employees between May 23 to Aug. 8.

“We are enacting these measures to minimize the impact on our faculty, staff, and their families,” UMES President Heidi M. Anderson said in a statement Tuesday. “This will be a difficult period for everyone, but these efforts will make our university, our region and our state all the stronger moving forward.”
A university spokesperson wrote in an email Monday that the school has 632 full-time employees earning $50,000 and more. The school’s student enrollment for the spring was 2,841.
Morgan State University in Baltimore, the state’s biggest Black institution, with nearly 11,000 students and 2,926 employees, anticipates a $12 million decrease in appropriations.
In a statement, the university said it plans to institute a hiring freeze on nonessential roles, eliminating 35 vacant positions and “the restructuring and/or elimination of select staff positions (up to 15 in total).”
Morgan State, which isn’t affiliated with the state’s university system, highlighted the fact that no tenured or tenure-track faculty positions will be affected by its proposals.
“We are deeply mindful of the potential job loss this process may entail for some members of our dedicated staff,” according to the statement from Morgan State. “The University did not arrive at these decisions lightly. Every step taken was grounded in sound fiscal management and compassionate leadership, with the goal of protecting the long-term health and sustainability of the institution.”
Another historically Black institution, Bowie State University in Prince George’s County, with more than 6,000 students, does not plan any staff reductions or furloughs. However, a spokesperson with Bowie State also said Monday that the school does not plan to fill 50 vacant positions.
A spokesperson with Salisbury University said the university also doesn’t anticipate layoffs or furloughs at the university with 7,025 students and slightly more than 1,100 full-time employees.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
“Our goal is to protect and prioritize our students and our employees as much as possible,” spokesperson Jason Rhodes said in an email Monday. “SU will continue to follow that principle as long as challenging budget times continue.”
Stuart Katzenberg, with the American Federation of State, County and Muncipal Employees Maryland Council 3, said Monday his organization has not discussed or received any proposals on salary reductions or furloughs from any representatives of the university system.
“If they were to pursue those with AFSCME, they’d have to come and negotiate with us as well as apparently get approval by the chancellor. They have not done that with us yet,” said Katzenberg, director of growth and collective bargaining for the union.
AFSCME represents more than 6,000 employees in the university system, including custodians, mechanics, administrative assistants and those in information technology. The university system and AFSCME signed a contract in August that increased the minimum salary of $38,000 and boosted annual leave and other benefits.
“Our members make the campuses run. Without them, the campuses wouldn’t be clean. There wouldn’t be air conditioning in the summer,” Katzenberg said. “So without our members, the campuses couldn’t run.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Bowie-State-University-11-22-2023-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-20 00:59:32.580308

(Photo by Staff Sgt. Jared Duhon/U.S. Air Force)A Maryland board tasked with bringing down prescription drug costs is working through a “dossier” of a  medication to treat type 2 diabetes — the first of many such reports to determine if there are ways for the state to save money on certain medications.
The Prescription Drug Affordability Board unveiled a 92-page draft report Monday for Farxiga, a brand-name medication for dapagliflozin, to help board members determine if the drug is “unaffordable” for Marylanders.
It is the first of several dossiers analyzing the cost burdens of six popular prescription drugs in an effort to find avenues for the state to save on medications for those on the state’s health plan.
PDAB staff have been working on the Farxiga dossier since November, according to Andrew York, executive director for the board. He hopes that future dossiers will be easier to pull together now that staff have a format to work with.


Targeted drugs
Six drugs were selected for “cost review,” and address several conditions including Type 2 diabetes, heart disease, kidney disease, eczema, Crohn’s disease and more.

“I think staff now knows the time it takes to put these dossiers together,” York told the board during the virtual Monday meeting. “That organizational process and cross referencing to make sure that everything is available to the board — that took a lot of time and effort. But now that that template’s in place, I think we’ll be moving forward pretty quickly.”
Since the board’s inception in 2019, it has been involved in a lengthy rule-making process to determine what drugs could be expensive for state employees and to establish methods to bring those costs down.
In March 2024, PDAB board members officially selected six drugs to undergo the “cost review” process, part of which includes an information gathering period to develop a dossier on the drugs. But the board has yet to bring down costs for any drugs on the state health plan.
Meanwhile, Gov. Wes Moore (D) is expected to sign off on legislation Tuesday to expand the authority of the board to bring down costs for more Marylanders, not just those on the state plan.
Critics in the legislature and the pharmaceutical industry cited the pace of the board’s progress to argue unsuccessfully against expanding PDAB’s authority, but House and Senate bills to do just that passed by comfortable margins this year.
House Bill 424 and Senate Bill 357 would allow the board to establish what are called upper payment limits on the commercial market, to place a limit on how much the state is willing to pay for certain drugs. The board currently has that authority for state employees and others on the state health plan.
The expanded authority would only go into effect a year after the board has successfully placed upper payment limits for two drugs on state health plans – meaning it will still be some time before the state can wield its new authority on the commercial market.
But the dossier Monday sheds some light on different considerations that the board will use to determine if it will take action to reduce state spending on Farxiga — including overall state spending on the drug, prevalence of the diseases that the prescription drug treats, and costs of the disease to the health care system.
In Maryland, about 10.5% of adults aged 18 years or older had been diagnosed with diabetes as of 2022 data, the report says.

“In Maryland, for calendar year 2021, total and per-patient medical costs attributable to diabetes were $6.506 billion and $11,909, respectively,” the report says, citing data from the American Diabetes Association.
The dossier reports similar data for other conditions Farxiga is often prescribed to treat, such as heart failure and Chronic Kidney Disease.
From 2022 through 2023, Maryland spent $1.4 million on the most common dosage of Farxiga (10 MG) for those on the state health plan – about 289 Marylanders, according to the dossier.
The dossier reports that out-of-pocket costs for Farxiga can vary, depending on insurance coverage.
The median cost for 10 milligrams of Farxiga cost $160 for those with commercial insurance in 2023, but those on the state health plan paid $60 for the same dose. Meanwhile, those on Medicare paid a median of $158.90, according to 2022 data.
But portions of the report are redacted from the public due to confidentiality restrictions, and the dossier is not finalized yet. Following Monday’s meeting, PDAB staff will make tweaks on the dossier to more clearly relay the information. The Farxiga dossier will then go up for a 15-day public comment period.
Staff is working on a dossier for another drug that helps treat type 2 diabetes called Jardiance, which should also be available for public comment soon, according to York.
The board still has to officially determine if Farxiga or Jardiance pose an “affordability challenge” before board members can consider next steps to bring down costs, which could include setting upper payment limits.

Protect Connecticut is a coalition dedicated to passing critical legislation this session that will proactively safeguard our residents from the relentless harm of a hostile federal administration.
As a coalition, Protect Connecticut represents the majority of people in Connecticut, including immigrants, families struggling financially, LGBTQ+ communities, survivors of violence, and individuals seeking healthcare —particularly those directly threatened by federal policies. Together, we are urgently calling for meaningful and decisive action in three key areas:
First, protecting immigrants by securing personal information and ensuring Connecticut government does not cooperate with or aid ICE in their war on immigrant communities. 
Second, ensuring robust access to healthcare, including reproductive and LGBTQ+ care. 
Third, investing deeply in our social safety net policies and services that promote opportunity and economic security for all by guarding against challenges like housing insecurity and food insecurity.
It’s important to note that the three policy priority areas within our collective agenda are not the only issues of import. Many of us seek to advance other areas and policies that are not enumerated here and will continue to do so. However, this agenda focuses on that which is under assault by the federal administration and will have the biggest impact on Connecticut residents and the state’s finances.
If we fail to act, the consequences could be irreparable. The harm to families, healthcare access, and civil rights could become permanent. Connecticut is uniquely positioned to lead —not just because we have the resources, but because our state has consistently demonstrated a deep commitment to justice, equity, and community. Despite that deep commitment, we still have many residents in every zip code across the state who are barely getting by and that number will continue to grow due to the impact of dismantling federal agencies and programs.
Protect Connecticut is more than an agenda. It is a roadmap for resilience and safety, a concrete plan to protect the lives and dignity of people in our state. But we cannot succeed alone. We invite you to join our push to pass these essential protections now. Connect with us and help protect Connecticut: instagram.com/protectctnow

To me, it feels like an attack on everything I’ve fought to become.   .","I was 13 years old when I caused the accidental death of a friend. 
That’s the kind of sentence that stops people in their tracks and it should. I remember the silence that followed, not just from the world around me, but inside me. How do you move forward from something like that when you’re still just a kid yourself? I didn’t know how. No one did. I just kept waking up inside a body that felt like a prison and a world that no longer had a place for me.
There was no guidebook for a child who had taken a life, even by accident. No healing circle. No support group. Just isolation, shame, and eventually, prison. I wore my guilt like skin. And no matter where I went, school, the streets, a cell, I never felt like I belonged. Not to a community. Not to the future. Not even to myself.
That’s why AmeriCorps Public Allies didn’t just change my life. It saved it.
I didn’t come into the program confident or put together. I came in broken. But Public Allies didn’t ask me to hide that. They didn’t shame me. They didn’t treat me like a case file. They treated me like a human being with potential, not just a past.
They gave me meaningful work and trusted me to lead. They handed me a mic when I thought I’d never have a voice. They sat with my story when others ran from it. Through service, I found healing. Through community, I found purpose. And for the first time in years, I felt something crack open: I didn’t want to die. I wanted to live.
Not survive. Live.
AmeriCorps didn’t save a version of me. It saved me. All of me.
Now, the government wants to shut it down. To some, that’s just a budget cut. To me, it feels like an attack on everything I’ve fought to become — on everyone like me who is out there right now, quietly losing hope. Waiting for someone to see them.
Because here’s the truth: not everyone has the same starting line. Some of us start with a tragedy that follows us like a shadow. Some of us grow up in systems that forget us until we fail. Some of us have never once been told, “You still matter.”
That’s what Public Allies did. It said, You still matter.
If you’ve never hated yourself so much that breathing felt like punishment, you may not understand what programs like this really do. They don’t just build résumés. They build lives. They don’t just reduce unemployment. They reduce despair.
Don’t let AmeriCorps die.
Because if you do, you’re not just cutting a line item. You’re cutting off lifelines. You’re killing the one place where someone like me can walk in with nothing but a story and walk out with a reason to keep going. I am one of the lucky ones. And I’m writing this because I know there’s someone else out there, on the edge, waiting to be seen.
Don’t let us disappear.

(Sara Wilson/Colorado Newsline)People convicted of first-degree car theft in Colorado will be unable to have a firearm under a new law signed by Gov. Jared Polis on Monday.
House Bill 25-1171 adds the offense to the list of crimes covered by the Possession of Weapon by Previous Offender statute in the state. POWPO makes it illegal to own a firearm for people with one or more of the listed convictions on their record.
“From now on anyone convicted of first degree motor vehicle theft (is) ineligible to possess a firearm, keeping guns out of the wrong hands and protecting our communities,” Polis said in a statement. “I am proud of our work to improve public safety in Colorado, and with this bill signed into law, I look forward to continuing our bold progress to protect Coloradans and our communities.”
A person can be convicted of first-degree vehicle theft only after two other vehicle theft convictions.
The bill was sponsored by Reps. Shannon Bird of Westminster and Andrew Boesenecker of Fort Collins and Sens. Nick Hinrichsen of Pueblo and Dafna Michaelson Jenet of Commerce City, all Democrats. It passed the Legislature with bipartisan support.
A 2021 law narrowed the scope of the POWPO application in Colorado, and while a 2022 law then added more felonies back to the list, it left car theft out.
“What we heard in committee from law enforcement is a plea. They are begging us, in these situations where you have someone who has been convicted three times of auto theft, they are asking us to please take the firearm out of the equation,” Boesenecker said on the House floor during bill debate.

As the bill made its way through the Legislature, Hinrichsen said that car theft is distinct from other property crimes and non-violent offenses left out of POWPO.
“When we look at punishments relative to crime, either in terms of sentences or in terms of restrictions, what we should be looking at is the severity of the action and the risk and harm done to the victim and community more broadly. When you’re dealing with the theft of a vehicle, you’re disrupting the entire life of an individual,” he said during the bill’s first Senate committee hearing.
The bill was amended in the House, under a change brought by Republican representatives, to allow a person to petition a court to restore their firearm possession rights after 10 years.
“This is the crucially important piece — for someone who has turned their life around, they can petition to get this removed,” Rep. Ryan Armagost, a Berthoud Republican who helped negotiate the amendment, said on the House floor.
But that amendment ended up being a sticking point. Other crimes on the POWPO list do not have that restoration pathway for adults, creating equal protection concerns. Sponsors said, however, that the attorney general’s office said the bill with the amendment is defensible if a legal challenge emerges.
But the Senate stripped the amendment from the bill and passed a version without the restoration piece. The House then refused to accept the change and forced the Senate to decide, in the last hours of the session on May 7, to either pass the House version of the bill or allow the legislation to die. The Senate passed the bill.
“I appreciate the hard work of the House sponsors to work on deals that bring parties into agreement, that brought representatives to be able to get behind this policy that I believe will save lives in Colorado,” Hinrichsen said.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-05-20 02:46:05+00:00,CT Mirror,CT House narrowly votes to decriminalize ‘magic mushrooms’,Mark Pazniokas,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/05/19/ct-decriminalize-magic-mushrooms/,The bill reduces the penalty for illegally possessing less than half an ounce of psilocybin to a $150 fine for a first offense.,"Over protracted objections from the Republican minority, the Connecticut House voted 74 to 65 Monday night for a bill that would decriminalize small amounts of psilocybin, the psychoactive compound found in hallucinogenic mushrooms.
House Bill 7065 would reduce the penalty for illegally possessing less than half an ounce of psilocybin from a crime that carries a possible prison term to a $150 fine for a first offense.
Republicans attacked the legislation as premature, given ongoing research into its potential medical benefits, and flawed in that it does not precisely define psilocybin, which is a chemical compound.
“Why jump the gun on this?” asked Rep. Tracy Marra, R-Darien.
The bill passed despite significant dissent among Democrats: 22 joined 43 Republicans in opposition. Two Republicans joined 72 Democrats in favor. A dozen lawmakers did not vote.
The Democratic majority rejected several Republican amendments, including one that would have created a working group to study cities and states that have decriminalized psilocybin.
“Psilocybin is a product which has been shown to be an effective therapeutic for various mental illnesses, including treating PTSD, addictions, depressions and anxiety disorders,” said Rep. Steven Stafstrom, D-Bridgeport, the co-chair of the Judiciary Committee. 
Stafstrom called the bill a cautious step that would cease to equate the drug with heroin and cocaine.
“What this bill seeks to do is pretty simple. It doesn’t legalize the substance. I want to be really clear. This bill does not legalize psilocybin,” he said. “What this bill says is, instead of being subject to a year in jail for possessing under half an ounce of psilocybin, you’d be subject to a fine.”
Marra said she is aware of anecdotal evidence of the drug’s promise but said the state should defer to the FDA on decriminalization and await the results of ongoing research.
“I believe there is promise for this drug,” she said.
Rep. Craig Fishbein, R-Wallingford, the ranking Republican on Judiciary, mocked the majority for even debating the bill.
“Believe it or not, while people’s electric bills are going through the roof, taxes are being increased — we hear across the state about our municipalities raising taxes — the Connecticut legislature is decriminalizing magic mushrooms,” Fishbein said. “Yup, that’s what we have before us.”
Fishbein complained the bill had no standards for assessing potency.
“That’s how we’re going to operate here? I think we need a lot more information,” he said. “I’m very concerned about the lack of studies.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_7499-1024x804.jpg,,,2025-05-19 23:01:23.731611

(Photo by Dominique Sindayiganza courtesy of SEIU 1199NE)As striking workers picketed outside Butler Hospital for the fifth day Monday, the Providence psychiatric hospital’s management announced that health insurance for employees not actively working will be terminated at the end of the month.
About 800 members of New England Health Care Employees Union (SEIU 1199NE) were sent a letter informing them that medical, dental and vision benefits would expire on May 31. After that date, workers and their dependents will be ineligible for hospital-provided benefits unless they elect to continue their coverage through COBRA, the federal law allowing individuals to pay the full premium for their health coverage, including any portion previously paid by their employer.
“I know this is a scare tactic and all of that, but it’s horrible,” Brooke Huminski, a social worker in Butler’s Inpatient Assessment Center, said during an interview while picketing outside the hospital entrance along Blackstone Boulevard Monday at around 6:15 p.m. “It’s horrible to do this to someone.”
Strike appears imminent at Butler Hospital

Huminski said she knew it was always a possibility that hospital management could cut off health benefits. But the news comes at a stressful time as she and her partner are in the middle of an IVF treatment. Huminski said she also takes medication to manage a serious health condition.
“I’ve worked eight years evenings in the psychiatric emergency room,” Huminski said. “I love my patients. I have loved my job. I love my colleagues, but I’m just heartbroken by this and terrified.”
SEIU 1199NE represents clerical staff, registered nurses, mental health workers, and housekeeping and dietary staff at the 168-bed hospital owned by Care New England. All four of the union’s contracts with Care New England expired on March 31. The union announced April 25 that its members had voted to authorize a strike as they continued to demand higher wages, pension program access for future employees and greater attention to workplace safety. The last time both sides met was on May 7, and SEIU went on strike at 6 a.m. May 15.
According to the letter sent to SEIU 1199NE members, their last hospital paycheck will be May 23. Workers’ life insurance, long-term disability, health care flexible spending and dependent care spending accounts and insurance for critical illness, accident and voluntary legal coverage ended on May 14.
“We have worked diligently to reach a fair and sustainable agreement, offering significant wage increases and improvements in workplace safety,” Butler President and Chief Operating Officer Mary E. Marran said in a statement posted on its website. “Unfortunately, SEIU 1199 NE ended negotiations on May 7 and has not yet returned to the bargaining table, despite our continued willingness to resume talks.”
SEIU 1199NE maintains that it submitted a proposal at 8 p.m. on May 7 but that hospital management never responded.
“We continue to urge SEIU 1199 NE to re-engage in good-faith negotiations so we can reach a resolution that refocuses our shared commitment on what matters most—our patients and the dedicated professionals who care for them,” Marran added.
Rhode Island Current reached out to Care New England for additional comment, but a spokesperson said that Marran’s message posted online would be the only comment.
Rep. Rebecca Kislak, a Providence Democrat, has joined striking workers every day except Sunday. “What is breaking my heart right now is that I’m seeing an employer that doesn’t pay a whole lot to their employees to erode any goodwill and that worries me about the future of the hospital,” Kislak said.
Rep. David Morales, a Providence Democrat, visited with striking workers to show support for the first four days but was not there on Monday. He said Monday night that he was surprised when he learned about termination of health benefits.
“I thought that the hospital would be proceeding in better faith when it came to reaching an agreement with these frontline health care workers and I’m disappointed that they’ve exercised this measure to shut them out of their benefits,” Morales said.
“It’s a power move that sends a message that the bosses are in charge and that the workers should feel vulnerable.”
Morales said union leaders shared with him that workers planned to start applying for unemployment insurance Monday night.

The comments came during the Idaho Legislature’s Joint Finance-Appropriations Committee’s first day of spring meetings Monday in Idaho Falls.
The Joint Finance-Appropriations Committee, or JFAC for short, is a powerful legislative committee that sets the budgets for every state agency and department.

The medical workforce debate started during a workforce panel discussion at the College of Eastern Idaho after Rep. James Petzke, R-Meridian, asked the panelists if the Idaho Legislature was doing enough to develop the kind of modern workforce Idaho employers and industries need.
Eastern Idaho Regional Medical Center CEO Betsy Hunsicker didn’t sugar-coat her answer. She immediately told Petzke the short answer is “no.”
“It’s very challenging, and we don’t have OB-GYN coming in here,” Hunsicker said. “We’re not training general surgeons. We’re not. Physicians generally practice where they train. So I think the training piece for residency for physicians is really probably something that needs to continue to grow.”
 Physicians are ‘scared to practice’ in Idaho due to strict abortion ban, doctor tells committee 

Hunsicker and other panelists asked legislators to support two programs to help develop the state’s workforce – medical residency programs and the Idaho Launch workforce training initiative championed by Gov. Brad Little.
The discussion and the tension ratcheted up during a presentation later Monday given by Dr. Jennifer Cook, the OB fellowship director and associate director of the family medicine residency program at Full Circle Health in Boise. 
Cook was giving an overview of health education programs and talking about ways to bring more doctors to Idaho. 
Cook said huge swaths of Idaho are considered maternal care deserts, and the state ranks near the bottom nationally when it comes to physicians-per-capita.
In addition to supporting incentives like loan repayment programs and investing in medical residencies and fellowships, Cook told legislators they could attract more doctors if they clarified the state’s near total abortion ban to include the health of the pregnant mother – not just the life of the pregnant mother.
“Because right now, physicians are kind of scared to practice here, I’m not going to lie,” Cook told JFAC members. “Because there’s so much ambiguity – and I don’t think that was intentional in any way, shape or form. I think people are trying to support their constituents – but it has led us to this gray area where we don’t know what management is actually allowable, and that’s really hard.”
Cook said that ambiguity has real consequences.
“I had fellows who sat and watched a woman who was 19 weeks pregnant bleed and couldn’t do anything about it, and just waited until she was so sick she was about to die,” Cook said. “If that was your family, it would be really scary.”
While she was talking, Rep. Josh Tanner, R-Eagle, turned to his neighbor, Rep. Dustin Manwaring, R-Pocatello, and said, “that’s not true.”
Moments later, Cook briefly paused her presentation to JFAC members.
“I can see some eyes rolling,” Cook said. “I can see you all rolling your eyes.”
Cook then continued her presentation. 
When she fielded questions after her presentation, Rep. Steven Miller, R-Fairfield, and Tanner told Cook that they feel Idaho’s abortion law is clear.
Tanner told Cook he thinks the discussion is political. He said his conservative doctor friends tell him the law is clear, while people who lean left are “going nuts” over the abortion law.

In an interview with the Idaho Capital Sun after Cook’s presentation, Tanner said the life of the unborn baby gets lost in the debate.
“The problem that I see that they run into is they’re only looking at the aspect of the mom, keeping that person alive, and not the actual baby,” Tanner told the Sun.
Tanner also referenced the University of Washington’s Washington, Wyoming Alaska, Montana and Idaho, or WWAMI, medical program.
“Part of the problem, in my opinion, I think overall is where you look at the training aspect that they actually go through,” Tanner told the Sum. “So when they’re going through the WWAMI they’re going through up in Washington, and some of the actual classes and how most of the doctors that I talked to have come out like they’re fully like, ‘Abortion is no different than needing stitches. It’s no different than anything.’ And I think they dehumanized that child at that point in time.”
However, the University of Washington has said it does not use Idaho funds to teach courses related to abortion care, according to the Spokesman-Review. 
At a legislative hearing during the 2025 session, UW School of Medicine Vice Dean Suzanne Allen said the school would agree to Idaho’s abortion laws and stipulations, according to the Spokesman-Review.
“The University of Washington does not spend any Idaho funds on abortion care or abortion training,” she said.
In a statement regarding House Bill 176, which sought to defund Idaho WWAMI, UW said it was disheartened to see the Legislature discuss dissolving a more than 50-year partnership.
“The Idaho WWAMI partnership is required to teach the same content to our students that other medical schools are required to teach across the country to pass the national licensing exam,” the university stated. “This includes women’s health content such as normal labor and delivery as well as complications including miscarriages that require abortion procedures.”
  Legislature’s budget committee has been told before that abortion ban makes it harder to attract, retain maternal health care workers 

Although the Idaho Legislature adjourned April 4 and is not in session, JFAC often conducts interim meetings during the fall and spring to continue monitoring the state budget and take a closer look at agencies and programs that receive state funding.
This is not the first time JFAC members have been told that the Idaho Legislature’s abortion ban has made it harder to attract and retain physicians.  
During a different JFAC interim tour on Nov. 21, 2024, Idaho College of Osteopathic Medicine President Tracy Farnsworth told legislators the abortion ban has run off existing physicians and may be scaring away new ones. 
“Many of you probably know this, with our current Idaho state abortion laws that provide very little, if any, opportunity to terminate a pregnancy for health because we don’t have a health of the mother exception, we’ve lost roughly 25% of our OB-GYN,” Farnsworth said in November.
“We’ve gone from 200 to 150 OB-GYN, and we are hearing anecdotal evidence of a number of graduating OB-GYN residency students choosing not to come to Idaho because of fear of losing their license and (being) criminalized,” Farnsworth added.
JFAC members did not vote on any budgets or any bills on Monday. 
JFAC’s spring meetings continue Tuesday with a tour of community resource centers and the Idaho Department of Water Resources’ Eastern Regional Office. 
JFAC’s meetings are scheduled to conclude Wednesday with a tour of Idaho National Laboratory facilities.

(Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — Nebraska’s version of “One Big Beautiful Bill” for property tax relief went up in smoke Monday despite an effort to narrow new revenues to increased taxes on cigarettes and vapes.
It becomes the third property tax package in the past year to propose and fail to garner traction to use new sales tax revenues to lower property taxes. It also deals a significant blow to Gov. Jim Pillen’s pledge to keep property taxes flat this year as he eyes reelection.
Legislative Bill 170, led by State Sen. Tom Brandt of Plymouth, failed 30-15. It needed 33 votes to overcome a filibuster from opponents across the political spectrum who opposed the tax “shift.” The proposal originally sought to add sales taxes to 20 currently exempt goods or services, including pop, dating services, chartered jets, swimming pool cleaning and maintenance services and pet grooming. It also sought to hike the taxes on cigarettes (up to $1.36) and vapes (up to 40%).
The original package anticipated $110 million in new revenue, with $100 million directed to property tax credits to offset property taxes paid to local K-12 school districts.
“Property taxes remain one of the most painful burdens our residents face, impacting everyone from family farmers to first-time homeowners,” Brandt said. “This legislation is a responsible, targeted effort to address the burden by broadening Nebraska’s tax base.”

However, as happened at the end of both the 2024 regular session and an 18-day special session Pillen called last summer, lawmakers ultimately rejected expanded sales taxes on several goods and services, which could have raised about $53 million, Brandt’s estimates indicated.
“It’s just rebranded or repackaged from the prior two failed attempts that this Legislature has not moved forward for a variety of different reasons, with strong support across a politically diverse coalition,” said State Sen. Danielle Conrad of Lincoln.
‘Representing some ideology’
Brandt sought to narrow LB 170 to a lower revenue target of $80 million for new property tax relief each year by striking any broadening of the sales tax base. Instead, he proposed to increase cigarette taxes to $1.64 per 20-pack, which he said would raise nearly $60 million each year, and to increase vape taxes to 40% wholesale, which he said would raise about $15 million.
Both versions of LB 170 also included a proposal from Fremont State Sen. Dave Wordekemper to capture a 20% tax on cigars, cheroots and stogies purchased online, which senators estimated would raise $100,000 in revenue.
That left roughly $5 million that would have needed to be made up later, such as by adding back a handful of expanded sales taxes to the package.

State Sen. Jana Hughes of Seward, who has fought for increased taxes on vapes, said property tax relief is necessary for the grandmas or grandpas across Nebraska, as well as retirees and veterans, who are being priced out of their homes because of property taxes.
Hughes, State Sen. Mike Jacobson of North Platte and a handful of other conservatives in the officially nonpartisan Legislature defended the shift to new sales tax revenue as targeting “optional” goods or services. 
“We are so dang lazy we can’t even go to the McDonald’s drive-through by ourselves to go pick up our food. We hire someone to pick it up, and that’s a service, and we’re not even talking about taxing that service,” Hughes said.
A vote against LB 170, supporters said, was a vote against property tax relief.
“Don’t tell me you’re representing your constituents when you say you don’t want to lower property taxes, because you aren’t representing your constituents,” said State Sen. Mike Jacobson of North Platte. “You’re representing some ideology.”
‘Tax increase with no end in sight’
Much of the pushback to LB 170 was bipartisan, including from Republican State Sens. Brad von Gillern of the Elkhorn area, chair of the Legislature’s Revenue Committee, and Stan Clouse of Kearney, who said the bill was not “sustainable” relief. 
Clouse, a former longtime Kearney mayor, said the relief was “not real” and was “simply increasing revenue streams.” He suggested eliminating unfunded mandates was a better focus.
  State Sen. Brad von Gillern of Elkhorn, center, flanked by State Sens. Beau Ballard of Lincoln and Mike McDonnell of Omaha. Aug. 20, 2024. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)
Added von Gillern: “This is putting dollars into the top of a bucket that has a hole in the bottom of it.”
State Sen. Beau Ballard of Lincoln, a Pillen appointee, criticized LB 170 and its narrower components as a “tax increase with no end in sight” that wasn’t the right path forward, even as he identified property tax relief as a top priority for his district.
Von Gillern and State Sen. Tanya Storer of Whitman said the increased revenue also wouldn’t keep up with property tax growth, which was nearly $300 million in two of the past three years. The exception in annual increases that high was last fall, after the state took on the tab for property taxes previously levied by community colleges.
The state budget passed last week included about $57 million in expanded property tax credits for next year, and about $11 million more for homestead exemptions. Even combined with the $80 million in Brandt’s bill, property taxes would likely increase statewide next year.
That stands in direct contrast to Pillen’s pledge to hold property taxes flat. He has said that, without “a shadow of a doubt,” he and allies would find additional property tax relief this year.
‘The right triggers’
Storer, a rancher in north-central Nebraska, said she was concerned that the continued reliance on property tax credits was “feeding the demon” and taking away accountability from local taxing authorities.
“We still haven’t pulled the right triggers,” Storer, a freshman lawmaker, said.

Another path forward for property tax relief includes buying down property tax levies directly, an approach led by Hughes in a Pillen-backed LB 303, which also sought long-term changes to how the state funds K-12 schools. 
However, the provision to lower property taxes directly has since been stripped out of LB 303 to give time for senators to further study the approach before returning next January.
State Sen. George Dungan of Lincoln, who has consistently opposed expanding the sales tax to exempted items without lowering the 5.5-cent statewide sales tax rate, said the latest package would pick “winners and losers.” 
Dungan criticized repeated efforts for a “grand slam swing” at tax policy when expansive adjustments need more time to be effective.
On the Democratic side, State Sens. Ashlei Spivey and Terrell McKinney, both of Omaha, noted LB 170 wouldn’t have helped renters.
Conrad and State Sen. Dunixi Guereca of Omaha cautioned that an increased tax on nicotine products also wouldn’t be paid by “Big Tobacco” executives, but everyday Nebraskans.
Dungan and State Sen. Machaela Cavanaugh of Omaha added that increasing taxes on cigarettes and vapes would hopefully decrease tobacco usage, which could lead to less tax revenue.
“If we continue to just try to put a piece of tape over the hole in the boat,” Dungan said, “it’s not going to fix the actual problem.”
After the vote, Brandt said he was disappointed and that he had made his “run” for more relief.
“If the Legislature doesn’t want to give property tax relief, I don’t know what else I can do,” Brandt told the Nebraska Examiner.



Dozen senators crossed party lines on final vote
Voting to move forward on LB 170: Democratic State Sens. Wendy DeBoer of Omaha, Jason Prokop of Lincoln, Dan Quick of Grand Island, Jane Raybould of Lincoln and Victor Rountree of Bellevue.
Voting against LB 170: Republican State Sens. Bob Andersen of Sarpy County, Beau Ballard of Lincoln, Stan Clouse of Kearney, Glen Meyer of Pender, Tanya Storer of Whitman, Jared Storm of David City and Paul Strommen of Sidney.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-05-20 01:29:56+00:00,CT Mirror,Bethany first selectwoman to resign after scathing report,Laura Tillman,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/05/19/bethany-first-selectwoman-paula-cofrancesco-to-resign/,Paula Cofrancesco was accused of mishandling reports that children were sexually abused while attending town-run camp programs.,"This story has been updated. 
Bethany First Selectwoman Paula Cofrancesco announced her resignation before a town meeting on Monday night, reading from a letter that she said she planned to file with the town clerk’s office on Tuesday morning. 
The resignation comes after a scathing report was released on May 15 that accused Cofrancesco of mishandling a number of allegations that children were sexually abused while attending after-school and camp programs run by the town. The release of that report was met with numerous calls for her resignation by elected officials and residents in light of what was described as her “ineptitude, malfeasance, and gross neglect.”
Cofrancesco’s announcement before a packed town meeting was greeted with cheers.
Yet, even as she resigned, Cofrancesco seemed to double down on her repeated claims that she’d done nothing wrong. 
“I have always acted in the best interest of the town of Bethany, and while I disagree with the findings of the recent report as to my conduct, I recognize that my continuing as first selectwoman will be a distraction to the important business that needs to be done.”
Cofrancesco added that she hoped the town could begin the process of healing before closing her comments and walking away from the podium.
The report that was released last week was prepared by the Pullman & Comley law firm, followed a seven-month investigation and asserted that Cofrancesco deceived Bethany residents by repeatedly claiming she did not know the nature of the allegations against the accused, Anthony Mastrangelo. According to the report, Cofrancesco ensured that Mastrangelo continued to be employed by the town even after the school superintendent had fired him and banned him from the school campus. Cofrancesco even resisted efforts to make programs safer: according to an interview in the report with Cofrancesco’s assistant, no background checks were conducted until 2024.
The resignation takes place as lawmakers are debating a controversial bill that would require municipal camps to be licensed by the state. Currently, camps in Connecticut that are run by towns and cities receive no state oversight and aren’t required to comply with even basic regulations that private camps must abide by, like conducting staff background checks and testing water quality. 
Cofrancesco was among the voices of opposition when a similar bill was proposed in 2023. At the time, she argued that municipal camps already received enough oversight, including from elected leaders like herself.
Cofrancesco first ran for the position of first selectwoman in 2019. Among her supporters at the time was Amy Lestinsky, the mother of a girl who became the fifth child to make abuse accusations against Mastrangelo. Though Mastrangelo no longer worked for the town by the time that abuse is alleged to have occurred, he was a frequent babysitter for local kids and Cofrancesco kept quiet the allegations, including investigations by the Department of Children and Families and Connecticut State Police.
“I am extremely happy that our [first selectwoman] will be handing in her resignation,” Lestinsky told the CT Mirror. “While I feel she should have resigned last year, this is finally a step forward for our community to begin to heal.”
In addition to Cofrancesco, the report places blame on Connecticut State Police, calling their delay in seeking arrest warrants for Mastrangelo an “unexplained failure.” While Cofrancesco has now announced her resignation, police still have not provided an explanation for their lack of action, during which time a fifth victim was allegedly sexually assaulted. 
Cofrancesco’s resignation will go into effect on June 6, according to her statement. Gina Teixiera, a member of the Bethany Board of Selectman, told the Connecticut Mirror that she believed Cofrancesco’s resignation should be effective immediately. 
“It’s disappointing but not surprising to hear her say she acted in the best interest of the town when Pullman & Comley’s report, supported by evidence, says otherwise.

While the federal government protects animals listed under the Endangered Species Act, states are tasked with keeping the vast majority of other species out of the “emergency room.” Habitat loss, pollution and climate change are making that job much more difficult.
At the same time, states are finding it harder to count on the hunting and fishing revenues that have long funded most of their work. Agencies say they have more challenges than ever before, and less money to take them on.
In many states, lawmakers are rethinking the long-standing model for wildlife management. They’re considering new funding sources to make the agencies less reliant on license fees. They’re asking wildlife managers to expand their work beyond traditional “game” species, adding protections for threatened insects and other animals. And some are scrutinizing the commissions that have long governed wildlife management.
Some of the proposals have seen broad support from outdoors lovers who want to strengthen their wildlife agencies. Others have drawn opposition from sporting groups, who fear the new focus will diminish hunting and fishing opportunities.
“We’re seeing quite a bit of action this year,” said Logan Christian, wildlife and habitat specialist with the National Caucus of Environmental Legislators, a forum for state lawmakers. “We definitely have noticed that states are working on strengthening their wildlife agencies.”
As Stateline previously reported, New Mexico enacted the most sweeping overhaul this year. It renamed the Department of Game & Fish as the Department of Wildlife, giving it a more explicit focus on non-game species. Budget writers provided $10.5 million in new funding over the next three years to help threatened species. And lawmakers created a new process for appointing the agency’s commissioners, with guidelines ensuring a diversity of expertise and experience.
Wildlife advocates in other states say the New Mexico overhaul was a game changer. But lawmakers elsewhere are taking a more piecemeal approach.
Dollars
Numerous states are reconsidering their wildlife agencies’ funding model.
“There’s definitely a growing awareness that the current management system is outdated and really unfit for 21st century challenges,” said Michelle Lute, executive director of Wildlife for All, a nonprofit focused on overhauling state wildlife governance. “State wildlife agencies are seeing that they can’t rely on hunting and fishing license fees to be able to do this work.”

Earlier this year, lawmakers in Utah enacted a new tax on wind and solar projects that will help fund the state’s wildlife agency. The revenue could double the department’s funding to protect non-game species, from $5 million to $10 million.
“We have a funding model in place for game species,” said Paul Thompson, administrator of the Species Protection Account with the Utah Division of Wildlife Resources. “Funding to work on some of our native species programs has been really hard to come by.”
The new revenue could allow the agency to invest in more biologists, conservation easements, watershed restoration projects and native fish hatchery programs. State Rep. Casey Snider, the Republican who sponsored the bill, argued that the clean energy sector should pay because its development is harming Utah’s habitat.
“Wind and solar projects have an outsized impact on [non-game] species, and they have not been contributing financially,” he said.
But industry leaders said the law will threaten the state’s energy development.
“[The measure will] severely strain the economics of an existing project and send a negative message to developers and the financial institutions that provide capital for these projects,” said Theresa Foxley, chief of staff to rPlus Energies, a renewable developer, in testimony to lawmakers.
Lawmakers in Oregon are considering an increase to the state’s tax on hotel and short-term rental stays to help fund non-game wildlife work. The proposal would bring in about $30 million annually. State Rep. Ken Helm, the bill’s Democratic sponsor, said the state wildlife agency’s division to manage non-game species “has come and gone over the last 30 years as funding is available.”
Growing concerns about climate change and biodiversity have created urgency to find a stable funding source, he said. Helm said the lodging tax is a logical source, because the state’s tourism industry is centered on the outdoors. He noted that Oregon’s natural resources agencies receive only a tiny fraction of the state’s general revenue.
Travel and tourism groups oppose the bill, arguing it could drive visitors elsewhere. Helm has also proposed a bill that would bring in wildlife funding through an income tax increase.
He said his message to fellow lawmakers was: “I’ve given you two ways to get the money we need for this agency. Nobody’s been able to come up with a better idea. Just pick one.”
The bill was heard in committee earlier this month, but has not yet advanced.

Meanwhile, lawmakers in Hawaii approved a “green fee” — a lodging tax increase of 0.75% that Democratic Gov. Josh Green’s office estimates will bring in $100 million annually to help protect the state from climate change. While the fund is not explicitly focused on wildlife, it’s expected to contribute to efforts such as coral reef restoration and watershed protection that will benefit important habitats.
State Rep. Amy Perruso, a Democrat who was among the advocates for a green fee, said the COVID-19 pandemic was a wakeup call.
“With the absence of tourists, we saw a lot more fish in the ocean, everything about the environment was so much more healthy because we didn’t have 10 million extra people,” she said. “If we’re going to do something to protect the environment, [tourism] is a logical connection.”
Washington state was among the first to significantly invest in non-game conservation through state tax revenue, with legislation enacted two years ago. The budget passed by lawmakers this session continues that work, with $14 million set aside for biodiversity and species recovery each of the next two years.
Lawmakers in Kansas and North Carolina also proposed using more general fund revenue for wildlife work, although those measures have not advanced.
Mission
In other states, lawmakers are focused on expanding their wildlife agencies’ mission to more non-game species. Last year, Colorado gave wildlife managers the authority to manage insects and other invertebrates, as well as rare plants.
“Invertebrates are wildlife, and their conservation benefits the entire ecosystem, including the species [state wildlife officials] traditionally managed,” said Richard Reading, vice chair of the Colorado Parks and Wildlife Commission. “They do everything from creating our soils to filtering our water to pollinating the food we eat.”
Reading also serves as vice president of science and conservation at the Butterfly Pavilion, an insect zoo. He noted that studies are showing that many invertebrate species are in rapid decline. In addition to expanding the agency’s authority, lawmakers provided funding for six staff members to take on the additional work.
A similar bill in Nevada, focused on invertebrates, advanced through the Assembly’s natural resources committee.
“There’s definitely concerns about declines in pollinator species,” said Assemblymember Howard Watts, a Democrat who sponsored the bill. “Our wildlife agency can and should take proactive action to do research, surveys and habitat improvement to keep these species off the [endangered species list].”
Watts said the bill would allow wildlife managers to consider insects in state plans to protect imperiled species. He said the Nevada Department of Wildlife has requested an entomologist position if it’s asked to take on the additional species. Beyond that, he said, the measure would not require additional money, as it’s focused on voluntary, proactive work, rather than additional regulations.

Another bill in Pennsylvania would expand wildlife managers’ authority to include insects. That measure has been approved by the House Environmental and Natural Resources Protection Committee.
Sporting groups have largely been supportive of efforts to provide new funding sources to manage non-game species. But some are skeptical of plans to expand agencies’ mission without an increase in revenue.
“Most hunters and anglers understand that healthy game populations are dependent on ecosystem integrity,” said Devin O’Dea, Western policy and conservation manager with Backcountry Hunters & Anglers, a nonprofit focused on public lands. “But when you take a model that’s been developed with the intent of enforcing regulations for fish and game species, expand that scope without funding and additional capacity, it’s a recipe for something to fall off the plate.”
Governance
Meanwhile, some legislators want to rethink the commission model that oversees wildlife governance. Critics say that governors often select commissioners who are hunting guides, farmers and political donors. Once appointed, they enact wildlife policies to suit their economic interests.
Florida state Rep. Anna V. Eskamani, a Democrat, drafted a bill that would overhaul the state’s Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission. Her proposal would increase the board from seven to nine members. It would designate seats for scientists, conservationists, local officials, farmers, hunters and anglers.
“The commission has made decisions not based on science or conservation, but based on developers or landowners that engage in agricultural practices,” she said. “We tried to strike a balance to ensure there are voices with an environmental background, with a conservation and wildlife background, with an academic background.”
The bill did not advance, but Eskamani said grassroots support is building for systemic changes in wildlife management.
Some sporting groups are more wary of commission overhaul proposals.
“We have seen examples where proposed changes to commissions were politically motivated or motivated by anti-hunting and anti-angling interests,” said Kent Keene senior manager for Western states and agriculture policy with the Congressional Sportsmen’s Foundation, a group that promotes hunting and fishing priorities on Capitol Hill. “When those changes are focused on science-based needs, then the sportsmen’s community has a long history of supporting those steps to ensure we are protecting our heritage.”
Some hunting and fishing groups have emphasized that the expanded mission should come with additional funding, so agencies aren’t stretched thin. Keene noted that hunters and anglers pay an excise tax on the purchase of gear, which provides an important funding source for wildlife agencies. Some have proposed a similar “backpack tax” on gear for hikers, birdwatchers and others.
Another proposal in New Hampshire would give the wildlife agency’s executive director the authority to make policy decisions, relegating the Fish and Game Commission to an advisory body. That bill did not advance.

(Photo by Christopher Shea/Rhode Island Current)As a House commission studying Rhode Island landlord-tenant law met to prepare its final report Monday, tenants’ rights organizations made a last-minute push for lawmakers to pass legislation to restrict the reasons landlords can use to justify evictions or refuse to renew a lease.
A proposal to codify “just cause evictions” surfaced as the 11-member commission formed last summer held its final meeting, drawing opposition from Realtors and landlords who argued such a measure was merely masquerading as a rent freeze. 
Commissioner Daniel Denvir, the co-chair of the tenant organizing group Reclaim Rhode Island, said he made the recommendation so that landlords can’t evict their renters for arbitrary reasons.
“It is overwhelmingly, emphatically the singular thing that the tenant movement in this state wants,” Denvir said. “You need a just cause to evict someone. You can’t terminate a residency because a landlord said so.”
Just cause legislation was introduced in both chambers in February. The House version is sponsored by Rep. Cherie Cruz, a Pawtucket Democrat, and the Senate bill is sponsored by Tiara Mack, a Providence Democrat. Both bills received judiciary committee hearings and were held for further study, as is standard practice when legislation is first vetted by a panel.
The legislation would cap rent increases at 4% annually or 1½ times the annual percentage change in the consumer price index — similar to the yearly cap municipalities face when raising taxes.
The two Realtors on the commission argued that limiting rent increases will hinder property owners from making further investment into new buildings or maintaining existing ones.
“It’s going to diminish housing, diminish the quality of housing, the quantity of housing,” said Commissioner Shannon Elizabeth Weinstein, an associate broker and partner at RentProv Realty.

David Place, a Burrillville Republican; Superior Court Judge Christopher Smith, the commission’s chairman; and Shannon Elizabeth Weinstein, an associate broker and partner at RentProv Realty.

Housing advocates have repeatedly cited rising rents as a major factor in Rhode Island’s growing unhoused population.
“Rents have gone through the roof,” Denvir said. 
The National Low Income Housing Coalition’s latest “Gap” report found that 64% of extremely low-income renters in Rhode Island spend more than half of their income on housing, leaving little for necessities like food and health care. Just 47 affordable and available rental homes for every 100 households with extremely low incomes, according to the report from the Washington D.C.-based nonprofit.
Under the proposals from Cruz and Mack, landlords would have the ability to raise rent above the prescribed percentage. But if they attempt to evict a tenant for failing to pay the excess amount, the housing court would consider it a “rebuttable presumption” that the increase was unreasonable.
Building owners who manage five units or fewer would remain exempt from the proposed legislation.
But Weinstein said the just cause eviction proposal is “rent control with additional restrictions.”
The commission was created through a House resolution last year to address recent disputes between landlords and tenants involving issues like housing discrimination, maintenance dilemmas, late payments, termination of tenancy and security deposits. It has also reviewed existing laws to determine what clarifications may be needed to language governing the rights and obligations of landlords and tenants.
Under the House resolution that created the panel, the recommendations were due by May 5. But Rep. David Morales, a Providence Democrat who serves as the commission’s vice chair, told Rhode Island Current the group needed more time to refine and finalize its proposed changes.
“One internal discussion turned to several,” he said in an interview. 
A final report is expected to be completed Wednesday and then published online Thursday. It will include 11 recommendations discussed and debated by the commission. Both landlords and tenant organizations were in agreement on six of them:

Seal eviction records when a case is dismissed.
Seal the names of minors involved in eviction proceedings, and allow individuals aged 18 to 21 with familial ties to a tenant to request that their names also be sealed.
Require landlords to provide a receipt “without delay” after receiving any rental payment made in cash.
Allow existing legal services for tenants facing eviction to continue, subject to available funding and income eligibility. Also consider providing financial assistance and supportive services to help tenants remain housed.
Develop a model form to document tenant repairs.
Seal eviction records when a tenant prevails over their landlord.

Four recommendations came from landlords, over the objections from tenant groups: 

Allow landlords and renters to file an ex parte motion or request a temporary restraining order during eviction proceedings.
Permit rent payments after a lease termination date.
Amending termination notice language to reflect the rental due date as the termination date
Give tenants the option to pay rent into the court registry when a stay of execution is granted in an eviction case.

The only support for just cause eviction legislation came from Denvir.
Commissioner Julie Finn, executive director of the Warwick Housing Authority, was not present at Monday’s meeting.

LaMonica McIver with “assaulting, impeding and interfering with law enforcement” during the arrest of Newark Mayor Ras Baraka outside a migrant jail in Newark 10 days ago.
Habba also announced her office is dropping Baraka’s misdemeanor trespassing charge “for the sake of moving forward.” Baraka called for federal prosecutors to drop the charge after a court hearing in his case in Newark on Thursday.
The stunning development has McIver accusing the Trump administration of attempting to “criminalize and deter legislative oversight” and Habba saying that congressional oversight is “not an issue in this case.” 
“No one is above the law — politicians or otherwise. It is the job of this office to uphold justice impartially, regardless of who you are,” Habba said in a statement Monday evening. “Now we will let the justice system work.” 
McIver said these charges are purely political.
“This administration will never stop me from working for the people in our district and standing up for what is right,” she said in a statement. “I am thankful for the outpouring of support I have received and I look forward to the truth being laid out clearly in court.”
The charges against McIver stem from a May 9 protest outside Delaney Hall, the new migrant jail in Newark. In the days prior, Baraka had attempted to gain access to the facility, which he claims is operating illegally without proper city permits.
McIver and two other New Jersey Democrats, Reps. Rob Menendez and Bonnie Watson Coleman, joined Baraka that day. Federal agents moved to arrest Baraka, and video of the chaos that ensued shows McIver and other protestors surrounding the mayor. 
While Baraka was still in federal custody, McIver told reporters that she was the one assaulted by federal agents.
“We did not get one apology, we did not get one explanation. I personally, who was assaulted on camera, did not get one apology from any ICE administrator, no call from Homeland Security, nothing,” she said.
Department of Homeland Security officials later posted video of the melee to social media, focusing on a moment where McIver pushes past a federal agent.
McIver said in her statement that she, Menendez, and Watson Coleman were lawfully conducting oversight of the facility and that the visit “should have been peaceful and short.” 
“Instead, ICE agents created an unnecessary and unsafe confrontation when they chose to arrest Mayor Baraka,” she said. 
Habba’s statement says she attempted to address these issues without bringing criminal charges and gave McIver “every opportunity to come to a resolution, but she has unfortunately declined.”
The three House members have faced backlash from Republican lawmakers who have introduced a resolution that would strip them of their committee assignments, and at least one representative has called for McIver to be expelled from Congress. U.S. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem accused the three Democrats of “lawlessness.”
Habba’s statement says she has invited Baraka to tour Delaney Hall. 
“The government has nothing to hide at the facility, and I will personally accompany the mayor so he can see that firsthand,” she said. “The citizens of New Jersey deserve unified leadership so we can get to work to keep our state safe.” 
Habba was present in court last week for a 20-minute status conference on Baraka’s charges. Lawyers for Baraka said he was let onto the property by a staff member, and that Baraka was arrested outside the property. Monday was a deadline for federal prosecutors to deliver certain information pertaining to Baraka’s arrest.
Baraka, who is one of six Democrats running for his party’s nomination for governor, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

(Robert Zullo/ States Newsroom)Pennsylvania electricity would be more reliable and affordable if more wind, solar and nuclear power are deployed as the regional grid faces an explosive growth in demand, state lawmakers heard Monday.
Testimony during  a House Environmental and Natural Resource Protection Committee hearing suggested that Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro’s proposed legislation to increase the supply of renewable energy would position the commonwealth well to ride out the turbulence. But at least one industry representative pushed back on that premise.
PJM Interconnection, the organization that operates the electricity grid for Pennsylvania and 12 other states, has predicted its peak demand will grow by about 70,000 megawatts to 220,000 megawatts by 2040. The growth is being driven by the increased electrification of transportation and industry and the proliferation of data centers to satisfy the demand for computing power from artificial intelligence and other technologies.
“That’s like building Pennsylvania’s entire existing energy generating fleet, and then some additional 20,000 more megawatts over the next 15 years. That’s a huge amount of growth, and we do need all energy sources to play a part in that,” said Evan Vaughn, executive director of the Mid-Atlantic Renewable Energy Coalition, a nonprofit group representing wind, solar and battery storage developers and advocates for renewable energy growth.
Shapiro’s Pennsylvania Reliable Energy Sustainability Standard (PRESS) would create incentives for renewable energy development and add emerging technologies such as next-generation nuclear, fusion, and carbon capture technologies to the state’s range of renewable energy sources. 
First introduced in 2024 and reintroduced as part of Shapiro’s broader Lightning energy plan, PRESS would require 35% of Pennsylvania’s electricity to come from clean sources by 2035. The updated standard would open Pennsylvania to new investment and create 14,500 jobs, the governor’s office said. 
The Lightning plan would employ an existing state program, the Economic Development for a Growing Economy (EDGE) Tax Credit, to to provide up to $100 million per facility for three years to encourage the addition of renewable energy to the grid and additional credits for projects in the two proposed regional hydrogen hubs and for sustainable aviation fuel.
Rep. Danielle Friel-Otten (D-Chester) and Sen. Steve Santarsiero (D-Bucks) are sponsors of companion bills in the House and Senate that would put PRESS into effect. Pennsylvania is not immune from the effects on the price of electricity of the growing global demand for energy and a plateau in petroleum and natural gas production, Friel-Otten said.
“We have an important task ahead of us to increase energy on the grid,” Friel-Otten said. “As we do that, we have a responsibility to continue to do the work to reduce emissions and mitigate climate change.”
Vaughn said there are about 9,600 megawatts of solar, wind and storage capacity projects in the PJM queue in Pennsylvania.
“In many ways those are the fastest projects and the most concrete projects that can be brought online to help meet demand in the next five years or so,” he said, adding that utility scale wind and solar power projects are the least expensive options for new power plants.
Combined with Shapiro’s proposed Reliable Energy Siting and Electric Transition (RESET) Board, which would serve as a central authority to consider and approve applications for large generating facilities, the planned projects could be online quickly. That legislation was introduced as House Bill 502 by Rep. Mandy Steele (D-Allegheny).
Nick Cohen, president of Doral Renewables, a solar energy production and storage development company in Philadelphia, said local opposition to energy projects often stands in the way of the economic benefits to individual landowners and communities. Pennsylvania would benefit from a state-level reviewing body that other states have empowered to vet energy projects.
“The bill is encouraging. It’s a beacon that goes out to corporations who, in many cases, are the buyers of the energy. And it will bring companies to Pennsylvania who are looking for renewable energy,” Cohen said.
But David Taylor, president and CEO of the Pennsylvania Manufacturers Association, said the state’s retail choice energy structure has been a success, with electricity prices decreasing significantly since the industry was deregulated in 2005. In the 15 years that followed, greenhouse gas emissions from power generation decreased by more than 44%, Taylor said.
Shapiro’s plan would tamper with that success by placing mandates on the energy industry, forcing the early retirement of reliable generation assets such as natural gas and coal and replace them with what he said were problematic technologies, he said.
“To be clear, this is not an evolution of policy. It’s a revolutionary disruption that would dismantle our competitive electricity markets and replace them with government mandates that distort supply, limit choice and raise costs,” Taylor said.
The RESET Board would streamline the process for building energy projects by speeding permits and reducing red tape. Pennsylvania is one of only 12 states without a state entity to handle siting decisions for major energy projects, according to Shapiro’s office.
Solar and wind would require the development of millions of acres of open land, create waste as technology becomes obsolete and put the United States at the mercy of nations such as China that dominate the production of rare earth elements needed for batteries, Taylor claimed.  
Although Pennsylvania ranks near the bottom among the states in energy from wind, solar and geothermal sources, according to a PennEnvironment analysis of U.S. Energy Information Administration data, the goal of 35% renewable energy includes nuclear and is lower than that of neighboring states. New Jersey, for example, has a goal of 50% renewable energy by 2030.
Taylor said he also opposes Shapiro’s plan to offer tax credits for renewable energy projects.
“Every time that the word incentive is used, I hear distortion. You are taking money from the taxpayers and essentially using it to bribe people to make choices that they would not otherwise make. And those things are fundamentally unhealthy for our economy,” Taylor said. 
Rep. Thomas Mehaffie (R-Dauphin) said the unprecedented growth in demand means it’s crucial that the commonwealth act to speed development of all energy sources. 
Mehaffie recalled his sponsorship in 2019 of legislation to update the then-15-year-old precursor to PRESS, the Alternative Energy Portfolio Standards, when “a big fight over a bunch of industries wanting more and more” resulted in inaction. 
There’s no more time to fight, he said. 
“Five years ago, we sounded this alarm, and no one did anything … if we continue to stick our head in the sand and do nothing, guess what’s going to happen? Nothing,” Mehaffie said. “And I’ll tell you, what’s going to happen is we’re not going to have power on the grid.”",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/TURBINES-3-1024x670.jpeg,,,2025-05-19 21:01:18.078812

(Photo by Charlotte Rene Woods/Virginia Mercury)CHARLOTTESVILLE, Va. — Abortion pills — and questions over their inherent safety — were back in federal court Monday. Unlike a lawsuit rejected by the U.S. Supreme Court last year, plaintiffs this time are not anti-abortion activists arguing medication abortion should be banned, but abortion providers arguing the remaining restrictions should be lifted to match the drug’s 25-year record of safety and efficacy.
The suit seeks to make abortion pills more accessible by removing several existing restrictions on the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s mifepristone-misoprostol regimen first approved in 2000. The drug was approved under the FDA’s drug safety program called Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS), provisions of which have been steadily eliminated over time but not fully.
On behalf of independent providers in Virginia, Montana, and Kansas, Center for Reproductive Rights senior counsel Linda Goldstein argued the FDA’s most recent evaluations did not properly assess whether remaining restrictions are still medically necessary. She argued that the biggest risks the FDA has identified with mifepristone — serious bleeding and infection — are not exclusive to the drug but with all pregnancy terminations, including spontaneous miscarriages, which she said affected about 25% of all pregnancies. Beyond abortion, for which the drug has captured attention, mifepristone is also used to treat miscarriages so that they conclude safely to help prevent infection.
“The FDA has acknowledged that staying pregnant is more dangerous than not staying pregnant,” said Goldstein, arguing that at minimum the FDA should be required to explain why drugs that pose similar risks are not subject to the same restrictions.
She noted that of the 20,000 drugs the FDA has approved, only 73 have REMS provisions, and that mifepristone has proven to be a safe drug over time. About 7.5 million U.S. patients have taken it as of the end of last year, Goldstein said. As of December 2024, the FDA has reported 36 patient deaths associated with mifepristone since it was first approved in 2000.
Whole Woman’s Health Alliance v. FDA is the first time the U.S. Department of Justice is arguing a position on mifepristone in court since the Trump administration took office. Justice Department attorneys said current regulations are necessary for the most common form of pregnancy termination to be considered safe. When asked by the judge, DOJ attorney Noah Katzen did not confirm or deny whether or not the FDA still considers the drug to be safe and effective overall.
“That is what the FDA determined in the past,” Katzen said during the hearing at the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Virginia in Charlottesville, where the case was originally filed in 2023.
Katzen, the FDA’s former associate chief counsel until 2021 and currently a trial attorney for the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, said the FDA has found that the evidence was “not sufficient” to conclude the REMS are no longer necessary.
U.S. District Judge Robert S. Ballou, appointed by Democratic President Joe Biden, appeared more sympathetic to plaintiffs’ argument that some of the requirements appear arbitrary in that they don’t apply to other drugs with equal or greater risk, including drugs his parents have taken.
Ballou did not rule at the end of Monday’s hearing but said he would as soon as possible.
After the hearing, Whole Woman’s Health Alliance founder and president Amy Hagstrom Miller told States Newsroom she took note of Katzen’s response about whether the FDA considers mifepristone to be safe and effective.
“It was an interesting choice of words,” she said.
This lawsuit is among several federal cases involving mifepristone. Earlier this month, the Trump administration filed a brief in the case Missouri v. FDA, requesting the court dismiss three states’ lawsuit to restrict mifepristone on procedural grounds, but did not comment on the merits of the case or explicitly defend the FDA’s current medication abortion policy.
While the Missouri v. FDA lawsuit seeks to reinstate regulations loosened between 2016 and 2021, the Whole Woman’s Health v. FDA lawsuit takes aim at restrictions that require: medical professionals who prescribe mifepristone to register with the drug manufacturer; pharmacies to apply for special certification and maintain copious records, and patients to review and sign a counseling form.
On behalf of plaintiffs, which include Whole Woman’s Health Alliance in Virginia and other states, All Families Healthcare and Blue Mountain Clinic in Montana, and Trust Women in Kansas, Goldstein argued that these existing rules are burdensome and make these medications harder to access by limiting the number of providers and pharmacies who can provide and dispense it and impede access to time-sensitive care.
Goldstein noted the “political climate” surrounding mifepristone and pointed to how abortion opponents seek either rescinding of FDA approval for mifepristone or a return to the in-person dispensing requirements. She added how efforts to make abortion medication more difficult to obtain are outlined in Project 2025 — the conservative Heritage Foundation’s playbook.
Before and especially since Roe v. Wade was overturned in 2022, anti-abortion groups have tried to convince courts that abortion pills, in addition to ending the lives of embryos and fetuses, harm pregnant people at rates that warrant being pulled from the market or at the very least heavily restricted.
During his presidential campaign and since taking office, President Donald Trump and his health appointees have messaged strategically on medication abortion, on the one hand promising to retain its access while also open to examining new evidence suggesting it is unsafe.
Just last week, U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said he would direct the FDA to review abortion pill safety and potentially change its drug label, following the release of an anti-abortion white paper commissioned by far-right funders, whose analysis has been widely criticized by reproductive health scientists and is outflanked by hundreds of studies showing a very low rate of serious adverse events.
 Significant for the South 

Hagstrom Miller called the current restrictions “politically motivated” and said overturning them would be especially significant for Virginia, which as the least restrictive state in the South, has seen an uptick in people traveling from elsewhere to receive care.
“They’re not related to the safety of the medication,” Hagstrom Miller said, of the current restrictions. “We just want to ensure that the most popular method for abortion in Virginia and beyond is protected no matter who sits at the White House and who sits in the FDA.”
Virginia moves to protect reproductive and voting rights, but the fight is far from over

Virginia is in the process of amending its state constitution to enshrine abortion and other reproductive health care procedures or medications. The constitutional amendment passed the legislature on party-line votes this year and must pass again next year before appearing on ballots for voters statewide. Its continued success or failure hinges on the outcome of the state’s competitive House of Delegates elections — where Democrats hold a slim majority.
While governors don’t have a say in constitutional amendments, the issue is a divergence between gubernatorial candidates Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears and Democratic challenger former Congresswoman Abigail Spanberger. This means that should the amendment fail and partisan control of the House shift, whoever is the next governor could advance or block potential future efforts to walk back Virginia’s current abortion access laws.
“It’s really important that we protect that safe access to medication abortion no matter where people live — Virginia is playing a key role in the South right now,” Hagstrom Miller said.

Victor Rountree of Bellevue, on April 10, 2025, as lawmakers debate his priority bill before it was vetoed by the governor. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — Despite three consecutive bipartisan votes this year to lift a lifetime ban on public food aid for some Nebraskans with past drug felonies, the Legislature on Monday did an about face that put a nail in the bill’s coffin.
The only change between the 32-17 vote on May 14 that favored Legislative Bill 319, noted State Sen. Wendy DeBoer of Omaha and others, was a veto by Nebraska Gov. Jim Pillen.

“If you change your mind, if you don’t have the backbone to stand by your vote — on food, to people who don’t have it — I don’t really know what you stand for,” DeBoer told colleagues.
Despite pleas by her and others, including the bill’s sponsor, State Sen. Victor Rountree of Bellevue — who invoked several Bible passages about forgiveness — the Legislature voted 24-24 to uphold the governor’s veto. The bill needed 30 votes to override Pillen’s veto.
That means the status quo stands, with state law prohibiting anyone who has been convicted of selling or distributing a controlled substance from accessing SNAP benefits (the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program). People with three or more felonies for possessing or using illegal drugs also are ineligible, but state law allows Nebraskans with one or two drug possession or use convictions access to SNAP if they complete a licensed treatment program.
Rountree’s priority bill would have lifted the ban entirely under certain circumstances, such as if the offender completed their criminal sentence or was serving a term of parole or on post-release supervision. Also under Rountree’s bill, a person with three or more felony convictions for drug possession or use had to participate in an accredited substance abuse treatment program unless a health care provider determined it was not needed.
Pillen’s one-page veto letter came just hours after LB 319 had gained 32 of the 25 votes needed at the time to move it to the governor’s desk. Pillen contended that the bill would create “loopholes” where “habitual offenders” could evade treatment.
“Individuals that distribute or sell illicit drugs should not be entitled to taxpayer-funded benefits,” the governor wrote. “Any illegal drug users should be required to complete treatment before they receive their third felony conviction.”
Among those who consistently opposed Rountree’s bill and supported the veto were State Sen. Tony Sorrentino of the Elkhorn area. He fended off colleagues’ criticisms that withholding food as a punishment is “barbaric” and said he was “very comfortable about being uncomfortable” in this situation.

“I’m never going to stop standing up for the victims of these crimes,” he said.
Meanwhile, nonprofits and people affected by the ban voiced disappointment.
Derrick Martinez, a Nebraskan who is SNAP banned, said of today’s action: “We continued on a path doing the same thing that may keep people reoffending out of survival. It’s time to do something better, because the old way has not worked.”
The vote shift by seven Republican legislators who last week voted for the bill came despite being called out by supporters of the bill. The seven: State Sens. Christy Armendariz of Omaha, Stan Clouse of Kearney, Rob Dover of Norfolk, Glen Meyer of Pender, Mike Moser of Columbus; Rita Sanders of Bellevue and Brad von Gillern of Omaha. 
State Sen. John Fredrickson of Omaha said he had never cast a vote based on “fear” of reprisal or political consequences from another elected official.
He said that if LB 319 was a good policy last week, why isn’t it today? He asked colleagues to honor the role the Legislature has as a separate branch of government. 
“We were elected to lead, not to follow, and certainly not to flinch,” Fredrickson said.
State Sen. Margo Juarez of Omaha affirmed her support for the bill and addressed a comment directly to Pillen: “Do you not consider this a pro-life issue? Do you really support life?”
Clouse, of his flip, said he was about “50-50” for the bill before and that the governor’s decision pushed him to the other side.
Said Meyer, “I’m not inclined to override the governor’s veto.” He said he also was swayed after learning later about a federal option that could be available to those the bill sought to help.

Armendariz said she had reservations earlier, and voted against the bill during the initial two rounds of debate. She said she didn’t feel strongly enough for the legislation to go against the governor’s will.
Among Republican lawmakers who stood by their earlier vote to support LB 319 was State Sen. Mike Jacobson of North Platte, who said he had asked Rountree earlier to bolster the bill with a treatment-related requirement, and that Rountree followed through.
Jacobson, in voting to override the veto, said he doubted that many of his colleagues have ever dealt with a friend or loved one suffering from a serious addiction. Because he has, he said that he understands there is no cure — only a vigilant commitment and regimen to stay clean.
“I’ve been around addiction,” Jacobson said. “I would encourage some of you to do the same to really understand why addiction exists.”
State Sen. Sen Megan Hunt of Omaha and others noted that lifting the ban would affect people who had long ago served their sentence related to drugs.
“In Nebraska, this is the only crime where somebody can do their time, pay their debt to society, do their treatment, pay their fines, do everything that the judge, the jury, and the law says that they’re supposed to do —  but they pay the price legally for the rest of their life,” Hunt said.

State Sen. Danielle Conrad of Lincoln was among those who talked about “smart justice reform,” noting that SNAP benefits help keep recidivism rates low.
State Sen. Bob Andersen of Sarpy County, who opposed the bill from the start, said such support services should be left to private philanthropists and churches.
Rountree — who opened the discussion by calling it a “historic moment” and opportunity to take care of Nebraskans — said he was disappointed for the people of the state and the 1,000 or so who would have benefited by the legislation that had law enforcement support.
Also a minister, Rountree, in an interview with the Nebraska Examiner, called support for the veto a “sign of the times” — government moving  away from taking care of “the least of these.”
Versions of LB 319 have been proposed in years past. Hunt said she has presented one every year since becoming a state senator.
Said Rountree: “These are challenging times for legislation like this. It doesn’t mean we’re going to give up.”



Nonprofits weigh in
Nonprofits in Nebraska that work with inmates reentering society after incarceration said state lawmakers “got it wrong today.”
“When the government continues to make felony convictions and restrictions with no reprieve for anyone who has honestly worked to rebuild their lives, it shows us how out of touch our elected officials are,” said Jasmine Harris, public policy director for one such nonprofit, RISE.
She said to ensure successful reentry, barriers to basic needs must be removed. “Otherwise, people find themselves in predicaments that continue these cycles of incarceration and addiction.”
Eric Savaiano, food and nutrition access manager for Nebraska Appleseed, said that ending the SNAP ban is about ensuring a basic human need. “We won’t stop fighting for this until this ban is gone. It is too important.”
Mindy Rush Chipman, executive director of the ACLU of Nebraska, said no one benefits from the Monday vote.
“The SNAP ban will keep making life harder for struggling Nebraskans, adding food insecurity to the mix of collateral consequences that are already hurting them and their families long after their sentence ended,” she said.

When the Trump administration cut funding for a program that gave food banks money to buy and distribute food from local farmers, Minnesota lawmakers decided to continue the program at the state level. 
The two-year, $115 million state agriculture budget has been approved by the House and Senate and is awaiting the signature of Gov. Tim Walz, and sets up a modest state program to replace the one cut by the federal government.
But Second Harvest Heartland, the biggest hunger relief organization in the state, says the budget still partially defunds the Farm to Food Shelf program, which allowed Second Harvest to purchase excess produce from Minnesota farmers at a steep discount. (The budget boosts funding for a related program for dairy.)
Rep. Fue Lee, DFL-Minneapolis, carried a bill to create a state program that mirrors the endangered federal Local Food Purchase Assistance Cooperative Agreement Program. Schools, food banks, governments and businesses can apply for grants to purchase food from Minnesota farmers and distribute it for free. Grant recipients must purchase 70% of the food from small farms — those that bring in less than $100,000 per year — or from farmers who rent their land. 
Lee’s bill ended up in the budget, with $1.4 million over two years directed to the Local Food Purchasing Assistance grant program — around half as much as the federal government gave to Minnesota last year for the program.
Minnesota Farmers Union, Land Stewardship Project and Minnesota Farmers Market Association were among the bill’s supporters. 
Zach Rodvold, a lobbyist for Second Harvest Heartland, said the net effect of the budget is a cut in overall food assistance — on top of other federal cuts to food aid, as well as proposed cuts to SNAP, which helps low-income people buy groceries.
“What they voted for was a cut that will cost almost 4 million pounds of produce every year indefinitely,” Rodvold said. 
That’s partly because the dollars that went to the Farm to Food Shelf program stretched farther — the food banks were paying pennies on the dollar for produce that farmers didn’t intend to sell in traditional markets. The new state program, called the Local Food Purchasing Assistance grant program, pays farmers the market price for their produce. 
The Local Food Purchasing Assistance grant program will also allow recipients to contract with farmers for future production, creating a secure market for small Minnesota farmers.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Minneapolis-farm-182961853-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-19 21:01:18.078812

(Photo by Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)A provision to let pipeline companies bypass state permitters is expected to be stripped from the “big, beautiful” federal budget reconciliation bill, but anti-pipeline activists want Congress to kill a carbon tax credit program before they pass the bill along to President Donald Trump.
That was the message from a group of South Dakota carbon dioxide pipeline opponents during a virtual press conference Monday. Representatives from Dakota Rural Action, the South Dakota Property Rights and Local Control Alliance, and the South Dakota Stockgrowers Association joined the call.
Last week, groups in the anti-carbon pipeline camp raised alarms about the reconciliation bill over a provision tucked within its 1,100 pages. It would have given the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission exclusive authority to issue licenses for pipelines carrying natural gas, carbon dioxide, hydrogen, oil or other energy products and byproducts.
Is Congress trampling on state laws protecting property rights against pipelines?

The state permitting process has been a political minefield for a proposed carbon pipeline from Summit Carbon Solutions that would traverse parts of Iowa, Nebraska, Minnesota and South Dakota, collecting carbon from ethanol plants on its way to a North Dakota sequestration site. The South Dakota Public Utilities Commission has rejected the project twice.
South Dakota Republican Gov. Larry Rhoden signed a bill into law in March banning the use of eminent domain by carbon pipeline companies, stripping Summit of the potential use of state court condemnation actions to build beneath land owned by project opponents.
Anticipated removal of federal provision to preempt state regulators
Critics said the federal permitting provision in the reconciliation bill would have allowed Summit to preempt state-level regulations.
The bill passed through a House committee Sunday night. President Trump has called it a “big, beautiful bill” chock full of tax breaks and cuts to wasteful spending; opponents have decried it as a plan to carve large swaths of the citizenry out of programs such as Medicaid. The complex budget reconciliation process allows the majority party to pass legislation with simple majorities in both chambers, avoiding the U.S. Senate’s usual 60-vote requirement.
The federal pipeline preemption provision will be removed in the House Rules Committee on Wednesday morning, according to Kristen Blakely, who works for U.S. Rep. Dusty Johnson, R-South Dakota.
Opponents of the Summit project celebrated that news on the Monday press call.
“It was good to see that they removed the federal siting authority,” said Republican state Sen. Joy Hohn of Hartford.

 Iowa lawmaker reacts
Rep. Charley Thomson, R-Charles City, who has supported eminent domain reform in Iowa and led a group of lawmakers opposed to the pipeline, said it was “good news” the language will be removed.
“I’m very glad to see that, and I think it was not a smart move to put it in there,” Thomson said. “It reeks of desperation.”
Last week the Iowa Legislature approved Thomson’s bill to restrict the use of eminent domain for CO2 pipelines and to offer protections to surrounding landowners.
Thomson said he is “hopeful” Gov. Kim Reynolds, who hasn’t weighed in on the issue, will sign the bill.
“Given that at a minimum, 80% of Iowa supports what’s in the bill, I think it’d be the smart thing to do,” Thomson said, referencing a survey from earlier this year assessing opposition to the use of eminent domain by private corporations to build pipelines.
Thomson said despite critiques of the bill from senators who opposed it on the floor, the bill does a “good thing” and codifies current regulation surrounding pipelines into state statute.

Pipeline opponents remain concerned about one other provision that remains in the bill. It would let pipeline companies pay the federal government $10 million for an “expedited environmental review” lasting one year, with a possible extension of up to six months. The current federal review process can take years. Under the provision, an expedited review’s results would not be appealable.
Summit doesn’t need that level of environmental review, though other pipelines – like the controversial Dakota Access crude oil pipeline that Hohn fought to prevent nearly a decade ago – do need them.
Blakely told Searchlight that the expedited environmental review no longer applies to any carbon pipelines, as it was tied to the now-scuttled preemption provision for permits.
Anti-pipeline groups: Johnson should think of governor’s race
Hohn was elected on a landowner rights platform and helped shepherd the eminent domain ban through the statehouse.
Summit’s business model hinges on the company’s intended collection of billions in 45Q tax credits for companies that sequester carbon, keeping it from contributing to climate change.
Hohn and the others on hand for Monday’s press conference want to see Rep. Johnson push for the elimination of that program, which has existed for decades and was beefed up through former President Joe Biden’s Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act.
“We are calling for Rep. Johnson to die on this hill,” said Chase Jensen of Dakota Rural Action, who called the notion of 45Q credits surviving in a U.S. Capitol transfixed by talk of wasteful spending “insane.”
Ed Fischbach, a board member of Dakota Rural Action, called the 45Q program “nothing but corporate welfare.”
Dennis Fieckert of the South Dakota Property Rights and Local Control Alliance suggested that Johnson’s potential entry into the 2026 South Dakota gubernatorial contest would start off on the wrong foot without a push to end 45Q.
Hohn was one of several state lawmakers who earned their office last year through opposition to eminent domain for carbon pipelines. In that same election, South Dakota voters shot down a law passed by state lawmakers in 2024 that would have granted landowners additional rights but also cleared a path for permitting by Summit.
Rep. Johnson “knows what’s going on here in South Dakota,” Feickert said, adding, “He needs to step up.”
Blakely, Johnson’s spokeswoman, pointed out that the reconciliation bill would alter the tax credit program by limiting access to companies that begin construction within two years of the bill’s enactment. The bill also restricts access to credits by taxpaying companies that are “specified foreign entities” like Chinese defense companies, or taxpaying companies influenced by those entities.
As far as the notion of eliminating 45Q, a statement from Johnson said he’s still working with his colleagues to make the “big, beautiful bill” a “more conservative” piece of legislation.
“I’ve been on the frontlines to help eliminate ridiculous portions of the Inflation Reduction Act, like EV chargers and other Green New Deal policies,” Johnson said.
Jensen, of Dakota Rural Action, said the credits in 45Q didn’t originate with the Green New Deal, the name attached to a set of policies promoted by some of Congress’ more liberal members. The tax credits originated under a bill signed by President George W. Bush in 2008, and were expanded by President Trump during his first term in office before President Biden’s infrastructure bill expanded them further.
“Our congressman continues to make it sound like this is about getting rid of the Green New Deal, and that this is Biden’s fault, but in reality, this is a bipartisan agenda that we are trying to get rid of,” Jensen said.

(Micah Drew/Daily Montanan)Midway through May, the top of Glacier National Park’s Logan Pass was shrouded in white.
Monday morning, thin clouds obscured the prominent peaks that guard the Continental Divide, rime ice coated the treetops visible above the snowpack, and snow drifts piled up to the roof of the visitor’s center. On top of a winter’s worth of compacted snow sat a fresh inch or so of powder from the weekend’s storm.
These are the current conditions at the top of the Going-to-the-Sun Road, the iconic alpine highway that bisects the park and during the summer will see hundreds of thousands of visitors a month.
But on Monday, the only people at the pass were a gaggle of media members, four avalanche forecasters, heavy equipment operators and Glacier’s communications team.

“People are just waiting breathlessly for this road to open,” Glacier spokesperson Gina Icenoggle told the Daily Montanan. “Once the road is plowed, the side rails are installed, the visitor center is ready and potable water is available up here, we’ll open it up.”
But that day could be a ways off.
Park officials always refrain from giving an estimated opening date for the Sun Road, due to the variability of late spring conditions at higher elevations.
But data from the previous 92 years since the road opened tells a story of opening dates trending slightly later in the summer.
The average opening date for vehicles to traverse the length of the 50-mile scenic corridor is June 11, but that has trended later in recent decades. The average opening date since 2000 has been June 21, while since 2010 it has been closer to June 26 — due to three mid-July openings, one of which occurred due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Going-to-the-Sun Road hasn’t opened to vehicles in May since 2005.
The monumental task of preparing the serpentine highway for visitors usually begins in March, when snow in the lower valleys begins to melt. On the west side of the Park, a crew of around a dozen, including avalanche forecasters and heavy equipment operators, plow, scoop and dump thousands of tons of snow each day.
Typically, the process begins with a dozer to cut down on the snowpack until it’s only a few feet from the road bed. Rotary snow plows do the bulk of the work at that point, but at certain parts of the road it becomes an all-hands-on-deck operation.
The Big Drift, a one-mile stretch just east of Logan Pass, is known for accumulating up to 80 feet of snow throughout the winter and requires a fleet of excavators and bobcats to punch through.
Because of the steep cliffside nature of the Going-to-the-Sun Road, avalanches are common throughout the spring and early summer, occasionally requiring road crews to double back to stretches of road they’ve previously cleared.
The work can be incredibly dangerous. In 1953, a massive avalanche tumbled down the mountainside into one of the road crews, killing two members, including the foreman, George Beaton.
“It’s a lot safer than it used to be,” said Brian Paul, the park’s road supervisor, due to a team of avalanche forecasters that are part of the crew.
Four avalanche forecasters work in shifts to provide the most accurate data for the road crews, checking overnight temperatures and weather patterns, digging snow pits, and monitoring snowpack along the mountain ridges above the highway. Two forecasters work for the National Park Service, and two are employed by the U. S. Geological Survey.
Every morning, the forecasters on duty will start working around 4:30 to look at what the weather did overnight. They’ll gather data from nearby weather stations and models for the day and put out an internal forecast for park personnel. At 6 a.m., the forecasters will brief the road crew on the day’s conditions, including what parts of the road might be avalanche prone.
“It’s been more of a typical avalanche season year on the Sun Road,” said Erich Peitzch, a USGS snow scientist who manages the park service’s avalanche program and has been forecasting in Glacier since 2007. “We usually get, at some point, a late season snow storm where, you know, it’ll put more avalanche debris on the road.”
During the weekend, new snow triggered a slide on the west side of the Park, shoving 12 feet of debris across the road — a “pretty small avalanche” by Glacier standards, Peitzch said.
“For now, things are relatively stable, but we’re still in the mountains, and the road still passes through dozens of avalanche chutes. And the road is what we call a terrain trap — snow will just pile up when an avalanche comes down and it can get pretty deep.”

After road crews finish clearing snow, and debris, off the road, a series of guardrails are installed along the outer edge of the highway. Eventually, water will flow back to the visitor’s center, the bathrooms will be cleaned and ready and the Park will accept cars along the full length of Going-to-the-Sun Road.

Until then, hikers and bikers are allowed on both the east and west side of Going-to-the-Sun Road past the marked vehicle closures. Hiker/Biker closures are in place on weekdays until 4 p.m., after which visitors can continue up the road until reaching the avalanche hazard closure. Going past the avalanche closures is punishable by a $5,000 fine and as long as six months in jail. The latest conditions for the road can be viewed online.
And while no one can say for certain when visitors will be able to drive up to Logan Pass this summer, park officials assure the public it will be as soon as safely possible.
“So many surrounding businesses and the local economy counts on this road being open,” Icenoggle said. “When it’s go time, it’s go time.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Glacier_Plow-1024x651.jpg,,,2025-05-19 20:04:27.936559

A lightning strike during a severe storm caused significant damage to the South Sheridan Water Treatment Plant, according to a press release issued by the city Sunday. The lightning strike resulted in a fire that caused “extensive damage” to the facility, including a “total loss of power at the plant.” 
The guardsmen from the 39th Infantry Brigade Combat Team are using a 400-gallon mobile water tank, known as a water buffalo, to distribute water at the Tractor Supply located at 1695 Rock St. in Sheridan.
Residents need to provide their own containers, and guardsmen will refill the water buffalo as many times as needed at Sheridan Water Works, according to the release.

The slate of bills signed is the first action on legislation Reynolds has taken since the 2025 legislative session adjourned Thursday. However, these are not the first bills she has signed this year — the governor has already signed into law several measures, including high-profile laws like the ban on using cellphones while driving outside of handsfree or voice-activated modes, and the removal of gender identity from the Iowa Civil Rights Act.
There are still many other measures awaiting Reynolds’ signature that passed this session. The governor has until June 14 — 30 days from the end of session — to sign bills passed this year into law. Measures she does not sign during this period are considered a “pocket veto” and do not become law.

Here are some of the bills Reynolds signed Monday:
K-12 public school funding
Iowa lawmakers sent Reynolds Senate File 167, the State Supplemental Aid (SSA) rate for the 2025-2026 school year, in April. The legislation came to the governor much later than in many previous years — the Legislature has a self-imposed deadline to pass the SSA rate for the upcoming school year within 30 days of the governor’s budget being released in January, though there is no penalty for failing to meet this target.
This year, House and Senate Republicans reached an agreement setting the SSA rate for the upcoming school year at 2%, an increase of $157 per K-12 student for the per-pupil funding mechanism for Iowa schools. The bill also included some funding components for Iowa schools that Republicans said will help address inequities with rural school district funding, including a $5 bump to the State Cost Per Pupil (SCPP) and a 5% increase to the rate of funding per pupil to the transportation equity fund.
Democrats said the 2% rate will not provide enough funding for schools, saying that 159 Iowa school districts will be on the budget guarantee for the upcoming school year — a process that increases local property taxes when school districts’ funding needs are not met by state aid.
Anti-SLAPP protections
The governor also signed House File 472 into law, a measure targeting “strategic lawsuits against public participation,” also known as SLAPP lawsuits. SLAPP cases are civil lawsuits filed by businesses, individuals or organizations against news organizations and activists that are typically a means to try to silence these entities from publishing stories or making public statements about a specific topic. The lawsuits are not filed necessarily with the intention to win in court, but as a means to draw down time and money from the people being sued to prevent them from continuing to report or talk about a subject.
The law is a way to provide protections for defendants in these cases by giving courts the ability to grant expedited relief in cases involving First Amendment rights, like the freedoms of speech and press.
This is a bill that has come up in multiple previous legislative sessions, but did not receive Senate approval until this year. Discussions in Iowa started on SLAPP lawsuits after a 2018 case in which a Carroll police officer sued the Carroll Times Herald when the newspaper reported he had sexual relationships with teenagers — information the officer confirmed was true. The judge had dismissed the lawsuit, but the Carroll Times Herald accrued more than $100,000 in legal fees, nearly putting the paper out of business.
Local restrictions on fireworks
Senate File 303 prevents Iowa cities and counties from prohibiting or limiting the use of fireworks on July 3, 4 and Dec. 31.
Iowans must still follow state laws regulating the use of fireworks, like a ban on fireworks sales to minors or the use of “display” fireworks without local permission, during these three days. However, other further restrictions could not be set by local jurisdictions.
Several cities in Iowa, like Des Moines, Ames and Iowa City, have more restrictions or total bans on the use of fireworks that would no longer be enforceable on these three days. Local rules could still be enforced during other periods when fireworks are permitted for legal use by the state — from June 1 through July 8 and Dec. 10 through Jan. 3 of each year.
During floor debate on the bill, Republican lawmakers supporting the measure said this change was necessary to allow Iowans to fully participate in the the country’s 250th anniversary, referring to President Donald Trump’s idea to begin celebrations at the Iowa State Fair for the “Great American State Fair” from Memorial Day 2025 to July 4, 2026.

Moscow residents gathered Saturday to unite against Christian nationalism, the third such community-building event in seven months.
Titled, “United in Community,” the sold-out event’s aim was to bring people together to discuss democracy and the community’s future.
“After the first two gatherings, organizers received emails and comments asking ‘what can we do?’” said Joann Muneta, chair of the Latah County Human Rights Task Force.

Saturday’s event aimed to answer that question.
“So I want us to kind of dig in and try to see if we can understand this phenomenon (Christian nationalism), and particularly in the American context, and most importantly, equip you with some strategies to resist it while building the inclusive democracy,” said Political Strategist Scot Nakagawa, who keynoted the event.
 Moscow’s experience could have national significance

Nakagawa, who lives in Oregon, co-founded the 22nd Century Initiative, a national strategy center working to resist authoritarianism.
He emphasized that Moscow’s efforts have significance beyond the city’s limits.
“I think that it does have really broad national implications, and what you do here will be resonant throughout the country,” he said.
Moscow is home to Christ Church, whose members own about 20% of downtown Moscow’s buildings and operate various businesses locally, ranging from construction to restaurants. The church, led by Pastor Doug Wilson, is widely recognized as a significant force within the Christian nationalist movement in the United States.
Nakagawa noted that Christ Church and its affiliated congregations represent only 5% of Moscow’s population, yet wield disproportionate influence.
“… There is this kind of message about minority rule that I think is really resonant with most people in the United States,” he said, adding that many local businesses have been displaced as the church bought buildings and made them unavailable to other enterprises.
While Moscow’s situation may seem unique, Nakagawa argued it reflects broader trends occurring worldwide.
He framed the rise of Christian nationalism as part of a global phenomenon affecting multiple religions, not just an isolated American issue. He cited what scholars call the “multiple modernities crisis” — the collision between ancient faith traditions and the dislocating forces of globalization, digital information systems and rapid cultural change.
These forces, he said, are causing people to feel culturally displaced while driving economic insecurity and inequality worldwide.
“Digital technology has shattered traditional gatekeepers of religious knowledge. Anyone now with a smartphone can claim prophetic authority,” Nakagawa explained, noting how this democratization of religious interpretation has also unleashed authoritarian voices.
He described theocratic movements as offering “promises of restored order” and “easy answers and divine protection” to people whose traditional communities feel under assault from rapid economic change.
 Building coalitions across ideological differences and creating alliances

Nakagawa outlined several strategies for how to fight theocracy in Moscow. He advocated for building coalitions across ideological differences, and creating unlikely alliances around shared democratic values.
He also stressed the importance of local electoral engagement.
“Run candidates for school boards, state legislatures and courts and particularly for small offices,” he said, noting that people in those positions “can drive transparency and public participation in a way that could restore or build trust in those institutions by making them accountable.”
After the keynote, attendees heard from local organizations who are committed to supporting an inclusive region. They were also given a list of these organizations; about 30 groups were listed.

The Rev. Mary Jane Miles from the Nez Perce Tribe, and a Presbyterian pastor, addressed the gathering about overcoming division through understanding rather than contempt.
Miles, who recently stepped down from the Nez Perce Tribal Executive Committee after turning 85, shared her perspective on battling hatred with a different approach.
“Contempt is no match for love,” she said.
Miles emphasized that practicing kindness can become transformative.
“It’s hard to be nice if I hate you, but once you get into the practice of being nice, it grows on you,” she told the audience.
She also highlighted gratitude as a powerful tool for change.
“Gratitude is a contempt killer. The key to being nicer and happier is gratitude,” she said.
Miles connected this message to the broader American promise, saying, “We are always promised life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. I love that pursuit of happiness, and that’s what we are doing here. We want to go back to the pursuit of happiness and have a happy life together with each other.”
After hearing from Miles and other supporters, attendees dispersed into breakout sessions, including “addressing theocracy,” “supporting public schools,” and “finding common ground.” FāVS was not permitted to attend these sessions, so that guests could have privacy.
Dale Gentry, who helped organize the event, said the hope was that through these breakouts, the community could come up with next steps.
United in Community was organized by the Latah County Human Rights Task Force and the United Church of Moscow. Saturday’s event was a follow up to the United Against Hate Summit in September 2024 and a presentation on Religious Extremism in December 2024.

(Photo illustration via Getty Images)Frustration. Defeat. Uncertainty about whether they will be able to complete their goals. These are some of the feelings University of Iowa Student Body President Thomas Knudsen said fellow UI student have expressed to him as they watch tuition and fees rise along with many other expenses.
Knudsen, a junior at the UI, shared stories Monday with the Iowa Board of Regents of students trying to find ways to make ends meet. He said in the years since he first enrolled at the university, the cost of attendance has risen by about $1,200.
“We know these decisions are not made lightly, and we understand that maintaining a high quality education requires resources, but it’s essential to remember that behind these numbers are real students,” Knudsen said.
Student leaders who spoke to the Iowa Board of Regents called for transparency, consistency and investment in Iowa’s future, rather than placing more cost burdens on those who will ensure it. The board received the universities’ proposed tuition and fee increases last month for the upcoming academic year and will vote on whether to approve them in June.
Each of the state’s public universities will implement tuition and fee increases under the proposal, with the UI and Iowa State University planning 3% tuition increases for in-state, undergraduate students and the University of Northern Iowa offering a 2.7% increase for the same population.

If approved, the increase at the UI would add $279 to tuition, Knudsen said. While it doesn’t seem like too much for one year, he said for many students “it’s the difference between pursuing a four-year degree or pursuing some sort of alternative option.”
He urged the board, if the tuition increases are approved, to be transparent with students as to where their money is going, prioritize support for low-income and first-generation students and keep advocating for increased funding from the state.
“Tuition should not always be the go-to solution when budgets are tight,” Knudsen said. “When higher education is a public good, it deserves consistent support from the state.”
Gabriel Salazar, UNI student body vice president, said rising costs won’t just impact current students, but could damage enrollment and overall draw to the state. About 80% of UNI graduates stay in Iowa after completing their studies, Salazar said, and even a couple hundred dollars could be the difference between students choosing to come to Iowa, driving success in the state, or going somewhere else.
“Every cent put into our universities is an investment in our state’s current economy and future prosperity,” Salazar said. “If the cost of education continues to rise, it can lead to students leaving to another state where they would miss out on the quality education that our fine regents institutions have to offer.”
This applies to graduate and professional students as well as undergraduates, said Airiana Mohr, incoming vice president of UI Graduate & Professional Student Government. She asked the board to keep tuition flat for the upcoming academic year to help students dealing with the uncertainty of federal funding and other impacts to their work.
Both Mohr and Muhammad Azhan, representing graduate and professional students at ISU, pointed out that graduate and professional students often have additional costs to consider, like families, transportation and more. Graduate students also contribute immense amounts of work to their institutions, Azhan said.
Azhan said he and other students are asking the board for a pause in hiking costs in order to consider other options for keeping universities going without asking for more from students to do so.
“Preserving accessibility means more than … staying below the national average, it means ensuring that students can realistically afford to live based on their income and thrive here in Iowa, to contribute to the Iowa workforce,” Azhan said. “If you want to remain competitive and continue attracting top talent from across the country and around the world, we must recognize that affordability is one of the most important factors in recruitment and retention.”
Board moves ahead with Wintersteen retirement
The board also voted Monday to accept ISU President Wendy Wintersteen’s intention to retire and begin the process of searching for a new university head.
After more than 45 years at ISU and nine serving as its president, Wintersteen announced May 16 she plans to retire in January 2026. Board President Sherry Bates said in the Monday meeting Wintersteen’s efforts while heading ISU have maintained the institution’s place as one of the top land-grant universities in the U.S.
With the board’s approval, Iowa Board of Regents Executive Director Mark Braun will begin the process of finding a firm to conduct the search for Wintersteen’s replacement, form a search committee and develop a timetable for the search.
“Obviously, this isn’t President Wintersteen’s last meeting, and we look forward to continuing to work with her as we begin the transition to ISU’s next leader, but as her time winds down, I want to publicly acknowledge how much she has meant to our board and the state of Iowa,” Bates said. “She has been a tremendous president for ISU, and we will miss her greatly. I, along with past and current board members, have greatly enjoyed working with her and wish her well in her retirement.”

Greg Gianforte.
Sen. Willis Curdy, D-Missoula, said Monday he had worked on Senate Bill 390 for several sessions with support from youth advocates and public health workers.
“This is long overdue,” Curdy said.
The law now defines “smoking,” which is prohibited indoors, to include using an electronic smoking device.
The bill was one of a couple pieces of legislation in 2025 tied to the Montana Clean Indoor Air Act. However, Senate Bill 150, to create an exemption in the act that allowed for cigar rooms, failed in its last vote during the legislative session.
 ‘A matter of perseverance’ 
Curdy said SB 390 was near and dear to him as a former high school teacher, and he and former legislator Fred Anderson, a Great Falls Republican and school principal, had talked about the effects on youth.
“I got some support from folks — quite a bit of support from folks — who had in the past opposed the bill,” Curdy said.
He said some previous opponents came around after “an epiphany with their own health,” and others after learning about the negative health consequences of e-cigarettes and vape pens.
Curdy also said more work needs to be done to strengthen the Montana Clean Indoor Air Act, and he is interested in additional legislation, although he declined to cite specifics Monday.
However, he said persistence at the Montana Legislature paid off with SB 390.
“It was a matter of perseverance,” Curdy said.
 Cigar bar bill failed, but will return 
After clearing the Senate, a bill that would have created an exception in the Montana Clean Indoor Air Act for cigar rooms failed in the House in its last vote after some representatives changed their votes.
Sponsored by Sen. Wylie Galt, R-Martinsdale, the bill passed the House on second reading with 51 votes, but then it failed with only 45 votes in support on third reading.
The bill was backed by the tourism and hospitality industry, and supporters argued Montana is at a disadvantage as a luxury destination because it cannot offer a place where cigar aficionados can legally smoke indoors.
Public health advocates opposed the bill, pointing to detrimental effects of second-hand smoke. Some also alleged the bill would run contrary to an agreement made when Montana first passed the Clean Indoor Air Act in 2005 but gave bars four years to comply.
Originally, the bill would have allowed cigar bars in standalone structures, but it was amended to create an exception for cigar rooms with separate ventilation instead.
Galt said Monday he believes that change, along with an amendment that included a study related to gambling machines and opposed by the industry, might have ended up sinking the bill.
Galt has worked on the bill for many sessions, and he earlier said cigar bars are legal in many other states. He said Monday he’ll continue to pursue the opportunity for Montana.
“I do intend on running it again next session with some of the amendments we worked on,” Galt said in a text message Monday. “Tenth year may be my lucky year.”
Jackie Semmens, with the American Heart Association, had opposed SB 150 during the Montana Legislature.
Semmens said Monday an amendment in the House Business and Labor Committee “would have essentially brought back smoking sections to Montana bars.”
But she said “there is no safe level of second-hand smoke,” and she believes the change might have contributed to the demise of the bill.
“This really upset our members, who called their legislators to ask them to vote ‘no’ on SB 150,” said Semmens, government relations director for Montana for the association. “Montanans by and large don’t want to return to the days of smoking in bars.”
However, in a phone call and email, Semmens also praised the addition of e-cigarettes to the Clean Indoor Air Act.
“We believe that the addition of e-cigarettes to the Clean Indoor Air Act was an important update to the law given the youth vaping epidemic,” Semmens said. “Nicotine in any form is an addictive drug, and we want to send a clear message to youth in Montana that vaping is not safe for you or for people around you.
“We also hope this will inspire more interest in what else Montana can do to help curb the youth vaping epidemic.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/E_Cigarettes_Ego_Vaporizers_and_Box_Mods_17679064871.jpg,,,2025-05-19 20:04:27.936559

An official with the state’s emergency response agency worried about costs if a wildfire, tornado or any other disaster were to devastate a small Wyoming town.
The post Proposed FEMA change could leave Wyoming towns in trouble when disasters damage public infrastructure appeared first on WyoFile .","In an effort to slash spending by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, White House officials are considering drastically raising the threshold for how much damage a natural disaster must cause before local governments will qualify for federal help rebuilding. 
Under the new proposed criteria, Wyoming’s state and local governments wouldn’t have been eligible for federal compensation for public infrastructure losses in recent disasters of note — including last year’s historic wildfires and flooding in 2023 and 2017 — an official with the Wyoming Department of Homeland Security told a state legislative committee Monday. 
Under the current calculation, a disaster has to do more than $1.1 million in damage to public infrastructure before Wyoming can turn to the federal government for help. President Donald Trump’s administration is considering changing that threshold to $4.4 million, according to an internal memo reported on by CNN.
Wyoming, with its wide open spaces, reaches the current threshold much less often than more crowded and urban states, where wildfires, hurricanes and other natural disasters can damage swathes of infrastructure quickly.

The most recent example is last August’s wildfires in northeastern Wyoming. Those fires cost the state tens of millions of dollars to fight, and did tens of millions of dollars more in damage to ranch land and other private property. In the grand scheme of those costs, public infrastructure losses were relatively slight, Ashley Paulsrud, the Wyoming Department of Homeland Security’s finance section chief, told WyoFile. 
The fires burned the power lines and poles of a rural electric company, Paulsrud said, and the price tag for damage extended above $1.1 million, but remained considerably below $2 million. Then-President Joe Biden awarded the federal disaster designation last year, covering the utility’s rebuilding cost.
But Paulsrud worried about what could occur if a wildfire, tornado or any other disaster were to devastate one of Wyoming’s small or medium towns. The disaster could cause immense destruction to towns with limited municipal budgets, while still not doing enough damage to hit the federal government’s proposed new threshold. That might leave the town reliant on the state to cover rebuilding costs. 
The prospect that Wyoming could be shut out of federal relief in such a case is “pretty scary,” Paulsrud told the Joint Judiciary Committee on Monday during its meeting in Torrington. It is just one area in which the Trump administration’s efforts to slash federal spending could cut into her office’s work in Wyoming, Paulsrud said.

The Wyoming Department of Homeland Security receives 92% of its funding from the federal government, Paulsrud said. It is also the administrator of federal grant programs that fund emergency service personnel for local governments. Many of those funding streams are in doubt, Paulsrud said. Normally at this point in the year, the agency would have insight into its funding for the coming one, she said, but the state has not received word on those grants.
Trump and U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem have been critical of FEMA and have promised to dramatically reduce the agency’s funding. So far, the proposals floated publicly indicate they propose to do so by shifting the cost burden for recovering from disasters to the states impacted by them. 
The move to raise the threshold for public assistance funding comes as Trump has rejected providing federal disaster designations to at least three states already during his second term, according to CNN. Trump rejected a request from Washington state for a major disaster declaration in the wake of a destructive winter storm last year. He also rejected requests from Arkansas and Kentucky for the designation in the wake of severe storms and tornadoes that killed more than 40 people across four states and ravaged some towns.
In Wyoming, last year’s wildfire season was particularly severe and drained nearly all of the state’s disaster response coffers. Gov. Mark Gordon used virtually all of the funds available to him for emergencies to respond to the disasters, he told lawmakers ahead of the 2025 legislative session. 
Legislators restored that emergency funding and granted the governor the ability to draw up to $30 million from the state’s rainy day fund if future wildfires draw those accounts down again. They also created both a grant and a loan program to help impacted ranchers recover. Those discussions were contentious during the legislative session, with many lawmakers reluctant to create a grant program that would help property owners and businesses recover from the wildfires.  
Wyoming is one of five western states without a state-funded disaster recovery program to address calamities that do not meet the requirements for federal disaster assistance.
Paulsrud told lawmakers her department may ask for a significant increase in state funding this year, given the possibility Wyoming won’t be able to count on the federal government for future disaster relief. “Most likely our budget ask will be a lot different this year,” she said.

(Michael Achterling/North Dakota Monitor)Progressive North Dakotans who brainstormed ideas for the next legislative session want lawmakers to focus on three areas: strong schools, economic security and personal freedom.
About 40 people broke into small groups at the North Dakota Heritage Center on Friday to discuss what they believe are the most pressing issues facing the state. The discussion was part of a community-led event called the People’s Session.
Erin Oban, a former Democratic state senator and teacher, said students going through the K-12 system have vastly different needs.
“There is strong public support for our public schools,” Oban said. “The challenge is that is not necessarily reflected in the decision-making process and funding that is coming, particularly from the state level.”
She added teachers are being underfunded and some have needed to take second jobs to make ends meet.
“We think that is horrible and quite a reflection on how we value teaching as a profession,” she said.

Barry Nelson, a community organizer for the North Dakota Human Rights Coalition, told event attendees that pre-K and early childhood education in the state need to be expanded.
About 62,000 kids in North Dakota are under age 6, but there are only about 38,000 licensed early childhood education slots in the state, he said. 
“The data shows that effective early childhood education increases income, reduces poverty, reduces teenage pregnancies and boosts economic productivity,” Nelson said.
Other education suggestions included creating incentives for businesses to hire international students who study in North Dakota to keep them in-state after they graduate. It also was suggested that North Dakota, in coordination with the federal government, should be able to issue a certain amount of work visas to international graduates.
Another attendee suggested addressing a shortage of lawyers with student loan forgiveness for North Dakota law school graduates and other professions if they stay in the state for five years.
Other policy suggestions included taxing out-of-state interests at a higher rate than North Dakota residents or businesses, raising the minimum wage to a livable wage and prohibiting businesses from paying tipped workers below minimum wage.
Progressive groups plan ‘People’s Session’ to set North Dakota priorities for future legislation

Those speaking on personal freedom wanted more pushback against the state’s abortion law and other laws targeting gender-affirming care or health care-related issues.
Advocacy organizations hosting the event included the North Dakota Human Rights Coalition, Gender Justice, Prairie Action, American Civil Liberties Union of North Dakota and North Dakota AFL-CIO.
Dalton Erickson, executive director for the North Dakota Human Rights Coalition, said the state has a citizen Legislature, which means the common people are supposed to have their voices heard for 80 days in Bismarck, every two years.
He said one of the purposes of the event was not only to hear concerns from the public, but to better organize policy proposals ahead of the next legislative session in 2027. Erickson added they will put many of the suggestions into bill draft form over the next year and will revisit the issues in spring 2026.
“I think we have a lot of excited people and a lot of great ideas to work off of,” he said.

(Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)A provision to let pipeline companies bypass state permitters is expected to be stripped from the “big, beautiful” federal budget reconciliation bill, but anti-pipeline activists want Congress to kill a carbon tax credit program before they pass the bill along to President Donald Trump.
That was the message from a group of South Dakota carbon dioxide pipeline opponents during a virtual press conference Monday. Representatives from Dakota Rural Action, the South Dakota Property Rights and Local Control Alliance, and the South Dakota Stockgrowers Association joined the call.
Last week, groups in the anti-carbon pipeline camp raised alarms about the reconciliation bill over a provision tucked within its 1,100 pages. It would have given the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission exclusive authority to issue licenses for pipelines carrying natural gas, carbon dioxide, hydrogen, oil or other energy products and byproducts.
Is Congress trampling on state laws protecting property rights against pipelines?

The state permitting process has been a political minefield for a proposed carbon pipeline from Summit Carbon Solutions that would traverse parts of Iowa, Nebraska, Minnesota and South Dakota, collecting carbon from ethanol plants on its way to a North Dakota sequestration site. The South Dakota Public Utilities Commission has rejected the project twice.
South Dakota Republican Gov. Larry Rhoden signed a bill into law in March banning the use of eminent domain by carbon pipeline companies, stripping Summit of the potential use of state court condemnation actions to build beneath land owned by project opponents.
Anticipated removal of federal provision to preempt state regulators
Critics said the federal permitting provision in the reconciliation bill would’ve allowed Summit to preempt state-level regulations.
The bill passed through a House committee Sunday night. President Trump has called it a “big, beautiful bill” chock full of tax breaks and cuts to wasteful spending; opponents have decried it as a plan to carve large swaths of the citizenry out of entitlement programs such as Medicaid. The complex budget reconciliation process allows the majority party to pass legislation with simple majorities in both chambers, avoiding the U.S. Senate’s usual 60-vote requirement.
The federal pipeline preemption provision will be removed in the House Rules Committee on Wednesday morning, according to Kristen Blakely, who works for U.S. Rep. Dusty Johnson, R-South Dakota.
Opponents of the Summit project celebrated that news on the Monday press call.
“It was good to see that they removed the federal siting authority,” said Republican state Sen. Joy Hohn of Hartford.
Pipeline opponents remain concerned about one other provision that remains in the bill. It would let pipeline companies pay the federal government $10 million for an “expedited environmental review” lasting one year, with a possible extension of up to six months. The current federal review process can take years. Under the provision, an expedited review’s results would not be appealable.
Summit doesn’t need that level of environmental review, though other pipelines – like the controversial Dakota Access crude oil pipeline that Hohn fought to prevent nearly a decade ago – do need them.
Blakely told Searchlight that the expedited environmental review no longer applies to any carbon pipelines, as it was tied to the now-scuttled preemption provision for permits.
Anti-pipeline groups: Johnson should think of governor’s race
Hohn was elected on a landowner rights platform and helped shepherd the eminent domain ban through the statehouse.
Summit’s business model hinges on the company’s intended collection of billions in 45Q tax credits for companies that sequester carbon, keeping it from contributing to climate change.
Hohn and the others on hand for Monday’s press conference want to see Rep. Johnson push for the elimination of that program, which has existed for decades and was beefed up through former President Joe Biden’s Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act.
Race for South Dakota governor could be a race for Trump’s favor

“We are calling for Rep. Johnson to die on this hill,” said Chase Jensen of Dakota Rural Action, who called the notion of 45Q credits surviving in a U.S. Capitol transfixed by talk of wasteful spending “insane.”
Ed Fischbach, a board member of Dakota Rural Action, called the 45Q program “nothing but corporate welfare.”
Dennis Fieckert of the South Dakota Property Rights and Local Control Alliance suggested that Johnson’s potential entry into the 2026 South Dakota gubernatorial contest would start off on the wrong foot without a push to end 45Q.
Hohn was one of several state lawmakers who earned their office last year through opposition to eminent domain for carbon pipelines. In that same election, South Dakota voters shot down a law passed by state lawmakers in 2024 that would have granted landowners additional rights but also cleared a path for permitting by Summit.
Rep. Johnson “knows what’s going on here in South Dakota,” Feickert said, adding, “He needs to step up.”
Blakely, Johnson’s spokeswoman, pointed out that the reconciliation bill would alter the tax credit program by limiting access to companies that begin construction within two years of the bill’s enactment. The bill also restricts access to credits by taxpaying companies that are “specified foreign entities” like Chinese defense companies, or taxpaying companies influenced by those entities.
As far as the notion of eliminating 45Q, a statement from Johnson said he’s still working with his colleagues to make the “big, beautiful bill” a “more conservative” piece of legislation.
“I’ve been on the frontlines to help eliminate ridiculous portions of the Inflation Reduction Act, like EV chargers and other Green New Deal policies,” Johnson said.
Jensen, of Dakota Rural Action, said the credits in 45Q didn’t originate with the Green New Deal, the name attached to a set of policies promoted by some of Congress’ more liberal members. The tax credits originated under a bill signed by President George W. Bush in 2008, and were expanded by President Trump during his first term in office before President Biden’s infrastructure bill expanded them further.
“Our congressman continues to make it sound like this is about getting rid of the Green New Deal, and that this is Biden’s fault, but in reality, this is a bipartisan agenda that we are trying to get rid of,” Jensen said.

(Sara Wilson/Colorado Newsline)People convicted of first-degree car theft in Colorado will be unable to have a firearm under a new law signed by Gov. Jared Polis on Monday.
House Bill 25-1171 adds the offense to the list of crimes covered by the Possession of Weapon by Previous Offender statute in the state. POWPO makes it illegal to own a firearm for people with one or more of the listed convictions on their record.
“From now on anyone convicted of first degree motor vehicle theft (is) ineligible to possess a firearm, keeping guns out of the wrong hands and protecting our communities,” Polis said in a statement. “I am proud of our work to improve public safety in Colorado, and with this bill signed into law, I look forward to continuing our bold progress to protect Coloradans and our communities.”

A person can be convicted of first-degree vehicle theft only after two other vehicle theft convictions.
The bill was sponsored by Reps. Shannon Bird of Westminster and Andrew Boesenecker of Fort Collins and Sens. Nick Hinrichsen of Pueblo and Dafna Michaelson Jenet of Commerce City, all Democrats. It passed the Legislature with bipartisan support.
A 2021 law narrowed the scope of the POWPO application in Colorado, and while a 2022 law then added more felonies back to the list, it left car theft out.
“What we heard in committee from law enforcement is a plea. They are begging us, in these situations where you have someone who has been convicted three times of auto theft, they are asking us to please take the firearm out of the equation,” Boesenecker said on the House floor during bill debate.










What we heard in committee from law enforcement is a plea. They are begging us, in these situations where you have someone who has been convicted three times of auto theft, they are asking us to please take the firearm out of the equation.


– State Rep. Andrew Boesenecker


As the bill made its way through the Legislature, Hinrichsen said that car theft is distinct from other property crimes and non-violent offenses left out of POWPO.
“When we look at punishments relative to crime, either in terms of sentences or in terms of restrictions, what we should be looking at is the severity of the action and the risk and harm done to the victim and community more broadly. When you’re dealing with the theft of a vehicle, you’re disrupting the entire life of an individual,” he said during the bill’s first Senate committee hearing.
The bill was amended in the House, under a change brought by Republican representatives, to allow a person to petition a court to restore their firearm possession rights after 10 years.
“This is the crucially important piece — for someone who has turned their life around, they can petition to get this removed,” Rep. Ryan Armagost, a Berthoud Republican who helped negotiate the amendment, said on the House floor.
But that amendment ended up being a sticking point. Other crimes on the POWPO list do not have that restoration pathway for adults, creating equal protection concerns. Sponsors said, however, that the attorney general’s office said the bill with the amendment is defensible if a legal challenge emerges.
But the Senate stripped the amendment from the bill and passed a version without the restoration piece. The House then refused to accept the change and forced the Senate to decide, in the last hours of the session on May 7, to either pass the House version of the bill or allow the legislation to die. The Senate passed the bill.
“I appreciate the hard work of the House sponsors to work on deals that bring parties into agreement, that brought representatives to be able to get behind this policy that I believe will save lives in Colorado,” Hinrichsen said.

(Photo by Jacquelyn Jimenez Romero/Washington State Standard)Labor advocates scored a win on Monday after Gov. Bob Ferguson signed a new law to extend unemployment benefits to striking workers in Washington. 
The governor’s conference room was packed with advocates and lawmakers who gathered to see Ferguson sign the law with his blue felt tip pen. 
“Allowing striking workers to access unemployment insurance benefits creates a more level playing field for workers to have the resources they need to effectively bargain for better working conditions,” Ferguson said before putting his signature on Senate Bill 5041. 
The new law goes into effect on Jan. 1, 2026 and is set to expire on Dec. 31, 2035. Washington joins New York and New Jersey as the only states that provide such benefits to striking workers.
The bill generated controversy during the legislative session, with Republicans and business groups opposing the idea, arguing that it will encourage more workers to go on strike and ​​result in higher costs for businesses.
Democrats and labor advocates say this law will disincentivize bad faith behavior by employers and encourage them to engage with their workers. 
“No one wants to go out on strike,” said April Sims, president of the Washington State Labor Council. “Going out on strike is the absolute last resort, and workers that strike do so because there is simply no other option.”
The bill went through several rounds of negotiations over how long workers could collect unemployment insurance. Unemployment insurance is typically available for up to 26 weeks. 
When the bill first passed the Senate, the benefits would be extended for up to 12 weeks for strikers. But when it passed the House, the threshold was lowered to four weeks. Lawmakers ultimately settled on six weeks. 
Workers will be eligible for unemployment benefits starting 15 to 21 days after the strike begins, depending on the day the strike starts. If the contract is resolved before that time, benefits will not be issued.
The benefits will also be extended to workers affected by an employer-initiated lockout, something labor advocates point to as a tactic businesses use to put pressure on workers during contract negotiations.
The state’s Employment Security Department will also be required to submit annual reports to the Legislature with data on the number of strikes in the state and the cost of benefits for striking workers for Washington’s unemployment insurance trust fund, which is funded by a tax on employers.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_2645-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-05-19 19:04:58.105776

Photo by Glenn Russell/VTDiggerThe town of Colchester has appealed to the Vermont Supreme Court a lower court decision that found town officials acted in bad faith when they tried to seize waterfront property in an eminent domain proceeding.The appeal continues a long legal saga that began in 2022, when the Mallet’s Bay waterfront property owner, Mongeon Bay Properties, sued the town after officials there started eminent domain proceedings.The property, at 885 East Lakeshore Dr., is not used as a permanent residence but is part of a larger unsubdivided parcel that hosts a mix of rental housing, seasonal housing and single-family homes.Superior Court Judge Samuel Hoar Jr. in March criticized the town’s efforts to condemn the property, and in a decision halting the proceedings said the proposed taking was made in “bad faith.”He further suggested in his decision that town officials used eminent domain in retaliation for a previous legal dispute with the property owner.Attorneys for the town, in their appeal to the Supreme Court, said there is “considerable evidence demonstrating the town’s position that it was necessary to take the property,” according to court documents.READ MORE
The town is asking the state’s highest court to weigh whether the trial court “abused its discretion in failing to consider the town’s significant evidence” and asked that the justices consider whether the lower court “improperly substituted its own preference” for the eminent domain proceedings.Aaron Frank, the town manager for Colchester, did not respond to a request for comment. A.J. LaRosa, the attorney for Mongeon Bay Properties, could not be reached.The town has long held an easement on the site to operate and maintain a decades-old stormwater drainpipe and catch basin underneath the property.Town officials claim that seizure of the property is necessary for both environmental and liability reasons. Frank said previously that the town “did not believe this was a sound situation due to the certainty of need for future repairs and replacement of the pipe.”“Having a seasonal rental property on the side of a steep slope, and on top of a large stormwater pipe presents a significant financial burden to the town and its taxpayers,” he added.In late 2021, the town queued up plans to build a treatment facility on the property that would remove phosphorus and other contaminants from stormwater before discharging it into Malletts Bay. The property owner sued the town in 2022.In his decision, Hoar suggested that the condemnation attempt stemmed from a previous lawsuit, when the town and property owner clashed in court over repairs to the town-owned stormwater drainpipe, which ruptured following an October 2019 storm.The two parties eventually settled out of court for an undisclosed amount of money. But the town initiated the condemnation proceedings while that court case was underway, Hoar wrote in his decision.The judge wrote in the ruling that a town attorney had threatened the property owner in 2020, saying, “if you sue the town we will take your house by eminent domain.”The Supreme Court has yet to schedule a date to hear the town’s appeal.Read the story on VTDigger here:  Colchester appeals eminent domain lawsuit to state Supreme Court.",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/east-lakeshore-1-20250326-1024x676.jpg,,,2025-05-19 19:04:58.105776

An official with the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food and Nutrition Service on May 6 wrote a letter to all U.S. states asking them to provide the “names, dates of birth, personal addresses used, and Social Security numbers” of anyone who is receiving or has applied to receive benefits under the Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program (SNAP).
Fidelity Information Services, the private contractor who processes payments on behalf of New Mexico’s Health Care Authority, informed the agency that it had received a formal request from USDA for “records regarding SNAP cardholder and transaction data,” Marina Pina, spokesperson for the HCA, told Source NM on Monday.
HCA told the contractor that it does not consent to disclosing the information, “due to questions and concerns regarding the legality of USDA’s demand for the information,” and FIS agreed not to provide it, Pina said in an emailed statement.
“USDA also acknowledged that its request contained many vague or ambiguous terms and will be providing additional guidance in the relatively near future,” Pina said. “HCA will assess how to proceed after receiving that additional information from USDA.”
The USDA’s May 6 letter cites President Donald Trump’s executive order which directed federal officials to ensure the U.S. government “has unfettered access to comprehensive data from all State programs that receive Federal funding.”
States Newsroom reports that the so-called Department of Government Efficiency, headed by Trump’s billionaire advisor Elon Musk, has alarmed data privacy experts by accessing sensitive information from the Treasury Department payment system, information about the headcount and budget of an intelligence agency and Americans’ Social Security numbers, health information and other demographic data.

(John Hult/South Dakota Searchlight)The South Dakota Division of Criminal Investigation is heading up an inquiry into two inmate deaths that occurred last week on the campus of the South Dakota State Penitentiary.
The deaths, as well as a host of security breakdowns in recent months, are among the motivating factors for a planned Friday protest outside the facility in Sioux Falls.
DCI spokesman Tony Mangan confirmed Monday that the agency is working with the Department of Corrections’ Office of Internal Affairs to look into the circumstances surrounding the deaths of two men housed in Sioux Falls.
The first, 39-year-old Jason Garreau, was found unresponsive in his cell on May 15, according to a news release sent by the DOC the following day. 
Fight breaks out at penitentiary one month after similar violence that injured officer

A similar news release came two days later, on Sunday, and also used the verbiage “found unresponsive in his cell,” in reference to the death of 24-year-old Joshua Arrow.
Garreau lived in the penitentiary, an 1881 structure whose age, safety and crowded conditions have caused three years of discussion among state lawmakers on a replacement. 
Arrow lived in the Jameson Annex, a building erected in the 1990s to house maximum-security inmates, those in disciplinary segregation and those with mental health needs. 
Both facilities have seen outbursts of violence since March. There were two incidents just days before a work group studying prison construction walked through for a visit in early April. The first involved a female correctional officer assaulted at the penitentiary, the second an outbreak of violence between multiple inmates at Jameson that led to injuries and a facility lockdown.
The penitentiary once again saw a flare-up of fighting in early May. On that violence, the DOC only offered that there were no “life-threatening” injuries or injuries to officers.
On May 7, a correctional officer was assaulted at Mike Durfee State Prison in Springfield, a medium security prison that played host to two days of wide-scale fighting last summer. 
After a tour of Southeast Technical College in Sioux Falls on May 7, South Dakota Gov. Larry Rhoden said he has “full confidence” in Corrections Secretary Kellie Wasko to manage the security issues within the DOC. 
Wasko, he said, has “done a pretty good job of managing that situation, given the circumstances that she’s inherited and the conditions and the overcrowding.”
On Friday, a group led by a former inmate named Tracii Barse plans to protest conditions at the penitentiary from 4 to 6 p.m. in Sioux Falls. The poster for the event says the group intends to “peacefully and respectfully” protest “the treatment the inmates are enduring from admins and guards.”
“We will be speaking in honor and memory of the deaths that have recently happened inside the prison system,” the poster reads.
Barse said one of the primary goals is to push the DOC to respond to the concerns of family members with more honesty and transparency. While lawmakers discuss the possibility of expensive new prison construction projects, Barse said, inmates are injured, sick and dying, and family members – and the public – are left to wonder about the circumstances for days, weeks or longer.
“The people have the right to know what’s going on,” Barse said.
Nicole Gednalske, a spokeswoman for the DOC, told South Dakota Searchlight in an emailed statement that the agency is “awaiting autopsy results at this time” on the two recent deaths.

Kelly Armstrong on May 3, 2025, after lawmakers adjourned. (Kyle Martin/For the North Dakota Monitor)Gov. Kelly Armstrong issued seven line-item vetoes on six bills Monday, with many objections focused on policies he felt lawmakers “shoehorned” into budget bills or encroached on executive authority.
One line-item veto was of a section of the Ethics Commission’s budget bill meant to protect lawmakers from being prosecuted for conflicts of interest — though he let a similar clause in the bill become law. 
Both provisions, part of Senate Bill 2004, concerned lawmakers who have a special interest in the outcome of legislation. Under House and Senate rules, lawmakers are supposed to notify their peers when they believe they have conflict of interest with a bill so that their colleagues can decide whether to excuse them from voting. They may also seek guidance from the Ethics Commission.
North Dakota lawmakers approve Ethics Commission bill with deadline removed

The vetoed clause stated that if a lawmaker voted on a bill they had a conflict of interest with, but followed legislative ethics rules and/or followed informal guidance from the Ethics Commission, they couldn’t be prosecuted for any potential crime that stemmed from that vote.
In a line-item veto message, Armstrong said the provision “sends the wrong message to North Dakotans.”
“While transparency and ethical conduct are essential in a representative democracy, this provision elevates internal legislative procedure above state law, effectively shielding lawmakers from accountability under our criminal code,” he wrote.
He said the clause would create another blanket protection for lawmakers at a time when the state “already has opaque campaign finance laws.” The Legislature at the last minute rejected a bill some hoped would increase campaign finance disclosure requirements — a move Armstrong criticized.
Armstrong signed the rest of the Ethics Commission budget into law, which included another more narrow immunity clause. The narrower section protects a lawmaker from being prosecuted under a specific statute for voting on a bill they have conflict of interest with if they follow House and Senate ethics rules. The statute, titled “speculating or wagering on official action or information,” is what Rep. Jason Dockter, R-Bismarck, was convicted of last year. 
“Section 4 of Senate Bill 2004 is acceptable and reasonable because it appropriately clarifies that legislators must have the freedom to perform their official duties without fear of prosecution,” Armstrong said in his veto message.
Effort to improve North Dakota campaign finance reporting fails

The Ethics Commission expressed earlier this month that the immunity provision the governor vetoed would have made it legally more risky for the commission to give informal advice.
Other line-item vetoes
House Bill 1003, budget for the attorney general: Armstrong vetoed a provision that sought to prevent a district court judge from waiving fees for the 24/7 sobriety program. “It invites a constitutional challenge and will only increase costs and jail overcrowding for counties,” Armstrong wrote in his veto message. He also noted a standalone bill, Senate Bill 2365, had the same provision but failed in the House, yet the policy was later “logrolled” the budget bill.
Senate Bill 2014, North Dakota Industrial Commission budget: The governor vetoed a $150,000 passthrough grant from the Housing Incentive Fund to a Native American-focused organization to fund a homelessness liaison position. “Addressing homelessness and housing insecurity requires a comprehensive, sustainable, and statewide strategy, not isolated, one-time allocations to individual entities,” Armstrong wrote in his veto message.
Also in that bill, Armstrong vetoed a mandate for the Bank of North Dakota to spend up to $250,000 to study economic development strategies in western North Dakota as oil production decreases. The governor said the Department of Commerce already has the authority to do such a study.
House Bill 1019, Parks and Recreation Department budget: Armstrong vetoed a portion of the bill that sought to eliminate the department’s ability to rename state parks and require legislative approval for name changes. Armstrong wrote that provision encroaches on the executive branch. It also could complicate matters if federal dollars were contingent on the renaming of a state park, he said. Last November, the department changed the name of the state park in Medora to Rough Rider State Park.
Senate Bill 2001, Legislative Council budget: Armstrong vetoed a line in the budget that reserves the 15th floor of the Capitol for legislative staff. The floor is occupied now by the Department of Career and Technical Education. Armstrong said lawmakers did not get input from his administration, the department affected or the public. He said his administration will help identify available Capitol space, but he objected to doing so in state law.
Senate Bill 2018, Department of Commerce budget: Armstrong vetoed $350,000 to the State Fair Association for sanitation restoration projects. The governor said that funding should have been included in the State Fair Association’s primary budget. He said adding it to the Commerce budget at the end of the session “is a clear example of logrolling, which undermines transparency, accountability, and the principle of deliberate budgeting.”
“Through limited use of my line-item veto authority, we’ve reduced spending, protected the integrity of the budgeting process and preserved executive branch authority to ensure that state government remains efficient and transparent,” Armstrong said in a statement Monday.
Sen. David Hogue, R-Minot, chair of the Legislative Management Committee, said Monday that while he may disagree with some of the vetoes, he does not believe Armstrong overstepped his authority. 
“I don’t think they (the vetoes) rise to the level of a situation where we’d want to independently call ourselves into session,” Hogue said. “If we had another reason, we might take them up, but these vetoes would not be the impetus in my view.”
The Legislature, which adjourned earlier this month, does not have to act on the vetoes within a set amount of days, said Emily Thompson, director of the legal division of Legislative Council. She added lawmakers would need to use at least one of their six remaining legislative days to consider a potential veto override.
Lawmakers during the 2025 session passed a total of 601 bills. Armstrong signed 597 and vetoed four bills in their entirety: a bill affecting state employee health insurance, a library content bill, a private school voucher bill and a tax credit for prison industries. Budget bills take effect July 1 and policy bills take effect Aug. 1.

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch) Iowa farmers have less than 10% of corn acres left to plant, which puts them a whopping 12 days ahead of last year’s pace and four days ahead of normal, according to the crop progress and condition report. 
The report said farmers made “rapid progress” during the reporting period which had nearly a full week suitable for field work.
Iowa Secretary of Agriculture Mike Naig said the rain and cooler temperatures forecasted this week might mean fewer days in the field, but could be helpful for young crops. 
“We need the moisture across the state, and the widespread rainfall will give the recently planted corn and soybeans a good boost,” Naig said. 
According to the crop report, released weekly by the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s National Agricultural Statistics Service, some corn struggled to emerge, due to dry conditions in scattered areas across the state, and had to be replanted. 
Overall, 58% of planted corn and 42% of planted soybean acres have emerged. More than 80% of soybean acres across the state have been planted. 
Iowa had an average rainfall of less than a tenth of an inch of rain and a statewide average temperature of 65 degrees, which is 4 degrees above normal. The lack of precipitation and high temperatures caused topsoil moisture conditions to drop from 70% adequate the previous week, to 53% adequate for the reporting period of May 12-18. Subsoil moisture conditions also dropped from 67% adequate to 58% adequate in the latest report. 
More than 60% of Iowa is in abnormally dry conditions, according to the latest report from the U.S. Drought Monitor, which shows western and southern regions are driest. 
Despite the somewhat dry conditions, 63% of pastures rated good or excellent in the state. Hay and oat conditions also rated well for the reporting period with 78% and 86%, respectively, rated good or excellent. 
Precipitation outlooks for the state show 1-2 inches of rain anticipated in the next seven days.

DemasThe United States Environmental Protection Agency on Monday lifted its emergency order on drinking water in the City of Flint, with agency Director Lee Zeldin announcing the city had met all the requirements outlined in the order. 
“EPA has been working closely with our state and local partners in Flint, Michigan for several years to restore safe drinking water. It’s been a long, arduous journey, but significant progress has been made over the last decade to revitalize their water infrastructure and ultimately achieve this goal,” Zeldin said in a video posted to YouTube. 
With water sampling placing the city in compliance with Safe Drinking Water Act Standards, and the city replacing over 97% of its lead pipes carrying water to homes, the end of the order will place the city under the normal obligations of the Act, Zeldin said.
“Our message to the residents of Flint, Michigan is simple. EPA will work with all other levels of Government to do its part to ensure your community has safe drinking water for decades to come. We will continue to be a partner to provide technical assistance to the city and state as efforts continue to maintain and upgrade water infrastructure,” he said. 
The Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy, or EGLE, similarly voiced its commitment to ensuring Flint residents have access to safe water. 
“Through the dedicated efforts of the state and our strong partnership with the City of Flint, we’ve made remarkable progress, replacing the vast majority of lead service lines and ensuring Flint’s water meets stringent safety standards. Working with the city to ensure the complete removal of all lead service lines remains a top priority,” EGLE spokesman Scott Dean said in an email. 
The Flint water crisis began in April 2014 when the city of Flint switched its water source from Detroit-supplied Lake Huron water to the Flint River, and failed to treat the water with corrosion control leading to pipes leaching lead into the city’s water alongside other contaminants. 
At least 12 people died as a result of the water crisis, with Genesee County Circuit Court Chief Judge David J. Newblatt eventually giving final approval to a settlement ordering the state to pay $600 million to residents and property owners whose water was contaminated. The city of Flint was also ordered to pay $20 million, McLaren Regional Medical Center was ordered to pay $5 million and Rowe Professional Services was required to pay $1.25 million. 
According to EGLE, Flint has met state and federal lead in drinking water standards for 18 consecutive monitoring periods with the latest round of monitoring noting that samples for the 90th percentile came in at 3 parts per billion below the federal requirement of 15 ppb.
“This moment is about the people of Flint—about their voices, their strength, and their determination,” Flint Mayor Sheldon Neeley said in a statement. “For nearly a decade, we have worked tirelessly to restore trust and integrity to our water system, as well as meeting rigorous standards. While this milestone marks progress, our commitment to clean, safe drinking water remains unwavering. We will continue to advance infrastructure, strengthen safeguards, and ensure that the mistakes of the past are never repeated. Flint families deserve nothing less.”
However, Flint Water Activist Melissa Mays said the announcement came as a complete shock, telling the Michigan Advance there are still deficiencies in the City’s water system and plenty of lead lines in need of replacement.
While community members planned to gather Tuesday night to celebrate community members who successfully held the City accountable in progressing on its court-ordered lead pipe replacement program, Mays said while a celebratory announcement from the EPA was expected, Monday’s message was not. 
“Did we expect for them to bail before the work is done? No, no, that was a shock,” she said. 
“That being said, looking at what this current administration is doing, yeah, the environment and people’s public health and safety, clean safe water are not priorities. They’re the opposite, apparently,” Mays said. 
While the city still struggles with rupturing water mains and residents continue to face issues with discolored, foul-smelling water, people cannot be expected to trust the infrastructure, Mays said, raising further concerns about where the EPA’s decision leaves Flint and other communities as Congressional Republicans work to repeal updated limits on lead in water.
“It is infuriating that the EPA still hasn’t even settled our civil cases yet, and the civil cases are based on the EPA not acting, not stepping in, not forcing the city and state to do the right thing. And here they’re doing that exact same thing,” Mays said. 
While a federal judge ruled in February that Flint residents’ case against the agency can move forward despite the EPA’s arguments that it should be immune, the agency hasn’t signaled that it’s willing to settle, Mays said.
“That recourse of, ‘hey, if the city messes up, you go to the state. If the state messes up, you go to the federal government.’ We don’t have that anymore. They’re just like, ‘well, you’re on your own, and we’re leaving you with the people responsible for causing the Flint water crisis,’” Mays said.

The state House will vote on its spending plan this week, with  Appropriations and Finance committee meetings Tuesday and possible floor votes to follow Wednesday and Thursday. 
After the House passes its budget, House and Senate negotiators will meet to reconcile their differences, including differences over how to compensate state employees. 
The Senate budget proposal approved last month included 1.25% raises and $3,000 in bonuses spread over two years for most state employees. Law enforcement officers would receive bigger raises under the Senate plan. 
Both the House and Senate budget proposals would eliminate vacant jobs. The House budget says it is using money from eliminating positions to fund employee raises. 
The House budget includes “one time” supplements for retirees of 1% in the first budget year and 2% in the second year. 
The House budget increases starting teacher base pay from $41,000 to $48,000 in 2025-26, and to $50,000 the following year. The House budget would also restore salary supplements for teachers with advanced degrees. 
“The NC House budget delivers some of the largest teacher pay raises in state history – because we’re serious about investing in our classrooms not just talking about it,” Rep. Brenden Jones (R-Columbus) wrote on social media. 
While beginning teacher salaries would rise dramatically, teachers with 25 years experience and more would see 2.1% raises.
Tamika Walker Kelly, president of the NC Association of Educators, said they appreciate the attention to beginning teacher pay, but experienced teachers deserve more.
“We appreciate lawmakers’ recognition of the urgent need to raise starting teacher pay and restore master’s pay to help address the teacher shortage faced by our public schools,” Kelly said in a statement. “Attracting new and highly qualified educators into the profession is essential, but if we want our schools to be the best in the Southeast, we need to do more for veteran teachers, who are the backbone of our public schools.
“A minor 2.1% raise for our most experienced teachers doesn’t send the signal that we value long-time education professionals, despite the scientific evidence that veteran teachers help students learn and grow more, and the reality that new teachers depend on the experience of their colleagues.”
On taxes, the House budget increases the standard deduction by $500 for tax filers who are single and by $1,000 for married people filing jointly.
A tax deduction on tips of up to $5,000 would begin in the 2026 tax year. 
The budget also revives back-to-school sales tax holiday for the first weekend in August starting next year. 
Lawmakers in both the House and Senate are having to budget more carefully this year to deal with the massive rebuilding effort in the western part of the state. Gov.

(Photo by Austin Fisher / Source NM)In a committee room on the third floor of the Roundhouse on Monday, many Tesuque Village residents hotly contested a luxury resort’s proposal for sewage disposal during the first of five days of scheduled hearings before the state environment department.
Earlier this year, NMED approved a draft permit for Bishop’s Lodge and a nearby development with 82 homes to discharge up to 30,000 gallons per day of treated wastewater into a new leach field using a treatment plant installed in 2024.
The state and Bishop’s Lodge’s parent company maintain that the proposal to treat sewage is safe, noting that the new wastewater treatment plant is “designed to meet or exceed all local and national water quality standards.”
The current state permit authorizes Bishop’s Lodge to discharge about 14,700 gallons per day into two leach fields on the property; the inn and surrounding houses have been paying to truck sewage into Santa Fe.
Residents of Tesuque Village, with a population of just around 1,000 people who rely mostly on private wells for drinking, have objected, saying the disposal method threatens to pollute drinking wells downstream. Opposition has become more organized, with community members opposed to the permit creating a nonprofit called Protect Tesuque.
In statements during public comment during the hearing, Bernadette Romero-Jaramillo, a lifelong resident and Protect Tesuque board member, described the permitting process as an example of “environmental injustice.”
“This is what environmental injustice looks like, the people making decisions, the executives, the investors, the state official signing off on these permits — they don’t live here, they don’t rely on well water, their children don’t drink from the aquifers,” Romero-Jaramillo said. “They won’t feel the impact of these choices, but we will, our families will, our children will.”
Residents in opposition were not the only public commenters. Jeffrey Rogers, a homeowner in Tesuque called the opposition to the permit “a lot of hyperbole.”
“This is a wastewater permit, this isn’t a petrochemical factory that’s asking to be buried in our backyard, or something like that,” he said. “It’s had a permit before, it’s carried on with that permit, and now opportunity is there to provide outstanding wastewater treatment that frankly, our community hasn’t had before.”


How to watch:
The New Mexico Environment Department proceedings will continue this week, and links to the live stream are available on the agency’s events calendar.


The state environment department will make a final determination for the permit based on the application, public comments and testimony during the public hearing. Those final determinations can include: approving, conditionally approving or disapproving the draft permit.
In April, Protect Tesuque filed an emergency petition before the New Mexico Supreme Court, requesting the justices to stop the process and require NMED to reissue the permit.
That matter remains  pending before justices. The court requested that other parties file their arguments by the end of the day Monday.

Despite two nominations as an interim topic, lawmakers will not be studying the practice of running over predators — a tactic livestock producers say they need. 
The post Ban on chasing, striking Wyoming’s wildlife with snowmobiles rejected, again, by legislative committee appeared first on WyoFile .","A continued push to end a brutal form of motorized over-snow hunting did not gain traction with Wyoming lawmakers studying bills ahead of the 2026 legislative session, despite a Sublette County incident that shined an unprecedented spotlight on the practice and multiple nominations for a ban. 
The idea of prohibiting the use of snowmobiles to kill fleeing wildlife appeared twice on the list of proposed topics that were considered by the Legislature’s Travel, Recreation, Wildlife and Cultural Resources Committee. 
“Such conduct is cruel, unsportsmanlike, and damages Wyoming’s reputation as a responsible manager of wildlife,” stated an idea submitted by Rep. Karlee Provenza, a Laramie Democrat. “A vehicle should never be used as a weapon against wildlife.”
Rep. Mike Schmid, a La Barge Republican who tried twice at a ban during the Legislature’s most recent general session, likewise submitted an idea to study ending the practice of “predator whacking.” Schmid’s proposal — like his failed bill — included a concession to the livestock industry. Specifically, his proposal was for a bill prohibiting the use of vehicles as a weapon to intentionally kill wildlife on public land, so that woolgrowers and cattlemen could continue running over coyotes and other predators on private land to protect their herds — a tactic they say they need.

Recently, in the wake of committee-sponsored bills dying at historically high rates, the Legislature revamped its interim topic selection process. Now there are fewer interim meetings, and committee chairs — not the body’s Management Council — get the final say over what topics to study during the 10 or so months between legislative sessions. Up against two dozen other ideas, Provenza’s and Schmid’s proposals to take a long look at a form of Wyoming recreation that’s been targeted even at the federal level were not selected. 
“That didn’t even come close to rising to the top,” said Rep. Andrew Byron, a Hoback Junction-area Republican who co-chairs the Travel, Recreation, Wildlife and Cultural Resources Committee with Casper Republican Sen. Bill Landen. “We had our committee members rank their priorities.”

If snowmobiling over wildlife rose into the top 10 prioritized ideas, Byron might have hand-picked the topic for interim study, he told WyoFile. 
“But it was not,” he said. 
There was a Feb. 26 meeting where lawmakers, lobbyists and members of the public pitched interim ideas to the committee. Schmid did not speak in support of his proposal during the gathering. 
Provenza deferred to a co-signer of her idea: Kristin Combs, who directs the Wyoming Wildlife Advocates.
 “Our values in Wyoming are one way, and our laws are another,” she told lawmakers. “I think that it’d be really great for the committee to take a look, a deep dive.” 
A coyote runs from people chasing it on snowmobiles. Videos that show people running down wildlife while riding snowmobiles can be found online with relative ease. (YouTube screenshot)
At the time, Combs praised a bill brought by Byron that stiffened penalties for keeping crippled predators alive — a measure that was a direct response to an infamous February 2024 incident where Daniel resident Cody Roberts brought a juvenile wolf badly injured by a snowmobile into a bar. 
That legislation became law, but it does not criminalize the act of running over animals with snowmobiles — it does, however, specify that animals must be swiftly dispatched after being struck.
A prior, related bill that emerged from a subset of the committee  — the “Treatment of Predators Working Group” — died after language clarifying that it’s in fact legal to run over wolves, coyotes and other predators in Wyoming incited outrage.

Without success, Wyoming lawmakers have been pushing to prohibit recreationally running over animals with snowmobiles for many years. Rep. Mike Yin, a Jackson Democrat, sponsored a bill in 2019, though it did not get as far as a committee hearing. Later that year, Yin tried to convince the Travel, Recreation, Wildlife and Cultural Resources Committee to take up the topic, but the idea fell flat. 
Six years later, the proposal got the same response — even after the state’s legal embrace of the practice attracted global ire. 
While it’s clear a committee bill will not come out of the interim session, Schmid, Provenza or a coalition of lawmakers could still bring a personal bill during the Legislature’s 2026 session. It will face longer odds of becoming law because it’s a budget year, requiring all non-budget bills to earn two-thirds support for introduction. 
Although recreationally snowmobiling over wildlife is likely to remain part of Wyoming for the foreseeable future, a discussion about its legality is something that needs to happen, Wyoming Wildlife Federation Government Affairs Director Jess Johnson told WyoFile in a text message.

“Statute is one of the ways we as Wyoming present ourselves to the world, and to each other — it is important that the optics match the ethics I know most Wyoming citizens and hunters have,” Johnson said. “We also must be willing to be at the table and listen to our neighbors in agriculture and their needs.”
There’s no clear solution just yet, she added. 
“But something needs to change,” Johnson said, “and we need to do it thoughtfully, creatively, collaboratively and in the spirit of the Wyoming we want to see into the future.”

While several states have imposed bans on noncompete agreements, the Florida Legislature went the opposite way during its recent session and made it easier for employers to impose these agreements on workers.
That’s prompted a coalition of organizations and law professors to ask Gov. Ron DeSantis to veto the measure (HB 1219) — known as the CHOICE Act — when it reaches his desk.
The name stands for Contracts Honoring Opportunity, Investment, Confidentiality, and Economic Growth. The bill would allow an employer to restrict an employee from taking competitive employment for up to four years, through either a “garden-leave” provision or a noncompete agreement.
Any company with employees who are “reasonably expected” to earn more than twice the annual mean wage of the county in which the business is located can subject workers to noncompete agreements. It would also apply to independent contractors and out-of-state employees.
The proposal is strongly opposed by the Economic Innovation Group, which along with more than a dozen law professors sent a letter to the governor last week, calling upon him to veto it.
“The CHOICE Act would codify one of the most anti-innovative, anti-startup, and anti-worker policies to be found anywhere in the country,” said John Lettieri, president and CEO of the organization, in a written statement.
“While dozens of other states are enacting limitations on the use of noncompete agreements, this legislation would take Florida in the opposite direction – locking in talent, stifling wage growth, and undermining efforts to build a cutting-edge ecosystem in the Sunshine State.”
Under the bill, if a company uses a properly drafted noncompete or garden-leave agreement, Florida courts would have to issue preliminary injunctions to stop a former employee from working for a competitor unless the employee can convince the court otherwise.
Employers and employees would need to provide advance notice of up to, but no more than, four years before terminating the employment or contractor relationship.
During a committee stop in the Senate, Jacksonville Democratic Sen. Tracie Davis noted that most noncompete agreements last between one and two years. She asked Northeast Florida GOP Sen. Tom Leek (the bill sponsor) why the state should bind workers for four years.
Leek referenced moves made by the Federal Trade Commission last year to adopt a comprehensive ban on new noncompetes with all workers, including senior executives. A federal judge in Texas overturned the ban in August.
“Florida is poised to become one of the finance capitals of the world,” Leek said at the time. “And if we want to attract those kinds of clean, high-paying jobs, you have to provide those businesses protection on the investment that they’re making and their employees.”
A noncompete lasting for four years would be the longest of any state in the country, according to the Economic Innovation Group.
“There is an abundance of economic research demonstrating that the strict enforcement of noncompete agreements sharply reduces employee wages, the quality and quantity of new patents, and jobs created by new businesses,” the coalition writes in the letter to DeSantis.
“The CHOICE Act would accelerate these economically harmful trends by enacting the following changes to state noncompete law for exactly the type of workers Florida aims to attract to grow its middle class.”
While that alliance is urging the governor to veto the bill, some well-heeled supporters of DeSantis support it. Among those are Citadel, the Miami hedge fund and financial services company, according to Bloomberg.
Citadel is led by Ken Griffin, a well-known GOP megadonor and financial backer to DeSantis who gave $12 million last year to Keep Florida Clean, the political committee formed to oppose the failed constitutional amendment aimed to legalize recreational cannabis for adults 21 and over.

Other coalition members, including Kymara Seals (right) stand behind him. (Sonny Albarado/Arkansas Advocate)An Arkansas ballot question committee announced Monday it had submitted a proposed constitutional amendment to protect voters’ right to direct democracy. 
The Arkansas Ballot Measure Rights Amendment, sponsored by Protect AR Rights, would amend Article 5 Section 1 of the Arkansas Constitution, the section that governs the state’s initiative and referendum process, to designate voters’ right to propose laws and constitutional amendments that can be put to a statewide vote as a “fundamental right.”
This is the second such effort proposed this year in response to state lawmakers approving about a dozen direct democracy-related laws during the 2025 legislative session. Supporters of the new laws have said they will ensure the integrity of the initiative and referendum process, while opponents have argued it will make it more difficult for citizen-led initiatives to qualify for the ballot. 
The direct democracy process allows Arkansans to propose new laws or constitutional amendments and put them to a statewide vote. Arkansas is one of 24 states that allows citizen-led initiatives, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.
Members of the six organizations that comprise the coalition behind Protect AR Rights gathered inside the Capitol to formally announce their ballot measure Monday. During the press conference, Arkansas Public Policy Panel Executive Director Bill Kopsky said their proposal “strengthens three fundamental citizen rights” in the state Constitution — the right to propose ballot measures, the right to gather signatures on petitions and the right to sign a ballot measure petition.
“Sadly some politicians don’t trust voters…and they’ve stripped the right to the ballot measure process away from us,” Kopsky said. “They are rigging the rules to make it nearly impossible for everyday Arkansans to propose ballot measures to ask their fellow citizens to sign and support measures and to even sign one themselves. We must stand up to this unprecedented power grab.”
Arkansas grassroots organizations seek to intervene in lawsuit challenging direct democracy laws 

The Arkansas Ballot Measure Rights Amendment would make several changes to the state’s initiative and referendum process, including prohibiting the General Assembly from amending or repealing constitutional amendments that voters approved; current law allows lawmakers to do so by a two-thirds majority vote. The proposed measure would only grant that authority for initiated acts.
The measure would also make changes to the signature-gathering process by prohibiting a requirement that signatures be collected from more than 15 counties. A 2023 law, which is being challenged in court, increased the threshold to 50 counties. 
If a qualified voter’s signature is deemed insufficient and therefore will be disqualified and not counted, the proposed measure would require the elector to be notified and given at least 10 business days to correct “any identified insufficiency.” Notification and a minimum cure period of 10 business days would also be required for the sponsors of a measure if there is a filing error.
The proposed constitutional amendment would also require a ballot title challenge to be filed within 10 business days of the title’s approval and be “tried at once with expedited review if appealed.”
Additionally, the measure defines petition fraud and declares it a criminal offense. 
 The other ballot measure

The League of Women Voters of Arkansas is also pursuing its own proposed constitutional amendment aimed at protecting voters’ right to direct democracy. Attorney General Tim Griffin has rejected the measure three times. 
In his most recent rejection earlier this month, Griffin cited a new law that prohibits ballot titles from being written above an eighth-grade reading level. This was the first time he rejected a proposed ballot measure under Act 602, which became law in April.
Protect AR Rights tried to make its proposal “as readable as possible,” but Kopsky said he doesn’t think it’s possible to meet the eighth-grade reading level and the clarity standard. For that reason, Protect AR Rights last week filed a motion to intervene in a League of Women Voters of Arkansas lawsuit challenging new state laws, he said. 
“We believe we’ll get injunctive relief,” Kopsky said. “If we don’t, we’ll have to rethink our strategy.”

The League of Women Voters of Arkansas’ lawsuit alleges eight recently approved laws governing direct democracy violate the First and 14th amendments to the U.S. Constitution. Protect AR Rights noted in its motion to intervene that the committee wants to challenge additional laws not included in the lawsuit, including Act 602 of 2025.
Arkansas Advocates for Children and Families is a member of the Protect AR Rights coalition. Executive Director Keesa Smith-Brantley said Monday that the group’s goal is for the proposals from Protect AR Rights and the League of Women Voters of Arkansas to work together.
“We do not want there to be any confusion. We believe that they have critical components,” she said. “There were things that we felt like we needed to equally add to make sure that we enshrine the rights of Arkansans in the Constitution, but we are hopeful to be able to work together in this process and talk about ways that we can make sure that both of the measures that we’re working on get passed.” 
Under state law, the attorney general’s office has 10 business days to approve or reject the proposed ballot measures. The League of Women Voters submitted the latest version of its proposal May 7 and is owed a response from Griffin by Wednesday. The deadline for a response on Protect AR Rights’ measure is June 3.
The attorney general’s office does not have any other pending ballot title proposals, Griffin’s communication’s director Jeff LeMaster confirmed Monday.

Phaneuf,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/05/19/ct-budget-passes-spending-cap-medicaid/,"Lawmakers approved a bill to cover CT's overspending, with Gov. Ned Lamont declaring the first spending cap emergency since 2007.","The General Assembly approved a plan Monday to cover $466 million in state agency overspending — including a $284 million problem in Medicaid — even though it means Connecticut’s budget would exceed the constitutional spending cap for the first time since 2007.
The legislation, which now heads to Gov. Ned Lamont, also helps him and the Democrat-controlled legislature compromise on a new state budget for the next two fiscal years.
The Senate approved the bill 24-10 shortly before 5:45 p.m. The House passed it earlier by a 98-46 tally. Both votes, which followed party lines, provided the 60% vote of approval needed to exceed the spending cap, which limits most budget growth to increases in household income or inflation.
Also included in the bill were provisions that clarify Connecticut’s workers’ compensation law in response to a state Supreme Court decision that would radically increase insurance premiums paid by municipalities and businesses.
“If we did not have a Medicaid deal, we would have been here a very long time,” House Speaker Matt Ritter, D-Hartford, said shortly before Monday’s debate, referring to a related understanding with the Lamont administration that will make it easier for legislators to fund key programs next fiscal year. “We believe that will help us pay for things like municipal aid [and] special education.”
Maneuvering around the spending cap
Despite the Medicaid challenges, the overall, $26 billion state budget for this fiscal year, which wraps June 30, is headed for the second-largest surplus in Connecticut history.
Analysts project a General Fund operating surplus of $462 million, with surging revenues offsetting hundreds of millions of dollars in anticipated overspending involving more than a dozen state agencies. And a program that forces legislators to save a portion of income and business tax receipts will capture another $1.9 billion.
But the spending cap limit must be followed regardless of the $2.4 billion fiscal cushion that’s projected.
And legislators could not retroactively approve much of that overspending Monday without pushing the current budget about $25 million over the cap.
The alternative, leaders said, would have been to delay Medicaid payments to health clinics, social service agencies and other providers until after the new fiscal year starts on July 1 — a move providers said would have forced layoffs and service suspensions.
The state Constitution allows legislators to exceed the cap legally provided the governor declares a budget emergency in writing and each chamber gives the extra spending a 60% vote of approval.
The spending cap and other budget controls, which last were set in 2017, are largely fixed by law and contract until July 2028, but still can be adjusted with the governor’s consent.
Critics, including some Democrats in the legislature, say the state has overcompensated for its past poor savings habits, stashing cash too aggressively to pay down its hefty pension debt while dangerously weakening education, town aid, health care and other core programs.
Lamont, who told business leaders in mid-January that the spending cap was “sacrosanct,” issued the declaration of a budget emergency early Monday and said he’s not abandoning his budget principles.
“What can you say? ‘It’s a slippery slope. Oh my God, here we go again, just like we did in the early 2000s,’” Lamont said. “I think people know me. That’s not going to happen.”
State officials have legally exceeded the spending cap seven times since it was created in 1991 but not since 2007. That’s when Republican Gov. M. Jodi Rell and a Democratic-controlled legislature, with GOP support, appropriated $690 million above the limit to significantly boost municipal aid and payments to doctors and other providers that treat the poor.
But minority Republicans in the House and Senate both chastised the Democratic governor on Monday and predicted the cap overage was the first step in a journey that would end with state budget deficits and tax increases.
“Get your pocketbooks, your wallets ready,” Senate Minority Leader Stephen Harding of Brookfield said during a press conference prior to Monday’s debates. “You’re going to give over more of your money [to] the state of Connecticut.”
Sen. Heather Somers of Groton, ranking GOP senator on the Appropriations Committee, added that “we have a governor who has literally folded like a lawn chair over this.”
Lamont’s communications director, Rob Blanchard, said Senate Republicans “have short-term memory loss,” noting lawmakers from both parties recently voted to order $40 million in additional special education grants for local school districts — despite warnings from Lamont that the current budget was in jeopardy of exceeding the spending cap.
“Nothing about this deficiency proposal will result in a tax increase and will ensure our Medicaid providers can care for our state’s most vulnerable,” Blanchard added.
House Minority Leader Vincent J. Candelora of North Branford noted during Monday’s debate that the latest budget problem could have been avoided had Democrats not ignored projections one year ago that showed Medicaid costs were surging.
Candelora called Monday’s bill a spending cap “end-around that I don’t think I have seen in quite a number of years.”
Medicaid bill opens door for more spending in next budget
Lamont’s declaration, though technically only allowing a spending cap exception this fiscal year, is part of a larger deal that provides some relief down the road as well.
Ritter confirmed Monday that the administration has agreed to carry forward a portion of this fiscal year’s $462 million operating surplus — roughly $255 million to $260 million — into the next, two-year state budget. 
And because those carryforward funds had been appropriated in the 2024-25, they count toward that fiscal year’s spending cap calculation.
In other words, that’s $255 million to $260 million extra that legislators can spend in the coming biennium without pushing the spending cap tally up by one penny.
Democrats and Lamont have struggled to find room under the cap in their plans for next fiscal year to accommodate additional investments in health care, early childhood development, education, and municipal aid.
They also are seeking additional funds to bolster the nursing home industry and services for people with developmental disabilities. The state’s largest health care workers’ union has set a May 27 strike deadline involving about 6,400 caregivers spread across dozens of nursing homes and group homes. The union says its members can earn more serving fast food than caring for Connecticut’s elderly residents and clients with disabilities.

(Getty Images) (This image cannot be republished unless you have a Getty subscription.)OKLAHOMA CITY – Oklahoma could be on the hook for paying almost $500 million if Congress moves forward with historic plans to shift food stamp costs to states.
Jeffrey Cartmell, Gov. Kevin Stitt’s appointee to head the Oklahoma Department of Human Services, discussed the potential impact during his confirmation hearing Monday before the state Senate’s Health and Human Services Committee.
The committee’s chair Sen. Paul Rosino, R-Oklahoma City, asked Cartmell about the potential impact of proposed federal cuts to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP. The program provides electronic benefits to purchase certain food items for those who qualify. 
Cartmell said changes to the program formerly known as food stamps could range from $170 million to $450 million a year depending on which cost-sharing plan is adopted by the Republican-led Congress.
He said the U.S. House is considering for the first time requiring states to pay matching dollars on SNAP. He said states could be required to pay up to 25% match.
About 17% of Oklahomans receive food stamps.
Last year, a 10% match would have cost his agency $170 million, he said. A 25% match would cost between $430 million to $450 million, he said.
Congress is also considering altering the administrative portion of the program, requiring the state to pay more, he said. Such a move would cost an additional $30 million to $40 million, Cartmell said.
“Absolute worst case scenario to the agency would be an additional probably $450 million to $475 million that we would no longer have funding for to provide for the program,” he said.
The figures come just days after Stitt and legislative leaders announced a budget agreement that included a 0.25% drop in the state’s top income tax bracket to 4.5% from 4.75%.
The Oklahoma Policy Institute, a Tulsa-based think tank, said the cut would cost the state coffers about $338 million.
Lawmakers recently eliminated the state’s 4.5% state portion on the grocery sales tax.
The panel approved Cartmell’s appointment, which now moves to the full Senate. He would replace Deborah L. Shropshire, who stepped down in the fall.

(Elise Plunk/Louisiana Illuminator)GRAND ISLE – Not all jewels have the deep green features of emeralds or sparkle of diamonds. Some tumble from algae-coated cages in a rush of rock and shell, briny water splashing alongside them onto the deck of a boat. 
These fine commodities are oysters, grown and harvested just off Louisiana’s coastline in a different way than the traditional seafloor beds that have been farmed for generations. 
Cultivated in a string of floating cages instead of on the water’s bottom, Grand Isle Jewels, the umbrella brand for all off-bottom oysters in the barrier island community, are marketed as precious gems of the Gulf Coast. 
“You create this craze for a certain item, and everybody’s jumping on it,” said Kirk Curole, owner of Bayside Oysters in Grand Isle.
After retiring from a career in oil and gas, Curole began harvesting off-bottom oysters as a hobby that turned into a small business. He now spends his days on the water, clad in rubber waders and toughened gloves as he pulls his crop from the floating cages.
“It’s the ‘bougie’ oyster. It’s the boutique oyster,” he said. “Everybody wants to try it.”
Louisiana is exploring Grand Isle Jewels as more than just a marketing strategy. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers lists the state’s strong interest in off-bottom oyster cultivation as a way to help build resiliency into an industry under threat from sediment diversions in its final environmental impact statement for the controversial Mid-Barataria Sediment Diversion project.
Whether this technique can beat back worsening hurricanes, climate change and the impact of sediment diversions is still undetermined.

An industry at risk
On-bottom culture, where oysters attach to reefs or substrate on the water’s bottom, is and has been the most popular method of oyster harvesting in Louisiana’s waters, fed for centuries by the wealth of nutrients carried down the Mississippi River and into the delta region. 
“Oysters here are probably in the best location in this regard because they show very high growth,” said Romain Lavaud, an oyster scientist and researcher at LSU. “They can be harvested within a year, whereas in other parts of their distribution range it can take two to three years.”
But Louisiana’s environment can also be an oyster harvester’s worst enemy. Hurricanes inflict huge damage to oyster reefs, and heavy rains can dilute the salt content of the water, killing oyster crops. 
“You’re kind of, like in any agriculture production, at the mercy of environmental conditions,” Lauvaud said.
Farming oysters has always been a gamble, said Peter Vujnovich, a third-generation on-bottom harvester based in Port Sulphur. Oyster farmers can lose big after a storm, he said. 
“Mostly you try to protect your house, your boats and the equipment and stuff like that, and the rest is really up to God,” Vujnovich said. “Make the sign of the cross, just hope you don’t get a direct hit.”
Port Sulphur saw large losses to its oyster reefs in 2005 from Hurricane Katrina, which eliminated seeding ground for traditional farmers.
Then, there are sediment diversions, a coastal restoration approach that mimics the natural process of building a delta with silty water from the Mississippi River. There are multiple planned diversions in Louisiana’s Coastal Master Plan to rebuild wetlands that have been diminished through hurricanes, natural subsidence and countless man-made canals. 
The Mid-Barataria Sediment Diversion project is one of the more controversial ones because of its likelihood of “major, permanent, adverse impacts” to oyster populations, according to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers environmental impact statement. It would alter or eliminate vast swaths of habitat in the Barataria basin, with the goal of returning the area to what it looked like before the effects of sea level rise, erosion and subsidence changed it.   
But on-bottom harvesters need reefs, and diversions would likely permanently eliminate vast swaths of oyster habitat. The Corps of Engineers’ study for the Mid-Barataria Sediment Diversion suggests the most productive oyster grounds in its basin, Hackberry Bay, “would experience the highest losses,” potentially experiencing “total loss” of habitat.
Gov. Jeff Landry has called for a pause on the nearly $3 billion project, citing in part its impact on the oyster industry.

Seeding off-bottom solutions
The Corps of Engineers has identified off-bottom oyster cultivation as a potential way for the industry to adapt to the threat of sediment diversions. The federal agency has oversight of all coastal restoration projects and acts as a gatekeeper for what’s proposed in Louisiana’s Coastal Master Plan.
Off-bottom farming could “help diversify the oyster industry and add a level of sustainability as the industry adjusts to a changing coast,” specifically in response to the diversion’s impact on salinity, the corps study said. 
Off-bottom culture can help with protection against predators and offer a way to harvest in areas without abundant reefs, left stripped after storms. But the key advantage the Army Corps and the state’s Coastal Restoration and Protection Authority cites centers around mobility. 
Floating cages could, in theory, be moved in response to a low salinity event such as the opening of a diversion. But harvesters need permission from regulators to store their gear and oysters in different bodies of water from where they’re harvested, and that can take up to 18 months to obtain. Also, the Louisiana Department of Health and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration does not allow oysters to be out of the water for more than 24 hours. 
Mobility could also help mitigate hurricane damage even if the oysters have to be jettisoned so the cages could be moved on shore temporarily during a storm. 
Curole said even if he loses his crop, it’s worth it to save his expensive equipment and harvest off-bottom again after the storm.
“If a storm is coming, I’m just going to go pick up my equipment, even if I have to dump my oysters out,” he said.  “I can oyster next year, or I can oyster in two or three months.”
This works for Curole, whose trailer can haul up to 350 oyster cages, but his business is relatively small. At the scale industry would need, there might not be enough time to relocate all the cages they would use, and the loss could spell doom for a business’ bottom line. 
“It has not been demonstrated that gear can be sunk and retrieved cost-effectively or relocated in time to avoid damage and loss of both gear and crop,” Daniel Petrolia, a University of Mississippi agro-ecomomics professor, wrote in a 2023 report on the economic challenges to off-bottom harvesting in Louisiana.
Time is in short supply as hurricanes approach, especially with storms developing and intensifying more rapidly in recent years. Off-bottom oyster operations are already expensive, according to the Petrolia report. He concludes the loss of harvesting gear to a storm could sink an off-bottom oyster harvester’s livelihood indefinitely.

Reliant on subsidies
Petrolia’s report also found that the success of off-bottom oysters in Louisiana relies entirely on state subsidies.
Louisiana began to offer grants for off-bottom harvesters in 2022, starting with $3 million to address the high startup costs
“Although the … grant program can indeed provide a hand up to existing growers, it does distort market signals and may give the impression that economic conditions are better than they actually are,” the report reads. “The eventual disappearance of the [subsidy] program will likely have consequences.”
The report also doesn’t expect “the average small-scale operation” to be profitable, even with funding support from the state. Curole did not receive a grant from the state and said his business is currently profitable, but he represents a smaller set of growers that operate more for supplemental income. True profitability becomes more possible, according to the report, with larger businesses. 
Off-bottom cultivation was never pitched as a silver bullet solution for the oyster industry’s future. Louisiana SeaGrant, a federal government-LSU partnership, is responsible for the majority of the off-bottom funding and hatchery support. It paid for Petrolia’s report and stands by the idea that off-bottom culture is meant to supplement rather than replace traditional techniques. 
Different off-bottom initiatives continue to support the oyster industry, such as the expansion of hatchery operations that farmers rely on for seed. Further research, such as how to sink and secure cages during hurricanes, and grant money to support it are also needed.
To harvesters like Vujnovich, the survival of the industry doesn’t hinge on a choice between off-bottom or on-bottom cultivation. It’s whether or not these tools will help his industry stand on its own again.
“They’ll always have a few hardcore like me,” he said. “The question is not if it’ll survive; it’s if it’ll flourish again.”

Congress’s proposed changes to Medicaid policies and a state insurer’s potential rate hikes would further stress a system in crisis, the Senator said in a Monday press conference.

Photo by Olivia Gieger/VTDiggerSen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., joined a group of state legislators, health care officials and advocates in Burlington Monday morning to raise the alarm on what they called Vermont’s health care affordability crisis.“Everyone knows that our health care system, nationally and in the state of Vermont, is broken. It is dysfunctional, and it is wildly expensive,” Sanders said. The press conference at Patrick Leahy Burlington International Airport was set against the backdrop of Congress’s attempts to push through a mega spending bill that is expected to include work requirements for Medicaid recipients and limit the extent to which state governments can use health care provider taxes to cover their portion of Medicaid funding.Back at home, Blue Cross Blue Shield of Vermont sits in financial jeopardy, having lost $152 million over the past three years. The nonprofit insurer has asked the Green Mountain Care Board to approve double-digit percentage increases to the premiums of plans sold in 2026 on the Vermont Health Connect — the state-run federal Affordable Care Act marketplace. “I’m not sure how anybody is going to be able to afford that,” Sanders said. While he did not touch on the specifics of how the state or federal governments can support the state’s only Vermont-based health insurer and protect it from insolvency, Sanders outlined areas where he thinks further investment can lead to lower health care costs for Vermont in the long term. Those included expansions of primary health care facilities and of nursing education programs that allow the state to rely less on traveling nurses, as well as increased support for home health care and nursing homes. He cited efforts to reduce the cost of prescription drugs as a key area that can lower costs for hospitals, and thus, reduce the costs that get passed onto insurers and individuals.All of this falls under a need for a broader cultural change, Sanders said, from a health care system that is focused on profit to one that supports health care as a human right. READ MORE

It’s a different culture,” Sanders said. “We’ve got to radically reorient our priorities.”Lisa Ventriss, co-chair of the newly formed advocacy group Vermont Health Care 911, put a finer point on it at the press conference: She suggested that shifting spending to patient care, rather than to administration or management, would open up “ample room for savings in Vermont,” while curbing the “gobsmacking” premium rate hikes the state has seen.Sen. Ginny Lyons, D-Chittenden Southeast, and Rep. Alyssa Black, D-Essex Town, who chair the health care committees in their respective chambers, also touted the bills that lawmakers are trying to pass this session to reduce health care costs in Vermont. Namely, the legislators highlighted S.162, which seeks to keep hospital charges in line with Medicare reimbursement rates (called “reference pricing”), and H.482, which would give the Green Mountain Care Board the ability to lower reimbursement rates paid to health care providers by an insurer in danger of insolvency. “We’re saving our Blue Cross and Blue Shield domestic insurer from insolvency. We’re stabilizing access to primary care, family medicine,” Lyons said. “We are now working to allow people to access food, rent and health care without having to make choices for one over the other.”Still, progress at the state level is quickly dwarfed by the potential threat of federal changes to Medicaid. Most worrisome, Black added in an interview following the press conference, is the threats from President Donald Trump’s administration to undo the so-called 1115 waiver program. That waiver gives states the ability to cover services beyond what federal statute outlines as required coverage under Medicaid. Vermont has become a particular leader on finding innovative ways to use this waiver. “It’s a huge amount of our Medicaid spending,” Black said. Sanders said he and Senate Democrats are trying to do “everything that we possibly can, in every possible way, to defeat this awful piece of legislation,” with regard to the spending bill’s impact on Medicaid in Vermont.He called the congressional bill a “Robin Hood proposal in reverse.”“You take from the poor and you give to the very rich. This is a disastrous piece of legislation, we’ve got to defeat,” he explained. The real solution, he suggested, is guaranteed health care for all, but for now he lauded the state’s efforts in “trying to begin to address this crisis.”“What we’re doing today is trying, at least to develop a sense of urgency in the state of Vermont. The status quo cannot continue. It is failing — failing small business. It’s failing patients. It’s failing everyone,” Sanders said.Read the story on VTDigger here:  Sen.

Lynn Evans, R-Aurelia, has launched an exploratory committee to run as a Republican in Iowa’s 4th Congressional District.
Evans said in a statement Saturday he is considering running for the position and plans to meet with people living in the northwest Iowa district in the coming weeks in order to determine “the best path forward.”
“After thoughtful prayer, conversations with my family, and encouragement from supporters across the district, I’m excited to share that I am officially launching an exploratory committee to consider a run for Congress in Iowa’s Fourth District,” Evans said in the news release.

Evans is serving his first term representing Iowa Senate District 3. He is the Senate Education Committee chair and an assistant majority leader in the chamber. Before his time in the Legislature, Evans worked as a superintendent in multiple Iowa school districts including the Alta-Aurelia Community School District. He currently works as an adjunct professor at Buena Vista University.
Evans said that during his time in the Senate, he has worked to “protect rural values, defend our freedoms, and bring common-sense leadership to tough issues like education, tax relief, and government overreach.”
“Now, I’m exploring how I can serve Iowa on a larger scale — bringing true conservative leadership to Washington and giving rural Iowa a strong, principled voice in Congress,” he said.
Evans’ announcement comes after U.S. Rep. Randy Feenstra, who currently holds the seat, announced his exploratory committee for a gubernatorial run earlier in May. Gov. Kim Reynolds has announced she will not seek reelection in 2026. Feenstra has represented the 4th District, a longtime conservative stronghold in the state, since the 2020 election, when he defeated then-incumbent Rep. Steve King in the Republican primary.
With Feenstra potentially ending his time as the 4th District representative to run for governor, there could be an open Republican primary for the congressional seat.
Democrat Ryan Melton, who has run against Feenstra in previous elections, has also announced his campaign for the 4th District seat, and other Republican candidates could enter the race. Another potential contender, Rep. Steven Holt, R-Denison, said in a social media post Friday that he does not intend to run for U.S. Congress but will seek to continue serving in the Iowa House.

(Provided by the SC Department of Corrections)COLUMBIA — Attorneys for a condemned inmate are asking for more information about the state’s execution methods before the inmate chooses which one will kill him.
Stephen Stanko, whose execution is scheduled June 13, has until May 30 to choose his method of execution. His attorneys have questioned whether two of the available methods, firing squad and lethal injection, have gone the way officials anticipated and are asking for more information on protocols and previous executions before the 57-year-old inmate must choose between them.
“Stanko now faces selection of a method of execution with serious unanswered questions,” the motion, dated Friday, reads.
Execution scheduled for SC inmate with 2 death sentences

Stanko also has the option of electrocution, but his attorneys have advised him to avoid the electric chair out of belief that it is less humane than either firing squad or lethal injection, “if carried out properly,” according to the motion.
Ahead of Stanko’s decision, state law requires the director for the Department of Corrections to submit a sworn statement to the state Supreme Court certifying which methods are available and that they’ve been recently tested.
Two of the five inmates executed since September objected to the statement ahead of their executions, claiming it was too vague about how the department tests and stores the pentobarbital used for lethal injections. The objections did not change anything. The state’s highest court ruled in both cases that the statement had enough information for inmates to make their decisions.
This is the first time attorneys have requested more information about the firing squad.
The motion comes soon after attorneys raised concerns that the state’s most recent firing squad execution, which took place April 11, didn’t go as planned. A pathologist who attorneys hired to review inmate Mikal Mahdi’s autopsy report found the bullets mostly missed his heart, failing to destroy it completely as they did in a previous execution. And his chest showed two bullet holes when he was supposed to have been hit with three bullets, according to filings submitted to the state’s highest court.
These problems could’ve meant Mahdi was alive and in pain longer than the 10 to 15 seconds experts predicted as the state high court weighed whether the method was constitutional, attorneys wrote. Media witnesses reported that Mahdi was breathing and making sounds for about a minute after the bullets struck him.
“An explanation for why Mahdi was conscious and suffering pain for more than double that time and how it will be avoided in the future is necessary as another inmate faces the gruesome choice between execution methods,” attorneys wrote in their request to the court.
A Department of Corrections spokeswoman said nothing went wrong. Two of the bullets struck Mahdi in the same place in his chest, following the same route through his body, and bullet fragments struck his heart, spokeswoman Chrysti Shain said previously.
2 SC legislators call for independent investigation into latest execution

Friday’s motion from Stanko’s attorneys asks the court to require that agency include in its filing a redacted version of the internal report it conducts after each execution, protocols for how exactly a doctor locates an inmate’s heart to place the target for the firing squad, and more information about the bullet fragments recovered in the two previous firing squad executions.
The attorneys also want to know more about how marksmen are trained and whether the same people were operating the guns in both executions, according to the filing.
“Information about the shooters’ training is especially necessary in South Carolina where there is almost no room for error,” the motion reads. In Utah, the only other state that has carried out executions by firing squad, protocol calls for inmates to be struck with four bullets, attorneys wrote.
More information about the protocol for lethal injection is also needed, attorneys wrote. They questioned, as they have in previous filings, why a doctor seemed to use two doses of deadly pentobarbital spaced 10 minutes apart when the corrections department has said inmates die with one dose.
If that is a backup dose, attorneys asked for clarification on what makes executioners believe it’s necessary. Knowing whether it suggests an inmate is still alive after 10 minutes could help Stanko decide whether he feels lethal injection is his best option, attorneys wrote.
Media witnesses to the state’s three lethal injection executions carried out since September reported that inmates appeared to stop breathing after several minutes and laid still until they were declared dead, usually about 20 minutes after the process began.
Attorneys for the Department of Corrections have not yet filed a response. They have until 3 p.m. Friday to do so, according to a Monday letter from the Supreme Court’s clerk.

The crime that Stanko’s scheduled to be executed for occurred April 8, 2005, though it’s the second of two killings that sent him to death row. He has never claimed innocence. In both cases, his attorneys argued he was legally insane during the killings.
According to prosecutors, Stanko shot his 74-year-old friend, Henry Turner, multiple times while Turner was shaving in the bathroom mirror. Stanko stole Turner’s truck and drove first to Columbia, then to Augusta, Georgia, where he pretended to be a businessman in town for the Masters golf tournament. Police caught him after a woman he stayed with in Georgia recognized his photograph in the paper and called the police, according to court records.
Stanko was also convicted of strangling his girlfriend, Laura Ling, to death while beating and raping her then-15-year-old daughter. That happened the day before he killed Turner.
Stanko slit the daughter’s throat and left her for dead before taking off with Ling’s jewelry and credit cards, but the daughter survived and called the police. Stanko received a separate death sentence in that case, for which his appeals are ongoing.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMG_0542-1024x681.jpeg,,,2025-05-19 18:08:08.053426

(Alex Cochran for Alabama Reflector)Most of the complaints are handwritten in ballpoint pen and sent from prisons to federal courts through the U.S. mail. The particulars about the incidents vary, but fear of correctional officers is a common theme.
“I am requesting an emergency transfer before these officers kill me,” wrote one man from St. Clair Correctional Facility.
“I am more afraid now than I ever have been since I was first incarcerated,” wrote another man from Holman Prison.



May 19: The Alabama Department of Corrections has settled over 90 lawsuits alleging corrections officers used excessive force, costing the state millions of dollars.
May 20: Even as the prison population has declined, use of force incidents in Alabama’s prisons have soared, and some corrections officers named in lawsuits alleging excessive force have not only held onto jobs, but been promoted.

May 21: The anatomy of one inmate’s allegations against a corrections officer, and the aftermath.
May 22: Who’s paying for these settlements? You are. Who’s getting the most money from this litigation? Attorneys defending corrections officers.


“Don’t let these people kill me,” wrote another man from Donaldson Correctional Facility. “I’m scared for my life and that they will say I killed myself.”
The allegations are from three civil rights lawsuits among 124 that the Alabama Department of Corrections (ADOC) has paid to settle since 2020. The vast majority involved complaints of excessive force inside Alabama’s violent and overcrowded prisons, according to a review of court records and state financial data.
An Alabama Reflector examination found that of 124 lawsuits that ADOC settled in the five-year period between 2020 and 2024, 94 involved complaints of excessive force. Other lawsuits alleged wrongful deaths and accused ADOC staff of failing to protect incarcerated people from violence, including assaults and rapes.
The cost of defending lawsuits against individual officers and larger, class-action cases against the entire department has pushed ADOC’s legal spending over $57 million since 2020. In the last five years, the department has spent over $17 million on the legal defense of accused officers and lawsuit settlements, along with over $39 million litigating a handful of complex cases against ADOC, including a lawsuit filed by the U.S. Department of Justice over prison conditions.
Data on civil lawsuits and outcomes against other state prison systems is not readily available, but the sheer volume of excessive force cases ADOC is settling is significant, according to several correctional experts.
“That sounds extreme, in my experience,” said Steve Sinclair, who retired as Washington’s Department of Corrections Secretary in 2021 after a 32-year career in corrections. “It’s pretty routine to have lawsuits for various reasons, and not all of those are legit lawsuits. But certainly not 60 or 80 plus. It’s inconceivable to me.”
The 94 excessive force lawsuits were settled between 2020-2024, but resulted from incidents that occurred in the span between 2014-2022, and cover 15 of ADOC’s 26 institutions, including maximum, medium and minimum-security facilities.
Alleged acts of excessive force resulting in serious injury were documented everywhere from the Loxley community work center, a minimum-security facility housing 360 prisoners who work in the community, to death row at Holman Correctional Facility in Atmore, depicting an institutional landscape characterized by subterranean brutality.
Forty-five percent of the lawsuits detailed injuries so severe that the victims required hospitalization, ranging from lacerations requiring stitches to broken bones, many requiring surgery. Some complaints allege beatings that resulted in multiple injuries. Medical records submitted in court show one man had both arms broken in an incident involving an officer. Another man said he suffered broken ribs and broken bones in his back from a staff assault. A third was hospitalized with a broken leg and hand. Nineteen complaints described traumatic head and brain injuries. At least seven cases detailed catastrophic traumas that left the victims permanently disabled or disfigured.
The findings are the result of a monthslong investigation that included the examination of accounting data obtained from the Alabama Department of Finance detailing all payments made from the General Liability Trust Fund since 2020, as well as court records connected to the trust fund transactions.










Don't let these people kill me. I'm scared for my life and that they will say I killed myself.


– Inmate, Donaldson Correctional Facility


The General Liability Trust Fund operates similarly to insurance, with a $1 million cap per incident, to cover both the legal defense of state employees and any potential settlement payment, also known as indemnity, to plaintiffs. State agencies pay an annual premium to participate. The fund is used for individual plaintiff-filed lawsuits that seek damages. Lawsuits filed against entire state agencies, like class-action litigation that seek to change policy, are paid for out of the state’s General Fund.
The increased volume of individual lawsuits filed against employees of ADOC comes as the department is embroiled in several class-action lawsuits against the entire system over prison labor and the lack of mental health treatment, as well as ongoing litigation with the U.S. Department of Justice, which sued the state in December 2020 after concluding that Alabama “failed or refused to correct” unconstitutional prison conditions, including the common use of excessive force.
A staff member from the U.S. Attorney’s office in Alabama’s Northern District said the lawsuit remains ongoing at this time, but would not provide any further details.
ADOC and the Alabama Attorney General’s Office continue to deny that the state’s prison problems amount to systemic constitutional violations, but lawyers for state employees are routinely using public dollars to quietly pay out dozens of lawsuit settlements—the amounts determined in confidential settlement negotiations or mediation, not reported in court filings, and outside stakeholder scrutiny. While settlements are not an admission of liability, these lawsuits were filed over the same conditions that led the DOJ to sue the state: overcrowding, understaffing, inadequate facilities, and “an excessive amount of violence, sexual abuse and prisoner deaths.”
The DOJ began investigating Alabama’s 13 prisons for men in 2016, and in 2019 released the first of two findings letters that detailed why the federal department found reasonable cause that conditions in ADOC violate the Eighth and 14th Amendment rights of prisoners, amounting to cruel and unusual punishment.
“All too often, correctional officers use force in the absence of a physical threat while making no effort to de-escalate tense situations,” the DOJ stated in its findings letter on excessive force. “Such uses of force heighten tensions in already violent and overcrowded prisons. Correctional officers also use force as a form of retribution and for the sole purpose of inflicting pain.”
In response to questions about the surge in excessive force lawsuits and settlements, an ADOC spokesperson pointed to the DOJ.
“Most are piggybacking off the allegations contained in the DOJ findings letters, which ADOC adamantly denies,” wrote ADOC’s spokesperson, Kelly Betts, in an email response.
Betts also wrote that ADOC “does not comment on pending litigation or confidential settlement negotiations and any resulting agreements,” and referred questions about the number of settlements or specific lawsuits to the Alabama Attorney General’s Office, which began handling most of ADOC’s civil litigation in 2023.
The Alabama Attorney General’s Office did not respond to multiple emails and phone messages seeking comment, including a list of submitted questions.
For decades, ADOC had no internal grievance process for people in prison to file complaints over officer abuse or misconduct. Without proper oversight inside the prisons, lawsuits can serve as a backstop for accountability.
Many legal rights and protections for people in prison have been put in place by the courts, and some of those cases started out as complaints from the prisoners themselves. Everything from the right to send and receive mail, to the right to basic medical care are the results of litigation, said one man who has filed lawsuits against ADOC officers in the past and asked to withhold his name out of fear of reprisal.
“There’s really no bottom to how badly a state will treat prisoners without the intervention and oversight of the courts,” he said. “Filing a lawsuit seeking damages is often the only meaningful way to challenge mistreatment in prison.”
 ‘A culture of impunity’

The 94 excessive force complaints that resulted in settlement payments to victims do not represent the total lawsuits filed against ADOC officers, many of which are dismissed by the courts.
“These are probably the most egregious examples of what is really a culture of impunity and violation of people’s rights,” said David Gespass, an attorney who has represented incarcerated people in excessive force cases against ADOC officers.
The complaints detail incidents occurring in various parts of the prisons — open dormitories and individual cells, but also prison barbershops, chow halls, health care units and bathrooms. Forty-five percent of complainants said officers beat them while they were handcuffed, and 27% alleged the excessive use of chemical spray, two factors cited in the DOJ’s findings.
The state’s highest security and most overcrowded prisons generated the most lawsuits in the time period examined. Donaldson Correctional Facility in Bessemer topped the list with 25 excessive force lawsuits ending in settlement, followed by Holman, St. Clair, Limestone and Bibb.
Some of the complaints include shocking and gruesome details.

2018 assault at Ventress. The complaint stated an officer handcuffed the victim behind his back, then struck him from behind, “breaking his jaw in two places, sending a large portion of his jawbone between his teeth and spraying blood all over the wall.” ADOC settled the lawsuit for $90,000, and according to court documents, terminated the officer who assaulted the man.
2019 incident at Limestone. The complaint stated an officer placed the victim in a takedown position, known to cause “excruciating pain” in the shoulders, then another officer kicked his legs, causing him to fall and strike his head on the floor. Officers then sprayed him with mace, kicked and punched him. The man suffered a traumatic brain injury, permanent hearing loss, and numerous contusions, according to the complaint. The plaintiff was released from prison and died of an overdose in 2023, according to court documents. ADOC settled the lawsuit with his mother for $9,000.
2018 assault at Staton. The complaint stated that two officers sprayed the victim with pepper spray, beat him with batons, kicked and stomped him. The man was flown to a hospital in critical condition, where he was diagnosed with bleeding in the brain, multiple fractures to his ribs, face, head, back and damage to his lungs. The man is now in a long-term VA hospital “bedridden, unable to verbally communicate, and minimally conscious.” ADOC settled the lawsuit filed by his family for $55,000.

Five settlements stemmed from a raid at Holman prison in 2016 by ADOC’s “Correctional Emergency Response Team” or CERT. According to the complaints, CERT members charged into the dorm while the men inside were sleeping, shouting and beating men with batons. At least one man was taken to a hospital with serious injuries. The settlements totaled $13,500.
Two years later, another incident involving CERT at Holman led to an excessive force lawsuit filed by a man who uses a wheelchair. The man handwrote in his complaint that one officer slapped him, another hit him in the head with his baton.
“That blow busted my head and caused me to fall out of my wheelchair flat on the floor face down,” he wrote.
“They kicked and stomped on me so viciously until I defecated on myself. I was knocked out unconscious.” His lawsuit ended in a $7,000 settlement.
 Prisoners injured during a medical event

At least a half dozen complaints alleged that officers used excessive force on incarcerated men who were in need of mental health or medical attention, including two filed by men who said they were beaten while having a seizure.
One such complaint accused officers at Bibb of beating a man with batons while he was suffering an epileptic seizure in the infirmary, “strapped or handcuffed into a gurney.” When his seizure was over and the beating stopped, officers accused the man of using drugs, which he denied, according to the complaint. They then “chained plaintiff to a wall as he continued to bleed and exhibit clear epileptic symptoms.”
The incarcerated man presented witness statements from other prisoners and prison staff to support his claim, but officers argued their use of force was justified because the plaintiff was violent and unrestrained.
A federal judge denied the officers’ motions to dismiss the case.
“The court finds that a reasonable jury would have difficulty not concluding that prison officers beating a fully restrained, possibly unconscious prisoner who had just suffered an epileptic seizure ‘offends contemporary standards of decency,’” U.S. District Judge Karen Owen Bowdre wrote.
ADOC settled the lawsuit for $30,000.

– U.S. District Judge Karen Owen Bowdre


“Excessive force should always be treated like a big deal,” said former Washington Department of Corrections Secretary Steve Sinclair. “If you tolerate or minimize it, that’s what builds a horrible culture. And you shouldn’t have to wait for a court to tell you.”
 Mounting cases, mounting costs

A spike in lawsuits filed against individual officers began in 2020. In the five years before that, ADOC typically filed fewer than 20 claims per year to the General Liability Trust Fund, according to records provided by the Department of Finance. In 2020, the number of claims ticked up to 33, then 58 in 2021. In 2022, facing a surge of lawsuits against officers, ADOC filed 194 liability claims, and then filed 235 in 2023. Complete data for 2024 is not yet available.

 
That flood of lawsuits caused ADOC’s spending from the general liability trust fund to quadruple. Between 2015 and 2019, ADOC accounted for $2.9 million in legal expenses and settlement payments from the fund. In the following five years between 2020 and 2024, ADOC utilized $17.4 million from the General Liability Trust Fund, more than any other state department.
Legal expenses for the defense of officers named in the lawsuits amounted to double the amount of paid settlements. Between 2020 and 2024, payments to private attorneys who were hired to represent ADOC employees topped $12.9 million in that five year period, while indemnity, or settlement payments to plaintiffs, accounted for just $4.4 million. Plaintiffs alleging excessive force received a total of $1.7 million, with a median settlement of just $8,000.
These figures represent only a fraction of ADOC’s overall legal spending since 2020. Legal payments to outside attorneys and law firms for the department’s defense in class action cases amount to over $39.7 million, paid out of the state’s General Fund budget, according to records available in the Open Alabama checkbook database maintained by the Department of Finance. Combined with transactions from the state’s liability trust fund, ADOC has spent over $57 million on legal services since 2020. By comparison, the Alabama Attorney General Office’s General Fund budget this year is about $13.7 million.
“I think it’s fair to ask, how much is too much?” said Rep. Chris England, D-Tuscaloosa, a member of the state’s Joint Prison Oversight Committee and a frequent critic of prison conditions and ADOC spending. “It’s hard to imagine that we were intending to create a fund that just allows us to be in a perpetual state of lawsuits forever. When does the state of Alabama start demanding results from these lawsuits?”

(Photo by Emma Murphy/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — The state’s mental health agency faces billing errors, fraud and information technology vulnerabilities in delivering services, an initial financial examination found. 
Over the next 18 months, the Oklahoma Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services must implement dozens of changes to protect its patients and billing integrity, the review said.
The agency must also prioritize hiring a chief financial officer and internal auditor with deep public sector experience, according to the initial findings released by David Greenwell.
Greenwell, a certified public accountant, was retained by Gov. Kevin Stitt to oversee the department’s finances and examine the reasons for the financial disarray plaguing the agency that has resulted in contracts being cut or canceled and concerns that the agency can’t afford to pay 2,000 employees.
Greenwell’s findings also show that the agency now needs nearly $30 million in emergency funding from the Legislature to pay its bills. That’s about $2.6 million more than had been previously projected last week by Greenwell and Aaron Morris, state’s chief financial officer. 
In the report first released Monday by Stitt, Greenwell wrote Thursday that he’d reached his latest estimate by examining the agency’s actual expenditures and revenues through May 11, and his number “reflects a best-effort projection” using historical data and trend analysis.
But he said he’s also made 52 recommendations that the agency must take to mitigate risks. Key priorities include updating the agency’s ethical code, adopting modern accounting systems and standardizing reimbursement processes.
“These changes will improve patient care by ensuring funds are used effectively, aligning with Oklahoma’s mental health priorities,” Greenwell wrote.
He said the agency must strengthen its internal controls over financial reporting. 
His recommendations anticipate “improving accuracy, compliance, and accountability in managing mental health services across state-owned and private facilities.” Implementation should be phased in over 18 months with some goals quickly achievable, including enhanced training to create a culture of ethical conduct and accountability, he said.
Greenwell said in a statement that nothing about the mental health department “is permanently broken,” and by making “intentional adjustments to procedures,” the agency will get back to business.
Stitt said that the report “is the signal for a new beginning for the department.”
“No one signs up for a job like this thinking they’ll have to take on decades of financial mismanagement. Commissioner (Allie) Friesen has navigated this challenge admirably and has kept me and my team informed every step of the way,” he said in a statement. “Oklahomans will be better off now that we have a handle on this department.”

House Bill 57, which the House and Senate passed in April, would increase the base student allocation, core of the funding formula, by $700 per student, providing a slight year-over-year increase in public school funding.
In a brief message with the veto announcement on Monday, the governor said that there was “no evidence that a permanent increase in the Base Student Allocation will improve educational outcomes. Therefore, this bill in its current form does not serve the best interest of Alaskans.”
The governor was scheduled to hold a news conference at 3 p.m. Monday, and will be broadcast live.
The House and Senate are scheduled to meet at 9 a.m. Tuesday to consider overriding the governor’s veto.

Raymond Crews. (LAI photo)Louisiana high school students might soon be able to take a conservative alternative to the ACT exam to qualify for the state’s popular college scholarship program.
State lawmakers quietly approved an amendment to a bill Monday that would make results from the Classical Learning Test acceptable to qualify for the Taylor Opportunity Program for Students, which provides tuition assistance for qualifying Louisiana students. 
Conservative educators are the chief proponents of the Classical Learning Test, which evaluates students on math, writing and grammar with an emphasis on classic literature and historic documents. Its supporters frequently tout that the exam emphasizes texts that “shaped Western culture.” 
The test has been embraced by conservative lawmakers in Oklahoma, Florida and Arkansas. and has the support of the conservative Cato Institution and Heritage Foundation. 
Oklahoma lawmakers extensively debated embracing the test to qualify for their version of TOPS, with Democrats arguing it doesn’t meet the same academic rigor and anti-cheating measures as the ACT. 
In Louisiana, only Louisiana Christian University and the University of New Orleans Honors College accept the test for admissions, according to the CLT website. 
The change to TOPS acceptance standard was made through an amendment to House Bill 77 by Rep. Chris Turner, R-Ruston, which creates a new level of TOPS awards for high-achieving students. There was no debate on the amendment and it passed without objection. The House approved Turner’s bill in a 91-4 vote. 
Rep. Raymond Crews, R-Bossier City, sponsored the amendment. Crews said Jeremy Tate, founder and CEO of Classical Learning Initiatives, which created and administers the test, asked him to do so. 
Crews said he had not heard of the Classical Learning Test before Tate brought it to him, and he did not know that Tate was associated with the test. 
Turner’s bill was also amended on the House floor to allow students who leave the state for their undergraduate education to use their TOPS awards if they return to Louisiana to attend medical school.

(Courtesy of the Utah House) Rainbow refractions — cascading through a collection of crystals embedded at the peak of the dome above — danced across Dana Jones’ face as she showed off a one-of-a-kind work of art meant to make the Utah Capitol’s newest building something special. 
“We had a vision that we wanted Utahns to connect with this building in a way that if they were going to go on a road trip through Utah, they would be able to see the different landscapes (and its) symbols,” said Jones, executive director of Utah Capitol Preservation Board. 
A group of Utah reporters from various outlets, including Utah News Dispatch, were invited to the Utah Capitol on Monday for the public’s first look at the stained glass dome that’s been installed atop the new building that’s currently under construction to replace what was once known as the State Office Building at the Utah Capitol’s complex in Salt Lake City.

The dome will act as a laylight for the north building’s atrium — and Jones lauded it as one of at least several special works of art state officials will unveil as the north building nears completion. She said it’s expected to be done by the beginning of next year, in time for the Utah Legislature’s 2026 session in January. 
To capture a behind-the-scenes and up-close look at the stained glass masterpiece, reporters were invited to step atop scaffolding more than 200 feet in the air. As construction finishes, the scaffolding will be dismantled — and to most, the dome will only be viewable from hundreds of feet below. But Jones said state officials wanted to show off its vivid colors, textures, hidden symbols and intricate details before the platform came down. 
Glowing with sunlight, hues of blue, red, orange, yellow, green and every color in between poured through its glass. The 25-foot by 25-foot dome featured 89 panels of stained glass made up of 14,000 individual glass pieces. 
Its panes contain at least 34 depictions of Utah landmarks and symbols — some easier to spot than others.

You may have to squint, but hidden in the stained glass lead lines are symbols including a Utahraptor skull, a cougar, a dragonfly, a hummingbird, a lizard, a hopi kokopelli and anasazi symbol of the sun deity, and even an outline of the Great Salt Lake. 
The stained glass mural was designed by lead artist Dallin Orr at the Lehi-based stained glass studio Holdman Studios, selected through a competitive bidding process. Orr told reporters his goal was to capture “harmony” by balancing all of Utah’s “chaotic and diverse biomes,” from the snowy mountain peaks to the deserts — all anchored around the dome’s center point, the sun. 
Karen Ferguson, the building’s architect, said the dome’s shape — its double curve, transitioning from a square frame to a circle that rounds into a dome — makes it unique. 
Her favorite part? The bristlecone pine — made with sand collected from all of Utah’s 29 counties. 
“That has every county in the state, right there,” she said. “And it’s just so iconic of Utah.” 
Before walking reporters up to the top of the building to see the dome, Jones said the project has been “near and dear to my heart,” and that she hopes others will experience a “wow moment” like she did when she first saw it. 
“We want this to connect with Utah,” she said, adding that the stained glass artwork is special because it’s now “part of the historic fabric” of the Utah Capitol complex. “That is pretty special. We have built this to be long lasting, with the 100-plus year context of this building.” 
Jones said when she first saw the completed dome, “it legitimately took my breath away.” 
“At the risk of sounding cheesy, it was an emotional thing for me,” she said. “When you pour your heart and everything into a project. … I mean, this is part of history.”

Jones said for her, the elk seen trudging through the snow from behind a pine tree evoked memories of her dad — who she said died in the ’90s while elk hunting after he suffered from a heart attack. “He died doing what he loved,” she said. 
Like her, Jones said she hopes Utahns looking up at the mural will find something special they can “connect” with “in their own way.” 
The dome cost $1.6 million to complete, according to Jones — a price tag that she said was well worth it to create an iconic piece of art that will become “the historic fabric of this building.”
“It deserves to have the presence that it has,” she said. “Especially when it represents all things Utah.”

(Katie McKellar / Utah News Dispatch)
The dome is just one piece of a larger construction project that’s been underway at the Utah Capitol complex since 2022. At its groundbreaking, state officials estimated the building would cost about $165 million, but since then its price tag has hit about $208 million, with state officials blaming construction inflation for the price increases, the Deseret News reported. 
When combined with another $73 million for renovations to the Utah Capitol complex’s central plaza fountain and an underground parking structure for lawmakers and state employees, the entire construction project has totaled about $281 million, according to state officials. 
The new north building will replace the old State Office Building, which was built in the 1960s. For years, state leaders had eyed replacing the building, which was not only aging and in need of upgrades, but didn’t fit with the rest of the Utah Capitol complex. 
Now, the new north building will not only match the white stone and marble styling of the rest of the Utah Capitol’s buildings, but it will be more than just an office space for state employees. It will also be the new home for the “Museum of Utah,” as well as offer conference rooms, and other spaces for the public. 
The entire construction project, along with redoing the outdoor plaza and the underground parking lot, is all meant to create more space and help better connect Utahns with their Capitol. 
“We’re doing all this,” Jones said, “to make coming to the people’s house easier.”

Federal fallout

	
As federal funding and systems dwindle, states are left to decide how and whether to make up the difference.
Read the latest


With the brief window for fiddlehead foraging nearing its close, citizens of the Mi’kmaq Nation hope to collect the traditional food source this week from the Aroostook River flood plain to test as part of their research into understanding, and in turn reducing, forever chemicals in the food supply.
However, they may no longer be able to afford to do the testing they’d planned. 
Following months of preparation after securing federal funding in September, the team received an email from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s Office of Mission Support on May 13 stating that their four-year grant had been terminated, effective immediately. 
“The objectives of the award are no longer consistent with EPA funding priorities,” the email read. 
The EPA terminated all of the ten grants it had awarded for research into reducing per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances, otherwise known as PFAS, in plants and animals, including two others to Maine-based teams led by the Passamaquoddy Tribe and the University of Maine. PFAS have been linked to long term adverse health outcomes, such as cancers and weakened immune systems, and their pervasiveness in agriculture is not fully understood. 
The termination of these grants, each for roughly $1.6 million, are some of the latest examples of the billions of federal dollars the Trump administration has blocked despite already being appropriated by U.S. Congress. 
“It’s complete overreach,” said Chelli Stanley, co-founder of an organization committed to cleaning contaminated land, Upland Grassroots, which is part of the research team headed by the Mi’kmaq Nation. “We’re going to appeal. We’re also seeking legal aid.”
Mi’kmaq Nation, Passamaquoddy Tribe, UMaine awarded federal grants for forever chemical research

The Passamaquoddy Tribe also plans to appeal the termination of its grant, said Marvin Cling, environmental director for the Sipayik Environmental Department at Pleasant Point. UMaine did not provide comment regarding whether they intend to dispute the decision by the time of publication. 
The grantees have 30 days from their termination notices to make the case that their work is in compliance with the EPA’s priorities. But crafting that argument is complicated by the fact that the EPA has given contradictory statements regarding why the grants were terminated and whether or not they are in line with the agency’s priorities. 
Conflicting agency response
In a statement provided to Maine Morning Star in response to a request as to why the research no longer aligns with priorities, the EPA equated the grants with Diversity, Equity and Inclusion measures. 
“As with any change in administration, the EPA has been reviewing all of its grant programs and awarded grants to ensure each is an appropriate use of taxpayer dollars and to understand how those programs align with administration priorities,” the EPA Press Office wrote. “Maybe the Biden-Harris administration shouldn’t have forced their radical agenda of wasteful DEI programs and ‘environmental justice’ preferencing on the EPA’s core mission of protecting human health and the environment treating tribes and Alaska Natives as such.”
There is no mention of DEI or environmental justice in the Maine teams’ research plans or overall objectives of the grant program.
“This is a matter of public health,” said Frey Corey, information technology director for the Mi’kmaq Nation who is a researcher for the Tribes’ grant. Corey has worked with the EPA since 1996 when he started managing natural resources for the Tribe. 
“There’s been funding challenges over the years — there’s no doubt about that,” Corey said. “But in terms of how they’re operating, this is really unusual.”

Democratic U.S. Rep Chellie Pingree of Maine, who helped secure that funding as a member of the House Appropriations Committee, told Maine Morning Star this response from the EPA was “not only incredibly disappointing, it’s absurd.” 
“To suggest that supporting tribal health and environmental safety — in this case, by studying PFAS contamination in their ancestral waters — is some kind of ‘radical agenda’ is both offensive and deeply ignorant,” Pingree said. “How many times do we have to make clear to this administration that tribes are not ‘DEI’?”
The response the EPA provided to Maine Morning Star runs counter to the agency’s press releases in recent weeks, which highlight a focus on combating PFAS contamination, including through partnerships with tribes. It is also directly at odds with the response EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin gave to Pingree about the grant terminations during an Appropriations subcommittee hearing on Thursday. 
After Zeldin outlined that addressing PFAS contamination is a priority for the agency and him personally, Pingree asked, “Since these grants are consistent with the EPA priorities, do you know why they were terminated?” 
Zeldin responded, “It’s an important program. It’s something that’s congressionally appropriated. The agency’s going through a reorg, so the way that the program and these grants are administered are going to be different going forward.”
In early May, the agency announced a significant reorganization with major cuts to staffing, especially to its Office of Research and Development, the part of the agency that provides scientific analysis on environmental hazards. Pingree has called those changes a blatant abuse of public health and the agency’s core mission. 
Pingree told Maine Morning Star that she felt Zeldin’s response on Thursday was a non-answer.
“The only good thing was he did emphasize that he understood it was appropriated funds,” Pingree said. 










Either Administrator Zeldin was disingenuous with me and our subcommittee, or he and his agency aren’t on the same page.


– U.S. Rep. Chellie Pingree


But in light of the EPA’s response to Maine Morning Star, Pingree added, “Either Administrator Zeldin was disingenuous with me and our subcommittee, or he and his agency aren’t on the same page.” 
Republican U.S. Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, who chairs the Senate Appropriations Committee, also told Maine Morning Star she reached out to the agency last week about the grant terminations and is continuing to press leadership to get a clear answer about their status. 
“Research into PFAS mitigation is critically important for our farmers and rural communities, work I am urging the EPA to continue without delay,” Collins said in a statement. “Terminating PFAS grants would be an extremely damaging development.”
Regardless of the reason, Pingree said she considers the termination to be illegal and unconstitutional. 
She is encouraging the grantees to go through the appeals process but said she will continue to question EPA leadership on the terminations, including during hearings for the proposed budget, which outlines a 55% funding cut to the EPA that would directly impact the Maine Department of Environmental Protection. 
Maine has spearheaded efforts to address PFAS contamination. It was the first state to require manufacturers to report intentionally added PFAS in their products and has established a host of assistance programs to help farms continue to operate while also protecting public health.
“It’s just doubly cruel of the EPA to take that money back from Maine when we’ve been such a leader in dealing with this critical toxin in our environment that we have so much more work to do on,” Pingree said.
The research 
The research these grants were supporting in Maine showed promise for helping farmers, communities and consumers detect and prevent PFAS from accumulating in their food, water and soil. It also represents a new model that centers Indigenous communities who have deep knowledge of the land on which this work is being conducted. 
The collaboration between the Mi’kmaq Nation, University of Virginia, Upland Grassroots and Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station dates back to 2019, when they came together to test ways to clean toxins from the former Loring Airforce Base in Aroostook County, which now belongs to the Mi’kmaq Nation.

The team has seen early success with using hemp plants to remove PFAS from soil — a process called phytoremediation. These are the findings that led the group to apply for the EPA grant to further study how this method and others can help reduce contamination from irrigation on farms, a well-known reality for Aroostook County.
After receiving the grant in September, the team began the initial phase of the research, which has three overarching focuses.
Randy Martin, executive director of the Central Aroostook County Soil and Water Conservation District, planned to study how irrigation from the Aroostook River causes PFAS build up in soil and then ultimately in crops. Martin started this winter monitoring contamination levels, watering plants using the Aroostook River and harvesting them for testing. 
The Mi’kmaq Nation is focused on how widespread PFAS contamination is in the ecosystem, including medicinal and culturally relevant plants, such as fiddleheads as well as ash wood, which the Tribe has long used for basketweaving.  
With the grant now in limbo, the team is planning to freeze these samples with the hope that they can still be studied in the future, as testing makes up the bulk of the cost. 
Researchers at the University of Virginia created biosensors to detect PFAS, a twist on the idea of sentinel plants, which are alternative species that display visible symptoms of infection to provide warning signs. Bryan Berger, associate professor of chemical engineering at UVA, said the grant was going to help expand testing to the field. 
“Our work is directly focused on delivering solutions to farmers and communities affected, which we did and continue to do now,” Berger said. “It also provides crucial data for regulatory decisions, and offers industries a cost-effective compliance tool — ultimately safeguarding public health while reducing environmental remediation costs across all sectors.”
Before the EPA terminated the grant, the team published a paper demonstrating how one application of this technology could be used in monitoring environmental water quality and a report for growers that shows how PFAS accumulates in potatoes grown in northern Maine.
“We’re proud of how much we accomplished in a short time, and frustrated we weren’t given the chance to complete our work,” Berger said. 
Berger, Stanley and Corey said the team is committed to continuing its research despite the grant termination. If it is not eventually reinstated, they plan to explore private funds. 
The other two Maine-based projects had similar but distinct aims. 
UMaine’s project was to examine ways to disrupt the PFAS contamination cycle, including by limiting the chemical uptake by forages (plants eaten by livestock), livestock, and animal byproducts such as milk, meat and manure. The EPA terminated UMaine’s grant on May 10, according to its website.
The Passamaquoddy Tribe, specifically the Sipayik Environmental Department at Pleasant Point, planned to assess PFAS in water and fish from watersheds in Tribal and disadvantaged regions of Northeastern Maine to inform the health of those in the area who depend on recreational fisheries as food sources. The Tribe had been in the process of hiring someone to do the research when it received notice of its grant termination on May 12, Cling said.

(Photo by Jacquelyn Jimenez Romero/Washington State Standard)On his first day, Washington Gov. Bob Ferguson angered many Democratic lawmakers by demanding the Legislature put $100 million in the next state budget to help local police departments hire police officers.
“That idea was a cornerstone of my campaign for Governor. Any budget I sign must include this funding,” he said in his Jan. 15 inaugural address.
On Monday, there were clear signs of a rapprochement as Ferguson signed House Bill 2015 that embeds a $100 million grant program in a broad policy bill designed to let local and tribal governments decide how best to use those dollars – even if that means not hiring a single new cop.
“It’s a wonderful bill,” Ferguson said, celebrating the political win flanked by Democratic legislators, uniformed officers, and local government leaders. He insisted it will improve public safety and result in more officers on streets across Washington.
“It’s going to be a big step forward. I have no doubt about that,” he said. “Jurisdictions will make their choices, but there’s going to be significant investments in new law enforcement officers. I don’t think there’s any other way to interpret what we did here today.”
The measure signed Monday aims to strike a balance by allowing for spending on more than just police hiring, which many Democrats view skeptically as the best path to improve public safety. 
It allows use of grants to hire and retain not only officers but also peer counselors and behavioral health personnel “working in co-response to increase community policing and public safety.” Crisis intervention training and other areas, like emergency management planning and community assistance programs, are among the additional spending options.
“This is a good law. Public safety is about the community. This bill is from the community, for the community,” said Rep. Debra Entenman, D-Kent, the bill’s prime sponsor. “I want police in communities. I want good and fair policing.”
Bumpy road
Democrats hold near super majorities in the House and Senate. Many of them winced when Ferguson drew a line in the legislative sand in his first speech and winced again when he endorsed the approach in a bill sponsored by Sen. Jeff Holy, R-Cheney.
It remained a sore point all session long as the legislation evolved through many iterations.
On April 15, the Members of Color Caucus in the Senate restated their opposition in a letter to Ferguson.
“While we understand your administration intends to move forward with this law enforcement funding request, we ask that you also commit — equally and unequivocally — to meeting the long-neglected needs that disproportionately affect communities of color,” reads the letter signed by a dozen Democratic senators.
The message echoed what the Legislative Black Caucus told Ferguson in a January meeting.
They said if there was going to be $100 million to beef up the ranks of law enforcement, there should be at least as much to shore up social services and other supportive programs in communities.
“It can’t be all cops all the time,” said Rep. Kristine Reeves, D-Federal Way, chair of the Legislative Black Caucus, following the meeting. “We want to invest in public safety. We want to invest in strong and strategic public safety that meets all communities’ needs.”
Ultimately the bill passed by margins of 55-42 in the House and 30-19 in the Senate. Only five Republican lawmakers, including Holy, supported the bill.
Reeves, who did vote for it, stood alongside Ferguson as he signed the bill Monday.
“I don’t think every community is going to hire a cop,” she said. “The whole point of this legislation was, how do we give local communities local control to determine what best suits their public safety needs.”
How it works
The Washington State Criminal Justice Training Commission will develop and administer the grant program. As written, the state dollars must be allotted by June 30, 2028.
Cities and counties can access the grant money if they’ve already imposed either of two existing public safety sales taxes.
In addition, the bill offers local governments the ability to adopt a new 0.1% sales tax without voter approval to pay for criminal justice expenses. 
The local sales tax revenue could go toward costs such as public defenders, domestic violence services, and programs to help connect formerly incarcerated people with jobs.
Lawmakers also decided governments can’t impose the new tax if voters have rejected a similar tax proposal in the past two years.
The new law sets other criteria for qualifying for grant dollars. 
For example, 25% of officers would have to complete a 40-hour crisis intervention training. The bill originally set this benchmark at 80%. 
Other hurdles departments must clear to access the money include implementing model policies on use-of-force and other issues, completing trauma-informed training for all officers and complying with a law that restricts police from helping with federal immigration enforcement.
Ferguson made the grant program a centerpiece of his 2024 campaign because, he said, Washington is ranked last in the nation in police staffing per capita. 
When asked Monday if this law is enough to move the needle, he said, “I don’t know the answer. It’s going to help.”",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_1620-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-05-19 18:08:08.053426

(Photo by Illustration Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)Lawmakers on a Senate panel approved measures meant to bolster vaccine uptake and better prepare for future outbreaks in divided votes Monday, showing some vaccine doubts spurred by the pandemic have persisted in New Jersey.
Both measures received votes of 5-3 from the Senate’s health committee Monday, with all Democrats voting yes and all Republicans opposed. The first bill would require automatic enrollment in the state’s vaccine registry, with some ability to opt out. The other is a resolution urging the state’s residents to get immunized as vaccination rates fall and residents again contract some diseases once thought to be eradicated within the United States.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention last week reported 1,024 confirmed measles cases across 31 states — including three in New Jersey — so far in 2025, up sharply from the 285 confirmed cases reported for all of 2024. Three, including two unvaccinated children, have died after contracting measles this year.
“As a pediatrician, words cannot express the angst that is felt in our profession when we know these deaths were preventable,” said Dr. Jennifer Chuang, vice president-elect of the New Jersey chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics. 
The vaccine registry bill would require individuals not already enrolled in the New Jersey Immunization Information System, the state’s vaccine registry, to be entered there when they next receive a vaccine.
It would allow patients — or their parents or guardians — to file written requests not to be entered into the registry, though another portion of the bill would allow the commissioner of health to deny such requests during public health emergencies or outbreaks of communicable diseases, among some others.
“By making the NJIIS registry an opt-out system rather than an opt-in, the state will be able to gather more data to be better prepared for the next pandemic,” said Sen. Joe Vitale (D-Middlesex), the legislation’s prime sponsor and the panel’s chair.
Under existing law, children born beginning in 1998 are automatically enrolled in the registry unless their parent or guardian opts out.
Critics of the bill said automatic enrollment could turn some away from vaccination.
“I think that this could end up having a, once again, unintended consequence of people who may have ordinarily gone in and gotten a certain vaccine deciding not to because now they’re automatically put into a registry because of any sort of potential threat of any sort of outbreak, even if it’s inapplicable to why the person’s going in,” said Sen. Holly Schepisi (R-Bergen).
The resolution, a type of legislation with limited force of law, urges the Department of Health to increase awareness of measles within New Jersey, like by sending mailers on the benefits of vaccines and how to obtain them. The department is not required to comply with the resolution’s urgings.
Dr. Susan Boruchoff, director of clinical services and education at the Robert Wood Johnson Medical School’s immunology and infectious diseases division, noted that the nation had “just about completely eradicated measles from this country.”
“We had declared it eradicated — completely gone,” Boruchoff said. “To have cases is different.”
The rise in measles cases has coincided with declines in uptake of the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine, more commonly called the MMR vaccine. Statewide, 90.4% of New Jersey teens aged 13 to 17 had received two doses of the MMR vaccine, the Department of Health said in an August 2024 brief.
Uptake rates for the MMR vaccine, which is typically administered to children no older than six, are lower in some counties, according to Chuang.
In Ocean County, 84.8% of students met school vaccination requirements in the 2023-2024 school year. Researchers have said a 95% vaccination rate is needed to maintain herd immunity against measles.
Anti-vaccine activists who testified to oppose the resolution charged vaccines were broadly ineffective, citing prevention rates for flu vaccines, which target specific prominent strains of influenza and vary in efficacy year-to-year.
There’s little doubt the full Senate could find the votes to approve the measure, though protests over past vaccine measures could make that search more difficult.
In late 2019, months before New Jersey reported its first case of COVID-19, thousands of anti-vaccine protestors descended on the Statehouse for days of concerted protests targeting a bill that would have ended the state’s religious exemption to school, child care, and university vaccine requirements.
Those protests — which included an appearance from anti-vaccine campaigner Robert Kennedy Jr., who is now U.S. secretary of health and human services, and enough calls to jam clog members’ phone systems — stalled the legislation after peeling away support from a handful of Democrats in the Senate.

Lucy Renaud and Kingsten Zenick are reporters with the Community News Service, a University of Vermont journalism internship, on assignment for the Montpelier BridgeFive years of survival through a global pandemic, historic flooding and a withering moviegoing crowd, and the Savoy Theater is still standing.The two-screen theater in downtown Montpelier remains a hangout for people who want to share their love of cinema, a role its owners are dedicated to keeping up. “Reality is, if you don’t see a movie in the theaters, you can watch it later and watch it at home. So we have to make the experience unique; it has to be special to make you come out and watch the movie here,” said owner James O’Hanlon. “Part of that is just what we are showing: Showing films that leave people completely moved and almost as if their lives have been changed — that’s what we are here for.”The rise of streaming services as people’s preferred movie-viewing mechanism has forced theaters across the country to close their doors. Vermont hasn’t escaped those headwinds: Merrill’s Roxy Cinema in Burlington shuttered this past fall, ending a 43-year run in the state’s biggest city.But with post-flood renovations completed in the basement and upgrades to the theater’s upstairs pending, O’Hanlon and crew are hitting back against the streaming surge. The plan? Focusing on a curated selection of arthouse and indie flicks, promoting local filmmakers and offering wine and beer alongside the usual popcorn and candy.The Savoy first opened under Rick Winston in 1981. Alongside the folks at Capitol Theater, a more traditional theater that had operated for decades around the corner, Winston helped foster a local following of film lovers in the city before selling to Terry Youk in 2009.Youk recruited several local carpenters and volunteers to help with major renovations on the building, including the transformation of what was originally a basement video store into a second theater room. Among those who volunteered a day to help with renovations was O’Hanlon, who eventually bought the place from Youk in 2016. He recalls instantly falling in love with the Savoy. The theater is one of the few spots for arthouse films in the state. To O’Hanlon, it felt like home.“I look at my role as sort of the steward or curator of facilitating what it’s gonna take to keep this place going,” he said. “And I love movies too. That’s why I believe in it and keep it alive.”He understands streaming at home is typically the more affordable and easier option these days. And generational divides in moviegoing habits have been tricky to navigate: “The older crowd is the loyal base,” he said. Younger people — less so. But he feels a theater can offer something you just can’t get from your laptop or living room.“Certain films are cinematic,” he said, invoking that elusive sense of spectacle, grandness. “And you’re gonna lose something if you don’t watch it on a real screen like that.”And there’s something special, he said, about the collective buzz of a theater audience all tuned in to the same experience.Closing shop in 2020 because of Covid — and again for almost nine weeks after the 2023 floods — only reinforced the idea of getting people to come out and be together.The Savoy goes beyond screenings to host panel talks, rom-com-themed craft nights, cinema club meetings and showings of staff favorites. The latter, a series called “Movies We Love,” focuses on older films. “That will draw in a new audience who hasn’t seen them before, as well as people who have seen them before but love to come and see the films again,” O’Hanlon said. The theater also looks to bolster the local film community by getting involved with the annual Green Mountain Film Festival. The multiday event, held in Montpelier, features screenings in both the city’s theaters and has been running for more than two decades. Last year it returned from a four-year, pandemic-driven break.In the end, the Savoy’s persistence only exists because of people who care. O’Hanlon is quick to credit local support for the theater’s staying in business. “This place only exists because of the community here,” he said. “Not because of me. It’s here because the people in this community love it.”Read the story on VTDigger here:  In Montpelier, the Savoy’s show goes on despite theater industry slump.",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/savoy-theatre-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-05-19 18:08:08.053426

The Trump administration is waging economic warfare against Massachusetts by turning political points into lethal policies that weaken higher education, life sciences, maritime trade, and tourism -- key pillars of our economy that account for about one-third of the state’s gross domestic product. 
The post Massachusetts is under economic attack  appeared fi[...]","THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION is waging economic warfare against Massachusetts by turning political points into lethal policies that weaken several of our pillar industries: higher education, life sciences, maritime trade,  and tourism. These industries account for about one-third of the state’s gross domestic product. Recently, I completed a study assessing the near and longer-term impact of these actions on state economic growth, jobs and tax revenue collection. The study confirmed that Massachusetts is disproportionately affected by the policy trifecta — deep cuts in federal funding, high trade tariffs, and immigration crackdowns. Collectively, these policies are a giant wrecking ball to the state’s economy.   Start with the White House’s federal spending cuts. At the center of Massachusetts’s knowledge-based economy is higher education and life sciences, accounting for almost 20 percent of GDP.  The state is the third largest recipient of National Institutes of Health funding, totaling $3.5 billion annually, spread out over 6,000 grants and 220 recipients. Grant recipients include colleges, universities, medical centers, and research institutions. Mass General Brigham is at the top of the list, garnering over $655 million.  Federal funding strengthens the state’s “eds and meds” economy, fueling biotech, drug discovery, and innovation.  This funding supports over 140,000 jobs, generating spinoff technologies and startups, creating even more jobs — a multiplier effect that, at 2.5 times, swells the yearly economic benefit to $9 billion. Deep NIH cuts in 2026 could reduce economic activity by $1.4 to $2.2 billion, with a loss of 14,000 jobs.  If cuts persist, losses could reach 64,000 by 2028. The higher-skilled brain drain has started as scientists and researchers relocate to countries that provide better biotech-friendly opportunities. These cuts, if not stopped, could eventually undermine the state’s dominant position in life sciences.  Trade is also an important driver, accounting for over 9 percent of the state’s economic activity.  Massachusetts trades over $62 billion in goods annually, with Canada, China, and Mexico its largest trading partners.  Having a trading surplus, Massachusetts sells more goods than it buys.  Typical exports include medical devices, high-tech instruments, and pharmaceuticals.  Purchases include gasoline, motor vehicles, lumber and electricity.  Tariffs have proven to be a destructive economic policy, fueling higher costs, damaging market confidence, spending and shrinking trade. By 2026, tariff hikes could erase $12.8 billion in state economic growth, almost $1 billion in tax revenue, and up to 79,000 jobs.   If not lessened, the “tariff war” could also become a transmission mechanism for the next recession. In an ominous sign, US first quarter GDP declined. Should this trend persist, the nation could hit full recession by June, and Massachusetts would follow. If a recession occurs, economic losses to the state could double.   The immigrant population, totaling 1.4 million people, is vital to the Massachusetts economy.  Foreign-born residents account for 20 percent of the state’s population, 23 percent of the labor force, and 25 percent of entrepreneurs. The state ranks fifth in the nation in percentage of foreign-born residents, even above Texas.  Foreign-born workers support the lower-end service industries and highest value-add STEM industries.  Annual state and local taxes paid by immigrants top $7 billion. The undocumented immigrant workforce of 400,000 is concentrated in several industries including construction, food services, manufacturing, and health care.  An immigration crackdown will also shrink the flow of legal immigrants needed to fill job openings and spur future economic growth. Last year, Massachusetts’s labor supply growth was generated entirely by incoming immigrants. Given the state’s low unemployment rates, even a modest reduction in the immigrant workforce would lead to a significant labor shortage. In 2026, tighter immigration policies could cost the state up to $3.9 billion in lost spending, $481 million in lost tax revenue, and 45,000 fewer workers, over 4,000 of whom are entrepreneurs. Government policies can also have damaging ripple effects. Last year, 82,000 international students enrolled in our higher education institutions, spending $3.9 billion and supporting about 36,000 jobs. Travel bans, visa cancelations, student deportations, and threats to block foreign students from universities have elevated fear and anxiety. Unfriendly immigration policies could dampen international student enrollments and financially harm area colleges and universities. Northeastern University, Boston University, Harvard, MIT, and UMass Amherst top the list with the highest concentration of international students.  On a statewide basis, a 10 percent enrollment decline could cost higher education $390 million annually.   Anti-immigration policies could also harm the state’s vibrant $24 billion tourist industry, which accounts for almost 4 percent of GDP. Each year, over 50 million people visit the Bay State, over 2.1 million of whom are foreign visitors.  A 30 percent drop in foreign visitors would cost over $1 billion through 2028.   In response to this economic attack, Massachusetts should plan and respond aggressively.  Gov. Healey’s recently announced state hiring freeze is a good first step. But other actions need to be taken. The governor’s office should gain valuable stakeholder input and create a detailed “Mass.  Strong” action plan.  Similar to under Covid, given the current extent of economic uncertainty, for the FY 2026 budget, state legislators should refrain from adopting a full-year budget and endorse month-to-month spending plans until the full impact of White House moves is clearer. Stress-testing must be part of the budgeting process, including analysis of how the state would handle moderate to severe reductions in federal Medicaid reimbursement.  Legal challenges against Trump administration orders should also be intensified; doing so will throw sand in the works, reducing policy harm. To magnify the state’s legal punch, greater funds than previously proposed by the House should be allocated to the attorney general To protect the state’s leadership in life sciences and counter lost NIH funding, a public-private partnership applying a venture capital model approach should be created.  Massachusetts also needs to protect its labor force supply and assert itself as a welcoming and safe place for immigrants to live, work, and study.  Lastly, a targeted campaign to encourage foreign tourists to visit the Bay State should also be undertaken. Doing so will help, reduce the economic blow of Trump anti-immigration policies. Responding to the economic threat in a planned, coordinated, and timely manner will also help Massachusetts better prepare for the economic uncertainty and wobbly economy that is most likely ahead.  Mark Williams is a finance professor at Boston University’s Questrom School of Business and past president of the Boston Economic Club. The post Massachusetts is under economic attack  appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Massachusetts-General-Hospital-2-2-1.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-05-19 18:08:08.053426

(Photo by Marga Buschbell-Steeger/Getty Images)State officials say a new Technology and Innovation Office within New Mexico’s Economic Development Department is expected to advance economic growth in the state and provide funding for startup companies.
House Bill 20, sponsored by Rep. Meredith Dixon (D-Albuquerque) during the most recent legislative session, establishes the Technology and Innovation Office, as well as the Research, Development and Deployment Fund with more than $90 million appropriated to support early tech businesses; match funds for research and development; support recruitment and retention; and boost New Mexico’s quantum technologies sector. 
“There is a lot going on in this state. We have some of the best talent and technology coming out of the labs and our universities,” Dixon told Source NM. “I would say that one of the most important things we can do is make sure that the companies that start here are able to stay here.”
According to a news release from the EDD, the department’s new division will “absorb the existing Office of Strategy, Science and Technology” and the office’s director, Nora Meyers Sackett, will continue in her role.
Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham signed the bill on April 9 and it goes into effect on July 1. 
“New Mexico’s trajectory in the fields of science and technology is clear, and this landmark investment accelerates that,” Lujan Grisham said in a statement. “With our deep bench in innovation, we’re creating momentum that will drive prosperity well into the future.”
HB20 also establishes the Technology and Innovation Network Advisory Board, representing New Mexico’s national labs, universities, the private sector and several other economic areas, and will help administer the Research, Development and Deployment Fund.
Dixon noted that in a 2021 report, the Economic Development Department identified nine target industries to help diversify the state’s economy, including aerospace; biosciences; cybersecurity; film and television; outdoor recreation; sustainable and value-added agriculture; intelligent manufacturing; global trade; and sustainable and green energy. She added that these sectors offer “high-growth” and “high-paying” jobs for a wide range of New Mexicans.
“New Mexico is uniquely positioned in a number of these high growth science and technology sectors,” Dixon said. “This is the time when the state needs to commit to supporting these industries and really getting them off the ground and having an entity in state government that supports and works with these industries to make sure that they have the tools that they need.”

(Lily O'Shea Becker/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — A Kansas reproductive rights advocacy group, backed by a Washington, D.C. law firm, sued state officials over a new law banning financial contributions from “foreign nationals” to support or oppose constitutional amendments.
The group, Kansans for Constitutional Freedom, argued in a complaint filed in federal court Friday that House Bill 2106, which passed the Legislature in April and is set to go into effect July 1, is broad, vague and unconstitutional. The group said the bill inhibits its ability to advocate for or against future constitutional amendments. Kansans for Constitutional Freedom and its donors have received contributions from foreign nationals, the lawsuit said.
The complaint drew a connection between HB 2106 and opposition to the 2022 ballot measure that sought to limit reproductive rights. Voters rejected the proposed constitutional amendment by a 59-41 margin.
“Rather than accept that an overwhelming majority of Kansas voters rejected the 2022 Amendment on its merits, opponents of abortion rights blamed ‘foreign influence’ for their failure at the ballot box,” the complaint said. “Moreover, HB 2106 was meant to make it harder for KCF specifically to engage in advocacy related to Kansas constitutional ballot initiatives.”
Kansans for Constitutional Freedom was the primary engine of opposition to the 2022 amendment, spending more than $11 million in a statewide campaign encouraging voter turnout. In the lawsuit, the organization said it intends to advocate for or against constitutional amendments in the future.
The lawsuit references a forthcoming constitutional amendment that will appear on voters’ ballots in August 2026 that seeks to elect Kansas Supreme Court justices by popular vote, abandoning the current nomination and appointment system. The organization argues the restrictions within HB 2106 are “targeted not at the ‘foreign interests’ Kansas claims it means to silence, but at those who associate with them.”
“Through a series of exceedingly broad, highly invasive, and at times completely incomprehensible restrictions, HB 2106 will muzzle the speech of U.S. citizens and domestic organizations far more effectively than that of the foreign nationals Kansas claims it means to target,” the lawsuit read.
HB 2106 retroactively prohibits indirect or direct contributions from a foreign national used for promoting or opposing a constitutional amendment. Any person involved in campaigning for or against an amendment already has to submit a series of campaign finance reports, and the bill added a new provision requiring non-foreign donors to certify they haven’t received more than $100,000 in the preceding four years from foreign nationals. If the law goes into effect, any person who knowingly received $100,000 or more in contributions from a foreign national in the past four years is barred from participating in constitutional advocacy for up to four years.
The lawsuit named nine members of the Kansas Governmental Ethics Commission, the commission’s executive director, Wade Wiebe, and Kansas Attorney General Kris Kobach, who is permitted under HB 2106 to bring criminal charges against anyone who violates its provisions. The ethics commission, which is set to be renamed as the Kansas Public Disclosure Commission under a new law that takes effect in July, is able to bring civil action against those who violate HB 2106.
During the bill’s legislative hearings, proponents took particular issue with the Sixteen Thirty Fund, a left-leaning dark money group that has received millions from foreigners and involved itself in ballot measure campaigns across the U.S. Kansans for Constitutional Freedom took in more than $1.5 million in donations from the fund in 2022, according to Open Secrets, an independent website that tracks money in politics.
Topeka-based law firm Irigonegaray and Revenaugh, a criminal defense and personal injury firm, and the D.C.-based Elias Law Group, which has challenged and drawn ire from the Trump administration, are representing Kansans for Constitutional Freedom.

  The Wisconsin Examiner’s Criminal Justice Reporting Project shines a light on incarceration, law enforcement and criminal justice issues with support from the Public Welfare Foundation.
“Melissa’s family desperately wants to know where she is, and the Tribe is fully committed to helping its law enforcement agency exhaust every investigative resource to find her and bring her home,” said T.J. Bill, LDF Tribal Police Chief, in a press release.
Beson is a Native American female, 5’7”, with a medium build, brown hair and brown eyes.  She has numerous tattoos, including on her neck, arms and legs.
She was reported missing on March 23, 2025.  The last confirmed sighting of her was on Monday, March 17, 2025, during the late afternoon. At that time, Beson was observed walking on Indian Village Road, near Wayman Lane, in Lac du Flambeau. When last seen, she wore red sweatpants, a black sleeveless shirt and a gray sweatshirt. 
“The Lac du Flambeau Tribal Police Department (LDFTPD) remains steadfast in its investigation into Melissa’s disappearance,” said Bill.  “Every lead, no matter how small, is being thoroughly pursued to find her. Authorities have searched relentlessly in the area where Melissa was last seen, as well as other areas of interest.  LDFTPD Officers and assisting agencies have conducted grid searches on foot, have deployed high-tech drones and airplanes, and have searched using specially trained canines. To date, over 3,400 acres have been carefully searched.”
Based on the information his office has received, Bill told the Wisconsin Examiner two theories about Beson’s disappearance have been pursued: she either walked out into the forest and became lost and is probably deceased, or she left the area and is living with other persons.
Besides the large-scale searches for Beson, coordination with other law enforcement agencies has been conducted regarding reports of Beson being in another community in the Wausau area, but follow-up investigations have yet to produce any information on Beson’s whereabouts.
“The reward offered by the Tribe will be apportioned as deemed just by the Tribe, in the event, for example, multiple credible tips are received, which lead to the discovery of Melissa Beson and/or the arrest and charging of anyone responsible for her disappearance,” said Bill.
Employees of law enforcement and correctional agencies are not eligible to collect the reward.
Anyone with information regarding Beson’s disappearance or location is asked to call the Lac du Flambeau Tribal Police Department at (715) 588-7717 or the Vilas County Sheriff’s Office at (715) 479-4441.

In all, 562 state lawmakers from 50 states and the District of Columbia signed the letter a letter.
The effort was organized by the State Innovation Exchange’s Reproductive Freedom Leadership Council (SiX RFLC) and  comes after anti-abortion lawmakers in Congress released a draft budget cutting off Planned Parenthood and other abortion providers from Medicaid funds.
Reps. LaVon Bracy Davis, Kevin Chambliss, Anna Eskamani, Rita Harris, Dianne Hart, and Felicia Robinson signed the letter. So did Sens. Shevrin Jones, Tina Polsky, and Darryl Rouson.
The State Innovation Exchange was founded in 2014 when the Center for State Innovation, the Progressive States Network, and the American Legislative and Issue Campaign Exchange (ALICE) merged. SiX works to promote racial, gender, social, and economic justice.
According to Kaiser Family Foundation (KFF) one in three women have been to a Planned Parenthood health center for care, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. In Florida, almost 100,000 patients relied on Planned Parenthood health centers for care last year – from birth control and cancer screenings, to STI treatment and wellness visits.

“Planned Parenthood is an irreplaceable part of our health care system in Florida,” Laura Goodhue, executive director of the Florida Alliance of Planned Parenthood Affiliates, said in a prepared release.
“These lawmakers understand that ‘defunding’ Planned Parenthood would shut down health centers and leave patients across our state without access to essential and affordable health care. We are proud to work alongside them to continue fighting relentlessly for access to affordable reproductive health care for all Floridians.”
Indeed, Planned Parenthood officials told the Florida Phoenix earlier this month that their clinics expanded their offerings in Florida after the state’s six week abortion ban took effect on May 1, 2024.
“We’ve expanded our service line. I think it’s important for the community to know we do much more than abortion care. We do vasectomies, we do prenatal care, we do fertility care. We do menopausal care. It’s not just abortions and STDs (sexually transmitted diseases).

The legislation, which was assured of passage by the Senate later Monday, is the product of intense negotiations resolved with unusual alacrity by traditional antagonists at the state Capitol on business and insurance issues: unions vs. business, and trial lawyers vs. insurers.
Without the legislative clarification Monday, public and private employers were facing a 235% jump in premiums on workers’ compensation, costing municipal, state and private employers an estimated $320 million a year, according to state and business analysis.
The unanimous court decision issued March 18 in Gardner vs. Department of Mental Health and Addiction Services focused on a narrow question with far-reaching impact: How much discretion do administrative law judges overseeing workers’ compensation claims have in awarding temporary benefits?
Contradicting long-standing practice and a ruling by the Appellate Court, the high court found “the administrative law judge has the discretion to award a claimant who has reached maximum medical improvement other benefits under the Workers’ Compensation Act, such as total or partial incapacity benefits.”
“And while that might seem like a very simple holding from the Supreme Court, the effect that that will have on our state and our municipalities is really very radical,” Rep. Jack Fazzino, D-Meriden, vice chair of the Judiciary Committee, said in the House debate.
The court ruling came at an awkward point in the legislative session, after most deadlines for filing and holding hearings on bills. But there was widespread acknowledgement that a quick clarification of the underlying law was needed to stabilize workers’ compensation costs.
“It was critically important, given that the decision in Gardner essentially undermined the 1993 reforms, or a good piece of them, which led to decreased premiums over a decade, balanced benefits and having some of the safest workplaces in the world,” said Chris DiPentima, the president of the Connecticut and Business Industry Association.
Fazzino said premiums in Meriden, one of the communities in his district, would increase by $1.2 million. Lager cities would face much larger jumps. None of it was anticipated before the March 18 ruling.
“I don’t feel comfortable going back to my city and saying, ‘Hey, by the way, here’s a $1.2 million increase in workers’ compensation premiums that you didn’t account for,’” Fazzino said.
Eric George, the president of the Insurance Association of Connecticut, said, “All of us were scrambling.”
He noted that representatives of business, municipalities, insurers, trial lawyers and labor quickly met for negotiations overseen by legislators who demanded and obtained a quick consensus.
“That does not happen often,” he said.
The high court’s analysis, in a decision written by Justice Nora Dannehy, turned on what the court called a plain-language reading of the law, not the intent of the legislature in 1993 or interpretation of agencies in subsequent years.
“The present appeal presents a question of statutory interpretation.,” Dannehy wrote. “Although this court will afford deference to an agency’s interpretation of a statutory provision that has been ‘subjected to judicial scrutiny or consistently applied by the agency over a long period of time’ and is reasonable…the board’s interpretation of the specific provisions at issue in this appeal has neither been time-tested nor subject to judicial scrutiny to warrant deferential treatment.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_7510-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-05-19 17:07:29.899263

(Photo by Andrew Roth/Michigan Advance)The secretary of state’s use of a government building – one that houses the department she oversees – to announce her candidacy for governor violated Michigan’s campaign finance laws, the Department of Attorney General said Monday.
That said, the department noted it did not have the authority to impose any civil penalties against Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson, nor any criminal penalties outlined in the law.
Benson jumped into the 2026 gubernatorial ring on January 22 with a press conference held in the lobby of the Austin building. Benson said then that the announcement was being held inside the building due to the cold weather. Reporters at the event questioned whether other candidates could also use the lobby for similar announcements, with some noting that other candidates had not been allowed to do so in the past.
Benson says she’s focused on ‘efficiency and transparency’ in Michigan governor campaign

Benson told reporters that other candidates could use the lobby if they’d like to announce their campaigns – which led to complaints from Republicans.
In a letter sent to Benson on Monday, Joshua Booth, chief of the opinions division with the Department of Attorney General, said the secretary of state had violated a portion of the Michigan Campaign Finance Act.
That said, Booth wrote that the Jocelyn Benson for Governor campaign committee had not violated the law because it was not a public body and because there was no allegation that the campaign committee was acting on behalf of a government body.
The act prohibits candidates from using public funds, personnel, office space, equipment and other property paid for by public resources. In that regard, Booth said Benson herself violated the act.
“Secretary Benson invited members of the press inside the Austin Building and then conducted a press conference, professionally dressed, during the day, in the lobby of the building that houses her office,” Booth wrote. “She gave no indication that would lead a reasonable person viewing the press conference to believe that she was there on her ‘personal time.’ Instead, the circumstances would lead a reasonable person to believe that Secretary Benson was acting as secretary of state with the authority of the Department of State, which is a ‘public body,’ to invite members of the press inside her office building and use the lobby for the press conference.”
As to Benson’s belief that other candidates could also use the Austin building to announce their candidacy, the law does allow for the use of public buildings for campaign events or candidate announcements. But Booth said her belief was misplaced because the Department of Technology, Management and Budget oversees the building, and therefore, the facility was not one that any candidate or committee had an equal opportunity to use.
Benson’s committee also raised First Amendment concerns, and argued that any violation of the act enforced against it would in turn violate her constitutional rights. But Booth said limiting candidates from using the building was a legitimate purpose because such a gathering could interfere with the entering, exiting and the general business of those working inside the building. 
A violation of the act carries a civil penalty of a fine not more than $1,000 imposed by the Department of State and a conciliation process helps determine the amount of the fine. If an agreement cannot be reached, the Department of State can refer the matter to the attorney general’s office.
The act is, however, silent on how the Department of Attorney General should resolve a complaint against the Secretary of State if it’s determined that a violation occurred. Booth said there are no provisions establishing a conciliation process, other informal method of resolving the complaint, or giving authority to the attorney general’s office to order a hearing or issue a civil fine following a hearing. There is also no provision allowing the secretary of state to appeal a fine imposed by the Department of Attorney General.
The same goes for criminal penalties, Booth said. The act states that anyone in violation of Michigan campaign finance law is guilty of a misdemeanor, but because the complaint was referred to the attorney general by the secretary of state, the attorney general’s office lacks the authority to charge Benson with a misdemeanor.
Booth said that it may sound odd and seem unfair that Benson is subject to the Campaign Finance Act’s rules but none of its penalties, but the Legislature never expressly gave the attorney general the authority to enforce the law against a secretary of state.
“Consequently, the attorney general is left with no choice but to simply identify the violation, remind the secretary of state of her obligations under the MCFA, and warn her against violating them in the future,” Booth wrote. “That said, it is by no means unusual for the Secretary of State to resolve campaign finance complaints with a similar reminder and warning. … Under the circumstances, resolving these complaints with a reminder and warning is the appropriate sanction, but it is also important to take this opportunity to point out the lack of enforcement options available to the attorney general under the current language of the MCFA.”

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-05-19 20:07:47+00:00,CT Mirror,PODCAST: CT lawmakers have three weeks to pass a budget,CT Mirror's Long Story Short,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/05/19/ct-lawmakers-state-budget/,CT Mirror's Keith M. Phaneuf discusses his story about budget negotiations in Connecticut and looming battles over funding priorities.,"Connecticut lawmakers have three weeks to pass a biennial budget. How are things looking?
WSHU’s Ebong Udoma spoke with CT Mirror’s Keith M. Phaneuf to discuss his article, “One skirmish over the CT budget is over, but the big battle looms,” as part of the collaborative podcast Long Story Short. Read Keith’s story here.
WSHU: Connecticut has a huge surplus, yet we have a situation where there’s a big debate about what to do with the budget and how to make things work in the out years. Why?
KP: Why is it not so cut and dry? Well, what we’re really have going on behind all of this is a fundamental debate over how much one generation, the current generation, should be paying to solve a problem created by three or four that came before it. That was the group that really created the pension debt that made headlines, national headlines about Connecticut, all throughout the 2010s. We still owe about $35 billion to our pension funds, benefits we’ve promised to people, but we haven’t saved for. The State has a plan to gradually pay all that down through about the early 2050s, but we’re using our budget caps and budget controls to generate huge surpluses. And I almost hate to use that word because it implies that money is not needed for these programs. We’re actually leaching dollars out of education, health care, social services, transportation, everything else, and we’re using it to make extra pension payments. Some folks have said we’ve overcorrected, and one generation is now paying too much. But that is why, that’s the shortest answer I can give you, why we would have a huge surplus. We can’t decide if there’s enough money for everything else. It’s because we’re trying to create huge surpluses to pay down pension debt.
WSHU: Now, I sensed a lot of frustration from House Speaker Matt Ritter (D) last week that the budget negotiations were not going well. Why? What was the issue here?
KP: The reason they’re not going well is, again, it goes back to this dynamic that I was just discussing with you. What’s happening is we are getting to a point where these budget caps that really have been in place in their current iterations, their current settings since about 2017 are becoming unbearable. And some folks may say, ‘Well, what changed? Why is this program that’s leeching money out of everything else? Why is that becoming too hard to bear now, if it’s been in place since 2017?’
The reason for that is that we have had, I don’t want to call it good fortune, because it’s related to a pandemic that killed so many people. But because of the pandemic, Connecticut received billions of dollars in emergency federal grants. We know them by the acronym ARPA, American Rescue Plan Act funds, and think of it almost as fiscal novocaine, while we were extracting all this money from the budget via the guardrails by the budget caps to make pension contributions. We had this emergency money that we could spend outside of the cap system, outside of the budget, to take the place of the money that the budget caps were removing. So you didn’t feel the loss of all that money. Well. Now these ARPA dollars have been exhausted, and for the first time, Connecticut is learning what it is like to take eight to 10% each year out of its budget and set it aside for extra-special pension debt reduction payments. And it’s very, very painful.
WSHU: Now, on top of that, we have a situation with the Trump administration in Washington cutting back on a lot of money that was coming, apart from the fact that the ARPA funds are gone. We now have the regular funds, like Medicaid, for instance. The talk is about cutting that back, and the state would have to make up the difference. How are they trying to deal with that?
KP: That is the double whammy of all double whammies, because the problems that we’re facing immediately, right now with Medicaid, don’t even deal with Congress and President Trump. That’s simply the fact that demand is much greater than we anticipated. As you point out, though, Ebong, we have a whole other problem to deal with this summer or early this fall. Once Congress and President Trump finish cutting the federal budget, we anticipate losing hundreds of millions of dollars, at a minimum, in Medicaid funding, and that’s going to be a whole other problem. I don’t think the math works any way other than simply scaling back these budget caps and not trying to pay down pension debt as fast as we currently are. That’s not a moral judgment. That’s literally just doing the math. I don’t see where you come up with the money any other way. And I should have also mentioned, even at the pace that we’re paying down pension debt.
Now, some folks have said, well, isn’t it worth it? In a couple of years, this problem will be over. That’s not the case, even with all the extra money we’ve poured into our pension funds. The estimate now is maybe we’ll have this problem solved instead of the early 2050s maybe by the mid 2040s The problem is just too big to obliterate quickly, meaning it’s one thing to say, well, can our social service and healthcare and municipal aid and K 12 school programs suffer for a year or two? No, we’re really asking, can they suffer for a couple more decades and then we’ll stop leeching all this money out to pay down pension debt. That’s the other problem you don’t hear a lot of in the debate, which is, this is not a problem we’re going to be done with overnight, even if we keep the guardrails and the budget caps at their current settings.
WSHU: Okay. And the thing about the budget caps is that Governor Lamont, who is a Democrat, is being backed by the minority GOP in saying they don’t want to move those guardrails, and the Democrats, who are in the majority in the legislature, want to do so. Is there room for a compromise? There has to be some type of compromise to get a budget deal, which we need in the next couple of weeks.
KP: That’s a good way to put it. You know, sometimes there has to be a compromise. We saw earlier this session, the Democratic and Republican legislators compromise and award special education money to towns, even though both parties knew it was going to push this current fiscal year’s budget over the spending cap, because Republican districts were losing money in their schools because of special education costs, just like Democrats were losing it. I think as the finances get too tight, folks who say, no, I want to leave things just the way they are, are going to realize it’s okay to do that again.
For the last few years, when there was all this federal ARPA money, it’s like, Oh, you just lost $10 to the guardrails. Here’s $8 that came from Washington and ARPA funds. Now it’s not so painful. Now you lose $10 and there’s nothing to offset it. I think that’s going to force this situation. Quite frankly, if Governor Lamont, and we don’t know, but if he does choose to run for a third term, he may also have to do something, because it’s going to be very hard to avoid a nursing home strike later this month if he does not loosen the guardrails. Some, not impossible, but it’s going to be increasingly difficult if he doesn’t try to carve out more money.
WSHU: Wow. Okay, so the bottom line here is that something has to give.
KP: It’s just the math. People can, you know, sort of form different political alliances, but the numbers just don’t care. Okay, at some point, the dollars and cents have to add up.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/2025_0108_SR_SessionFirstDay_540-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-19 16:08:08.932118

(Morgan Chilson/Kansas Reflector)SCRANTON — On a gravel road northwest of this small Kansas town, a picturesque creek with overhanging trees shimmers with brilliant shades of green.
The beauty, though, hasn’t made up for the aggravation caused by high floodwaters that sweep the wooden bridge over that creek off its moorings to land about 30 yards or so away from the roadway, leaving the road impassable for area farmers, said Ryan Fine, Osage County public works director.
“That old wood one, it kept floating away. If we got a big, heavy rain, it would float down there, and we’d have to grab it out of the trees,” he said, gesturing down the creek. “The last time it happened, I said, ‘Leave that sucker in the trees. I gotta figure this out.’ ”
The cost of a new bridge, done with the typical bridge construction the county uses, would have been more than $300,000, Fine said. Instead, with the help of the Soy Transportation Coalition and the Kansas Soybean Association, the total bridge price was about $106,000, attributed to financial help and building a different style of bridge.
The new culvert bridge has walls, called headwalls, attached to the sides of the culvert and wingwalls that come out from there to help support the bridge, Fine said. Then large beams are set into the ground to a depth of four or five feet, he said. The top is covered with rock. 
“Even if there is erosion from high water where it does go over this road, this should stay locked in place,” Fine said, then added with a smile, “OK, can’t say it would always lock in place, because water can do some amazing things. But this is going to give us a better chance of it staying put where it needs to be.”
 
First in Kansas
Fine said he remembered that Raylen Phelon, a commissioner at large for the Kansas Soybean Commission and vice-chairman of the STC, spoke at county meetings about help available for transportation projects.
He reached out and as a result, Osage County’s bridge became the first project in the state to use soybean checkoff funds set aside for such projects through the transportation coalition, Phelon said.
It’s also the first official use of the Soy Transportation Coalition’s report that was put together to offer innovative solutions for replacing and repairing rural bridges, Phelon said. STC is made up of 13 state soybean boards, the American Soybean Association and the United Soybean Board. The organization works to address transportation issues that affect the soy industry’s ability to move products.
The STC innovation report was designed to give counties options to consider when they replaced or repaired bridges, often with a significantly smaller price tag, said Kaleb Little, CEO of the Kansas Soybean Association. So along with $4,500 for the engineering costs on the project, they want to support creative thinking to solve problems that impact soybean farmers, he said.
  A new style of bridge that includes beams driven four or five feet into the ground replaced an old wooden bridge that kept moving downstream when it flooded. (Submitted)
Soybean checkoff
“What I really am tickled about is we’re using checkoff dollars,” Phelon said of the $4,500 check presented to Osage County. “It’s farmers’ checkoff dollars, from when they sell soybeans. It’s one-half of 1%, or a nickel every bushel with the prices right now, and it’s coming right back into the county, to where the farmers are at.”
Using checkoff dollars is a win-win for everyone, from the county and taxpayers to the farmers at the local level, he said. 
Phelon said he became  involved in STC because, as a soybean farmer, he knows how important infrastructure is. It was evident when a small bridge near his Melvern farm was getting to be unsafe, but if it had closed, he would have had to go miles out of his way to transport his crop.
“We can grow fantastic crops, but if you can’t get them to market, it affects your price,” Phelon said. “What are you going to do with an overabundance if you can’t move it? Also, it helps the consumer. If we can get it to them, it’ll help their prices be better.”

Phelon said STC supports projects around the country, including a large project at the Port of Grays Harbor in Washington state. Farmers can’t always make the connection to how that project halfway across the country helps them, he said. 
But two railroads go from the Midwest to Port of Grays, where soybeans are put on ships and sent around the world, Phelon said. 
“So taking products that are grown here in the United States, putting them on a boat and selling them — it helps our price,” he said. “There’s been maybe a little bit of pushback from Kansas farmers to say, well, we don’t sell any soybeans to China. I said wait a minute. Maybe not directly, but if Nebraska is selling them, we’re going to fill that void. And we need to be in that ballgame.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/P5150150-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-05-19 16:08:08.932118

(Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)Donald Trump has been president for 119 days as of Monday. That comes out to a lawsuit in which Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha is a lead plaintiff or participant roughly every six days since the new Trump administration began.
In fact, Neronha has joined so many multistate challenges to the federal government that his office’s website now features a page titled “Federal Action Response” to track his 19 litigious efforts against the commander in chief.
The page includes detailed information on every lawsuit Neronha has led or joined, from a birthright citizenship case filed in New Jersey District Court the day after Trump took office, to the latest pair of victories last week.
Both of last week’s wins happened on Neronha’s home turf, the U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island. Overall, seven of the 19 lawsuits Neronha has joined against the Trump administration have managed to temporarily block executive orders, federal funding cuts, or agency regulations issued by Trump’s cabinet members.
“Since day one, the Trump Administration has taken actions that extend far beyond the President’s constitutional authority,” the landing page reads. “These actions are impacting the rights of Rhode Islanders in real time. But we’re ready.” 
On Friday, May 16, District Judge Mary McElroy granted a request for a temporary court order and ordered the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to reinstate federal funding while the case is pending. Rhode Island is one of 24 plaintiffs challenging  the agency’s abrupt termination of $11 billion in pandemic-era public health grants.
On Tuesday, May 13, Chief Judge John McConnell’s preliminary injunction against a Trump executive order targeting library programming and other federal initiatives went into effect. McConnell issued the injunction on May 6, backing the 21 states that rallied against the executive order that led to the Institute of Museum and Library Services placing 85% of its staff on administrative leave. 
“Americans have quickly grown weary of their government attacking them instead of working for them,” Neronha said in a May 14 statement after the injunction became effective.
Neronha joined 21 other attorneys general in the library funding lawsuit, which sought to block an executive order that led to staff reductions and grant cancellations at the Institute of Museum and Library Services, the Minority Business Development Agency, and the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service, which helps mediate labor disputes.
“Above all else, as attorneys general, we have an obligation to protect the residents of our states from harm even when, perhaps especially when, it comes from the federal government,” Neronha’s statement continued. “With this order and many others, we are stopping this President in his tracks, and we will continue to fight every single step of the way.”
The executive order also designated the United States Agency for Global Media, the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, the United States Interagency Council on Homelessness, and the Community Development Financial Institutions Fund as targets for spending cuts (although these agencies were not part of the state attorneys’ efforts). The EO mandated these federal initiatives “reduce the performance of their statutory functions and associated personnel to the minimum presence and function” — in other words, abolish any programming not explicitly required by law. 
But McConnell wrote in his May 6 ruling that this executive maneuver “has effectively usurped Congress’s lawmaking and spending authority — without constitutional or statutory authority permitting them [the federal government] to do so.
McElroy’s ruling came in a lawsuit first filed in April, and deemed that HHS had violated both the Administrative Procedure Act and congressional spending authority.
“The power that HHS has asserted here is a broad one: terminating $11 billion worth of funding based on its determination that the money is no longer necessary,” McElroy wrote in her ruling. “The Court cannot see how it can claim that power based on the history of congressional action described above.”
The pair of rulings reflect the overall legal strategy of Neronha and his blue state counterparts during the second Trump era: to hastily respond to the executive branch’s equally speedy policymaking. Across the 19 lawsuits, states have argued that the Trump administration has repeatedly violated the Administrative Procedure Act, ignored congressional powers, and imposed wide-ranging but often unclear policy and budgeting directives on shaky legal ground. 
“A hacksaw approach to government reduction will never yield positive results for the American people, and we will continue to fight, and win, in court to minimize the harm the Trump Administration is causing the people of this country,” Neronha wrote in a statement after the May 16 ruling. “When the Trump Administration attempts to dismantle these agencies, it is making a targeted, concerted effort to prohibit everyday people from accessing their full potential.”
Six of the 19 cases in which Neronha has participated have been filed U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island, including the two most recent filings from May 13: Illinois v. FEMA, and California v. Department of Transportation, both of which challenge challenges immigration enforcement as a prerequisite for federal funding.    
Neronha has been especially busy in April and May, getting involved in 12 of the 19 cases during those two months.
A full list of the 19 cases, with court documents included, is available on the AG’s website.

(Photo by Jerry Redfern / Capital & Main)The “big, beautiful” bill making its way through the United States House of Representatives this week not only would cut federal spending on healthcare on which  40% of New Mexicans rely, but state and federal officials say it also would reduce revenue the state could use to pay for that healthcare itself.
One provision in the 1,116-page spending bill that is making progress in the House would reduce federal oil and gas royalties from 16.75% to 12.5%, undoing a hike Congress and President Joe Biden approved in the Inflation Reduction Act in 2022. 
Federal law requires 50% of royalties on federal land to be distributed to states in which production took place, which in 2024 meant that New Mexico received $2.88 billion from federal royalties, the biggest share of any state, according to the State Land Office. 
Reducing the rate back to pre-2022 levels will mean about $480 million less in total royalties the federal government collects between now and 2031, according to the office. In New Mexico, those funds are regularly invested in trust funds the state amasses to pay for services like early childhood education or other programs.
U.S. Rep. Teresa Leger Fernandez (D-N.M.) said in a news conference Friday decrying the bill that the provision amounts to a double-whammy for New Mexico, which relies heavily on oil and gas revenue and is also where Medicaid finances more than half of all births. Republicans are helping oil companies increase their sizable profits while making it harder for New Mexico to pay for healthcare, she said.
New Mexico mom, advocates urge Congress to protect safety net programs

“At a time when the Republicans are going to make states pay more for Medicaid, they are taking away the money that New Mexico uses to fund Medicaid,” Leger Fernandez said during a news conference Friday. “This is why we are so angry about this bill. It is a double impact on New Mexico.”
Leger Fernandez cited a May 5 letter Land Commissioner Stephanie Garcia Richard wrote to her office that laid out concerns about the Republicans’ approach to federal oil and gas extraction. 
“As the top recipient of federal mineral leasing distributions, the proposed reduction in the minimum royalty  rate… will hit New Mexico’s working families at a time when other federal funding for essential services is being slashed by the Trump Administration,” Garcia Richard wrote in the letter, which her office provided to Source New Mexico. 
This legislative session, state lawmakers created a new Medicaid Trust Fund that aims to generate enough in interest to pay for at least some of what the federal government could cut in Medicaid spending.
New Mexico has the highest per-capita Medicaid enrollment in the nation, 34%, according to the non-partisan health policy research organization KFF. The state is expected to need $8.9 billion in federal Medicaid funding to support its operations this fiscal year. For perspective, New Mexico’s record operating budget for this fiscal year is $10.8 billion. 
NM budget expert expects Medicaid work requirements out of Congress

It’s not entirely clear, however, how money in federal oil and gas royalties would make its way into the Medicaid Trust Fund that lawmakers created for the New Mexico Treasurer’s Office to oversee. The bill creating the fund does not specify, saying only that the fund “consists of distributions, appropriations, gifts, grants and donations.” 
State Land Office spokesperson Joey Keefe referred comment to the State Treasurer’s Office. A spokesperson there did not immediately respond to a request for that information Monday morning. 
In addition to her concerns about the lost federal royalties, Garcia Richard noted that the bill would require the federal government to lease land for oil and gas extraction to companies, even if it’s not in the best interest of taxpayers, by requiring quarterly lease sales, sometimes without competitive bids. 
“By enabling companies to get leases directly without a competitive auction and by requiring that an arbitrary percentage of lands [be] offered at quarterly lease sales, the federal government (and the states that share in this revenue) will receive less value than they should for the parcels,” Garcia Richard wrote. 
She urged Leger Fernandez and other members of the U.S. House Natural Resources Committee to vote against the proposal. Despite her effort, the committee voted to advance the bill two days later.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Chaco_Area_OnG_0313_04-1024x682.jpeg,,,2025-05-19 16:08:08.932118

As of Monday, 108 people across five counties were facing charges in connection with trafficking and selling fentanyl, cocaine and methamphetamine, said Attorney General Alan Wilson. He announced charges for an initial 64 people in January 2024.
Three people have pleaded guilty. The remaining charges are pending, and the investigation dubbed Operation Devil in Disguise is ongoing, according to his office.

At least six people have died from drug overdoses traced back to the operation, Wilson said. Among the more than 380 charges defendants face are murder, accessory to murder, and conspiracy to commit murder brought against people suspected of selling drugs laced with fentanyl that led to overdoses. Those charges require prosecutors to prove the sellers knew their product was strong enough to be lethal.
Such proof wouldn’t be needed for future charges under a soon-to-be law.
Under a bill passed this year that the governor is expected to sign, the Attorney General’s Office will be able to pursue charges of fentanyl-induced homicide, an offense created by the bill that carries a sentence of up to 30 years for anyone who knowingly “delivers, dispenses or otherwise provides” any amount of fentanyl that kills a person.
“That’s going to be a wonderful tool for law enforcement and prosecutors to use, and that is why we so vigorously advocated for it,” Wilson said.
Most of the fentanyl, which is both potent and cheap, was mixed with cocaine and methamphetamine to either bulk up the amount of the drug sold or increase its strength, Wilson said.
Bill makes anyone who provides a fatal dose of fentanyl in SC a killer

That can be dangerous, since fentanyl carries a higher risk of overdose, said Creighton Waters, the lead prosecutor in the case.
Fentanyl overdoses killed 1,660 people in the state in 2022, according to the Department of Public Health’s most recent data available. That accounted for more than 70% of the total 2,296 overdoses statewide that year, according to department data.
Two milligrams of the opioid can be enough to kill a person, depending on someone’s size, tolerance and past usage, according to the federal Drug Enforcement Administration. That means every kilogram of fentanyl has the potential to kill 500,000 people, Wilson said.
Investigators believe traffickers have brought 540 kilograms of fentanyl into the state. Officers have confiscated 4 kilograms of fentanyl while investigating the operation, according to the Attorney General’s Office.
“Fentanyl is obviously the biggest narcotics trafficking problem that we face because it is so deadly,” Waters said.

The operation is also believed to have trafficked 850 kilograms of cocaine and 500 kilograms of methamphetamine, Wilson said.
Law enforcement officers have confiscated more than 44 kilograms of cocaine, 10 kilograms of methamphetamine, $1 million in cash suspected of being exchanged for drugs and multiple guns, including assault rifles, according to the office.
In one case, police caught three defendants after watching them exchange 3 kilograms of cocaine outside a house in Greenville, prosecuting attorney Jennifer McKellar said as 11 of the accused appeared in Richland County bond court Monday.
Others were discovered through traffic stops or search warrants.
In several cases, defendants were charged with seemingly unrelated drug crimes that investigators later connected to the larger operation, causing prosecutors to add charges. At least one man continued trafficking drugs from jail, relaying coded instructions to his wife over the jail phone. Others were caught on surveillance cameras and through their phone communications smuggling drugs over state lines, McKellar said.
Legislators in 2023 passed a law creating penalties specific to people caught trafficking fentanyl. Under that law, a person caught trafficking 28 grams of fentanyl or more could be sentenced up to 40 years in prison. A first conviction of trafficking less than 14 grams comes with a sentence of up to 25 years, and a second conviction carries a mandatory 25 years in prison.
As law enforcement more vigorously pursues fentanyl trafficking, they have begun to see the supply drop, Waters said.
“Anecdotally, we’re starting to see some effects of the supply being squeezed a bit by greater efforts at enforcement,” Waters said.
Investigators have traced many of the drugs back to Mexican cartels bringing them in over the country’s southernmost border, Wilson said. People then bring the drugs through Atlanta and up to Greenville, which Wilson called the “front porch” of the state when it comes to drug trafficking.
“This is just a fraction of the army that’s coming for you,” Wilson said his message would be to people continuing to bring drugs into the state. “We will come for you, we will get you and we will put you in prison if you continue to do this.”",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_2405-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-05-19 16:08:08.932118

Terrell McKinney recalls Nebraska’s rockier relationship with Malcolm X, the rather rough road to getting the Omaha-born human rights leader into the state’s Hall of Fame.
John Ewing Jr., who last week became Omaha’s first elected Black mayor, was a toddler when Malcolm X was assassinated in 1965, and what sticks with him is how Nebraskans early on used him largely as a comparison point with the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.
Standing out to JoAnna LeFlore-Ejike is the slow march toward gaining communitywide buy-in to build up the Malcolm X memorial birth site and nonprofit foundation she now heads. Burned into her mind is a moment 15 years ago when she thought: “Where’s the people? Where are the people who are going to move this thing forward?”
But they and other fans said they’ve seen increased recognition and understanding in their state of what Malcolm X stood for. Buoyed by his rising national prominence, local voices have championed Malcolm X’s journey as one of self-determination, personal reformation and quest to unify Black people — and have successfully advocated for ways to enshrine his name in the state where he was born.
Efforts intensified as the 100th anniversary of Malcolm X’s birthday approached — and is being observed Monday, May 19.
“There’s a shift of the tide,” McKinney said, for the Black empowerment advocate he says is often misunderstood. “People are actually honoring his legacy and respecting it. It’s a show of understanding of who he was and what he means to North Omaha, the city, and the world.”
 Racial antagonism abandoned

Born Malcolm Little, his family left Omaha after suffering harassment from white supremacists, before Malcolm X was two years old. He evolved from a street hustler who, while in prison, became self-educated and converted to the Nation of Islam. He took the new surname “X” to signify the unknown African surname of his ancestors.
After completing a pilgrimage to Mecca, Malcolm X had a new outlook that abandoned concepts of racial antagonism. He changed his name again and denounced the Nation of Islam, which led to death threats.
At 39 years old, as he was about to give a speech in New York City in 1965, the father of six daughters was shot multiple times at close range by three gunmen identified as members of the Nation of Islam.
McKinney, a lawmaker who represents the North Omaha area where Malcolm X first lived, reflected on the Little family that he said was a target of racism. Malcolm’s father, a minister, was active in the Universal Negro Improvement Association, which led to the family’s being harassed. McKinney said the Littles would not have fathomed the recent turn of events in Nebraska.

 Shifts

Consider these milestones:
In May 2024, the state inducted Malcolm X as the 27th person and first African American into Nebraska’s Hall of Fame. Some along the way thought he was too controversial for the hall the Legislature created in 1961 to recognize Nebraskans who have made significant contributions to the state and nation.
Indeed, it took three different nominations over nearly two decades, in 2004, 2007, and 2022, before he was selected in 2022 by a governor-appointed commission that considered public testimony. The formal induction came two years later, with a bronze bust in Malcolm X’s image installed in the State Capitol. Due to legislation passed in 1998, no more than one person can be added to the Hall of Fame every five years.
At the induction, former State Sen. Ernie Chambers quipped about what he saw as a near impossibility: “I never thought in my wildest dream that I would live long enough … to see a white conservative Republican governor in a white ultraconservative state like Nebraska participate in the induction of Malcolm X.”
Also in 2024, the Nebraska Legislature passed a law establishing a “recognition” of Malcolm X every year on his birthday. McKinney had pushed for a state holiday, but that measure stalled. He said financial barriers to designating a paid holiday prompted him to change direction. He called the alternative a “good first step.”
The legislation calls for each May 19, starting this year, to be “set apart for holding suitable exercises in the schools of the state in recognition of the sacrifices of the late Nebraska Hall of Fame inductee El-Hajj Malik El-Shabazz, Malcolm X and his contributions to the betterment of society.” El-Hajj Malik El-Shabazz is the name Malcolm adopted after completing the “Hajj” pilgrimage to Mecca and converting to Sunni Islam.
 Museum on the horizon

Also in 2024, the Malcolm X Memorial Foundation officially was awarded a $20 million grant from the state to create a museum devoted to its namesake near 35th and Evans Street, a site where Malcolm X first lived with his family. The funds followed through on legislation, approved the previous year, to build the cultural center supporters foresee as a tourist destination.
Originally, the foundation had requested funding through a competitive process set up to dole out economic development grants to North and South Omaha from the state’s federal American Rescue Plan Act dollars. The museum was not among recommendations by a consultant, however. Amended legislation led by State Sens. Justin Wayne and McKinney carved out funds for the project.
As planned, the public dollars are set to build the museum, which is an anchor of a broader vision to transform the 17-acre campus that marks Malcolm X’s early childhood home.

Construction has yet to launch, but LeFlore-Ejike says planning is “moving along” with a review ongoing of requests that have been submitted for the master site plan development.
LeFlore-Ejike became executive director of the foundation in 2022, taking over work initiated in 1971 by Rowena Moore.
She said efforts to transform the still largely undeveloped area, which has gardens and a visitors center, has had “ebbs and flows.”
LeFlore-Ejike recalled the moment in 2010. She was a volunteer still in school, and the foundation had a grant for “visioning” work after having just purchased the existing visitor’s center, which was the former home of a Jehovah’s Witnesses congregation. She recalled disappointment in the lackluster support to continue building momentum.
Now, she said, “We’re finally in a season of harvest.”
Citing LeFlore-Ejike’s work with the foundation, USA Today named her a nominee for its Women of the Year program in 2025. The selection recognizes “heroines” across the country who break barriers, push for change and make communities better.
LeFlore-Ejike hopes Malcolm X supporters are proud that decades of volunteer work “has not been in vain.”
 History-making

Ewing commended the state for recognizing a significant Nebraska native “very worthy” of hall of fame status.
Malcolm X’s 100th birthday observance comes as Ewing also celebrates a historical win in Nebraska’s largest city. In last Tuesday’s election, he soundly defeated three-term Mayor Jean Stothert.
“It all goes to show how far we’ve come as a community when it comes to being inclusive and accepting of leaders in our community,” he said.
Ewing said leaders “come in all shapes and sizes and backgrounds.”
“It’s important they are accepted and know they belong here in Omaha and in Nebraska.”

“My mouth is full of cuss words right now,” Murphy said.
House Speaker Lisa Demuth, R-Cold Spring, blamed House Democrats, who refused to show up for the first few weeks of session so Republicans couldn’t use their temporary, 1-vote advantage to block a Democrat from being seated in a hotly contested election.
“Waiting 23 days of a stall out was not helpful,” Demuth said.
The blame game was in full force on Monday as it became apparent that lawmakers might not even stay at the Capitol until midnight, an unofficial tradition on the constitutionally mandated last day of the session, because there’d be no budget bills ready to debate.
“I think we’ll run out of things to do this evening,” said House Speaker Emerita Melissa Hortman, DFL-Brooklyn Park.
The Legislature has only passed seven, mostly noncontroversial bills out of some 20 bills in process, with the biggest pieces of legislation still outstanding, including the budgets for education, taxes, and health and human services.
There haven’t even been legislators assigned to hammer out agreements between the House and Senate in what are known as conference committees — a blend of representatives and senators of both parties — on education finance and taxes. Education alone comprises roughly 40% of the general fund budget.
Lawmakers must pass a budget by June 30, or the government shuts down.
Walz and lawmakers hope they can keep working on compromises on the most contentious issues and get to final deals, which would set the parameters for a quick special session, ideally before the Memorial Day holiday. Only Gov. Tim Walz can call a special session, but only lawmakers can adjourn once they’re in a special session.
While the governor and legislative leaders announced a global budget agreement last week, what exactly it entailed now seems to be up for debate. The governor and legislative leaders only released a single page with budget targets for state agencies, but no written record of their agreements on policy.
Leaders said paid family leave would remain unchanged except for a 0.1% reduction in the cap on payroll taxes. Now, deeper cuts are back on the table.
“There is bipartisan desire to make additional changes to paid family medical leave before it even rolls out. That was not part of the global agreement,” Demuth said, noting support from DFL Sen. Judy Seeberger for cuts to the program set to launch next year.
Hortman said on Monday that the agreement included no additional changes to paid family leave and expects Demuth “to honor her word.”
Senate Minority Leader Mark Johnson, R-East Grand Forks, reiterated to reporters that he never signed the global budget agreement on behalf of his caucus.
“We’re not subject or held to that agreement,” Johnson said. “We are going to fight to the very end.”
Progressive Democrats seemed to have backed down from threatening to hold up budget bills over rolling back access to MinnesotaCare for undocumented immigrant adults, which was part of the global agreement.
Rep. Cedrick Frazier, DFL-New Hope, said on Saturday that the People of Color and Indigenous Caucus and their allies don’t plan to shut down government over that bill.
With so much left to do and the Legislature no longer officially in session as of midnight, the negotiations will happen mostly outside of the public’s eye in “working groups.”
Asked if the public would be able to watch the working groups debate the state’s next two year budget, Murphy said she was “very interested” in them working in public if she could get agreement from the other body.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_6100-2-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-05-19 16:08:08.932118

But they no longer have protections from deportation. No justices signed onto the ruling, which is typical in cases brought before the high court on an emergency basis, but liberal Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson noted she would have denied the request.TPS status for that group of Venezuelans — a portion of Venezuelans living in the United States, not all of them — was set to end on April 7 under a move by the Trump administration.But U.S. District Judge Edward Chen of the Northern District of California in March blocked Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem’s decision to vacate an extension of TPS protections that had been put in place by the Biden administration until October 2026.The case is now before the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals.Chen, who was appointed by former President Barack Obama, blocked the Trump administration from removing protections for that group of Venezuelans on the basis that Noem’s actions were “arbitrary and capricious,” and potentially motivated by racism.“Acting on the basis of a negative group stereotype and generalizing such stereotype to the entire group is the classic example of racism,” Chen wrote in his order.Noem cited gang activity as her reason for not extending TPS for the group of 350,000 Venezuelans, who came to the United States in 2023.A second group of 250,000 Venezuelans who were granted TPS in 2021 will have their work and deportation protections expire in September. Chen’s order did not apply to the second group of Venezuelans.Those with TPS have deportation protections and are allowed to work and live in the United States for 18 months, unless extended by the DHS secretary.Democrats criticized Monday’s decision, including Colorado Sen. Michael Bennet.“Ending protections for Venezuelans fleeing Maduro’s regime is cruel, short-sighted, and destabilizing,” he wrote on social media.Rep. Pramila Jayapal, Democrat of Washington state, wrote on social media that Venezuelans “face extreme oppression, arbitrary detention, extrajudicial killings, and torture — the exact type of situation that requires our government to provide TPS.”Monday’s order is one of several immigration-related emergency requests from the Trump administration before the Supreme Court.Last week, the high court heard oral arguments that stemmed from an executive order signed by President Donald Trump to end the constitutional right to birthright citizenship.And justices in a separate case, again, denied the Trump administration from resuming the deportations of Venezuelans under an 18th-century wartime law known as the Alien Enemies Act.",,,,2025-05-19 16:08:08.932118

(Photo courtesy of Sony Electronics)Insurance companies doing business in Montana won’t have to provide coverage for hearing aids after Gov. Greg Gianforte vetoed House Bill 607 earlier this month.
State law currently requires insurance companies to cover hearing aids for individuals 18 years and younger. HB 607, brought by Rep. Paul Tuss, D-Havre, would have extended that to all ages. According to a fiscal note attached to a bill, the state estimates the average hearing aid to cost $5,000. 
In the same note, it said the average number of ears requiring hearing aids is 1.37, meaning a fair number of people require two.
“Typically, insurance will cover the diagnoses for hearing loss. But after that, you’re on your own,” Tuss said in a Monday press release. “By age 75, nearly half of Americans experience hearing loss. The cost of treatment can be a major burden on people’s finances— especially those living on fixed incomes. It causes people to put off getting hearing aids and try to get by with reduced hearing.”
In his veto letter, Gov. Greg Gianforte called the bill an “unfunded insurance mandate” that would cost Montana taxpayers $3.5 million. He added that it would need “increased contributions” from the state’s roughly 30,000 public employees.
“Our administration is proud of our work with the Legislature to lower healthcare costs and expand access for Montanans through conservative, free-market principles, not government mandates,” Gianforte wrote in the letter, dated May 2. “Our conservative, free-market approach stands in stark contrast to the approach of states that embrace costly government rules, regulations, and mandates that distort markets, limit consumer choice, and inflate health care costs.”
The day before the veto, Gianforte received a letter from Misty Ann Giles, the director of the state Department of Administration, urging him to veto the bill. In the letter, Giles said the legislation would cost the state between $500,000 to $600,000 annually, which is in line with the bill’s fiscal note.
“During negotiations with employees, there was no indication that hearing aid coverage was a needed benefit, and no funding was included in the state’s budget or HB 13 to pay for providing that additional benefit,” Giles wrote in the letter. “Although the additional cost of the expanded hearing aid mandate was noted in the fiscal note for HB 607, no appropriation was included to offset the expense.”
Insurance legislation was a priority for Democrats during the session, including laws looking to regulate where the tech industry and medical insurance industry collide.
Democratic leadership slammed the veto.
“Under the Hearing Aid Coverage Act, thousands of Montanans would have finally been able to afford to get their hearing back,” House Minority leader Katie Sullivan, D-Missoula said in a release. “But today, the Governor chose insurance companies over Montanans. Our multi-millionaire Governor does not know what it’s like to choose between getting healthcare and putting food on the table or filling up your tank with gas.”

In recent years, a handful of large private equity-owned companies such as Sevita have acquired hundreds of smaller providers of disability services around the country and rolled them into larger corporations (Kayla Bartkowski/Getty Images).Private equity companies have gobbled up group homes and other services for people with disabilities, attracting the attention of state and federal regulators across the nation and alarming advocates.
People with intellectual or developmental disabilities have suffered abuse, neglect and even death while under the care of private equity-owned providers, according to a recent report from watchdog group Private Equity Stakeholder Project.
“Private equity firms are, more than many other types of investors, laser-focused on maximizing their cash flow, often trying to double or triple their investment over a relatively short period of time, usually just a handful of years,” said Eileen O’Grady, the report’s author. “The way that private equity firms will often do that is to cut costs.”
For companies that provide essential services for people with disabilities, she said, “those cuts can have really harmful impacts on people’s lives.”
In late 2023, Florida moved to revoke the license of NeuroRestorative, one branch of the private equity-owned health services company Sevita, which provides services for people with disabilities. State regulators cited repeat violations by NeuroRestorative and a failure to “protect the rights of its clients to be free from physical abuse.” Ultimately the state opted not to revoke the license and fined the company $13,000 in a settlement.
But in recent years regulators have documented instances of patient harm at Sevita’s affiliates in multiple other states, including Colorado, Indiana, Iowa, Massachusetts and Utah. In 2019, a U.S. Senate committee conducted a probe into the company’s operations in Iowa and Oregon following multiple reports of patient abuse and neglect.

Chuck Grassley, an Iowa Republican, said in a statement in 2020 following his investigation.
In a statement to Stateline, Sevita did not address the sanctions directly, but avowed its commitment to providing services and supports to give people greater independence, regardless of their intellectual or physical challenges.
“Since 2019, when new ownership acquired the company, there has been significant capital investment to improve and expand our services, enhance facilities, implement robust training and new technologies, and strengthen our workforce — all with the goal of better serving our individuals and communities,” the statement said.
The disability care industry has proven increasingly attractive to private equity.
In recent years, a handful of large private equity-owned companies such as Sevita have snapped up hundreds of smaller providers of disability services — often community nonprofits, mom-and-pop businesses and religious organizations — and rolled them into larger corporations.
From 2013 to 2023, private equity firms acquired more than 1,000 disability and elder care providers, according to the report by the Private Equity Stakeholder Project. That’s likely an undercount because they’re generally not required to disclose acquisitions, the report said.
 Cash cow

Private equity firms use pooled investments from pension funds, sovereign wealth funds, endowments and wealthy individuals to buy a controlling stake in a company. They seek to maximize its value — often by cutting costs — and then sell it at a profit.
Most of Sevita’s revenue comes from providing disability services. It operates companies in 40 states under various brands, including Mentor Network, NeuroRestorative and REM.
Sevita is currently owned by private equity firms Centerbridge Partners and Vistria Group, which also own Help at Home, a home health company with more than 200 locations across about a dozen states.
Nearly all of Sevita’s revenue comes from Medicaid, according to a February 2025 report from S&P Global.
Through Medicaid and Medicare, the government pays for most services for people with intellectual or developmental disabilities. The two programs cover services such as group homes, adult day programs, in-home care, and physical and occupational therapy.
“Sevita has been owned by private equity firms for over a decade now, and has been under investigation and scrutiny at the federal and state level for basically that entire time,” O’Grady said.
In 2022, Iowa fined a NeuroRestorative group home $10,500 after a resident was left unattended in a liquor store and drank three-quarters of a bottle of vodka. The same year, Massachusetts temporarily removed Sevita’s license to operate group homes after regulators reported inadequate staff training and supervision, and a “myriad of issues that were uncovered onsite,” according to a Massachusetts Department of Developmental Services report.
The federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services has fined a NeuroRestorative facility in Utah four times since 2022. A February 2024 inspection report by the agency found the facility “failed to prevent abuse, neglect … and exploitation” of residents.
Last year, Florida fined another Sevita brand, Florida Mentor, for improper use of restraints. More issues have been documented in Sevita-owned locations in Arkansas, California, Colorado, Illinois, Indiana, New Hampshire and Nevada.
Meanwhile, Sevita’s owners, Centerbridge and Vistria, have collected nearly half a billion dollars since 2019 by loading Sevita and Help at Home with debt in order to pay dividends to investors, according to Moody’s, a financial services company.
Similar financial maneuvering contributed to the recent collapse of Steward Health Care, a private equity-owned hospital system that once had more than 30 hospitals nationwide. Steward has become a cautionary tale about the harm that profit-driven private equity firms can do to a state’s health system.
“Before Steward Health Care ultimately collapsed, executives spent years hiding their financial information from state regulators, putting patients and our health care system at risk,” Massachusetts Democratic House Speaker Ron Mariano said in a statement earlier this year announcing a new state law that beefs up reporting and financial requirements for private investors.
“That’s why ensuring that our institutions are equipped to monitor the health care landscape, and to guard against trends and transactions that drive up costs without improving patient outcomes, is so important.”
 David vs. Goliath

After two residents of a New Jersey group home died from choking on food in 2017, attorney Cory Bernstein became interested in private equity’s involvement in disability services. The residents had been living in homes operated by AdvoServ, a company then owned by the private equity firm Wellspring Capital Management. The state had cited AdvoServ more times than any other operator in New Jersey for abuse, neglect and unsafe conditions.
AdvoServ later ceased operations in 2019 after multiple state agencies, including in New Jersey, Florida and Maryland, launched investigations.
But even when state regulators are doing all they can to protect people with disabilities from substandard care, they’re limited in how much they can hold a company accountable, Bernstein told Stateline.
“It’s state-level oversight on a national entity with not much [help] coming from the federal side,” said Bernstein, who is now a staff attorney at the National Disability Rights Network, a membership organization of federally mandated state disability advocacy programs.
“States just don’t really have the resources or tools to do what needs to be done.”
A regulatory agency in Georgia might shut down all the group homes owned by a certain company, for example, but those regulators can’t do anything about the company’s abuses in, say, Montana. With branches in multiple states, a company is better able to withstand sanctions or even a loss of license in one state, he said.
“[States] are not set up to go up against a national operator with billions of dollars in resources in a regulatory or oversight battle,” Bernstein said.
Further complicating things for state regulators and for consumers is that a large services company such as Sevita might operate under multiple brand names, even in one state. It can be hard to parse out who owns a sanctioned business. Multiple brand names can also obscure a company’s monopoly on a particular regional market.
When Florida regulators reached a settlement agreement with Sevita’s NeuroRestorative last year, the state dismissed its proposed license revocation. O’Grady believes one reason the state chose to settle is the difficulty of finding alternative facilities to relocate the residents who would have been displaced from the 13 locations the company operated around the state.
“Because of that dearth of alternatives and the impotence of the state to act more fully, this company will continue to be allowed to operate,” she said.
Further complicating oversight: Large companies often operate various services that are overseen by different agencies. Group homes might be regulated under the state’s Medicaid program, while facilities that provide more intensive care might come under federal Medicare oversight.
There could be “two completely different oversight systems for facilities serving the same population in the same state with the same name,” Bernstein said.
 State solutions

Some states have moved to address problems with private equity involvement in health care by passing tighter restrictions on mergers and acquisitions of health care companies.
In Rhode Island, where private equity companies’ mismanagement of health care providers threatened the future of local hospitals, a robust oversight law allowed the state attorney general to impose conditions to protect the hospitals’ finances.
More states are following suit. In 2023 alone, 24 states enacted laws related to health system consolidation and competition, while this year at least half a dozen have considered legislation to check private equity-fueled health care mergers.

The Marine Draftsmen’s Association-United Auto Workers of America, Local 571, essentially the workers responsible for designing the U.S. Navy’s nuclear submarine fleet, had threatened to strike earlier this month if the company did not make greater wage and benefit concessions.
The local’s negotiating committee announced the tentative contract agreement late Sunday, saying it contains “unprecedented” wage increases of more than 30% over the five-year term as well as increased retirement security. The deal now goes up for a vote by union members. Union officials did not say when the vote would be.
“We’ve been saying it all along: The company didn’t want a work stoppage, we did not want a work stoppage,” William Louis, president of Local 571, said in a video posted on union social media sites Sunday night. “And as we’ve been telling you for a long time, we have been working endlessly to get to the table with the company and have something put together that we both agree on.”
Electric Boat, a subsidiary of Reston, Va.-based General Dynamics, was recently awarded a contract worth more than $12.4 billion by the Navy for the construction of two Virginia-class submarines. The funding also covers improved pay for workers including the Marine Draftsmen’s Association.
“This package recognizes the essential role of the MDA members in the production of submarines for the U.S. Navy,” Electric Boat said in a joint statement with the union.
The union’s contract expired April 4, but leadership had agreed to continue bargaining with EB.
Electric Boat employs more than 23,000 people at his shipyard in Groton, engineering facilities in New London and operations in Quonset Point, Rhode Island.
The company said its earlier offer included a 23.3% general wage increase over the life of the contract, plus benefits and an increased retirement package.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/AP25108024078154-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-19 16:08:08.932118

Kevin Stitt announced that a $4 billion aluminum smelting facility is coming to the Port of Inola in Northeast Oklahoma.

Kevin Stitt, right, sign a memorandum of understanding on April 21. (Photo provided by the Oklahoma Department of Commerce)Gov. Kevin Stitt announced that a $4 billion aluminum smelting facility is coming to the Port of Inola in Northeast Oklahoma. The governor penned a deal with Emirates Global Aluminium as part of a larger slate of deals with the United Arab Emirates announced by the Trump Administration on Thursday.


“Thanks to our pro-business environment, Oklahoma is quickly becoming the critical minerals headquarters of the United States,” Stitt said in a statement Thursday evening.
According to the memorandum of understanding Stitt signed in April with the company’s chief executive officer, that pro-business environment consists of more than $275 million in incentives from the state, plus another expected $735 million in tax exemptions and offsets. The state is loaning the company more than half a billion dollars in tax increment financing.
The Legislature still needs to approve that memorandum of understanding, but House Speaker Kyle Hilbert and Senate Pro Tem Lonnie Paxton expressed support.
“Oklahoma’s selection as the preferred site for the first new primary aluminum production plant built in the United States in nearly half a century is a landmark achievement for our state,” Paxton said in a statement.
The agreement is part of $200 billion in commercial agreements between the United States and the United Arab Emirates expected to be unveiled by President Donald Trump and the White House, according to the Oklahoma Department of Commerce.
“Oklahoma proudly stands with President Trump in the mission to bring manufacturing back to American soil,” Hilbert said in the same press release.
Stitt said the newly announced aluminum smelter will bring 1,000 direct jobs and 1,800 indirect jobs to Oklahoma.
But in addition to creating jobs, aluminum smelting generates harmful byproducts. Every ton of aluminum produced creates at least 2 tons of solid waste, which can include caustic, toxic and radioactive materials, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. The Inola facility is expected to produce around 600,000 tons of aluminum each year.
The Port of Inola is a vision of the Tulsa Ports, which acquired 2,200 acres of land on the Verdigris River in 2019. The port’s industrial park is currently home to a paper mill and a proposed $1 billion solar panel factory, which was initially projected to start manufacturing and create 1,000 jobs by 2025. After Stitt touted it as the largest economic development project in state history, the solar panel manufacturing plant has been on hold for a year and a half.
Now, the aluminum smelter has topped the solar panel factory in terms of promised economic impact.
“We are proud to welcome Emirates Global Aluminium to our state and excited for the generational impact this investment will have on our future,” Stitt said. “As President Donald Trump looks to onshore our nation’s supply chain for critical minerals, Oklahoma is leading the way in this sector.”
Oklahoma has attracted several mineral refining plants over the past five years. A lithium refinery broke ground in Muskogee in January. Plans for a nickel refinery are facing pushback in Lawton. After being announced in 2022, a Stillwater plant that processes rare earth metals produced its first “neo magnets” earlier this year.

(Tero Vesalainen / Getty Images)New Mexico Attorney General Raúl Torrez recently signed onto a letter backed by 39 other attorneys general opposing efforts by U.S. House Republicans to restrict states for the next decade from passing laws related to artificial intelligence.
“Artificial Intelligence will be the most impactful technology of our generation and states must have the ability to shepherd its progress in a safe and responsible way,” Torrez said in a statement. “While Congress has failed to act, we’ve worked hard to develop new proposals—like House Bill 401—which would have penalized the use of AI-generated content for harassment, extortion, or defamation, and created tools to detect harmful synthetic media and unmask bad actors. Though it didn’t pass, strong state-level protections are still urgently needed, and states must have the flexibility to regulate this emerging technology if Congress refuses to act.”
Republicans added the clause restricting states’ laws on AI to the U.S. House budget bill congressional they hope to pass before Memorial Day. The measure, advanced on May 14, as part of the House Energy & Commerce Committee’s budget reconciliation proposal. Exceptions to the state ban would include laws that “remove legal impediments to, or facilitate the deployment or operation of” AI systems.
In their letter, the AGs write that the “promise of AI raises exciting and important possibilities. But, like any emerging technology, there are risks to adoption without responsible, appropriate, and thoughtful oversight. In the absence of federal action to install this oversight, over the years, states have considered and passed legislation to address a wide range of harms associated with AI and automated decision-making.” Those harms include “deep-fakes designed to mislead voters and consumers,” the letter notes.
In addition to HB401, which did not make it out of the state House Commerce & Economic Development Committee during the most recent legislative session, New Mexico Democrats backed a so-called Artificial Intelligence Act, which did not make it through the session, but would have created a state regulatory AI framework.

It is the largest hydropower producer in the U.S. and also part of the federal Columbia River Power System. (Photo courtesy of Bureau of Reclamation)Grand Coulee Dam is among the most powerful energy-generating dams on earth. It’s the bedrock of the federal Columbia River Power System — a network of 31 dams supplying more than half of the hydropower in the Northwest. Grand Coulee alone, overseen by the federal Bureau of Reclamation, generates one-quarter of that.
Drought in the West has cost hydropower industry billions in losses in two decades, analysis finds

But critical operations at the dam are going understaffed following President Donald Trump’s orders, executed by the Office of Personnel Management, to cut probationary federal employees, freeze new hiring at federal agencies and offer incentives to get employees to retire and resign early. It’s a problem at several agencies that oversee the system, which have lost hundreds of employees and could collectively lose hundreds more by fall, and it has regional electric utilities concerned about the safety, reliability and future of the region’s power transmission.
“These are not D.C. policy-maker jobs. These are jobs on the ground, serving the people of the Pacific Northwest with clean, reliable power,” said Scott Simms, president of the Public Power Council. The nonprofit industry group represents consumer-owned utilities in six states, all of which rely on power from the Columbia River dams.
“It actually takes quite a few human beings to run these giant hydro projects on a daily basis,” Simms said. “So that is the prevailing concern in the short term: making sure that the right people are in certain jobs, and also that there’s coverage, because these are 24/7 jobs.”
 Hundreds of BPA, Bureau of Reclamation, Army Corps of Engineers employees gone

The Bureau is not the only player in the basin’s energy delivery system that’s suffering. The Army Corps of Engineers, which also manages the dams, could lose more than 300 employees in the next few months, according to Tom Conning, public information officer for the Corps’ Northwestern Division. Employees of the branch had until May 1 to accept a deferred resignation and be put on paid administrative leave and have until Sept. 30 to officially resign.
The Bonneville Power Administration, or BPA, which markets and delivers the dams’ hydropower across the region, has lost 200 employees, according to recent testimony from U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright at a May 7 House Committee on Appropriations budget hearing.
Cuts have cost the Bureau of Reclamation about 25% of its staff so far — around 1,400 people — according to reporting in Politico, and staffing levels at Grand Coulee Dam are about 70% of what they should be, according to Simms.
“We understand they were behind in being fully staffed as it was, and then the workforce reductions came into play,” he said of Grand Coulee.
Bureau officials did not respond to the Capital Chronicle’s request to either confirm or correct the figures.
“While we do not comment on personnel matters, we are committed to enhancing workforce management and are collaborating closely with the Office of Personnel Management to embrace new opportunities for optimization and innovation,” Michael Coffey, a regional public affairs officer at the Department of the Interior, said in an email.
Trump’s orders, meant to cut federal spending, have not had any impact. Analyses by the Wall Street Journal, Reuters and CBS News found the Treasury’s daily spending is up billions from the same period last year.
When it comes to BPA, staff who’ve been offered incentives to resign and retire won’t make any difference. Their salaries are not taxpayer funded, but ratepayer funded, and the agency sends a profit each year to the U.S. Treasury.
Simms said 90 more BPA jobs had been rescinded as part of the federal hiring freeze, a number confirmed by a source familiar with BPA. The agency initially lost more than 100 probationary employees under a Trump executive order in February, but has since been able to bring them back.
The 290 job losses at BPA so far account for nearly 10% of the agency’s staff, and the agency is already hundreds of employees short, according to Energy Secretary Wright’s testimony.

 Agencies work hand-in-hand to maintain, manage Columbia River Power System

All three agencies — Reclamation, Corps and BPA — collaborate to maintain and manage the Columbia River Power System.
“So they work hand-in-hand. If you don’t have reliable hydro projects, then you don’t have a stable, workable grid, right?” Simms said. “There’s craftspeople, there’s welders, there’s electricians, there’s all kinds of folks who are involved in the operation of any dam.”
The Corps is also grappling with the possibility of losing at least 325 employees in the next few months, according to Conning. That’s mostly due to resignations and early retirements.
“These reductions cut across all aspects of our operations, from senior managers, administration staff, park rangers, maintenance workers, etc.,” he said in an email. “Additionally, existing vacancies are complicating our ability to fully support various missions (like recreation).
Corps’ districts in Portland, Seattle and Walla Walla, Washington, have temporarily limited or closed some recreation areas to maintain public safety and services, he added.
Simms said the long-term concern for all of these agencies in the Northwest is not funding but having employees with the skills to preserve and improve the system. BPA and the agencies are years behind in the region as far as investing in grid expansion and connecting to new green energy projects, reporting from Oregon Public Broadcasting and ProPublica recently found.
Simms likened the predictable outcome to that of deferring maintenance on your car.
“Essentially your car is due for service and you just continue to ignore the warning light. You’re going to pay the consequences if you continue to ignore that warning light,” he said. “That is what we’re worried about in the longer term: making sure that we’ve got the right people to do the needed work. It’s not a money problem, it’s actually a people problem.”
Simms said the Public Power Council has been working with both sides of the aisle in both chambers of Congress to advocate for more investment in the region’s hydropower system and its employees.
At the May 7 Congressional budget hearing, Energy Secretary Wright said he was aware BPA’s staffing could not go lower.
“I don’t think we have room to reduce headcount there anymore,” he said. “There’ll be no more shrinkage in head count at Bonneville Power.”
Simms said federal leaders likely need to go further.
“I think we’re going to have to get our heads around the idea of probably paying incentive payments and retention payments the way we’ve seen at the FAA for air traffic controllers, the way we’ve seen it for the USDA for food inspectors, the way we’ve seen it at the Forest Service for fire mitigation personnel,” he said. “I think we’re going to be in a place where we’re going to have to use those kinds of tools to attract and retain the people that we need for these critical positions.”

Lawmakers in Raleigh recently concluded crossover week – a chaotic period in which they considered and voted on scores of bills in dozens of important subject areas in just a few days. And for better or worse, a lot of important and controversial measures won approval and remain eligible for final passage this session.
So, what passed? What failed? And what’s on the agenda going forward? Newsline’s Rob Schofield recently sat down with reporter Galen Bacharier, to find out. And as Galen told Rob, while the state budget debate is sure to be the chief focus of lawmakers going forward, several other high-profile topics – from culture war issues like “diversity, equity and inclusion” and gun control to the role of the state Auditor – will also remain on the political front burner.

(Photo by Getty Images)After lawmakers couldn’t agree on which committee should handle her proposal to regulate forever chemicals in pesticides, Rep. Amy Arata is taking a new, more sweeping approach. 
The Republican from New Gloucester got approval from legislative leaders to introduce a late-session bill (LD 1982) that would change how perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances, also known as PFAS, are defined in state law. She believes the current definition is overly broad and could include chemicals that don’t pose the same long-term health problems as PFAS, which have been linked to cancer and weakened immune systems. 
During a public hearing Monday, Arata introduced her proposal for Maine to adopt the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s narrower definition for PFAS, which was changed under the Biden administration. The proposal would narrow the definition from any fluorinated organic chemical containing at least one fully fluorinated carbon atom to substances containing any one of three specific chemical structures.
She told the Legislature’s Environment and Natural Resources committee that her bipartisan proposal is “merely a refinement” of the existing definition.
Arata is largely concerned with farmers being unable to use certain pesticides that would fall under the state’s current definition. She said changing Maine’s definition to align with that federal definition would still “protect the health of Maine citizens while also allowing our farmers and other industries to be competitive nationwide.” 
However, Commissioner Melanie Loyzim said the Department of Environmental Protection opposes the bill because the state already has a process for people to seek exemptions to use products with PFAS that would otherwise be prohibited under the state ban that will be rolling out in the coming years. 
Under the state’s PFAS products ban, any product containing intentionally added PFAS can not be sold in the state after Jan. 1, 2030. The department’s website includes step-by-step instructions for requesting exemptions for certain products with currently unavoidable use. 
Rather than creating a more limited definition, Loyzim said uses of PFAS that are “economically important” but don’t pose health risks should be evaluated individually. 
Loyzim also argued that this change wouldn’t actually create uniformity with the federal guidelines because the EPA uses different definitions based on the specific regulation, such as the Safe Drinking Water Act versus the Toxic Substances Control Act. 
Arata said her bill would not precipitate other changes in Maine laws related to PFAS, but Loyzim said that definition is used in multiple areas of statute including those pertaining to wastewater discharge, land application of sewage, food packaging and more. 
Nancy McBrady, deputy commissioner for the Maine Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry, acknowledged that farmers could be hurt by a prohibition on certain pesticides that would fall under the state’s PFAS products bans, but warned LD 1982 is too broad. 
Rather, she suggested the Legislature pursue a narrower discussion on PFAS and pesticides in the next session. However, that conversation would likely need to go before the Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry Committee. 
The Maine State Chamber of Commerce argues Arata’s proposal could create greater consistency and clarity for business, especially those who deal with national supply chains. The Maine Potato Board echoed this point when speaking in support of the bill. 
However, other environmental organizations including the Friends of Casco Bay, Defend Our Health and the Maine Organic Farmers and Gardeners Association opposed the bill.

(Chris Jackson | West Virginia Watch)A former lieutenant at the Southern Regional Jail in Raleigh County has been sentenced to 17 years in prison for covering up an assault that led to the death of inmate Quentez Burks in 2022. 
Burks died March 1, 2022, one day after the 37 year old was booked on charges of wanton endangerment and obstructing an officer. 
Chad Lester, 35, of Odd, West Virginia, was sentenced Thursday to 17 years, 6 months in prison to be followed by three years of supervised release. A federal jury convicted him earlier this year of three felony obstruction of justice charges, including conspiracy to tamper with witnesses; witness tampering; and giving false statements. 
According to prosecutors, officers at the jail retaliated against Burks for trying to push past an officer by bringing him to spots that were not monitored by surveillance cameras and assaulting him. Seven officers pleaded guilty to charges in Burks’ death.
Officials say Lester threatened subordinate officers with violence and retaliation, added false statements to multiple officers’ reports, instructed officers to give a false cover story to investigators, and personally gave false statements to internal investigators. He also lied about the assault during a voluntary interview with FBI agents.
“This defendant wrongfully decided to obstruct an investigation into a fatal assault of an inmate,” Assistant Attorney General Harmeet K. Dhillon of the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division said in a news release. “I am proud of the Criminal Section within the Civil Rights Division and their counterparts in the Southern District of West Virginia for their work on this case.”
“On the defendant’s watch, correctional officers killed an inmate, and the defendant conspired with them to cover up their crimes,” Acting United States Attorney Lisa G. Johnston said in a news release. “The defendant violated the public’s trust in the law enforcement system he had sworn to uphold.”

Trey Caldwell, R-Faxon, speaks at an announcement of a budget deal for the 2026 fiscal year on May 14. (Photo by Emma Murphy/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — A House budget committee on Monday voted to move forward with spending $312 million to purchase a private prison in Lawton that the state uses to house about 2,300 inmates.
Rep. Trey Caldwell, R-Faxon, said The GEO Group, which operates the Lawton Correctional and Rehabilitation Facility in south Comanche County, no longer wants to continue its business relationship with the state. 
Caldwell, who chairs the House’s appropriations committee and authored House Bill 2780, said legislators have made “multiple overtures” to the company to avoid having to purchase the prison, which included offering increases in the amount the state pays in per diem rates to care for inmates. 
“The company has stood steadfast now going back to January that they do not want to continue their business relationship with the state of Oklahoma,” Caldwell said.
He said Gov. Kevin Stitt’s office also requested the state purchase the prison.
Caldwell said last year, lawmakers passed a per diem increase to keep up with cost of living increases, but it was vetoed by Stitt. At the time, Stitt wrote in his veto message that he rejected the $3 million increase because he did not want to put taxpayers on the hook for increasing salaries of private corporations that have state contracts. 
The GEO Group responded to the veto by announcing it was abruptly ending its contract with the state. The Department of Corrections, which at the time had over 2,600 inmates in the prison, responded, alleging that the Lawton facility was the “most violent prison” in the state and lacked “the standard of care expected.” Around the same time, two inmates were killed and 30 others were injured during a fight. 
The Department of Corrections and The GEO Group ultimately agreed to a one-year contract extension.
Caldwell said both The GEO Group and the Department of Corrections have had legitimate frustrations.
He said the Department of Corrections has been concerned about inmate safety and violence in the facility, and The GEO Group had concerns that the state agency was incorrectly reclassifying inmates to make sure they qualified for incarceration in Lawton.
“I think that in the past there are things that both sides could point to and say that they’ve done wrong,” Caldwell said. “I think our job as a Legislature is looking at problems and trying to find solutions going forward. That’s what this piece of legislation does. It gets Oklahoma out of the private prison business.”
The Lawton facility is the state’s last privately operated prison, though the state leases and runs one other that is owned by a private entity.
The $312 million purchase is an “all-in price.” He said in the past, the state has purchased private prisons where the company took everything within the parameters of the prison with them, which made it very hard to immediately take control. This time, the contract includes vehicles, refrigerators, furniture, utensils, security cameras, the computer system and the warden’s house. It also includes private acreage next to the facility.
He said estimates show it would cost the state between $1.3 billion and $2 billion to build a similar facility.
The prison employs about 450 people, and every employee will be offered employment with pay that is at least equal to what they’re receiving now as well as state benefits, Caldwell said. The Department of Corrections will continue to be allocated the $47 million appropriation that The GEO Group had received, but the agency instead will use it to maintain and pay those employees.
Caldwell said the state has excess capacity to house minimum security inmates, but it doesn’t have the same space availability to incarcerate offenders classified as medium security or who must be in protective custody. 
Rep. Meloyde Blancett, D-Tulsa, said lawmakers did not intend to purchase a prison from a strategy perspective, and questioned if all efforts had been made to reconcile the differences between The GEO Group and the state’s executive branch “at a time when we could be investing in other things that are of greater value.” 
Rep. Andy Fugate, D-Oklahoma City, who cast the sole dissenting vote against the purchase, said he had hoped this purchase would open up some additional capacity to help address issues with Oklahoma’s aging prison infrastructure. He was told it would not.
“I was hoping to hear that we might have some capacity that we could shut down someplace else,” he said. “We have a number of prisons that are desperately in need of renovation, ancient, and those are places, frankly, oftentimes our DOC folks are not safe,” he said.
The measure, which passed by a 27-1 vote, next heads to the full House for consideration.

(Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)In the wake of guilty verdicts in Tennessee’s political corruption trial, House Republicans are lauding Speaker Cameron Sexton for alerting federal authorities to a secret political vendor and cooperating with them to get a conviction.
The House Republican Caucus released a statement immediately after the case’s outcome saying the guilty verdict for former Speaker Glen Casada and his ex-aide Cade Cothren “reaffirms the principle that public office is a sacred trust, not a license for personal gain or abuse of power.”
The jury found Casada guilty on 17 of 19 counts of fraud, kickbacks, bribery, money laundering and conspiracy and Cothren guilty on all 19 counts. Former Rep. Robin Smith pleaded guilty in the case and testified against the pair.
The caucus said it appreciates Sexton’s leadership as he was “instrumental in uncovering illegal activity by two former members and providing critical facts to federal authorities.”
The statement adds that Sexton’s “commitment to integrity in state government reflects the standards to which all public officials should be held.”
Former Tennessee House Speaker Glen Casada, ex-aide, guilty in federal corruption case

Sexton, a Crossville Republican, was expected to testify for the prosecution but was never called to the stand in the four-week trial. 
Casada’s defense attorney, Ed Yarbrough, said the absence of Sexton testimony left a hole in the prosecution’s argument. Yet the defense called no witnesses to testify, including Sexton, despite issuing subpoenas to him and numerous people.
Cothren and his defense team went after Sexton before the trial started, making the claim that he or one of his staff members wore a device to record conversations with lawmakers. In addition, Cothren said he helped Sexton win the House Speaker’s race in 2019 after Casada resigned the post, then fell out of favor.
Phoenix Solutions, the secretive company run by Cothren in cahoots with Casada and Smith, tapped into House members’ postage and printing money for constituent mailers. The trio had to keep Cothren’s role quiet because of his 2019 resignation from the chief of staff post in a racist and sexist texting scandal.
Phoenix Solutions ran into trouble getting paid by the Legislative Administration office run by Connie Ridley. As questions arose about the vendor, Cothren signed a W-9 form as “Matthew Phoenix,” a bogus name for the company’s president, one of the linchpins for the government’s case.
When FBI agents raided Casada’s home in January 2021, he ultimately told them that Cothren couldn’t “deal” with lawmakers or be known as running Phoenix Solutions because Sexton didn’t like him.

CLARKSDALE – J’s Grocery opened its doors in Clarksdale on May 2, marking a turning point for a community lacking access to fresh produce. Located in the Eastgate neighborhood, a historically underserved area, the store brings not only convenience but also a vital resource for those facing food insecurity.

Tyler Yarbrough, a local advocate and director of Mississippi Delta programs at Partnership for a Healthier America, has deep personal ties to the neighborhood. He grew up just a few blocks away in Eastgate, where he witnessed firsthand the struggles families faced in accessing fresh food. 
“I grew up in this neighborhood, and it was difficult to find healthy food options,” Yarbrough said. “I’m proud to be part of this effort to bring a neighborhood corner store back to life, where residents can walk a few steps and find fresh produce.”
Before the opening of J’s Grocery, many neighborhood stores had closed, and those still open primarily offered shelf-stable snacks. Yarbrough, along with partners, have worked to revitalize this corner of Clarksdale by reconnecting the community with local farmers and providing fresh fruits, vegetables, and meats. 
“This isn’t just about food; it’s about connecting people to their roots and building a healthier future,” Yarbrough said.

The Jones family has served the Clarksdale community for over 27 years by providing essential groceries and community services, including a laundromat and barber shop. After J’s Grocery closed for several years, the family took the lead in its recent reopening, working closely with local advocates and organizations — such as Yarbrough’s Partnership for a Healthier America and the nonprofit Rootswell — to renovate the space and refocus the store on fresh, healthy food options. This collaboration reflects their commitment to continuing the family’s legacy of service while addressing food insecurity in the neighborhood. 
“We want to give the community a better way to eat,” said Alshun Jones, the son of store owner Al Jones.  “It’s about supporting the neighborhood and providing healthy options that have been missing for so long.”

Store owner Al Jones expressed his gratitude for the support and partnerships that made the store’s opening possible. “This is just the beginning,” Al said. “We want to see more stores like this across the city, helping communities thrive.”
The store’s reopening also signals the beginning of a larger community revitalization effort, which includes plans for murals and safer sidewalks to connect the store to the nearby schools and residences.
With its focus on fresh food, community involvement, and local partnerships, J’s Grocery is more than just a store — it’s a beacon of hope for the Eastgate neighborhood, offering a fresh start for residents and a model for revitalizing food access in rural communities.

(Photo by Kayla Bartkowski/Getty Images)Private equity companies have gobbled up group homes and other services for people with disabilities, attracting the attention of state and federal regulators across the nation and alarming advocates.
People with intellectual or developmental disabilities have suffered abuse, neglect and even death while under the care of private equity-owned providers, according to a recent report from watchdog group Private Equity Stakeholder Project.
“Private equity firms are, more than many other types of investors, laser-focused on maximizing their cash flow, often trying to double or triple their investment over a relatively short period of time, usually just a handful of years,” said Eileen O’Grady, the report’s author. “The way that private equity firms will often do that is to cut costs.”

 According to the report, two of the top 10 largest private-equity owned developmental disabilities care providers operate in New Mexico: Team Services Group / Team Public Choices, owned by Alpine Investors; and Sevita, owned by Centerbridge Partners, Vistria Group.

For companies that provide essential services for people with disabilities, she said, “those cuts can have really harmful impacts on people’s lives.”
In late 2023, Florida moved to revoke the license of NeuroRestorative, one branch of the private equity-owned health services company Sevita, which provides services for people with disabilities. State regulators cited repeat violations by NeuroRestorative and a failure to “protect the rights of its clients to be free from physical abuse.” Ultimately the state opted not to revoke the license and fined the company $13,000 in a settlement.
But in recent years regulators have documented instances of patient harm at Sevita’s affiliates in multiple other states, including Colorado, Indiana, Iowa, Massachusetts and Utah. In 2019, a U.S. Senate committee conducted a probe into the company’s operations in Iowa and Oregon following multiple reports of patient abuse and neglect.
‘Shell game’: When private equity comes to town, hospitals can see cutbacks, closures

“Any entity that receives taxpayer dollars, but especially those charged with caring for our fellow Americans who may have an intellectual disability, ought to be doing everything under the sun to ensure quality care and continually improve,” U.S. Sen. Chuck Grassley, an Iowa Republican, said in a statement in 2020 following his investigation.
In a statement to Stateline, Sevita did not address the sanctions directly, but avowed its commitment to providing services and supports to give people greater independence, regardless of their intellectual or physical challenges.
“Since 2019, when new ownership acquired the company, there has been significant capital investment to improve and expand our services, enhance facilities, implement robust training and new technologies, and strengthen our workforce — all with the goal of better serving our individuals and communities,” the statement said.
The disability care industry has proven increasingly attractive to private equity.
In recent years, a handful of large private equity-owned companies such as Sevita have snapped up hundreds of smaller providers of disability services — often community nonprofits, mom-and-pop businesses and religious organizations — and rolled them into larger corporations.
From 2013 to 2023, private equity firms acquired more than 1,000 disability and elder care providers, according to the report by the Private Equity Stakeholder Project. That’s likely an undercount because they’re generally not required to disclose acquisitions, the report said.
Cash cow
Private equity firms use pooled investments from pension funds, sovereign wealth funds, endowments and wealthy individuals to buy a controlling stake in a company. They seek to maximize its value — often by cutting costs — and then sell it at a profit.
Most of Sevita’s revenue comes from providing disability services. It operates companies in 40 states under various brands, including Mentor Network, NeuroRestorative and REM.
Sevita is currently owned by private equity firms Centerbridge Partners and Vistria Group, which also own Help at Home, a home health company with more than 200 locations across about a dozen states.
Nearly all of Sevita’s revenue comes from Medicaid, according to a February 2025 report from S&P Global.
Private equity’s growing footprint in home health care draws scrutiny

Through Medicaid and Medicare, the government pays for most services for people with intellectual or developmental disabilities. The two programs cover services such as group homes, adult day programs, in-home care, and physical and occupational therapy.
“Sevita has been owned by private equity firms for over a decade now, and has been under investigation and scrutiny at the federal and state level for basically that entire time,” O’Grady said.
In 2022, Iowa fined a NeuroRestorative group home $10,500 after a resident was left unattended in a liquor store and drank three-quarters of a bottle of vodka. The same year, Massachusetts temporarily removed Sevita’s license to operate group homes after regulators reported inadequate staff training and supervision, and a “myriad of issues that were uncovered onsite,” according to a Massachusetts Department of Developmental Services report.
The federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services has fined a NeuroRestorative facility in Utah four times since 2022. A February 2024 inspection report by the agency found the facility “failed to prevent abuse, neglect … and exploitation” of residents.
Last year, Florida fined another Sevita brand, Florida Mentor, for improper use of restraints. More issues have been documented in Sevita-owned locations in Arkansas, California, Colorado, Illinois, Indiana, New Hampshire and Nevada.
Meanwhile, Sevita’s owners, Centerbridge and Vistria, have collected nearly half a billion dollars since 2019 by loading Sevita and Help at Home with debt in order to pay dividends to investors, according to Moody’s, a financial services company.
Similar financial maneuvering contributed to the recent collapse of Steward Health Care, a private equity-owned hospital system that once had more than 30 hospitals nationwide. Steward has become a cautionary tale about the harm that profit-driven private equity firms can do to a state’s health system.
“Before Steward Health Care ultimately collapsed, executives spent years hiding their financial information from state regulators, putting patients and our health care system at risk,” Massachusetts Democratic House Speaker Ron Mariano said in a statement earlier this year announcing a new state law that beefs up reporting and financial requirements for private investors.
“That’s why ensuring that our institutions are equipped to monitor the health care landscape, and to guard against trends and transactions that drive up costs without improving patient outcomes, is so important.”
David vs. Goliath
After two residents of a New Jersey group home died from choking on food in 2017, attorney Cory Bernstein became interested in private equity’s involvement in disability services. The residents had been living in homes operated by AdvoServ, a company then owned by the private equity firm Wellspring Capital Management. The state had cited AdvoServ more times than any other operator in New Jersey for abuse, neglect and unsafe conditions.
AdvoServ later ceased operations in 2019 after multiple state agencies, including in New Jersey, Florida and Maryland, launched investigations.




States just don’t really have the resources or tools to do what needs to be done.


– Cory Bernstein, staff attorney at the National Disability Rights Network



But even when state regulators are doing all they can to protect people with disabilities from substandard care, they’re limited in how much they can hold a company accountable, Bernstein told Stateline.
“It’s state-level oversight on a national entity with not much [help] coming from the federal side,” said Bernstein, who is now a staff attorney at the National Disability Rights Network, a membership organization of federally mandated state disability advocacy programs.
“States just don’t really have the resources or tools to do what needs to be done.”
A regulatory agency in Georgia might shut down all the group homes owned by a certain company, for example, but those regulators can’t do anything about the company’s abuses in, say, Montana. With branches in multiple states, a company is better able to withstand sanctions or even a loss of license in one state, he said.
“[States] are not set up to go up against a national operator with billions of dollars in resources in a regulatory or oversight battle,” Bernstein said.
Further complicating things for state regulators and for consumers is that a large services company such as Sevita might operate under multiple brand names, even in one state. It can be hard to parse out who owns a sanctioned business. Multiple brand names can also obscure a company’s monopoly on a particular regional market.
Vets fret as private equity snaps up clinics, pet care companies

When Florida regulators reached a settlement agreement with Sevita’s NeuroRestorative last year, the state dismissed its proposed license revocation. O’Grady believes one reason the state chose to settle is the difficulty of finding alternative facilities to relocate the residents who would have been displaced from the 13 locations the company operated around the state.
“Because of that dearth of alternatives and the impotence of the state to act more fully, this company will continue to be allowed to operate,” she said.
Further complicating oversight: Large companies often operate various services that are overseen by different agencies. Group homes might be regulated under the state’s Medicaid program, while facilities that provide more intensive care might come under federal Medicare oversight.
There could be “two completely different oversight systems for facilities serving the same population in the same state with the same name,” Bernstein said.
State solutions
Some states have moved to address problems with private equity involvement in health care by passing tighter restrictions on mergers and acquisitions of health care companies.
In Rhode Island, where private equity companies’ mismanagement of health care providers threatened the future of local hospitals, a robust oversight law allowed the state attorney general to impose conditions to protect the hospitals’ finances.
More states are following suit. In 2023 alone, 24 states enacted laws related to health system consolidation and competition, while this year at least half a dozen have considered legislation to check private equity-fueled health care mergers.

For nearly three decades, a pair of nonprofits – the North Carolina Institute of Medicine and NC Child – have released a biennial study known as the Child Health Report Card. The goal, as you might expect, is to provide legislators, public health officials, school administrators, parents and other nonprofit leaders with the latest information on the health and well-being of our state’s kids.
This year – as in 2023 – the focus of the report is on the mental health struggles that plague so many children and the urgent need for better (and better funded) public responses. And recently, to learn more about this issue and several others detailed in the report, NC Newsline caught up with the leaders of the two organizations – Institute of Medicine President and CEO Michelle Ries and NC Child executive director, Erica Palmer Smith.

Glenn Youngkin speaks at an event where he rolled out his amendments to the state budget in March. (Photo by Markus Schmidt/Virginia Mercury)Virginia’s general fund revenues rose sharply in April, bucking signs of a national economic cooldown as the state continues to post steady long-time job growth and rake in more tax dollars than projected.
Gov. Glenn Youngkin announced Monday that general fund revenues are up 6.3% — nearly $1.5 billion — compared to the same 10-month period last fiscal year. April alone brought in $322.4 million more than the same month in 2024, marking an 8.8% jump. Overall, revenues are tracking 0.8% — or $211.1 million — ahead of the state’s official forecast, with two months left in the fiscal year.
“Virginia’s financials remain strong, reflecting strong job growth and business investment,” Youngkin said in a statement. “With over 265,000 more Virginians working today versus three years ago and over $100 billion in capital investment commitments from companies eager to grow in Virginia, the Commonwealth’s financial performance is tracking ahead of forecast.”
The upbeat state report comes even as the national economy posted a notable dip in growth. According to a memo from Secretary of Finance Stephen Cummings to the governor, real U.S. GDP growth fell sharply in the first quarter of 2025. 
The decline was largely driven by a surge in imports, as consumers rushed to beat expected tariffs. Imports grew at a 9% annual rate, while the rest of the economy posted a more modest 2% pace.
Despite the GDP slide, hiring remained solid. The U.S. added 177,000 jobs in April, and Virginia tacked on 5,900 jobs in March — the most recent month with available data — led by construction, health care and transportation. The state’s unemployment rate nudged up slightly to 3.2% in March, up from 3.1 percent the previous month.
Still, federal employment is showing cracks. Virginia lost an estimated 4,100 federal jobs in March, while nationally the federal government shed 9,000 jobs in April — figures that state officials say bear watching.
“Strong revenue results for April, a significant collection month, indicate that the Virginia economy continues to exceed our prudent forecast,” Cummings said in a statement. “While we continue to have confidence in our FY2025 forecast and the long-term resiliency and strength of the Virginia economy, we are cognizant of potential short-term risks associated with federal job reductions and the resetting of trade relationships.”
Cummings added that the governor’s final budget decisions reflect a “prudent and responsible plan on behalf of our taxpayers to provide additional cushion for the commonwealth’s general fund resources.”
Meanwhile, inflation cooled slightly in April. Consumer prices rose 2.3% compared to last year, down from 2.4% in March and well below the 3.3% rate seen a year ago. Core inflation, which excludes food and energy, held steady at 2.8%. The Federal Reserve’s preferred inflation gauge also fell, with the core personal consumption expenditures index easing to 2.6% in March.

State wildlife agencies have a big job.
While the federal government protects animals listed under the Endangered Species Act, states are tasked with keeping the vast majority of other species out of the “emergency room.” Habitat loss, pollution and climate change are making that job much more difficult.
At the same time, states are finding it harder to count on the hunting and fishing revenues that have long funded most of their work. Agencies say they have more challenges than ever before, and less money to take them on.
In many states, lawmakers are rethinking the long-standing model for wildlife management. They’re considering new funding sources to make the agencies less reliant on license fees. They’re asking wildlife managers to expand their work beyond traditional “game” species, adding protections for threatened insects and other animals. And some are scrutinizing the commissions that have long governed wildlife management.
Some of the proposals have seen broad support from outdoors lovers who want to strengthen their wildlife agencies. Others have drawn opposition from sporting groups, who fear the new focus will diminish hunting and fishing opportunities.
“We’re seeing quite a bit of action this year,” said Logan Christian, wildlife and habitat specialist with the National Caucus of Environmental Legislators, a forum for state lawmakers. “We definitely have noticed that states are working on strengthening their wildlife agencies.”
As Stateline previously reported, New Mexico enacted the most sweeping overhaul this year. It renamed the Department of Game & Fish as the Department of Wildlife, giving it a more explicit focus on non-game species. Budget writers provided $10.5 million in new funding over the next three years to help threatened species. And lawmakers created a new process for appointing the agency’s commissioners, with guidelines ensuring a diversity of expertise and experience.
Wildlife advocates in other states say the New Mexico overhaul was a game changer. But lawmakers elsewhere are taking a more piecemeal approach.
Dollars
Numerous states are reconsidering their wildlife agencies’ funding model.
“There’s definitely a growing awareness that the current management system is outdated and really unfit for 21st century challenges,” said Michelle Lute, executive director of Wildlife for All, a nonprofit focused on overhauling state wildlife governance. “State wildlife agencies are seeing that they can’t rely on hunting and fishing license fees to be able to do this work.”

Earlier this year, lawmakers in Utah enacted a new tax on wind and solar projects that will help fund the state’s wildlife agency. The revenue could double the department’s funding to protect non-game species, from $5 million to $10 million.
“We have a funding model in place for game species,” said Paul Thompson, administrator of the Species Protection Account with the Utah Division of Wildlife Resources. “Funding to work on some of our native species programs has been really hard to come by.”
The new revenue could allow the agency to invest in more biologists, conservation easements, watershed restoration projects and native fish hatchery programs. State Rep. Casey Snider, the Republican who sponsored the bill, argued that the clean energy sector should pay because its development is harming Utah’s habitat.
“Wind and solar projects have an outsized impact on [non-game] species, and they have not been contributing financially,” he said.
But industry leaders said the law will threaten the state’s energy development.
“[The measure will] severely strain the economics of an existing project and send a negative message to developers and the financial institutions that provide capital for these projects,” said Theresa Foxley, chief of staff to rPlus Energies, a renewable developer, in testimony to lawmakers.
Lawmakers in Oregon are considering an increase to the state’s tax on hotel and short-term rental stays to help fund non-game wildlife work. The proposal would bring in about $30 million annually. State Rep. Ken Helm, the bill’s Democratic sponsor, said the state wildlife agency’s division to manage non-game species “has come and gone over the last 30 years as funding is available.”
Growing concerns about climate change and biodiversity have created urgency to find a stable funding source, he said. Helm said the lodging tax is a logical source, because the state’s tourism industry is centered on the outdoors. He noted that Oregon’s natural resources agencies receive only a tiny fraction of the state’s general revenue.
Travel and tourism groups oppose the bill, arguing it could drive visitors elsewhere. Helm has also proposed a bill that would bring in wildlife funding through an income tax increase.
He said his message to fellow lawmakers was: “I’ve given you two ways to get the money we need for this agency. Nobody’s been able to come up with a better idea. Just pick one.”
The bill was heard in committee earlier this month, but has not yet advanced.
As states rethink wildlife management, New Mexico offers a new model

Meanwhile, lawmakers in Hawaii approved a “green fee” — a lodging tax increase of 0.75% that Democratic Gov. Josh Green’s office estimates will bring in $100 million annually to help protect the state from climate change. While the fund is not explicitly focused on wildlife, it’s expected to contribute to efforts such as coral reef restoration and watershed protection that will benefit important habitats.
State Rep. Amy Perruso, a Democrat who was among the advocates for a green fee, said the COVID-19 pandemic was a wakeup call.
“With the absence of tourists, we saw a lot more fish in the ocean, everything about the environment was so much more healthy because we didn’t have 10 million extra people,” she said. “If we’re going to do something to protect the environment, [tourism] is a logical connection.”
Washington state was among the first to significantly invest in non-game conservation through state tax revenue, with legislation enacted two years ago. The budget passed by lawmakers this session continues that work, with $14 million set aside for biodiversity and species recovery each of the next two years.
Lawmakers in Kansas and North Carolina also proposed using more general fund revenue for wildlife work, although those measures have not advanced.
Mission
In other states, lawmakers are focused on expanding their wildlife agencies’ mission to more non-game species. Last year, Colorado gave wildlife managers the authority to manage insects and other invertebrates, as well as rare plants.
“Invertebrates are wildlife, and their conservation benefits the entire ecosystem, including the species [state wildlife officials] traditionally managed,” said Richard Reading, vice chair of the Colorado Parks and Wildlife Commission. “They do everything from creating our soils to filtering our water to pollinating the food we eat.”
Reading also serves as vice president of science and conservation at the Butterfly Pavilion, an insect zoo. He noted that studies are showing that many invertebrate species are in rapid decline. In addition to expanding the agency’s authority, lawmakers provided funding for six staff members to take on the additional work.
A similar bill in Nevada, focused on invertebrates, advanced through the Assembly’s natural resources committee.
“There’s definitely concerns about declines in pollinator species,” said Assemblymember Howard Watts, a Democrat who sponsored the bill. “Our wildlife agency can and should take proactive action to do research, surveys and habitat improvement to keep these species off the [endangered species list].”
Watts said the bill would allow wildlife managers to consider insects in state plans to protect imperiled species. He said the Nevada Department of Wildlife has requested an entomologist position if it’s asked to take on the additional species. Beyond that, he said, the measure would not require additional money, as it’s focused on voluntary, proactive work, rather than additional regulations.
State wildlife agencies focus on ‘hook and bullet’ work. Some see a new path.

Another bill in Pennsylvania would expand wildlife managers’ authority to include insects. That measure has been approved by the House Environmental and Natural Resources Protection Committee.
Sporting groups have largely been supportive of efforts to provide new funding sources to manage non-game species. But some are skeptical of plans to expand agencies’ mission without an increase in revenue.
“Most hunters and anglers understand that healthy game populations are dependent on ecosystem integrity,” said Devin O’Dea, Western policy and conservation manager with Backcountry Hunters & Anglers, a nonprofit focused on public lands. “But when you take a model that’s been developed with the intent of enforcing regulations for fish and game species, expand that scope without funding and additional capacity, it’s a recipe for something to fall off the plate.”
Governance
Meanwhile, some legislators want to rethink the commission model that oversees wildlife governance. Critics say that governors often select commissioners who are hunting guides, farmers and political donors. Once appointed, they enact wildlife policies to suit their economic interests.
Florida state Rep. Anna V. Eskamani, a Democrat, drafted a bill that would overhaul the state’s Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission. Her proposal would increase the board from seven to nine members. It would designate seats for scientists, conservationists, local officials, farmers, hunters and anglers.
“The commission has made decisions not based on science or conservation, but based on developers or landowners that engage in agricultural practices,” she said. “We tried to strike a balance to ensure there are voices with an environmental background, with a conservation and wildlife background, with an academic background.”
The bill did not advance, but Eskamani said grassroots support is building for systemic changes in wildlife management.
Some sporting groups are more wary of commission overhaul proposals.
“We have seen examples where proposed changes to commissions were politically motivated or motivated by anti-hunting and anti-angling interests,” said Kent Keene senior manager for Western states and agriculture policy with the Congressional Sportsmen’s Foundation, a group that promotes hunting and fishing priorities on Capitol Hill. “When those changes are focused on science-based needs, then the sportsmen’s community has a long history of supporting those steps to ensure we are protecting our heritage.”
Some hunting and fishing groups have emphasized that the expanded mission should come with additional funding, so agencies aren’t stretched thin. Keene noted that hunters and anglers pay an excise tax on the purchase of gear, which provides an important funding source for wildlife agencies. Some have proposed a similar “backpack tax” on gear for hikers, birdwatchers and others.
Another proposal in New Hampshire would give the wildlife agency’s executive director the authority to make policy decisions, relegating the Fish and Game Commission to an advisory body. That bill did not advance.

(Photo by Hadley Barndollar/New Hampshire Bulletin)Helen Hanks is stepping down from her role as New Hampshire Department of Corrections commissioner, Gov. Kelly Ayotte’s office announced Monday.
The announcement comes amid deep staffing shortages within the department, which have led to increased overtime pay as workers cover shifts left open by vacancies. Hanks told the Bulletin in June her department was facing a $3.44 million deficit caused in large part by these overtime payouts. The department said at the time that 46% of its positions were vacant.
In April, amid the state budgeting process, Hanks made an impassioned plea to state senators to reverse budget cuts and staff layoffs that the House implemented in their budget proposal. The majority of those layoffs affected civilian staff, not sworn officers. The Senate is still working through the budget and will have to pass its version of the budget, hash out any differences with the House, and have the governor approve it before the start of next fiscal year in July. In her plea, Hanks argued that these cuts would result in more offenders committing new crimes after leaving prison due to reduced rehabilitation and treatment programs; the department struggling to meet legal requirements; and maybe even the state being forced to call the New Hampshire National Guard for assistance.
Ayotte’s office said the governor would nominate John Scippa, director of New Hampshire Police Standards and Training, as acting commissioner while the state searches for Hanks’ replacement. The Executive Council will have to confirm Scippa before he can begin the role. The council’s next meeting is scheduled for Wednesday.
Hanks had been with the Department of Corrections since 2003, when she was hired as a social worker in the department’s Division of Medical and Forensic Services and assigned to the New Hampshire State Prison for Men. In 2005, she earned her first leadership role in the department when she was named deputy director of medical and forensic services. She slowly rose in the ranks of the department until 2017, when then-Gov. Chris Sununu appointed her commissioner. She was the first woman confirmed to the role.
Ayotte’s office also said Monday that Assistant Corrections Commissioner Paul Raymond has been placed on leave “effective immediately.”",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/IMG_8356-1-1024x537.jpg,,,2025-05-19 14:11:44.033873

Tate IV, who previously led Louisiana State University, to replace Jonathan Holloway as Rutgers University's next president. He's expected to start working on July 1. (Photo by Nick Romanenko, courtesy of Rutgers University)A social scientist and mathematician who has helmed Louisiana State University since 2021 will be the next president of Rutgers University.
William F. Tate IV will replace Jonathan Holloway, whose rocky five-year tenure was marred by a deadly global pandemic, a faculty strike, student protests over Gaza, and most recently, growing hostility and cuts from the Trump administration.
Rutgers’ board of governors, with the consent of its trustees, unanimously approved Tate Monday morning to lead New Jersey’s 67,000-student flagship university and applauded his “leadership abilities, academic credentials, intelligence, and administrative skills.”
“Dr. Tate is (an) extraordinary leader, a scholar, an innovator, and a transformative force whose vision will unite academic excellence with public impact,” trustees chair Amy Mansue said at a joint meeting in New Brunswick.
He will start July 1, with an annual base salary of $1.1 million and opportunities to pad his pay considerably with performance incentives.
Gov. Phil Murphy was on hand Monday to welcome him to New Jersey.
“I was instantly and incredibly impressed,” Murphy said of Tate’s credentials. “As they say in the movies, ‘He had me at hello.’”
Tate was the first Black president of Louisiana State University, that state’s flagship school with more than 55,000 students.
He had a turbulent tenure there, stirring controversy for a recent hiring freeze and for his decisions to drop diversity, equity, and inclusion language and to disband a committee tasked with renaming campus buildings with problematic names. One such building is named after John M. Parker, a former Louisiana governor who participated in the 1891 lynching of 11 Italian immigrants in New Orleans, the largest mass lynching in U.S. history.
Tate leaves Louisiana as officials there debate whether to split his position into two jobs. Besides serving as the university’s chief executive and academic officer, he also holds faculty appointments in sociology, psychiatry and behavioral medicine, epidemiology, and population and public health.
Before Louisiana, he served for 18 years as dean of the graduate school at Washington University in St. Louis, followed by about a year as provost at the University of South Carolina. He’s a Chicago native and married father of two with degrees from Northern Illinois University, University of Texas, University of Maryland, and the Washington University School of Medicine.
He was selected by a 20-member committee tasked with replacing Holloway, who announced in September he would step down. Officials said the committee considered “hundreds” of candidates. Dory Devlin, a Rutgers spokeswoman, declined to identify other finalists.
Tate said he’s “ready” for Rutgers and New Jersey, citing his upbringing in Chicago’s Bronzeville, a historically Black neighborhood.
“There is a lot in common between the grit, resilience, and toughness required to negotiate Bronzeville and here in the great state of New Jersey. So I’m ready,” Tate said.
Tate saluted Holloway for his work in positioning Rutgers “at the edge of excellence,” noting the increasingly tough times for higher education administrators.
“If you took a presidency in 2020 and you ended in 2025 I would submit you those were the five hardest years to ever be a university president,” Tate said.

Tate will be the 22nd president of Rutgers, which at 258 years old is one of the oldest universities in the U.S.
Holloway, a U.S. historian, was Rutgers’ first Black president, earning over $1 million a year.
He will remain Rutgers’ president until June 30 and then take a sabbatical during the 2025-26 academic year for research projects before returning to Rutgers as a full-time faculty member.

Within President Donald Trump’s first days in office, immigration officials in Michigan were sounding alarm bells for how his administration’s overhaul of the nation’s immigration system would negatively impact communities and children, making families afraid to send their kids to school or go to the hospital if they need help.
Volunteer child advocates for the Young Center for Immigrant Children’s Rights provide stability and oversight for children while they’re in government custody and facing deportation, the center’s website says. Volunteers visit children once a week, attending court proceedings and other meetings with a child in order to advocate for their welfare.
Amongst the new administration’s immigration policies, which include cutting federal programs for non-citizens, halting refugee services and deporting tens of thousands of people, the administration has terminated legal services for migrant children in the country alone who face navigating the legal system.
In order to combat the gap in help children can access, the Young Center for Immigrant Children’s Rights is holding informational meetings on May 27 and June 2 about becoming a volunteer, ahead of volunteer training on June 28 and 29. The center said in a news release that individuals, aged 21 or older, from all professions and social backgrounds are welcome to apply to be a volunteer. The center is also looking for bilingual volunteers.

The latest evidence of the Republican Party’s growth in Florida is news announced on Monday that registered Republicans now outrank Democrats in Miami-Dade County, the most populous in Florida.
The latest voter rolls in the county now show 464,370 registered Republicans, or 34% of voters, 440,790 Democrats, or 32.27%. Independent and third-party voters together number 460,783, or 33.7%.
“This is a total repudiation of the Democrats’ failed agenda. Miami-Dade is no longer their safe haven — it’s the beating heart of the Republican revolution,” said Evan Power, chairman of the Republican Party of Florida, in a written statement.
“We’re the party of hardworking families, Hispanic patriots, and communities demanding safe streets, top-notch schools, and a booming economy. Miami-Dade proves the unstoppable momentum of the Republican message.”
Long a Democratic stronghold, the majority-Latino area has been trending more politically right over the past decade but continued to back Democrats at the top of the ticket until the past couple of election cycles.
Although Donald Trump has won the state of Florida in the past three presidential elections, Miami-Dade voters supported Hillary Clinton in 2016 and Joe Biden in 2020. But Biden’s 2020 win was by only 7 points, down from Clinton’s 29-point margin of victory in 2016.

Then, last fall, Trump won Miami-Dade County for the first time in a presidential election, defeating Kamala Harris there by 11 points, becoming the first Republican to win in Miami-Dade since George H.W. Bush over Michael Dukakis in 1988 (Trump won the state by 13 points).
Florida has seen a surge of Republican voters since the COVID-19 crisis in 2020. Whereas Ron DeSantis narrowly defeated Democrat Andrew Gillum in the race for governor in 2018 in a vote so close it took a recount to sort out, he came back and defeated Democrat Charlie Crist by 19 points statewide in 2022.
DeSantis won Miami-Dade that year by 11 points. In 2018, he lost to Gillum by 21 points, according to the Miami Herald.
To see how quickly the tide has turned, one need only look back at 2018, when Florida Democrats enjoyed a more than 264,000-voter registration lead. The Republican Party of Florida in 2021 overtook the Democrats for the first time in the state, and their lead today stands at 1.29 million.
“A decade ago, Miami-Dade County was a deep blue county with hundreds of thousands more registered Democrats than Republicans,” DeSantis said on X on Monday morning. “Today, the county — with more than 2.8 million people — has a Republican voter registration advantage. Nobody would have predicted this ten years ago.”
“THE BEST IS YET TO COME,” said Southwest Republican U.S. Rep. and gubernatorial candidate Byron Donalds.
“Miami-Dade County has completed its off-year voter roll maintenance, and this morning, it shed 172,747 voters from its active voters,” said Michael Pruser, director of data science with Decision Desk HQ.
“The change netted Republican voters more than 38,000 voters compared to Democrats, and the country has now flipped to Republican by registration,” he added.
This is the second large county to flip from blue to red this year in Florida. In January, Republican voters overtook Democrats in Hillsborough County, the third-most populous in Florida. Republicans now lead in 59 out of 67 counties in voter registration.

(Courtesy photo)The state agency that runs state courts on Monday morning named Esperanza Lucero as its first-ever behavioral health integration and reform administrator, the person tasked with implementing major parts of a new state law reforming New Mexico’s behavioral health system.
New Mexico this year enacted Senate Bill 3, which is meant to rebuild the state’s systems for addressing mental health challenges, including substance use disorder.
The law requires the Administrative Office of the Courts to divide the state into behavioral health regions, each of which will identify five behavioral health priorities over the next four years.
“I see the Judiciary as uniquely suited to providing the leadership to bring together local stakeholders and providers in a meaningful way,” Esperanza said in a statement.
Esperanza’s first task in her new position is to assess the initiatives already underway in New Mexico under what is called Sequential Intercept Mapping (SIM), Supreme Court Chief Justice David Thomson said in a statement.
SIM is a commonly used conceptual model developed in the early 2000s that outlines points of “intercept” where people with mental health or substance use disorders can receive treatment and support.
AOC completed mapping for Santa Fe County in January; for Rio Arriba County in December; and for the Eighth Judicial District in northeastern New Mexico in October, according to reports published on its website.
A mapping workshop for the Fourth Judicial District in Mora, San Miguel and Guadalupe counties is scheduled for June 10 and 11, and a workshop for Los Alamos County is scheduled for June 23 and 24.
By June 1, the state Health Care Authority’s Behavioral Health Services Division will provide AOC with behavioral health standards and service evaluation guidelines, and by the end of this year, the state’s Medicaid program will establish a group of licensing boards to help streamline mental health providers’ credentialing, according to a timeline presented by New Mexico’s top adult mental health services official earlier this month.
Lucero previously served as director of the state Department of Health’s Center for Health Protection, and led the Aging and Long-Term Services Department’s Adult Protective Services Division.
“Her experience working extensively with state and local agencies to implement policy, strategies and initiatives will help in laying the groundwork for behavioral health system improvements required by state law,” AOC Director Karl W. Reifsteck said in a statement.

Earlier this year, lawmakers in Utah enacted a new tax on wind and solar projects that will help fund the state’s wildlife agency. The revenue could double the department’s funding to protect non-game species, from $5 million to $10 million.
“We have a funding model in place for game species,” said Paul Thompson, administrator of the Species Protection Account with the Utah Division of Wildlife Resources. “Funding to work on some of our native species programs has been really hard to come by.”
The new revenue could allow the agency to invest in more biologists, conservation easements, watershed restoration projects and native fish hatchery programs. State Rep. Casey Snider, the Republican who sponsored the bill, argued that the clean energy sector should pay because its development is harming Utah’s habitat.
“Wind and solar projects have an outsized impact on [non-game] species, and they have not been contributing financially,” he said.
But industry leaders said the law will threaten the state’s energy development.
“[The measure will] severely strain the economics of an existing project and send a negative message to developers and the financial institutions that provide capital for these projects,” said Theresa Foxley, chief of staff to rPlus Energies, a renewable developer, in testimony to lawmakers.
Lawmakers in Oregon are considering an increase to the state’s tax on hotel and short-term rental stays to help fund non-game wildlife work. The proposal would bring in about $30 million annually. State Rep. Ken Helm, the bill’s Democratic sponsor, said the state wildlife agency’s division to manage non-game species “has come and gone over the last 30 years as funding is available.”
Growing concerns about climate change and biodiversity have created urgency to find a stable funding source, he said. Helm said the lodging tax is a logical source, because the state’s tourism industry is centered on the outdoors. He noted that Oregon’s natural resources agencies receive only a tiny fraction of the state’s general revenue.
Travel and tourism groups oppose the bill, arguing it could drive visitors elsewhere. Helm has also proposed a bill that would bring in wildlife funding through an income tax increase.
He said his message to fellow lawmakers was: “I’ve given you two ways to get the money we need for this agency. Nobody’s been able to come up with a better idea. Just pick one.”
The bill was heard in committee earlier this month, but has not yet advanced.

Meanwhile, lawmakers in Hawaii approved a “green fee” — a lodging tax increase of 0.75% that Democratic Gov. Josh Green’s office estimates will bring in $100 million annually to help protect the state from climate change. While the fund is not explicitly focused on wildlife, it’s expected to contribute to efforts such as coral reef restoration and watershed protection that will benefit important habitats.
State Rep. Amy Perruso, a Democrat who was among the advocates for a green fee, said the COVID-19 pandemic was a wakeup call.
“With the absence of tourists, we saw a lot more fish in the ocean, everything about the environment was so much more healthy because we didn’t have 10 million extra people,” she said. “If we’re going to do something to protect the environment, [tourism] is a logical connection.”
Washington state was among the first to significantly invest in non-game conservation through state tax revenue, with legislation enacted two years ago. The budget passed by lawmakers this session continues that work, with $14 million set aside for biodiversity and species recovery each of the next two years.
Lawmakers in Kansas and North Carolina also proposed using more general fund revenue for wildlife work, although those measures have not advanced.

Mission

In other states, lawmakers are focused on expanding their wildlife agencies’ mission to more non-game species. Last year, Colorado gave wildlife managers the authority to manage insects and other invertebrates, as well as rare plants.
“Invertebrates are wildlife, and their conservation benefits the entire ecosystem, including the species [state wildlife officials] traditionally managed,” said Richard Reading, vice chair of the Colorado Parks and Wildlife Commission. “They do everything from creating our soils to filtering our water to pollinating the food we eat.”
Reading also serves as vice president of science and conservation at the Butterfly Pavilion, an insect zoo. He noted that studies are showing that many invertebrate species are in rapid decline. In addition to expanding the agency’s authority, lawmakers provided funding for six staff members to take on the additional work.
A similar bill in Nevada, focused on invertebrates, advanced through the Assembly’s natural resources committee.
“There’s definitely concerns about declines in pollinator species,” said Assemblymember Howard Watts, a Democrat who sponsored the bill. “Our wildlife agency can and should take proactive action to do research, surveys and habitat improvement to keep these species off the [endangered species list].”
Watts said the bill would allow wildlife managers to consider insects in state plans to protect imperiled species. He said the Nevada Department of Wildlife has requested an entomologist position if it’s asked to take on the additional species. Beyond that, he said, the measure would not require additional money, as it’s focused on voluntary, proactive work, rather than additional regulations.

Another bill in Pennsylvania would expand wildlife managers’ authority to include insects. That measure has been approved by the House Environmental and Natural Resources Protection Committee.
Sporting groups have largely been supportive of efforts to provide new funding sources to manage non-game species. But some are skeptical of plans to expand agencies’ mission without an increase in revenue.
“Most hunters and anglers understand that healthy game populations are dependent on ecosystem integrity,” said Devin O’Dea, Western policy and conservation manager with Backcountry Hunters & Anglers, a nonprofit focused on public lands. “But when you take a model that’s been developed with the intent of enforcing regulations for fish and game species, expand that scope without funding and additional capacity, it’s a recipe for something to fall off the plate.”

Governance

Meanwhile, some legislators want to rethink the commission model that oversees wildlife governance. Critics say that governors often select commissioners who are hunting guides, farmers and political donors. Once appointed, they enact wildlife policies to suit their economic interests.
Florida state Rep. Anna V. Eskamani, a Democrat, drafted a bill that would overhaul the state’s Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission. Her proposal would increase the board from seven to nine members. It would designate seats for scientists, conservationists, local officials, farmers, hunters and anglers.
“The commission has made decisions not based on science or conservation, but based on developers or landowners that engage in agricultural practices,” she said. “We tried to strike a balance to ensure there are voices with an environmental background, with a conservation and wildlife background, with an academic background.”
The bill did not advance, but Eskamani said grassroots support is building for systemic changes in wildlife management.
Some sporting groups are more wary of commission overhaul proposals.
“We have seen examples where proposed changes to commissions were politically motivated or motivated by anti-hunting and anti-angling interests,” said Kent Keene senior manager for Western states and agriculture policy with the Congressional Sportsmen’s Foundation, a group that promotes hunting and fishing priorities on Capitol Hill. “When those changes are focused on science-based needs, then the sportsmen’s community has a long history of supporting those steps to ensure we are protecting our heritage.”
Some hunting and fishing groups have emphasized that the expanded mission should come with additional funding, so agencies aren’t stretched thin. Keene noted that hunters and anglers pay an excise tax on the purchase of gear, which provides an important funding source for wildlife agencies. Some have proposed a similar “backpack tax” on gear for hikers, birdwatchers and others.
Another proposal in New Hampshire would give the wildlife agency’s executive director the authority to make policy decisions, relegating the Fish and Game Commission to an advisory body. That bill did not advance.

Saleena Gooch is suing Walgreens Pharmacy in U.S District Court for the Southern District of Iowa.
The lawsuit alleges the Walgreens store at 2508 W. Broadway, Council Bluffs, hired Gooch in January 2019 as a shift lead and in 2020 transferred her the store’s pharmacy, where she worked as a customer service associate, pharmacy technician and pharmacy operations manager.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
In July 2024, the lawsuit claims, Gooch was working in the store when the pharmacist on duty handed her a prescription order and instructed her to sell the medication to a waiting customer. Gooch allegedly followed the pharmacist’s directions, called out the name on the prescription order and the waiting customer responded.
She then asked the customer to verify, on a display screen, the telephone number associated with the order, to which the customer responded, “That is not my number.” Gooch reportedly asked the customer whether the displayed number could be an old phone number, and the customer indicated he didn’t think so, but then confirmed for Gooch the name of the medication included in the order.
Later in the day, another customer arrived and asked for the same prescription order Gooch had already sold, triggering an internal investigation as to what had transpired.
At some point after that incident, the lawsuit claims, Walgreens failed to review its proposed disciplinary action against Gooch in order to “take into consideration her diagnosis” of ADHD, and her employment was terminated.
According to the lawsuit, Gooch had previously been involved in other cases involving errors in dispensing medication. In October 2023, she had sold a prescription order, presumably to the wrong customer, in a situation where two different customers had the same first and last names.
In March 2024, a pharmacist instructed Gooch to ring up a prescription order despite the fact that the courier picking up the order was doing so for multiple customers and could not verify the customer information requested of him. It was later determined that one of the prescription orders was intended for a different individual.
A few weeks after that incident, in April 2024, Gooch sold a prescription order to another individual who was picking up multiple orders for different people. One prescription bag became stuck to another bag and was presumably sold despite a lack of verification as to that person’s identity.
It was after the incidents in March and April of 2024, the lawsuit alleges, that Walgreens management instructed Gooch to be tested for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, or ADHD, and she was later diagnosed with the disorder.
Her lawsuit seeks unspecified damages for alleged violations of state and federal laws prohibiting employers from discriminating against an individual on the basis of a physical or mental disability, such as ADHD.
Walgreens has yet to file a response to the lawsuit.
State records indicate Gooch’s pharmacy technician license is in good standing with the Iowa Board of Pharmacy, with no history of public disciplinary action.

(U.S. Army Corps of Engineers photo by Michael Davis) North Carolina Gov. Josh Stein is asking state lawmakers to approve $891 million in new relief for Hurricane Helene, signaling Monday that federal aid was continuing to dwindle and would not meet the needs of the western mountains.
Stein’s request — his second for hurricane aid since taking office in January — asks the General Assembly to infuse more than a quarter of a billion dollars into the western economy, including long-requested forgivable loans and grants for businesses. And it outlines investments to rebuild infrastructure, improve long-term housing and prepare for regional wildfires.
The state money will be especially crucial, the governor wrote, with pledged aid from the federal government “slow and uncertain.”
“I will continue to advocate for western North Carolina to our federal partners,” Stein wrote. “However, we suspect the burden will fall increasingly on state and local organizations.”
The legislature, which is controlled by Republicans, is unlikely to follow Stein’s request to the letter. But lawmakers have pledged to continue allocating aid, albeit with a more conservative approach. Helene aid will likely be considered as a separate bill from the larger state budget.



Stein asks for $891 million. Here are the highlights.
The largest line-item in Stein’s request is $100 million for the state to continue earning reimbursement from the feds. And he’s asking for an additional $50 million to cover “projects that neither federal and state programs nor insurance will support.”
Among other provisions:

A combined $100 million would go toward aid for small businesses — $50 million for forgivable loans and $50 million for grants.
School districts without flood insurance would see $70 million for repairs.
$50 million would fund stream debris removal, stabilization and farm infrastructure repairs.
Local governments facing budget shortfalls would see $40 million for revenue replacement.
Efforts to prevent and fight wildfires would see a $37 million infusion.
Tourism promotion and business adaptation efforts would get $15 million.
A combined $40 million would fund utility, rental and mortgage assistance, as well as efforts to prevent homelessness.

The legislature has thus far allocated a total of $1.6 billion for Helene relief. Around $1.4 billion has been appropriated, and another $202 million has been marked for spending but not yet sent out the door. The state’s last aid package, passed in March with bipartisan approval, totaled $524 million.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Hurricane-Helene-debris-Army-Corps-photo-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-05-19 13:12:21.304938

As the busy Memorial Day travel season begins, Delaware officials are urging drivers and passengers to buckle up as part of the national “Click It or Ticket” campaign.
Running from May 19 to June 8, the campaign pairs public education with stepped-up enforcement in an effort to reduce traffic fatalities involving unrestrained occupants.
The Delaware Office of Highway Safety (OHS), in coordination with state and local law enforcement, is leading the initiative, which will feature high-visibility patrols targeting seat belt violations during both daytime and nighttime hours.
“Although Delaware has a high seatbelt usage rate, the number of unrestrained fatalities is alarming,” said Sharon Bryson, Director of the Office of Highway Safety. “It is important to ensure everyone in the vehicle is properly restrained before driving.”
READ: Surf fishing reservations required starting May 24 at Delaware state parks
Delaware’s seatbelt usage has hovered around 92% in recent years, but unbelted occupants still accounted for 58% of traffic fatalities in 2024, according to state data. Young drivers and passengers, particularly those 19 and under, are especially vulnerable—accounting for 18% of crashes. Adults aged 35 to 44 are also overrepresented in unrestrained crashes.
The campaign also highlights national data. In 2023, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) reported 10,484 fatalities involving unbelted passengers. Alarmingly, 60% of those killed in back seats were not wearing seat belts, compared to 48% in the front. Nighttime driving proved especially dangerous, with 56% of those killed between 6 p.m. and 6 a.m. not buckled up.
Officials stress that air bags alone are not enough and that improper seat belt use—such as wearing the strap under the arm or behind the back—can render safety systems ineffective.
In addition to enforcement, OHS is emphasizing public education. Among their key safety tips:

Lap belts should rest across the hips, not the stomach.
Shoulder belts should go across the chest and never behind the back or under the arm.
Caregivers are urged to model seatbelt use for children and to avoid prematurely advancing children to the next stage of car seat.

More information, including seatbelt safety resources and campaign details, can be found here.
“Whether you are using a seatbelt, booster seat, or five point harness car seat, these restraints are all designed to help save lives and should be used correctly,” Bryson said. “The results of not wearing a seatbelt can be devastating, and buckling up can help prevent serious injury and fatality for you and your passengers.”",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/istockphoto-1163597718-612x612-1.jpg,,,2025-05-19 13:12:21.304938

(Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — The governor’s push for the executive branch to take on Nebraska medical cannabis regulations as a way to sidestep pending legislation at the statehouse would include no additional funding for months.
Gov. Jim Pillen’s spokesperson and the director of the Nebraska Department of Administrative Services confirmed Monday that under Pillen’s plan announced Friday, the Nebraska Medical Cannabis Commission still would have no additional funds to spend on developing rules or regulations. 
He announced his plan as lawmakers are set to debate Legislative Bill 677 Tuesday, which would legislatively create additional rules and regulations for the medical cannabis laws that voters overwhelmingly approved in November.
Pillen orders Nebraska medical cannabis regulations to proceed as legislative, legal fights approach

Under Pillen’s approach, the commission would need to make up for any spending later, such as through registration fees, though the commission’s ability to raise such revenue remains uncertain, as the Nebraska Attorney General’s Office has pledged to sue the new commission if it issues any state licenses for medical cannabis.
Pillen and Attorney General Mike Hilgers have questioned the legality of medical cannabis, though Pillen formally certified the vote in December and the laws have been in place since.
The governor’s Friday announcement referenced “operational funding” that had already been appropriated for the regulatory work, but when the next two-year state budget passed Thursday, it included limited new funding.
The Appropriations Committee offered an annual $30,000 each of the next two fiscal years for employees in the Liquor Control Commission, who take on additional duties under the new medical cannabis-related laws. In comparison, the Liquor Control Commission has a $2 million annual budget, including for enforcement of regulations.
The Medical Cannabis Commission has no additional funding for the remaining two months of the current fiscal year. 
The voter-approved laws required regulations by July 1 and licensing by Oct. 1.
The Department of Administrative Services, which Pillen oversees, can provide limited financial support to agencies crafting regulations. Pillen spokesperson Laura Strimple, citing Lee Will, the DAS director who previously oversaw the state’s budget, said the Liquor Control Commission has a cash fund spending authority of $100,000 that is “rarely used.”
The new spending would come through a new administratively created cash fund to capture any new revenue.
“This funding authority will allow for [the Cannabis Commission] to operate, combined with registration fees for revenue,” she said in an email.
The one cash fund that the Liquor Control Commission currently has is derived from the commission selling copies of its rules, the law governing its actions and other publications. It also gets funds from fees for registration, server training and more, according to a Legislative Fiscal Office directory of state funds and programs. Just a portion of the fund has been used in recent years.
State law allows the funds to be used for “any administrative costs” associated with specific liquor statutes. Medical cannabis statutes were placed in a different section of the law, and the budget bills did not expressly authorize additional spending from that fund.

City officials have sued. (Morgan Chilson/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — The city of Leavenworth and CoreCivic will take their fight to court June 25 to determine whether the company can reopen its prison facility as an ICE detention center without going through a permitting process.
Attorneys for Leavenworth filed suit in March in U.S. District Court against the Nashville-based company, which ran the Leavenworth Detention Center before it was closed in 2021. The June 25 hearing is a scheduling hearing.
CoreCivic announced its intent to reopen its prison facility as an Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention center, which would be named the Midwest Regional Reception Center.
In its initial filing, city attorneys said CoreCivic must apply for and receive a supplemental use permit to reopen and operate the prison.
“Our facility – which has been in Leavenworth since 1992 – is and always has been properly zoned,” said CoreCivic spokesman Ryan Gustin in an email. “Leavenworth’s city code designates our site as an existing special use and lawful conforming use.”
 Proper permits?

The city recently passed a resolution that indicated CoreCivic needed permission to open its facility, Gustin said.
“There’s nothing in Leavenworth’s code that allows for such a resolution to rescind zoning,” he said.
City officials do not agree. In a 211-page filing with attachments, their attorneys said that, while the lawsuit is about the need for proper permitting, there were other problems too.
From 1992 to 2021, when CoreCivic operated the detention center, the company “became embroiled in multiple widely publicized scandals resulting from its gross mismanagement of the Facility and the ensuing rampant abuse, violence, and violations of the constitutional rights of its detainees and staff,” the filing said.
“CoreCivic’s mismanagement directly and indirectly impacted the City in countless ways, including for example, by imposing unexpected maintenance costs on its taxpayers, unreasonably increasing the burden on the City’s police and law enforcement agencies to address violent crime, and even impeding the City’s investigation of sexual assaults and other violent crimes against detainees and staff,” the filing said.
The city’s lawsuit contends that CoreCivic was already operating the prison when the city enacted its development rules that require a permit, so the business was grandfathered in under the new rules. But by ceasing operations for three years, the filing said, CoreCivic must now apply for the special use permit.
In fact, CoreCivic applied for a special use permit in February 2025 but about three weeks later withdrew that application, the city’s filing said.
 Back and forth

Community activists are speaking about against the idea of CoreCivic operating a prison in Leavenworth.
Former CoreCivic employees regularly speak at city and county meetings about their negative experiences working in the closed detention center, and state organizations including the Kansas ACLU have helped organize press conferences and rallies. Objections include how CoreCivic operates, whether people held at the facility will be released into the community, and general opposition to immigrant detention centers.
Gustin said the company, as of April 30, had received applications from more than 1,100 people who want to work at the site.
“Despite what politically extreme outsider groups are saying, potential new employees and local business partners are excited to be part of what we’re creating in Leavenworth,” said Misty Mackey, warden of the new facility, in a press release. “We’re looking forward to operating a safe, transparent, accountable facility that will be a positive for this community dedicated to public service.”
Gustin said there has been inaccurate reporting about employees working on a job at the prison to replace the facility’s roof. CoreCivic issued cease-and-desist letters to those who accused the roofing company, Bass Roofing and Restoration, Fort Worth, of hiring workers without the proper permits.
“Any claims that our company has a contractor working for us at our Leavenworth facility that has undocumented or unauthorized workers doing the work are completely false,” he said. “We have been furnished documentation of the legal status of all workers on the roofing project at our facility from the primary contractor and subcontractor.”
The company has said that it will use local contractors at the facility, and Gustin said CoreCivic did reach out to local vendors.
“Experience in roofing our facilities and experience working on our federally contracted facilities is a factor we evaluate in reviewing bids,” he said. “It’s important to note that the roofing contractor who was selected for this project has handled similar work at another of our federal facilities, which required special clearances for workers.”
 Collaborative goals

Although aware of community disagreement about the facility, Gustin said CoreCivic wants to work with Leavenworth city and county officials.
“In addition to the impact fees we’ve agreed to pay – and the property tax we already pay – we’ve worked to both listen to and be transparent with the community,” he said.
CoreCivic has offered the following impact fees:

One-time impact fee of $1,000,000 to the city of Leavenworth
Annual impact fee of $250,000 to the city of Leavenworth
Additional $150,000 annually to the police department

Gustin said no one detained at the facility will be released directly into the Leavenworth community, which is one opposition point.
“Our facility will operate with strong oversight and accountability from our government partners, including regular audits and onsite monitors,” he said.

With 370,000 acres of active farmland, our agricultural sector contributes more than $4 billion annually to the state economy and supports 30,000 jobs. Yet despite this economic and social importance, Connecticut’s agrarian future is precarious. Between 2017 and 2022, we lost 463 farms. Rising production costs, climate pressures, and an aging farmer population threaten the future of farming in our state.
To support our farmers and secure a more resilient food system, we must start by rethinking how we value food, not as a commodity, but as a connector. Connecticut, one of the most urbanized states in the country, may not be the first place that comes to mind when you think of farmland. Yet it is precisely because of our size and geographic diversity that we are uniquely positioned to lead in local food innovation, if we invest in the right programs.

Zane Tickoo
Farm-to-school initiatives like CT Grown for CT Kids and the Connecticut Local Food for Schools Incentive Program are shining examples of what this kind of investment looks like. These programs connect local farmers with schools, ensuring that students receive fresh, nutritious meals while providing farmers with a stable, reliable market. It’s a win-win, children are better nourished, and farms are better supported.
That’s why recent developments are so alarming. In 2025, both programs faced devastating federal and state funding cuts. The USDA unexpectedly ended the Local Food for Schools Cooperative Agreement Program, stripping $5.6 million from Connecticut’s farm-to-school pipeline. At the state level, Governor Lamont’s proposed budget would cut $1 million from the Department of Agriculture, effectively eliminating CT Grown for CT Kids. Without meaningful intervention, these setbacks threaten to undo years of progress toward building a healthier and more resilient local food system.
Fortunately, the legislature has a chance to reverse course. House Bill 7013, now under consideration, offers a path forward. It proposes measures to strengthen program coordination, outreach, and technical assistance with schools and ensure smoother implementation. The bill also expands program eligibility to include childcare providers, broadening the reach of local food access beyond K–12 settings.
Just as importantly, HB 7013 and the proposed Appropriations budget seeks sustained funding for both programs, providing the financial stability needed for them to thrive. Organizations like the Connecticut Northeast Organic Farming Association (CT NOFA) have voiced strong support, recognizing the bill’s potential to bolster local agriculture, improve student nutrition, and increase public awareness around food systems.
This isn’t just smart policy,  it’s a moral imperative. Supporting farm-to-school programs isn’t just about feeding kids; it’s about shaping the next generation of Connecticut’s farmers, food entrepreneurs, and engaged citizens. When students learn where their food comes from, they gain a deeper appreciation for the land, labor, and community behind every meal.
Moreover, these programs can help address one of the most pressing challenges in agriculture today: a lack of young people entering the field. Farming is often viewed as inaccessible, outdated, or financially unviable. But by embedding food literacy into school curricula, expanding school gardens, and exposing students to sustainable farming practices, we can help change the narrative and inspire a new generation to see farming as both a calling and a career.
If we want a future in which Connecticut’s farms flourish and our children grow up nourished in every sense of the word, we must start by protecting and expanding these programs. That means not only preserving existing farmland but also investing in the infrastructure, both physical and educational, that connects people to it.
The future of Connecticut’s food system depends on bold, community-centered action. HB 7013 and funding for farm-to-school represents a critical next step to affirm a vision for Connecticut in which every child has access to healthy food, every farmer has access to a strong market, and every community has a stake in the resilience of our local food system.

(Photo by Kayla Bartkowski/Getty Images)Private equity companies have gobbled up group homes and other services for people with disabilities, attracting the attention of state and federal regulators across the nation and alarming advocates.
People with intellectual or developmental disabilities have suffered abuse, neglect and even death while under the care of private equity-owned providers, according to a recent report from watchdog group Private Equity Stakeholder Project.
“Private equity firms are, more than many other types of investors, laser-focused on maximizing their cash flow, often trying to double or triple their investment over a relatively short period of time, usually just a handful of years,” said Eileen O’Grady, the report’s author. “The way that private equity firms will often do that is to cut costs.”
For companies that provide essential services for people with disabilities, she said, “those cuts can have really harmful impacts on people’s lives.”
In late 2023, Florida moved to revoke the license of NeuroRestorative, one branch of the private equity-owned health services company Sevita, which provides services for people with disabilities. State regulators cited repeat violations by NeuroRestorative and a failure to “protect the rights of its clients to be free from physical abuse.” Ultimately the state opted not to revoke the license and fined the company $13,000 in a settlement.
But in recent years regulators have documented instances of patient harm at Sevita’s affiliates in multiple other states, including Colorado, Indiana, Iowa, Massachusetts and Utah. In 2019, a U.S. Senate committee conducted a probe into the company’s operations in Iowa and Oregon following multiple reports of patient abuse and neglect.
“Any entity that receives taxpayer dollars, but especially those charged with caring for our fellow Americans who may have an intellectual disability, ought to be doing everything under the sun to ensure quality care and continually improve,” U.S. Sen. Chuck Grassley, an Iowa Republican, said in a statement in 2020 following his investigation.
In a statement to Stateline, Sevita did not address the sanctions directly, but avowed its commitment to providing services and supports to give people greater independence, regardless of their intellectual or physical challenges.
“Since 2019, when new ownership acquired the company, there has been significant capital investment to improve and expand our services, enhance facilities, implement robust training and new technologies, and strengthen our workforce — all with the goal of better serving our individuals and communities,” the statement said.
The disability care industry has proven increasingly attractive to private equity.
In recent years, a handful of large private equity-owned companies such as Sevita have snapped up hundreds of smaller providers of disability services — often community nonprofits, mom-and-pop businesses and religious organizations — and rolled them into larger corporations.
From 2013 to 2023, private equity firms acquired more than 1,000 disability and elder care providers, according to the report by the Private Equity Stakeholder Project. That’s likely an undercount because they’re generally not required to disclose acquisitions, the report said.
Cash cow
Private equity firms use pooled investments from pension funds, sovereign wealth funds, endowments and wealthy individuals to buy a controlling stake in a company. They seek to maximize its value — often by cutting costs — and then sell it at a profit.
Most of Sevita’s revenue comes from providing disability services. It operates companies in 40 states under various brands, including Mentor Network, NeuroRestorative and REM.
Sevita is currently owned by private equity firms Centerbridge Partners and Vistria Group, which also own Help at Home, a home health company with more than 200 locations across about a dozen states.
Nearly all of Sevita’s revenue comes from Medicaid, according to a February 2025 report from S&P Global.
Through Medicaid and Medicare, the government pays for most services for people with intellectual or developmental disabilities. The two programs cover services such as group homes, adult day programs, in-home care, and physical and occupational therapy.
“Sevita has been owned by private equity firms for over a decade now, and has been under investigation and scrutiny at the federal and state level for basically that entire time,” O’Grady said.
In 2022, Iowa fined a NeuroRestorative group home $10,500 after a resident was left unattended in a liquor store and drank three-quarters of a bottle of vodka. The same year, Massachusetts temporarily removed Sevita’s license to operate group homes after regulators reported inadequate staff training and supervision, and a “myriad of issues that were uncovered onsite,” according to a Massachusetts Department of Developmental Services report.
The federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services has fined a NeuroRestorative facility in Utah four times since 2022. A February 2024 inspection report by the agency found the facility “failed to prevent abuse, neglect … and exploitation” of residents.
Last year, Florida fined another Sevita brand, Florida Mentor, for improper use of restraints. More issues have been documented in Sevita-owned locations in Arkansas, California, Colorado, Illinois, Indiana, New Hampshire and Nevada.
Meanwhile, Sevita’s owners, Centerbridge and Vistria, have collected nearly half a billion dollars since 2019 by loading Sevita and Help at Home with debt in order to pay dividends to investors, according to Moody’s, a financial services company.
Similar financial maneuvering contributed to the recent collapse of Steward Health Care, a private equity-owned hospital system that once had more than 30 hospitals nationwide. Steward has become a cautionary tale about the harm that profit-driven private equity firms can do to a state’s health system.
“Before Steward Health Care ultimately collapsed, executives spent years hiding their financial information from state regulators, putting patients and our health care system at risk,” Massachusetts Democratic House Speaker Ron Mariano said in a statement earlier this year announcing a new state law that beefs up reporting and financial requirements for private investors.
“That’s why ensuring that our institutions are equipped to monitor the health care landscape, and to guard against trends and transactions that drive up costs without improving patient outcomes, is so important.”
David vs. Goliath
After two residents of a New Jersey group home died from choking on food in 2017, attorney Cory Bernstein became interested in private equity’s involvement in disability services. The residents had been living in homes operated by AdvoServ, a company then owned by the private equity firm Wellspring Capital Management. The state had cited AdvoServ more times than any other operator in New Jersey for abuse, neglect and unsafe conditions.
AdvoServ later ceased operations in 2019 after multiple state agencies, including in New Jersey, Florida and Maryland, launched investigations.










States just don’t really have the resources or tools to do what needs to be done.


– Cory Bernstein, staff attorney at the National Disability Rights Network


But even when state regulators are doing all they can to protect people with disabilities from substandard care, they’re limited in how much they can hold a company accountable, Bernstein told Stateline.
“It’s state-level oversight on a national entity with not much [help] coming from the federal side,” said Bernstein, who is now a staff attorney at the National Disability Rights Network, a membership organization of federally mandated state disability advocacy programs.
“States just don’t really have the resources or tools to do what needs to be done.”
A regulatory agency in Georgia might shut down all the group homes owned by a certain company, for example, but those regulators can’t do anything about the company’s abuses in, say, Montana. With branches in multiple states, a company is better able to withstand sanctions or even a loss of license in one state, he said.
“[States] are not set up to go up against a national operator with billions of dollars in resources in a regulatory or oversight battle,” Bernstein said.
Further complicating things for state regulators and for consumers is that a large services company such as Sevita might operate under multiple brand names, even in one state. It can be hard to parse out who owns a sanctioned business. Multiple brand names can also obscure a company’s monopoly on a particular regional market.
When Florida regulators reached a settlement agreement with Sevita’s NeuroRestorative last year, the state dismissed its proposed license revocation. O’Grady believes one reason the state chose to settle is the difficulty of finding alternative facilities to relocate the residents who would have been displaced from the 13 locations the company operated around the state.
“Because of that dearth of alternatives and the impotence of the state to act more fully, this company will continue to be allowed to operate,” she said.
Further complicating oversight: Large companies often operate various services that are overseen by different agencies. Group homes might be regulated under the state’s Medicaid program, while facilities that provide more intensive care might come under federal Medicare oversight.
There could be “two completely different oversight systems for facilities serving the same population in the same state with the same name,” Bernstein said.
State solutions
Some states have moved to address problems with private equity involvement in health care by passing tighter restrictions on mergers and acquisitions of health care companies.
In Rhode Island, where private equity companies’ mismanagement of health care providers threatened the future of local hospitals, a robust oversight law allowed the state attorney general to impose conditions to protect the hospitals’ finances.
More states are following suit. In 2023 alone, 24 states enacted laws related to health system consolidation and competition, while this year at least half a dozen have considered legislation to check private equity-fueled health care mergers.

Laura Kelly assesses work of 2025 Kansas Legislature and weighty education, tax, budget and judicial reform issues on state's horizon.","Gov. Laura Kelly, with about 20 months remaining in her second term, takes stock on the Kansas Reflector podcast work of 2025 Legislature and significant education, tax, budget and judicial issues on horizon. (Anna Kaminski/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Gov. Laura Kelly wants the Republican-dominated legislative committee drafting a new state funding formula for K-12 public school districts to work on behalf of all Kansans by resisting pressure to funnel tax dollars into private schools.
Kelly, a Democrat nearing the home stretch of her second term as governor, said the existing formula was the product of years of work by the legislative and executive branches of state government and met the judicial branch’s view of Article 6 of the Kansas Constitution by making suitable provision for financing the state’s educational interest in children.
The current formula has led to full funding of public school districts, Kelly said. It could be improved before expiring in 2027, the governor said, but major overhaul could invite years of new litigation.
“Obviously, what I would really like is for them to tweak around the edges of what we’ve already got,” Kelly said on the Kansas Reflector podcast. “This is a formula that has really been decades in the making. It works for Kansas. Are there things that could be better, could be done differently? I’m sure that there are.”


“I would hope that, you know, deep down, what they’re really trying to do is to make our public school system the best in the country,” Kelly said. “Not looking for ways to undermine it and divert funds from that to private schools.”
During the interview, Kelly discussed issues shaping the final 20 months of her service as governor, including budget and policy decisions of President Donald Trump, the 2026 vote on a state constitutional amendment to elect members of the Kansas Supreme Court and formation of the state’s early childhood education office.
She looked back at pivot points in the 2024 session of the Legislature, most notably decisions to emphasize state income tax reductions rather than property tax reform.
 
Trump’s influence
Kelly, who chairs the Democratic Governors Association, expressed disagreement with Trump’s willingness to upend federal funding to states in ways that generated chaos and harmed people. Thousands of federal workers have been sacked along with hundreds of millions of dollars in funding slashed, she said.
In Kansas, sudden withdrawal of a federal grant led Kelly to authorize layoffs of 56 employees at the Kansas Department of Health and Environment.
She said sweeping reductions in federal funding of Medicaid, the health program relied on by people with disabilities, low-income children, elderly adults and pregnant women, would be devastating in Kansas.
“We were taking a very public stance and working very hard with our congressional delegations and others to ensure that Congress does not make those kinds of drastic cuts to a program that is extraordinarily important, not only to some citizens of the state of Kansas, but to the state itself. It would create economic havoc if they were to withdraw Medicaid funding,” Kelly said.
Kelly said she would work against the proposed amendment to the Kansas Constitution to allow direct public election of state Supreme Court justices and do away with the merit-based process vesting governors with responsibility to fill vacancies on the state’s highest court.
More than $100 million was spent on this spring’s Wisconsin Supreme Court election. It set a national record for expenditures on a state judicial race.
“I don’t think Kansans want to go that way, and I think they will speak loudly in August of 2026 just as they did in August of 2022 when the Legislature tried to essentially eliminate reproductive rights in the state of Kansas,” Kelly said.
By two-thirds majorities — 27-13 in the Senate and 84-40 in the House — the Kansas Legislature disagreed with Kelly by voting to place the Supreme Court amendment on ballots next year.
The governor said she was pleased the Legislature created the state Office of Early Childhood, which would consolidate programs spread across several agencies.
“We will save money and other resources by putting it all under this one umbrella, and we’ll be able to provide much better services,” she said.
Kelly also lauded formation of a state task force to create a “comprehensive, thoughtful, long-range plan with dedicated funding so that we address our water issues” much like the state dealt for decades with transportation planning.
 
Tax and budget policy
Kelly said the Legislature would regret following the $1.3 billion state income tax cut approved in 2024 with legislation in 2025 dedicating future state revenue surpluses to more individual and corporate income tax reductions. The House and Senate overrode Kelly’s veto of the bill obligating the state to lower income tax rates to 4%.
“When tax revenues come in higher than expected, your taxes go down automatically — a sensible way to return tax dollars to Kansans that only Governor Kelly could oppose,” said Senate President Ty Masterson and House Speaker Dan Hawkins, both Republicans.
Kelly said additional income tax cuts would kick in automatically regardless of economic factors or policy and budgetary realities. She said it was the kind of thinking that led Kansas Gov. Sam Brownback in 2012 and 2013 to aggressively slash income taxes. It starved state government and prompted a sales tax hike, increased borrowing and derailed highway and education funding before abandoned in 2017.
“What we’ve been left with is essentially a flat tax,” Kelly said of the 2025 income tax law. “That’s the kiss of death for the Kansas budget and the public services that we’ve been providing. It won’t be as fast or as dramatic as the impact of the Brownback tax experiment, but ultimately have the same effect.”
Kelly said she warned Republican leadership the law would tie the Legislature’s hands when trying to respond to unanticipated challenges.
“It’ll come back to bite them. Hopefully, you know, they will see that and come back soon and perhaps reverse their course,” she said.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/250518_kelly-02-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-05-19 12:22:33.389506

A PNM news release says the deal, if approved by the New Mexico Public Regulation Commission, along with Texas and federal regulators, would leave the company headquartered in New Mexico.
“This agreement will provide the financial resources necessary to thrive in this rapidly changing energy environment,” PNM President and CEO Don Tarry said in a statement “Our focus has been and will continue to be on serving our customers with safe, reliable energy. This investment will help us meet the considerable growth in demand while supporting the transition to a clean energy future and unlocking New Mexico’s potential for economic growth.”
Under the proposed agreement, Blackstone Infrastructure will acquire TXNM Energy for $61.25 per share upon closing for a “total enterprise value of $11.5 billion — including net debt — and TXNM Energy’s stock would no longer be publicly traded. A news release says the company expects the process to be completed in the second half of 2026.
Blackstone, which has $60 billion of assets under management, focuses on North American infrastructure platforms. The Wall Street Journal reports in the interim, Blackstone Infrastructure plans to invest $400 million in TXNM through the purchase of 8 million newly issued shares at $50 apiece to support TXNM’s plans for growth.
“PNM has done an excellent job of transitioning its generation portfolio to clean energy and supporting the communities it serves,”  Sean Klimczak, Blackstone’s global head of infrastructure, said in a statement. “We will utilize our long-term investment approach to support PNM’s economic development efforts during New Mexico’s sustainable generation transition.

Tate IV (Photo: Nick Romanenko/Rutgers University)LSU President William Tate has been named the next leader of Rutgers University in New Jersey, becoming the most notable in a string of abrupt, high-profile departures from Louisiana’s flagship public university. 
The Rutgers Board of Trustees unanimously confirmed Tate’s appointment Monday. He will begin his new job at the university July 1. His last day at LSU will be June 30. 
LSU spokesman Todd Woodward said an interim president will be announced Monday. 
Tate is the fourth administrator to leave LSU’s main campus this year. He follows the abrupt departures of General Counsel Winston DeCuir and Chief Administrative Officer Kimberly Lewis, who were two of the highest-ranking Black administrators at LSU. Provost Roy Haggerty also made his exit recently.
In addition, LSU Health Shreveport Chancellor David Guzick resigned under pressure and has taken a new role in the LSU System.  
Tate’s departure had been rumored for weeks amid discussions of splitting the roles of LSU System president and Baton Rouge campus chancellor, which were combined in 2012. 
LSU saw major growth in enrollment and research spending during Tate’s time at LSU. As Tate sought to boost research expenditures for his long-shot bid to join the prestigious American Association of Universities, spending on research grew from less than $300 million in the 2020-21 academic year to more than $500 million in 2023-24, the most recent year with data available. 
Though Tate’s hiring as LSU’s first Black president — the first at any Southeastern Conference University — was met with much fanfare, his tenure has been highly criticized for his stances on race and gender.   
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
In his first year on the job, Tate disbanded a committee looking into the possibility of renaming 13 buildings on campus named after racially problematic figures, They included the John M. Parker Coliseum, named after the former governor who participated in the largest mass lynching in American history. 
Tate promised reform after taking the helm of a university reeling from a Title IX scandal that ensued after a USA Today investigative report that revealed how the university mishandled sexual misconduct complaints against student-athletes.
He subsequently combined LSU’s Title IX, Civil Rights and diversity, equity and inclusion offices, dismissing a number of highly respected administrators and installing Todd Manuel, a former utility executive with no higher education experience, as the vice president of the office. 
Tate oversaw the dismantling of the DEI function of Manuel’s office in January 2024 ahead of conservative Gov. Jeff Landry taking office. Manuel has faced accusations that he and his deputies engaged in the very acts the office is designed to prevent. 
Off the clock, Tate also made problematic comments. Most notably, he shared a video from an anti-transgender group on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter, that amplified misinformation about an Olympic boxer Imane Khelif, who is not transgender. 
“This is illegal in Louisiana,” Tate wrote. “We have established guidelines in our laws. Why don’t the Olympics go to two divisions — Open and Women? It allows everyone to compete. Will it take a death to stop this at the Olympic level?” 
Though Tate later apologized for the error, his original comment is still on his X page. 
Tate’s struggles on race and gender puzzled many who lauded LSU for hiring a Black man with significant scholarship on critical race theory to lead a university with a long and, at times, ugly racial history, starting long before the current campus was built atop a cemetery for enslaved people. 
At the time of his hiring, Tate enjoyed the support of Democratic Gov. John Bel Edwards. Tate came out of the gate hot with talk of reform and used his early capital to hire other Black administrators, including Lewis, who had been serving as Edwards’ revenue department secretary, for a newly created position. 
But with a governor in office who had put LSU in his crosshairs, Tate seemed stuck between a rock and a hard place. Major donors to Landry now make up a majority of the LSU Board of Supervisors to whom the LSU president reports. 
Landry has more control over the state’s four higher education systems than his predecessors after he signed legislation giving him the power to select board chairs, which he used to place Scott Ballard in charge of the LSU board. 
Landry’s LSU board has been more vocal and more political than Edwards’, with members at times even calling for popular officials to be dismissed in open meetings. 
When Landry put tenured LSU Law Professor Ken Levy on blast on social media for profane and critical comments Levy made about the governor to students, Tate pulled Levy from the classroom and put him on paid administrative leave. The matter sparked a lawsuit against the university that is ongoing in court. 
Before coming to LSU, Tate served as provost of the University of South Carolina for less than a year and as department chair and graduate school dean Washington University in St. Louis from 2002-20.

Citizen Foster Care Review Boards review cases of children in the custody of the Department for Community Based Services in the Kentucky Cabinet for Health and Family Service, according to the program’s website. The children were placed in foster care due to dependency, neglect and abuse, but their cases are not final. They may include children whose adoptions have not been finalized or have returned home and young adults with extended out-of-home commitments due to educational purposes. 
A press release from the Administrative Office of the Courts said the counties in dire need of volunteers are Boone, Boyd, Bracken, Campbell, Carter, Clay, Elliott, Fleming, Greenup, Hardin, Johnson, Kenton, Laurel, Lawrence, Lewis, Magoffin, Martin, Mason, McCreary, Montgomery, Morgan, Powell, Robertson, Rowan, Whitley and Wolfe. However, volunteers also are needed statewide. 
“It takes a lot of wonderful people to do this meaningful work, and we are greatly in need of more volunteers to join us,” said Rosalyn Patton-Pelt, state chair of the foster care review board, in a statement. 
Volunteers typically review cases one day a month. However, before they can begin, they must apply for consideration, consent to a criminal record and central registry check and complete six hours of initial training. A family court or district court judge recommends volunteers to the local review board. Detailed information, including how to submit an online volunteer application, can be found on the Kentucky Courts of Justice website. 
The Administrative Office of the Courts said thousands of Kentucky children are placed in foster and other out-of-home care each year. The Citizen Foster Care Review Boards conduct interactive reviews on the children’s cases and make recommendations to the cabinet.

Senate Bill 46, sponsored by Sen. “Big Mike” Fesi, R-Houma, and House Bill 608, by Rep. Kim Coates, R-Ponchatoula, would ban the intentional release of chemicals into the atmosphere to alter the weather or climate. Coates’ measure includes a $200,000 fine for any violation.  
Weather modification is a wide-reaching term and often marbled with deep veins of misinformation. Human efforts and theories that attempt to alter precipitation or temperature are real but largely new areas of scientific study. The concept of weather modification has produced solid science along with skepticism and conspiracy theories in the decades since studies began.
The Louisiana bills specifically reference cloud seeding, or attempts to encourage rainfall with aerosols sprayed into the air. They also cover solar radiation modification, which tries to deflect sunlight away from Earth to curb increasing temperatures and associated climate change. 
Cloud seeding experiments are exceedingly rare along the Gulf Coast, and solar radiation modification exists only as a theoretical concept. Robert Rauber, an atmospheric scientist and professor emeritus at the University of Illinois, said cloud seeding simply doesn’t have widespread use in Louisiana, where rain is relatively abundant. 
“The Gulf Coast doesn’t need rain,” Rauber said, unlike the mountainous or desert states where cloud seeding is a more attractive option. “The reason why they cloud seed out west is to increase water supplies.” 
Rauber has participated in a variety of cloud seeding experiments in mountainous regions of the western United States and said the types of clouds along the Gulf Coast aren’t really conducive for seeding.
“It’s never been proven to work” at scale with the puffy, cumulus clouds more common in the South, said Rauber. “These clouds form wherever the heck they want … you can’t target an area very effectively.”
Cloud seeding can’t alter the paths or intensity of hurricanes either, said Rauber. He cited failed experiments in the 1940s when scientists seeded hurricanes with dry ice to see if they could weaken their intensity. Although researchers learned valuable information on how hurricanes formed and traveled, they were not able to change their path or intensity. 
One business has conducted cloud seeding experiments along the Gulf Coast, according to Rauber, who stressed that the science is shaky. 
Rainmaker Technology Corp., a geoengineering company based in El Segundo, California, has conducted experiments along the Gulf Coast as recently as March, according to National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration records. The company claims to use charged water particles to promote rain instead of aerosols. 
“It’s magic as far as I’m concerned because I have not seen any scientific research done in a proper way that shows that any of that is effective,” Rauber said. Misinformation and unproven methods that Rainmaker Technology and other companies promote adds to public fear and conspiracy theories surrounding weather modification, the professor said. 
Rainmaker Technology did not respond to calls for comment. 
Cloud seeding with silver iodide has been practiced for more than 70 years, and the scientific consensus is that the amount used is relatively effective, with the right clouds, and environmentally safe. Sprayed into clouds as an aerosol, silver iodide freezes and gives moisture-heavy clouds something to grab onto, coaxing its water molecules to condense and fall from the sky as rain. 
James Diaz, a medical toxicologist and professor emeritus at the LSU Health Sciences Center School of Public Health in New Orleans, said silver can prompt reactions when ingested in large doses and lab experiments suggest the heavy metal could be harmful to aquatic life in large amounts over time, but he said the amounts used for cloud seeding do not alarm him.
“These toxicities are unlikely after cloud seeding,” Diaz said.
It’s a similar story with iodide. Large amounts over long periods of time can do environmental and health harm, but Diaz said the amounts needed for cloud seeding aren’t worrying. 
“We should be more concerned about petrochemicals and pesticides,” he said. 
Fesi’s bill doesn’t apply to firefighting aerosols or pesticides used for agriculture. Coates said in an interview she intends to amend her bill so that it would not apply to pollutants emitted from the burning of fossil fuels. 
Fesi mentioned in his floor speech that sulfur dioxide is among the chemicals he believes are being sprayed into the atmosphere. There is no evidence that cloud seeding uses sulfur dioxide. The burning of fossil fuels, namely coal and oil at power plants and industrial facilities, is one of the largest sources of sulfur dioxide, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. 
Coates and Fesi clarified in interviews their bills will not regulate industrial emissions. 
Coates said she considers her bill to be part of the wider push in Republican-led states to ban weather modification, adding she believes the issue to have bipartisan appeal. Florida recently approved legislation similar to what’s under consideration in Louisiana, and Tennessee approved a ban on weather modification in 2024. 
“I just decided that I wanted to bring the bill because I don’t feel like anyone in Louisiana gave someone the right to do research in the air above us,” Coates said. “That’s our air above us, and we haven’t given anybody permission, anybody the right to spray or do any modification above us.”
When asked about the lack of widespread weather modification experiments in Louisiana, Coates said her bill is more precautionary. 
“Why mess with Mother Nature?” she added.
Coates’ bill advanced from the House Committee on Natural Resources and Environment with unanimous support and awaits debate in the full House.
Fesi testified on the Senate floor April 28 during debate over his bill that he believes “certain agencies within the federal government are doing cloud seeding and geoengineering.” In an interview Friday, the senator was asked what evidence he had to support his claims. 
“Look up in our sky,” Fesi answered.
In an interview, Fesi later said he sees “just tons and tons of cloud seeding” above his backyard and described it as “all of the stripes across the skies.”
Neither bill specifically discusses banning contrails, short for condensation trails. The thin, white cloud streaks that stretch behind airplanes are created as warm exhaust from jet engines meet the icy cold atmosphere, similarly to how warm breath briefly creates a fog in cold air. Unsubstantiated contrail theories attempt to connect weather modification and contrails, alleging jets are spraying chemicals for reasons ranging from weather alterations to population control.
Sen. Regina Barrow, D-Baton Rouge, was the only lawmaker to question Fesi’s claims on the Senate floor. He responded that “32 different agencies collect money for geoengineering of our weather.” Pressed by Barrow for details, Fesi shared a widely debunked conspiracy theory that the federal government is spraying aerosols to block sunlight, and that the materials – namely aluminum oxide – have been found in agricultural fields from contrail chemical spraying. 
No evidence exists of a government program that conducts or collects money for cloud seeding or solar radiation modification experiments. 
With no one else challenging his statements, Fesi’s bill advanced from the Senate on a 27-12 party line vote, with Republicans prevailing. The measure awaits committee consideration in the House of Representatives.",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_8649-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-19 11:14:03.142028

Lawmakers are advancing two bills that could lead to wage increases for some of them.,"In summary
Many people in California prisons and jails work for less than $1 an hour. Lawmakers are advancing two bills that could lead to wage increases for some of them.


Despite voters’ rejection of a ballot measure last fall to amend the state constitution to abolish involuntary prison labor, Assemblymember Isaac Bryan of Los Angeles believes he can get two bills passed that would improve wages for individuals inside jail and prison.
“It’s an interesting moment,” said Bryan, vice chair of the Legislative Black caucus, as he spoke of the Los Angeles fires and the public recognition of hard-working incarcerated fire crews.
“I think that reopened this conversation in the consciousness for folks about what incarcerated labor can look like and how undignified not paying folks a human wage — you know, a basic wage that is dignified — what that says about all of us.”
His Assembly Bill 247 would impose $19 per hour pay for incarcerated firefighters whenever their work assignment places them in active fire incidents.
“Very few people realize they make $5 to $10 a day doing that work, and so legislation to increase those wages has received kind of resounding support,” said Bryan.
The other measure, AB 248, doesn’t necessarily have an immediate price tag, but it would remove a decades-old statewide wage cap of $2 per eight-hour shift for county jail inmate workers — many of whom have not been convicted of any crimes and are awaiting trial.
Both of Bryan’s measures build on the Black Caucus’ efforts over the past several years to tackle the state’s history of discrimination against African Americans and to implement recommendations from the California Reparations Task Force.
In the immediate post-Civil War era, California prisons exploited incarcerated laborers — mostly Black and Indigenous — under threat of punishment. The task force described current prisoner work assignments as “state-sanctioned involuntary servitude” and a direct legacy of slavery. 
So far, the proposals that would carry out those changes have failed, most notably when voters in November rejected Proposition 6, the ballot measure that would have revised the state constitution to prohibit involuntary labor.
This year, Bryan’s bills are moving forward despite some concerns from Republican lawmakers that they could increase spending and threaten existing work programs that they support.
“This bill ignores the fundamental purpose of inmate labor programs,” Republican Assemblymember Heather Hadwick of Grass Valley said last month when she voted against the bill that would lift the cap on wages in county jails. “They’re not traditional employment. They’re part of a rehabilitation process that provides structure, skill building and a sense of responsibility. My rural counties cannot foot this bill.”
Most California county jails do not pay incarcerated workers any wages whatsoever. But when they do, they must abide by the $2 limit.
“For those quick at math, that’s 25 cents an hour,” explained Bryan. “At that rate, combined with predatory commissary prices, it would take you a full business week to be able to afford a two-ounce tube of toothpaste and a bag of hot Cheetos.” 
Mopping floors, cleaning toilets, preparing and distributing three meals a day for all persons in lockup — sheriffs and jailers treat these essential jobs as privileges bestowed on individuals who choose to trade work for time outside their cells and other perks, such as guaranteed daily showers or extra food.
Depriving incarcerated laborers of any substantial wage also limits their ability to pay court-mandated victims’ restitution fees, Bryan said. Despite working full time — and often even overtime, seven days a week — many prisoners continue to carry the debt of restitution.
“It is a relic of slavery — for sure,” said Bryan.

The California Supreme Court determined last year that county jail inmate workers — even those whose incarceration does not ultimately result in criminal convictions — are not entitled to state minimum wage requirements. In Ruelas vs. Alameda County, the court interpreted state law to define county jail work compensation as adequate in terms of offering sentence work credit, rehabilitative value and job-skills training opportunities.
“Whether the result here, based on an interpretation of the current statutory scheme, is a desirable policy is a matter beyond our purview, but it is not beyond the Legislature’s,” wrote Justice Kelli M. Evans in the April 2024 ruling. “The Legislature can, if it sees fit, adjust its approach to the payment of wages or wage credits for those awaiting adjudication of their cases as well as for convicted persons.”
Bryan, in co-authorship with Democratic Sen. Josh Becker of Menlo Park, aims to accomplish this adjustment to the state legislation.
California sheriffs oppose jail wage bill
The California State Sheriffs’ Association opposes the bill and said in a letter to the Assembly Public Safety Committee that it “would create pressure on counties to increase the fiscal recompense provided to inmate workers, thereby potentially limiting the availability of opportunities for work while incarcerated.”
Bryan noted that his county jail wage bill carries zero fiscal liability and therefore does not need to pass an appropriations committee. 
“This bill could pass and it could change nothing today,” said Bryan. “But it does mean at some point in the future — if there’s a county where the people of that county and the board of the county decide that it’s undignified to have people working for a quarter an hour, no matter whether they are incarcerated or not — they won’t have a preemption problem with the state. That’s all we’re trying to do is remove the state thumb on the scale that shouldn’t be there.”
Assemblymember Josh Hoover of Folsom, a district known for its century-old prison, explained his support for the bill. 
“We already have a $2 wage in the code, which means we have already acknowledged that there should be a wage paid,” he said. “I think it makes sense for local governments to be able to determine what that wage is, based upon the needs of their community.”
Assemblymember Carl DeMaio of San Diego said he opposes offering counties the authority to pay incarcerated workers more.
“We can get into the whole debate about rehabilitation, but the reality is when people are in jail, when they’re in prison, there’s a substantial cost to taxpayers,” he said. “It’s not unreasonable to expect inmates to help chip in to do a little bit of the work — clean their cell, do the laundry, serve the food.”
Work and rehabilitation in prison
Yet the debate over rehabilitation did quickly find its way into the Assembly’s conversation.
Because Gov. Gavin Newsom bases much of his transformative California model philosophy — which emphasizes rehabilitation, education, and reentry over punishment — on reforms first developed inside Norway’s prison system, detractors often view it with skepticism.
“The governor likes the Norwegian model, so I’m a little suspicious about this so-called Norwegian model,” DeMaio said. “But apparently there are some really good elements to the Norwegian model which includes $8 for work. Oh, no, no — not per hour, per week — and it’s part of the rehabilitation process.”
Bryan addressed DeMaio’s points in his closing. “I’ve been to Norway. I’ve seen it up close,” he said. “Folks in Norway are allowed to vote in prison; they go home on the weekends; often and during the week, they work outside of the prison and then come back; they earn real wages in their community and store that money up.
“There’s much we can learn from the Norwegian model, and so I look forward to exploring that with my colleague from San Diego.”

With 51 aye votes — all Democratic, save for Hoover’s lone Republican vote, 12 nays — all Republican, and 17 members (10 Democrats) formally choosing to cast no vote, the jail wage measure passed through the Assembly and now awaits Senate approval.
The Anti-Recidivism Coalition supports both of Bryan’s bills and co-sponsored AB 247, in addition to their overall advocacy for renewed anti-slavery legislation Assembly Constitutional Amendment 6, which would end California prison policies that require incarcerated individuals to fulfill labor obligations. Voters rejected 2024’s similar Prop. 6, but the measure will most likely resurface on a 2026 ballot. 
“When we got rid of the slave movement, we really shifted into utilizing prison labor as an alternative, and using the fact that these folks have been stripped of their freedom as a means to take advantage of them,” said the coalition’s chief strategy consultant and lobbyist, Esteban Núñez.
“You can work all day every day inside, and at the end of the month have barely enough to buy yourself what little hygiene you can. And that’s just not right. Keeping people in poverty and not compensating people fairly — purposely to keep them in poverty — it’s de-humanizing, at best.”

(Photo by Corrie Boudreaux for Source NM)Colorado Gov. Jared Polis has “deep reservations” about a plan for the Department of Homeland Security to use National Guard members to help with federal immigration enforcement.
The plan, first reported by the New York Times on Thursday, would pull in 20,000 members to increase enforcement capacity amid the Trump administration’s mass deportation efforts. Governors would be asked for National Guard troops to help with the detention and deportation of immigrants without legal status, though it is not clear what specific role troops would serve, according to NPR. The plan is being reviewed by Department of Defense lawyers.
“Our national guard members play an important role in protecting our state at home and abroad and the Governor would have deep reservations about pulling guard members away from core functions at a time when resources are being cut in these critical areas, further straining resources needed for public safety by diverting resources to a federal responsibility,” Polis spokesperson Shelby Wieman wrote in an email. “Gov. Polis calls on Congress to do their part and pass comprehensive immigration reform that secures our border, provides adequate personnel for border and interior enforcement so that they don’t need to take away national guard units from the states, and creates a pathway to citizenship.”

The Colorado Army National Guard and Colorado Air National Guard comprises about 5,500 people who serve part-time under the governor’s direction. Often, they respond to disasters in the state.
A spokesperson for the Colorado National Guard said it has not received any communication about a plan to ask members to volunteer for immigration enforcement.
Trump administration officials such as Stephen Miller, the White House deputy chief of staff for policy, have suggested that that National Guard troops from Republican-led states could be deployed in states, like Colorado, governed by Democrats. Democratic lawmakers in the Colorado Legislature passed a sweeping immigrant rights bill during the legislative session this year. It included a provision that would ban military units from another state from entering Colorado without the governor’s permission.
“Any time we have someone else’s National Guard that wants to come into this state, agreements happen. The governor’s office has asked for support in this area,” Rep. Lorena Garcia, an Adams County Democrat and the bill’s sponsor, said during floor debate on May 2. “We have seen buses come forward without any warning from Texas. Who’s to say that (Texas) Gov. (Greg) Abbott wouldn’t just throw his National Guard straight into Colorado because they decided to do immigration enforcement here?”
A Polis spokesperson in November after Trump’s election told Newsline in a statement, “It would be a violation of state sovereignty for another state to send National Guard troops without a request from the state.”
Many of the approximately 40,000 migrants who arrived in Denver since 2022 came on buses sent from Texas at Abbott’s direction. In February, Abbott gave the Texas National Guard the authority to make immigration arrests.
Polis has not signed that immigration bill, Senate Bill 25-276, into law. Though it would bar other states from sending their National Guard troops into Colorado, it would do little if Trump federalized the National Guard to perform law enforcement activities under the Insurrection Act, which was last invoked in 1992 during the Los Angeles riots after the police beating of Rodney King.
Bill sponsor state Sen. Mike Weissman, an Aurora Democrat, told Newsline that the provision in question is comparable to laws in other states, including Texas.
“So it depends exactly what Trump, and potentially Trump-allied governors, proceed to do,” he wrote in an email. “The mere fact that Trump is trying to corral guards members for his anti-immigrant efforts is yet another sign of the rapid disintegration of norms and precedents in this country.”

Anglers planning to surf fish at Delaware State Parks over the summer will need a reservation on weekends and holidays starting Saturday, May 24, the Delaware Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control (DNREC) announced.
The reservation requirement, which applies to the state’s seven multi-use drive-on beaches, is part of DNREC’s effort to manage demand and preserve beach access during peak season.
Reservations for the May 24 kickoff can be made beginning Tuesday, May 20, at 11 a.m., and will continue each week for upcoming weekend dates.

The policy affects holders of annual and two-year surf fishing permits who wish to drive onto state park beaches between 8 a.m. and 4 p.m. on Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays through Labor Day.
Off-peak permit holders are excluded from the reservation system, as their permits only allow beach access during non-peak times.
Reservations, which cost a non-refundable $4 per vehicle, must be made online here or by phone.
Spots are available on a first-come, first-served basis until sold out.
Reservations open the Tuesday before each Saturday and the Wednesday before each Sunday.
For weekday holidays, such as Memorial Day (May 26), Juneteenth (June 19), Independence Day (July 4), and Labor Day (Sept. 1), the system opens the Thursday prior.
DNREC says the reservation system has been upgraded in response to angler feedback.
Now, vehicle information is automatically linked to reservations when a valid surf fishing permit number is entered. Users can also manage multiple reservations for different permits under a single account.
Permit holders are required to print and display their reservation confirmation in their vehicle for verification by Delaware Natural Resources Police. Those with valid reservations are guaranteed park access even if general day-use parking reaches capacity.

(Illustration by Alex Cochran for New Jersey Monitor)Five of the six candidates seeking the Democratic nomination for governor on June 10 met for their final debate of the campaign on Sunday. Here are my thoughts, in no particular order:
 Gloves on

Rep. Mikie Sherrill is the presumptive front-runner based on public polling, though her rivals didn’t go after her in any meaningful way.
Even Jersey City Mayor Steve Fulop, who was aggressive in his interactions with Sherrill during a debate last week and has taken many swipes at her on social media, avoided confrontation with her Sunday. Fulop was asked about that during a press conference following the debate.
“I didn’t think she was that relevant in the debate, to be honest with you, because she didn’t insert herself in a lot of the conversations, so I didn’t feel the need to say I disagree,” he said. “She didn’t really speak … much on the transportation front nor on the health care or education front in any substantive way.”
Sherrill’s team, who were watching this press conference from the audience, looked quizzical. It’s clear that Sherrill has been running more of a bio campaign than one based on specifics about what she’d do as governor, but she certainly offered specifics last night, saying she backs teacher certification programs for long-term substitutes, a planned light rail line connecting Glassboro and Camden, and an independent auditing of the state’s health benefits plan.
 Baraka v. Gottheimer

There were only a few moments of genuine sparring on the debate stage, most notably an angry exchange between Rep. Josh Gottheimer and Newark Mayor Ras Baraka when Gottheimer said as governor he would make sure New Jersey gets its share of federal dollars back. Baraka said this confused him.
“I’m trying to figure out why they have to wait to become governor to get more money back from the government, because that’s their job as Congress people,” Baraka said. “You should not wait to become the governor to do that for us today. That’s his job today.”
Gottheimer, saying he wanted to “fact check” Baraka, said he’s helped the 5th Congressional District, which he represents, win more federal dollars than his predecessors.
“In my district, because we’ve been working with our mayors, we’re up 357% since I’ve been in Congress,” Gottheimer said.
“We’re talking about the whole state here, we’re not talking about your district,” Baraka said.
There appears to be little love lost between these two. During last week’s debate, Gottheimer snapped at Baraka when Baraka kept giving Gottheimer condescending pats. And during one of Gottheimer’s answers Sunday on public worker health care costs, Baraka could be heard saying, “He has no idea what he’s talking about.”
 Newark airport

Two candidates, Fulop and Gottheimer, urged people to keep using Newark airport despite weeks of news about long delays and problems with air traffic control equipment. “People should keep flying out of Newark,” Gottheimer said. For what, Jersey pride? No, thanks.
 Fighting

Former state Sen. Steve Sweeney was in a fighting mood. About the problems at Newark airport, Sweeney pooh-poohed writing letters to federal officials seeking help, as our current governor has done. “Drag their asses into a hearing … Let’s start breaking their you-know-whats,” he said. Later, while accusing New York of bullying New Jersey with its congestion pricing toll, Sweeney said, “When you deal with a bully, you punch them right in the nose and they pay attention.”

 Electability

During Baraka’s closing argument, he noted that some of his rivals have engaged in a whisper campaign that, should he win the June 10 primary, he would be unelectable as a general election candidate.
“I’m going to tell you why they say I’m not electable. One, because I’m from Newark. Two, because I’m too progressive. And three, because I’m too black. Well, I like being from Newark. I like being from Newark. As a matter of fact, I think because you’re closest to the problems, you’re closest to the solutions. I also like being progressive. I like being progressive and standing on my progressive values. I think that’s what brings us together. And I can’t do nothing about being black. God made me beautiful and amazing on purpose,” he said.
 Change

Many of the candidates are running campaigns based on the idea that voters will want something different after eight years of Gov. Phil Murphy, a Democrat. Sweeney, who was in the Legislature for 20 years and led the state Senate for about a decade, said voters should instead pick an insider.
“I’m the candidate that understands the inside and out of Trenton. You know, you always hear, we need an outsider to change things. Well, you know what happens? They come there and after two years, they figure it out — now they’re running for reelection and unfortunately it’s too late,” he said.
 Wawa

Gottheimer, repeating something he’s said many times on the campaign trail, griped that property taxes are high because there are too many towns in New Jersey with their own bureaucracies.
“Instead of buying in bulk, as I said, we pay Wawa prices instead of Costco prices for health care, for salt on our roads, and then what happens is all this gets fed into our property taxes that are killing people,” he said.
I continue to be baffled by this talking point because I’ve always found items at Wawa to be pretty cheap. They also have free air for your tires and that line is always long.
Baraka quipped, “I don’t want my health care from Wawa or Costco.”
 Oops?

Fulop argued that voters should send a mayor to the governor’s mansion, saying, “You haven’t had one for 20 years.” That’s right, and that former mayor-turned-governor was … Jim McGreevey.
 One common enemy

There are five men running for the GOP primary, but you wouldn’t know it from Sunday’s debate, when only one of them — former Assemblyman Jack Ciattarelli — was the focus of Democrats’ attacks. Ciattarelli was the GOP nominee for governor in 2021, he has led in all of the public polling of this year’s race, and he has the endorsement of Donald Trump, so Democrats on Sunday treated him as the presumptive Republican nominee. Sherrill opened her remarks with an attack on Ciattarelli, not on any of the men vying with her for the Dem nomination in three weeks.
“We know what the stakes are. We know Jack Ciattarelli has promised to DOGE New Jersey. Trump has said he’s ‘100% MAGA.’  He said he’s going to not stand up to Trump on anything and go along with everything. And we also know that he said he’s going to cut funding for Planned Parenthood and put in place an abortion ban,” Sherrill said.
 Length

The debate was looooooong. After two hours and 30 minutes on the stage, the six candidates later did solo press conferences. I overheard Baraka ask one of his aides what time his press conference started. “9:50,” the aide said. Baraka responded, “9:50?!” before adding an expletive.

This week: health coverage losses due to congressional Republicans’ cuts; UnitedHealth in free fall; the young children dying to fentanyl; EPA funding to clean up polluted sites; and a bad year for rail.
Tens of thousands of Minnesotans on verge of losing health insurance
Roughly 150,000 Minnesotans would lose health insurance under congressional Republicans’ plan to cut funding for Medicaid and other social services, according to an estimate released last week by Democrats on the Senate Joint Economic Committee.
Roughly 110,000 of those losses would come from Medicaid cuts, with an additional 40,000 losing coverage due to cuts to Affordable Care Act funding. 
All told, roughly 13.7 million Americans would lose health insurance coverage under the spending proposals currently being debated in Washington. The numbers are derived from an analysis by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. Under those proposals, any cost savings from the reduced Medicaid and ACA spending would be more than offset by expanded tax cuts, primarily benefiting the rich. 
On net, the GOP tax bill is currently expected to add roughly $3 trillion to the federal deficit over the next decade.
UnitedHealth is having a very bad year
Minnesota-based UnitedHealth, one of the largest corporations in the U.S., has shed roughly half its value on the stock market in the past month.
In the past week alone, CEO Andrew Witty stepped down, and the Wall Street Journal reported the company is under criminal investigation by the U.S. Justice Department over potential Medicare fraud.
UnitedHealth is one of just 30 companies that make up the Dow Jones Industrial Average, so its ongoing slide is having a disproportionate impact on perceptions of the economy’s health. The overall Dow is up roughly 5% over the same period UnitedHealth has fallen by half.
The company received national attention and scrutiny after the murder last year of Brian Thompson, an executive in charge of its health insurance division. The company has also been the subject of an ongoing investigation by health and medicine news organization STAT over its use of unregulated algorithms to deny patients care and juice profits.
Fentanyl has killed 23 Minnesota kids under the age of 8
A KARE 11 investigation finds that since 2000, 23 Minnesota infants and children under the age of eight have been killed by accidental fentanyl ingestion. 
The investigation details the story of one fentanyl-addicted mother who left out foil containing residue that her one-year-old daughter ingested. That mother was convicted of second-degree manslaughter and sentenced to two years in prison, plus additional time on supervised release.
Nationwide, accidental pediatric fentanyl exposures are rising: The nation’s poison control centers report there were 120 exposures in 2020, and 539 by 2023. Not all exposures are lethal, but the drug’s high potency means that the ingestion of even a minuscule amount can pose a threat to a child’s life.
Pre-natal exposure, when an infant is exposed to illicit substances in utero due to the mother’s drug use, is also a problem, with more than 1,100 cases in Minnesota in 2023 (drug-specific breakdowns aren’t available in the data, which come from the federal government).
EPA awards more than $2 million to clean up polluted sites in Minnesota
The Environmental Protection Agency recently announced $2.2 million in funding to clean up contaminated sites in Minnesota. The sites include a former landfill in Duluth, as well locations in Minneapolis, St. Paul, Willmar and Cass Lake.
“The $267 million in Brownfield grants will transform contaminated properties into valuable spaces for businesses and housing, creating new opportunities that strengthen local economies and directly benefit American families,” said EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin.
The federal agency recently cancelled tens of millions in grants for environmental justice initiatives in Minnesota and other Midwestern states.
The Northern Lights Express is on the ropes
Minnesota lawmakers voted over the weekend to pull $77 million in funding from the proposed Northern Lights Express rail line to Duluth and direct it toward unemployment insurance costs for hourly school workers. 
The project, which lawmakers initially funded in 2023, had been dependent on federal funds to move forward. Those funds never came through, and the current budget crunch in St. Paul made the previously-earmarked funds irresistible to lawmakers looking to plug holes elsewhere.
House Republican Transportation Chair Jon Koznick spiked the football: “With the House and Senate voting to shift a significant amount of the state’s share of the project’s funding, the Northern Lights Express train is effectively dead, and taxpayers are better off because of it.”
Sen. Jen McEwen, DFL-Duluth, said on the Senate floor on Sunday she’s holding out hope that it will happen one day.
“Although we are making a substantial cancellation because of this austerity that is being imposed upon the people of Minnesota … the Northern Lights Express project is still alive,” McEwen said.

A major affordable housing redevelopment is underway in Newark as officials broke ground last week on the George Read Village project, a $26.6 million initiative that will bring 72 affordable housing units to the city, including 18 new homes.
“It is my hope that this is just the beginning of a new era of commitment to this great need. It shows what can be accomplished when dedicated visionaries work hard and long toward a common goal for the good of a community and its deserving people,” said Marene Jordan, executive director of the NHA.
The project, led by the NHA in partnership with developer Ingerman, will replace an aging residential structure along Main Street with a modern, mid-rise, mixed-use building and five new family cottages.
The new units will be available to households earning between 30% and 50% of the Area Median Income (AMI), aiming to meet the needs of low-income families in a city known for its student-dominated housing market.

Nikki Lane, chair of the NHA Board of Commissioners, noted the project’s importance in balancing the city’s housing landscape.
“This project will not only improve the need for affordable housing, it will enhance the diversity of the City of Newark, which is a unique college town with a strong emphasis on student housing,” she said. “Developing for individuals and families is refreshing,”
The redevelopment has received a wide range of funding support, including:

$5.39 million from the Delaware State Housing Authority
$3.985 million in federal American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) funds
$1 million in New Castle County HOME program funds
$431,000 from the city of Newark
$1.06 million in Low Income Housing Tax Credits, generating roughly $10 million in equity

“This redevelopment of George Read Village shows what can happen with collaboration, investments and vision. Bringing 18 new units to this area of Newark will have a meaningful impact on the community and address our critical housing supply issues,” said Delaware State Housing Authority (DSHA) Director Matthew Heckles.
New Castle County Executive Marcus Henry called the project “a commitment to the people we serve,” emphasizing its role in providing safe and dignified housing.
David Holden, Development Principal at Ingerman, credited strong community support and partnerships for helping the project reach this stage.
“After much success with The Willows at Alder Creek, Ingerman is thrilled to partner once again with the Newark Housing Authority to bring additional high-quality affordable housing to the people of Newark,” Holden said. “We could not have reached this important milestone without the community’s support and our collaboration with the DSHA, city leadership and staff who share our vision to expand and improve the City’s affordable housing offerings,”
Construction is now underway, with officials hopeful the new development will serve as a model for future affordable housing projects across the state.
“The Newark Housing Authority is greatly appreciative to all those who contributed their time, efforts, talents and funds in bringing this to a reality,” Jordan said. “It is my belief that this will not be the last project and groundbreaking event for a deserving group in our community and the Newark Housing Authority will always be steadfast in its goal of greater achievements.”",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/65a79b049c8bf.image_.jpg,,,2025-05-19 12:22:33.389506

A Republican reconciliation bill still being negotiated in the U.S. House contains various proposed changes to Medicaid — among them work reporting requirements — to pay for an extension of President Donald Trump’s 2017 tax cuts. A preliminary Congressional Budget Office estimate found over 8 million people nationally could lose coverage under the House legislation.
The work requirements would apply to adults on Medicaid between ages 19 and 64, requiring them to report at least 80 hours of work per month or qualify for an exception. The exemptions include people with disabilities, caregivers and pregnant participants.
A report from the Urban Institute and Robert Wood Johnson Foundation published last month found between 84,000 and 96,000 Missourians ages 19 to 64 could lose coverage under the plan. Another report, from the left-leaning Center for Budget and Policy Priorities published last week, estimated a reduction of 91,000 Missourians. 
The CBPP analysis found that although 28% of Missouri Medicaid participants in the adult-expansion group could lose coverage, only 8% of participants in the adult-expansion group didn’t work in the last year and don’t qualify for an exemption — meaning thousands of eligible participants would lose coverage.
U.S. House panel passes GOP plan that cuts Medicaid by $625B, adds work requirement

Work requirements in the current version of the legislation would go into effect in 2029, though there are reports Republicans are considering moving up the timeline.
States would be required to monitor compliance and ensure those with exceptions don’t get kicked off. Participants would need to navigate red tape to prove they’re working or exempt. 
New bureaucratic hurdles could prove especially problematic in Missouri, which has historically fared poorly with administration of its public assistance programs. Missouri’s social services agency has struggled to meet federal standards for processing Medicaid applications and is being sued for its administration of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program.
Administrative issues — such as long call center wait times, application delays and paperwork issues — routinely cause Missourians who are eligible for benefits to be incorrectly booted from benefit programs.
At a legislative hearing for a proposed work requirement in Missouri earlier this year, opponents said work requirements on Medicaid would only exacerbate the social service agency’s call center wait times and staffing issues.
One in five Missourians is enrolled on Medicaid. Most adults on Medicaid are already working or would qualify for an exception, but work reporting requirements would cause many to fall through the cracks, experts say, including low-wage workers with unpredictable hours. Opponents of work requirements also say Medicaid is a crucial safety net for workers who are laid-off or fired for reasons beyond their control and lose employer-sponsored health care.
U.S. Sen. Josh Hawley has been a vocal opponent of Medicaid cuts but has said he is supportive of work requirements.
“Listen, if you want to do work requirements, I’m all for that,” he told CNN last week. “I bet every Republican, and I bet most Americans would agree with that.”
Arkansas was the first state to adopt Medicaid work requirements in 2018. Until a court halted the program in 2019, over 18,000 people lost coverage, many of whom didn’t know about exemptions or couldn’t navigate the red tape. Studies found Arkansas’ policy didn’t result in increased employment.
Georgia’s Medicaid work requirement program has been mired in technical issues, ProPublica has reported, and the increased requirements for state employees to verify work status have proven onerous and expensive.
Other proposed Medicaid changes in the U.S. House budget include more frequent eligibility checks, out-of-pocket copays for some enrollees and freezing the tax states levy on providers to help fund the program.

When Gov. Gavin Newsom laid out his revised state budget proposal last week, he emphasized how President Donald Trump and his administration made forecasting California’s economic future even harder. To see that chaotic uncertainty in action, all one needs to look at is the daily investment returns posted by the California Public Employees’ Retirement System.
As of Friday morning the nation’s largest public pension fund, CalPERS, has a total market value of $539 billion. But in the days following “Liberation Day,” when Trump first imposed his tariffs on April 2, CalPERS losses hovered around $25 billion. In the first two days alone, CalPERS lost $15 billion, while the stock market experienced a $6.6 trillion wipeout.
The pension fund’s bounceback from a $508 billion-low on April 7 could be attributed to Trump easing off his most severe tariffs and making a deal with China to pause the highest tariffs for 90 days. 
But more volatility is likely on the horizon: In an April board meeting, CalPERS CEO Marcie Frost said the agency is keeping its “eyes on the road ahead as we navigate all the twists and turns of the current time.”

Frost: “Global economies expand or contract for a variety of reasons. But we must prepare for the possibility that current events here in the U.S. could have a serious impact on our investment returns as of June 30 and into the fiscal year that begins after that.”

Meanwhile, Newsom described Trump’s tariff rollout as “remarkably inconsistent,” and to plug California’s $12 billion budget hole, the governor is proposing controversial shifts in funding that are drawing ire from advocates and stakeholders:

Health care: Newsom wants to use $1.6 billion from Proposition 35 — which voters approved in November to increase the pay of doctors who treat Medi-Cal patients — toward the deficit. He also wants to move $500 million initially earmarked to support family planning and women’s health care to the state’s general fund. Both proposals are getting pushback from doctors, hospitals and clinics, which argue that it is wrong to reroute money voters set aside for specific health costs. Read more from CalMatters’ Kristen Hwang.


Climate projects: In addition to extending California’s cap and trade program through 2045, Newsom wants to commit more than half of the money it generates this year, or roughly $4.8 billion, to Cal Fire operations and the High-Speed Rail Project. The cap and trade program has provided billions of dollars for projects aimed at combating climate change. Critics of Newsom’s proposal say moving the money would mean limiting resources for the state’s other environmental efforts, such as reducing emissions from gas-powered cars. Read more from CalMatters’ Alejandro Lazo.

On Saturday the nonpartisan Legislative Analyst’s Office released its review of the governor’s updated state budget plan. Though it projects a $14 billion deficit, the analyst’s office considers Newsom’s “spending reductions appropriate.”

What can high school grads wear?

Two months ago, the Trump administration said it would withhold federal funding to school districts that promote diversity, equity and inclusion through clubs, activities and graduation ceremonies. Though a judge has since temporarily blocked that order and California is filing a separate lawsuit to stop the order, one state lawmaker wants to make it easier for students to wear tribal or other cultural regalia at graduation.
As CalMatters’ Carolyn Jones explains, a bill by Democratic Assemblymember James Ramos of San Bernardino would eliminate the pre-approval process for students who want to wear cultural regalia — Native American or otherwise — at graduation. Native students, families and tribes say schools require notice too far in advance because students often receive their regalia on graduation day, sometimes as a gift from a grandparent or tribal elder. This can be stressful for students on graduation day, since they’re unsure whether they’ll be allowed to wear the regalia.
Jennie Rocha, who graduated from Clovis North High School last year, said she was nervous arriving at graduation because she wore a Comanche stole that the school had initially denied.

Rocha: “I wanted to wear it because I feel like everything I have is because of the Comanche. I wouldn’t be able to go to college without their support.”

But schools argue they need a pre-approval process for all students to ensure the regalia are respectful and appropriate.

Public silenced at bill hearings

As state legislators wade through the more than 2,000 bills they introduced this year, residents from across the state who travel to Sacramento to speak in support or opposition of those proposals can sometimes find themselves given just a few seconds to speak or silenced altogether, write CalMatters’ Ryan Sabalow and Hans Poschman.
In the past two months, there have been at least a dozen examples of committee leaders cutting off speakers midway through their remarks, or prohibiting them to talk at all due to time constraints. Legislators say it’s sometimes necessary to ensure hearings don’t drag into the night, while ensuring other members of the public, as well as lobbyists and advocates, get their say too. 
But for Californians who must drive hours from remote parts of the state, it can be frustrating and discouraging to have their viewpoints be rushed through the legislative process. In April, Elizabeth Washoe took a day off work to drive five hours from Modoc County to the state Capitol to speak in support of a bear-hunting bill. She was given only a few seconds to speak.

Washoe: “I would love to have more time to say something. It’s not equitable representation for rural areas.”

Gov. Gavin Newsom wants to extend California’s landmark cap and trade program through 2045. But earmarking half of this year’s funds to the beleaguered rail project and Cal Fire would leave too little for other climate projects, critics say. 


California Gov. Gavin Newsom wants to tap at least $2.5 billion from the state’s climate fund to pay for state firefighting crews and the long-troubled high-speed rail project.
In his budget proposal unveiled last week, Newsom announced that he is seeking to extend the state’s landmark cap and trade program, which is funded by credits bought and sold by major polluters, through 2045. But the allocation of the money is already triggering a fervent debate among state lawmakers.
Large polluters, such as oil refineries and power plants, pay for their greenhouse gases through a market system of auctioned credits called cap and trade. Over the past 11 years, almost $13 billion from cap and trade auctions has already been spent on electric vehicles, public transit, clean energy and other projects to reduce greenhouse gases and adapt to climate change.
The governor’s new plan would commit $1.54 billion of the 2025-26 climate funds, and more in later years, to pay for Cal Fire’s “fire prevention, fire control, and resource management activities.” That would amount to more than a third of the state fire agency’s $4.47 billion budget, according to the governor’s proposed budget. Wildfires have grown more extreme because of climate change, straining Cal Fire’s resources.
In addition, through 2045, the governor’s plan would earmark at least $1 billion a year of the climate funds to the California high-speed rail project, which aims to connect Los Angeles to San Francisco. The project, which has been beset with construction delays, cost overruns and fights about the route for years, was allocated $407 million of cap and trade money last year.
Combined, the firefighting and high speed rail costs could consume more than half of the projected $4.8 billion that cap and trade would provide in the next fiscal year.
Newsom’s proposal to extend California’s cap-and-trade program, which expires in 2030, for 15 more years could spark one of the year’s most consequential fights in the Legislature over climate change.
The push to extend the program is bound to be contentious, particularly if Newsom seeks a two-thirds vote of the Legislature, as various groups jostle for a slice of the funding. Watchdogs, policy analysts and environmental justice advocates also have raised concerns about how the program is structured and who benefits the most.
Many legislators have already expressed concerns about the use of climate funds to pay for firefighters and high speed rail. Some lawmakers and other critics and analysts say diverting the money would mean cutting other priorities, such as the transition to electric vehicles.
“You’re going to have some tough choices,” said Helen Kerstein, who tracks the cap and trade program for the nonpartisan Legislative Analyst’s Office. “You can’t add $1.5 billion — and growing — and not take anything away, at least in the near term, given current projections.”
“You’re going to have some tough choices. You can’t add $1.5 billion — and growing — and not take anything away, at least in the near term.”HELEN KERSTEIN, LEGISLATIVE ANALYST’S OFFICE
Assemblymember Lori Wilson, a Democrat from Suisun City, said she is concerned that using climate fund money to pay for Cal Fire’s activities could crowd out spending that has already been promised to reduce emissions from cars and trucks and fund mass transit.
Transportation “is the largest single source, but the hardest to decarbonize,” Wilson said. “And the whole point is to transition, which is why those investments (are) necessary.”
A coalition of environmental justice groups said the governor, by using so much money for high speed rail and general fund expenses, is leaving inadequate money “for extreme heat impacts, affordable housing, clean drinking water, and other critical environmental programs that reduce greenhouse gasses and clean up contaminated air, water and soil that pose direct threats to public health.”

The cap and trade proposal came as California faces a $12 billion budget deficit. By proposing the cap and trade extension as an addition to the budget bill, which moves  through the legislative process faster than standalone bills — Newsom could sidestep what might otherwise be a longer, more contentious climate debate.
The move links the reauthorization of the program to broader budget negotiations — boosting the governor’s leverage but reducing legislative oversight and public input.
Assemblymember Cottie Petrie-Norris, a Democrat from Irvine, protested the governor’s moves at a committee meeting on Thursday. 
“This is probably the most challenging budget situation the state of California has faced in at least the last seventeen years. We are going to be grappling with some very, very tough choices, very tough decisions,” she said. “Trying to then layer in, and shoehorn in, the reauthorization of our landmark climate cap and trade — cap and invest — program seems kind of insane to me.”
Newsom’s proposed extension of the program — which he wants to rename “cap and invest” — comes after President Donald Trump attacked it in an executive order targeting blue-state climate initiatives. The order singled out California’s cap and trade program as forcing businesses to meet “radical requirements.”
Newsom framed his cap and trade proposal in the resistance language reminiscent of clashes during the first Trump era. “California won’t bend the knee to a federal administration hellbent on making America polluted again,” Newsom said in a statement.
But some state lawmakers are already questioning key parts of the plan. Assemblymember Steve Bennett, a Democrat from Oxnard, questioned during the hearing Thursday whether revenues from cap and trade could realistically cover all of Newsom’s promises.
“So, in a sense you’re proposing more money than we’re saying we have?” Bennett, chair of the committee, asked Newsom administration officials from the state Department of Finance.
Bennett was also openly skeptical of continuing to use cap and trade money to pay for the high-speed rail project, which has ballooned to a cost of $128 billion. “We need to… make sure we don’t have a train to nowhere,” he said.
Through 2030, 25% of all cap and trade money is earmarked for high speed rail under state law. A bill in the  Assembly authored by a Republican that would eliminate that earmark has not moved forward.
“Real tracks are being laid…so I want to get (high speed rail) done. That’s our commitment. That’s why it’s still reflected in the cap and trade extension.”GOV. GAVIN NEWSOM
Newsom said at his budget briefing Wednesday that his “commitment (to high speed rail) is firm.”
“Real tracks are being laid…so I want to get it done,” Newsom said. “That’s our commitment. That’s why it’s still reflected in the cap and trade extension.”
Several other lawmakers also raised concerns about the governor’s budget math and were skeptical of relying on a funding stream that is supposed to shrink over time as California reduces its carbon emissions.
“Trying to…shoehorn in the reauthorization of our landmark climate cap and trade program (in budget negotiations) seems kind of insane to me.”ASSEMBLYMEMBER COTTIE PETRIE-NORRIS 
California Transit Association Executive Director Michael Pimentel said the governor’s plan was “silent on the importance of continued climate investment” into mass transit.
“To combat climate change, improve air quality, and address the affordability crisis faced by everyday Californians, state leaders must stand up to protect and maintain continued investment in clean, efficient, and affordable public transit projects and services,” he said.
A contentious history 
California launched its cap-and-trade program in 2013 as a key tool for slashing greenhouse gas emissions. Created under the 2006 Global Warming Solutions Act, the system set a declining cap on emissions from major polluters and allowed businesses to buy and sell permits, creating a market for emissions.
By 2017, then-Gov. Jerry Brown faced a critical inflection point. The program was set to expire in 2020, and Brown sought to extend it through 2030. But the path to reauthorization was anything but smooth.
The political lift came in securing a two-thirds vote in the Legislature, the threshold that would help inoculate the program from legal attacks, given that California voters expanded the definition of a tax in 2010.
That supermajority required bipartisan support, and Brown courted moderate Republicans with concessions: tax breaks for manufacturers, fee waivers for rural residents and spending assurances.
Newsom’s proposal would maintain many of the program’s most controversial provisions. Those include free emission permits for the oil and gas industry, a price ceiling mechanism and the use of carbon offsets, which have drawn criticism over concerns about their effectiveness. The governor’s proposal leaves most of the details up to the discretion of the Air Resources Board, which oversees the cap and trade program.
One key issue is the number of free allowances to industry, including the oil and gas industry. Newsom’s proposal could extend many of those giveaways through 2045, said climate expert Danny Cullenward, vice chair of an independent advisory cap and trade committee.
Cullenward told CalMatters that the market will likely begin shifting from a surplus of pollution permits to a scarcity. That will raise emissions reductions and state revenue, but also potentially increase consumer costs, with key decisions left to the Air Resources Board.
“It’ll bring in more money to the state, but it’ll also have higher consumer price impacts,” Cullenward said. “That’s going to be a key issue.”
The cap and trade debate is unfolding amid growing concern over affordability in California — a theme running through nearly every aspect of the state’s climate policy. A new report from the Legislative Analyst’s Office raised questions about how much the program could cost Californians. For instance, the cap and trade program could add 74 cents to the cost of gasoline if credits rise to their highest levels, amounting to about an additional $700 a year for the average California household, the report said. 
Of the $12.8 billion spent so far, nearly $9.2 billion has been invested in projects that benefit disadvantaged communities that are designated as a priority, according to the air board. 
The cap and trade debate is unfolding amid growing concern over affordability in California — a theme running through nearly every aspect of the state’s climate policy.
But environmental justice advocates have long criticized the program for failing to reduce local pollution in those communities, which often bear the cost of higher gasoline prices, too. Because cap and trade allows companies to comply with greenhouse gas limits by buying credits, they can continue operating in low-income neighborhoods without reducing emissions there.
Advocacy groups have asked the Legislature to reject a plan similar to the governor’s that would largely leave the program unchanged.
“Our communities, who bear the disproportionate burden of some of the worst air quality in the state, and the nation, are also predominantly communities of color,” Connie Cho, senior policy advisor for the Asian Pacific Environmental Network, said at a state Senate hearing earlier this month.

The cost of the low-income health insurance program has been growing rapidly.,"In summary
Newsom’s Medi-Cal budget plan would shift money for voter-approved increases in doctors’ pay and reproductive care to cover other expenses. The cost of the low-income health insurance program has been growing rapidly.




Six months after California voters overwhelmingly approved a ballot initiative that increases the pay of doctors treating Medi-Cal patients, Gov. Gavin Newsom wants to divert that money to cover other health costs.
Newsom last week proposed using $1.6 billion generated by Proposition 35 over the next two years to help address California’s $12 billion state deficit. The governor said the spending plan is allowable under the ballot measure, while doctors, hospitals, clinics and others who support the measure are crying foul.
Rising costs are making Medi-Cal, the state’s health insurance for low-income people, unsustainable, triggering a controversy over use of funds that voters earmarked for specific health costs, such as doctor’s pay and women’s reproductive health.
In addition to reallocating the Prop. 35 funds, the governor also wants to move $500 million from the state tobacco tax into the state’s general fund. That money, which voters approved in a 2016 ballot measure, is supposed to support family planning and women’s health care, among other services. 
Health advocates say the governor’s proposals for shifting the money will weaken the state’s health safety net and hamstring reproductive health care.
Planned Parenthood said the double hit from Newsom’s Prop. 35 and tobacco tax proposals in the state budget could cripple its services. 
Jodi Hicks, chief executive of Planned Parenthood Affiliates of California and co-chair of the Yes on Prop. 35 campaign, called Newsom’s proposal “shocking” and “plain cruel.” She said Planned Parenthood would lose a third of its budget if it is approved by the Legislature next month. Low-income patients would have to contend with longer wait times, fewer appointment options and potentially need to drive further to access care. 
“Our footprint is so large in sexual and reproductive health care in California. There is no way for other clinics to absorb that,” Hicks said.
Newsom’s proposal comes at a time when the Republican-led Congress is contemplating deep cuts to Medicaid. Included is cutting off all federal funding for Planned Parenthood. (Medi-Cal is California’s name for Medicaid.) “We need the state to help us prepare, not make things significantly worse,” Hicks said.

The use of state health funds will likely be a centerpiece as the state Legislature negotiates a budget deal with Newsom over the next month. A final budget is due June 15. 
The state’s Democratic lawmakers, who have a supermajority in the Legislature, have largely balked at Newsom’s changes to Medi-Cal, which also include freezing new enrollment for most adults without permanent legal status.
“I’m disheartened that the Governor’s updated budget is riddled with deep cuts to our constituents’ healthcare. We cannot boast about having the fourth-largest economy while balancing our budget on the back of everyday Californians’ healthcare,” Assembly Health Committee Chair Mia Bonta, a Democrat from Oakland, said in a statement.
Is it legal to move Prop. 35 funds?
Prop. 35, approved by 68% of California voters in November, was designed to guarantee doctors would get paid more to serve patients covered by Medi-Cal. Reimbursement rates for Medi-Cal are so low that patients often struggle to find doctors who will accept their insurance. 
Prop. 35 uses a special tax paid by health insurance plans to generate revenue for Medi-Cal. Most of the money — $9 billion in 2024-25 — goes to the state’s general fund. But the additional $1.6 billion that Newsom wants to take for general Medi-Cal spending was supposed to be reserved to increase the amount doctors get paid for specific services, such as primary care, specialty care and emergency room visits.  
Newsom’s budget proposal would instead use the $1.6 billion intended for doctors’ pay increases to support higher Medi-Cal spending for primary care, specialty care, ambulances and hospital outpatient procedures. 
Planned Parenthood and the California Medical Association helped lead the industry group that put the measure on the ballot. 
In a statement, Dr. Shannon Udovic-Constant, president of the medical association, called Newsom’s budget proposal a “direct violation of the will of California voters.”
“The proposition was passed to prevent exactly this kind of maneuver – raiding health care funding to solve budget problems,” she said.

When questioned about the move during a budget presentation on Wednesday, Newsom denied this characterization and said the proposed spending is “absolutely consistent” with the rules established by the ballot measure. 
Newsom repeatedly blamed Prop. 35 for causing part of the state’s budget shortfall and called it and other recent ballot measures “unfunded initiatives.” 
The governor said Medi-Cal has a growth problem that the state cannot afford. 
State spending on Medi-Cal has more than doubled since 2017 and is now projected to cost $76.8 billion in the 2024-25 budget year. Earlier this year lawmakers approved an extra $6 billion for unexpected Medi-Cal costs.

Linnea Koopmans, chief executive of the Local Health Plans of California and chair of the Prop. 35 advisory committee, said in a statement to CalMatters that Newsom’s budget does not reflect California’s values. 
“Undoubtedly, the state budget challenge is real, but sweeping more than $1 billion of (Prop. 35) revenue is not an option. These funds must be used to support Medi-Cal investments in providers and workforce that are necessary to improve access to care,” Koopmans said. 
The Prop. 35 advisory committee was established by the ballot initiative to oversee how the state spends the money.
Industry supporters of the measure say Newsom’s proposal doesn’t actually pay doctors more; it conflates increased costs associated with Medi-Cal’s growing enrollment with payment. 
Molly Weedn, a spokesperson for the Yes on 35 campaign, said in a statement that the budget proposal raises “serious legal concerns.”
“The Governor proposes using Prop. 35 funding to cover already incurred costs in Medi-Cal and not for increasing provider payments to increase access to health care,” Weedn said.
The most contentious part of the debate comes down to whether he’s using the Prop. 35 money to pay the state’s general expenses, not just health care. 
The Newsom administration’s finance department said in a document shared with CalMatters that doctors’ pay is reviewed and increased annually, which aligns with Prop. 35’s requirements. The department also denies that using the money to pay for Medi-Cal would replace general fund spending because the amount that the state is taking from the general fund for Medi-Cal continues to grow. 
Critics say these standard adjustments are not necessarily a true rate increase for doctors — they mostly reflect increased Medi-Cal costs as a result of more patients enrolling or more expensive care being provided. In order to substantially increase how much doctors get paid, the state would have to submit an application for federal approval, which it has not done.
“It appears the caseload growth in Medi-Cal is being used to justify the need for these funds,” said Jennifer Kent, an advisor to the Prop. 35 campaign and former director of the health care services department. 
Newsom isn’t the first governor to sweep money approved by voters into the general fund, and his budget proposal also mirrors a move made by his predecessor, Jerry Brown, in 2017 to eliminate payments made for family planning, women’s health and dentistry by the state tobacco tax.
Amy Moy, co-chief executive of Essential Access Health, which provides grants to clinics for reproductive health care, said the governor’s proposed cuts jeopardize California’s commitment to making abortion, contraceptives and other reproductive health services accessible. 
Moy, a member of the Proposition 35 stakeholder advisory committee, said she is confident the final budget approved by the Legislature will pull back some of Newsom’s proposed cuts. 
“Ultimately we believe that California’s commitment, including our administration’s commitment, to sexual and reproductive health will be reflected in the final budget.”

California lawmakers cut them off,Ryan Sabalow and Hans Poschman,,,,,https://calmatters.org/politics/2025/05/california-legislature-silenced-public-hearings/,"As lawmakers rush through thousands of bills in Sacramento and make decisions in secret, regular Californians are often silenced.","In summary
As lawmakers rush through thousands of bills in Sacramento and make decisions in secret, regular Californians are often silenced.


Landon Morrison, a recovering addict, wanted to tell California lawmakers why they should support legislation he believes will hold troubled drug and alcohol treatment centers accountable.
He was told he would only get two minutes to speak, so he spent hours writing and rehearsing exactly what he wanted to say. But after getting on the road at 4 a.m. for the six-hour drive to Sacramento from Los Angeles County, Morrison didn’t get to say a single word because previous speakers talked for too long.
The committee’s Democratic chairperson, Sen. Caroline Menjivar of Van Nuys, ended testimony in support of the bill after five minutes.
“In a way, this kind of articulated the stigma of addiction. … I’m at the bottom of the line, you know?” Morrison said. “It was just kind of very disheartening.”
Morrison’s experience is hardly unique in the California Legislature as lawmakers try to jam through the more than 2,000 bills lawmakers have introduced so far this year. Over the past two months, CalMatters journalists witnessed more than a dozen examples of committee leaders cutting speakers off midway through their remarks or prohibiting them from talking at all because other people went over the few minutes that members of the public are given to testify.
Lawmakers say the rules are necessary to accommodate the armies of paid lobbyists, political activists and members of the public who flood the Capitol each year to jockey for and against legislation. Lawmakers say they do their best to ensure everyone gets their say while aiming to keep hearings from dragging on well into the night.  
“Some bills you get dozens of people. Some bills you get over 100 people,” said Assemblymember Marc Berman, a Democrat representing the Palo Alto area who oversees the Business and Professions Committee. “There is a real attempt to be fair on both sides and to everybody.”
The public comment limits are yet another symptom of lawmakers rushing through thousands of bills in the few months they’re in session in Sacramento – and usually waiting until right before key deadlines to push through the largest volume of bills.
‘Me too’ speakers get only seconds
To try to fit in all those wishing to speak, most members of the public who show up at the Capitol can only express their positions through what’s known as the “me too” portion of a hearing.
After the lead witnesses in support or opposition of a bill each get to deliver two minutes of testimony, others approach the microphone and state their name, organization and whether they support or oppose it. In 2023, legislative leaders stopped allowing people to offer their comments remotely via Zoom as they had during the pandemic.

Lobbyists and other insiders usually know the drill and keep their “me toos” to a couple of seconds so the committee leaders don’t cut them off. 
But regular people who might not be familiar with the process regularly get shut down if they speak beyond a few seconds.
That happened to Albert Titman, Sr., a Native American man from the Sacramento area. He came to the Assembly Business and Professions Committee in late April to tell lawmakers why they should oppose a cannabis tax bill he thinks would harm disadvantaged tribal communities. 
But he wasn’t designated as a lead witness, so when he tried to speak during the “me too” portion of the hearing, Berman, the committee chairperson, told him to wrap it up.
“Now we’re just at the name, organization and position,” Berman reminded him as Titman grew frustrated.
“There’s not one Native person here,” Titman shot back. “Not one Native person.”
Capitol security ushered Titman away from the mic.
“They shut me down, just pretty much telling me to shut up, you know?” Titman said in an interview. “I wanted to actually sit up there and present my argument, but they wouldn’t allow me.”
Berman said later that he “felt very bad” for how things went with Titman, and he noted he did give Titman a little more time than the other “me too” speakers had. But Berman said he was obligated to keep the hearing moving. If a committee runs too long, it can delay the subsequent committees scheduled to use the same room.“I try to have a little flexibility, but you can’t let somebody talk for, you know, a minute who’s really just supposed to be providing their name, organization or affiliation and support or opposition to the bill,” he said. “Every time is a dance, and it’s not easy.”
Kathi Zollinger, a volunteer with the Lake Tahoe-based BEAR League, didn’t have security called on her last month when she approached the mic and tried to say why she opposed a  bear-hunting bill.
But she was still taken aback when Diane Papan, the Democratic chairperson of the Assembly Parks and Wildlife Committee, cut her off mid-sentence.

“I thought it was kind of rude,” she said afterward. Papan, who represents the San Mateo area, didn’t respond to an interview request.
One of the bear bill’s supporters, Elizabeth Washoe, took a day off work, filled up her vehicle with $5-plus a gallon gas before she left Modoc County and made the five-hour drive to the capital, only to be given a few seconds at the mic. 
In an interview, she said that as a Native American woman from a rural area, she left feeling that those living in the far reaches of the state have a harder time having their voices heard.
“I would love to have more time to say something,” she said. “It’s not equitable representation for rural areas.”
Democrat blocks comment on transgender bill 
Some people who get cut off believe it’s because a committee chair doesn’t like what they have to say. Opponents of a bill to allow transgender people to more easily change their names say that happened to them when the proposal was before the Assembly Health Committee on April 29.
The committee’s chairperson, Mia Bonta, a Democrat from Oakland, refused to give the lead witnesses for opponents their two minutes each. Bonta told them they hadn’t properly registered in advance.“I was very clear and the rules that the Health Committee adopted indicated that we needed to have registered opposition offering witness testimony,” she said. “And I reiterated that at the beginning of this hearing, and those are the rules of this committee.”
But the bill’s opponents said they could find no reference to the rules online. 
After driving from San Francisco to testify, Erin Friday, president of the group Our Duty, was furious. 
“Welcome to China,” she said. Another organization called Californians for Good Governance later filed a formal complaint over how the opponents were treated.
Bonta’s spokesperson, Daniel McGreevy, said in an email that Bonta’s actions were “consistent with updated guidelines which are established and read at the top of all recent hearings.”
In an interview, Friday said she regularly testifies in other states on similar legislation. She said no other state she’s been to is as restrictive about public comment in hearings. 
“I’m a lifelong Democrat, so I find it really quite amusing when (California Democrats) talk about Republicans not wanting to play by the rules, or constitutional chaos, when we have no voice whatsoever,” said Friday, whose organization believes there “is no such thing as a transgender child.” 
Are hearings mostly political theater?
After CalMatters highlighted last year the consequences of rushing through too many bills at the last minute, legislative leaders slightly lowered the amount of bills each lawmaker could introduce during the two-year session that began in December. It’s helped a little. At the bill filing deadline earlier this year, lawmakers had introduced 2,278 bills – down from 2,640 at the start of the last session.
The committees are still jam-packed, such as in late April, as lawmakers butted up against a deadline to advance their measures. Two Senate Judiciary Committee hearings discussed a combined 106 bills. One of those hearings went 11 hours. The final votes weren’t tallied until almost 11 p.m.

The public comment limits also underscore another problem that CalMatters has pointed out. The Democrats who control the Capitol often make their decisions behind closed doors.
It’s a trend reflected in the Digital Democracy database. Last session, just 25 bills failed because a majority of lawmakers voted “no ” during a committee hearing or a floor session. Plenty of bills still die — 2,403 of them were killed during the last two-year session — but they’re almost always spiked through secretive procedural tactics that leave the public with little way of knowing who is responsible.
Critics say that makes commenting in hearings mostly performative since it’s so rare for bills to be killed in public.
San Diego Republican Assemblymember Carl DeMaio says he doesn’t bother bringing witnesses to testify because he knows what they say won’t change anyone’s mind — and there’s a good chance they won’t get to say all they came to say anyway. It’s “all theater,” he said. “That’s irrelevant, because these politicians basically do their deals in back rooms, and they walk into the hearing already decided.”
Other ways to influence legislation
Legislators and Capitol insiders say people can influence legislation before committee hearings in plenty of other ways. Anyone can submit formal remarks on individual bills through the Legislature’s online position letter portal. 
They can also write or call lawmakers’ offices and request meetings with them or their staff, or speak to the politicians when they do events in their district, which can be more effective than showing up at a hearing whose outcome could be predetermined. 
Lobbyist Jennifer Fearing says she tells advocates that if they really want to be heard, facetime with a lawmaker in their district is best.
“You don’t have to change the whole system up here (in Sacramento) to have that kind of impact,” Fearing said. “A minute in a hearing is not a substitute for a relationship at home.” 
For Morrison, a recovering addict, the trip to Sacramento wasn’t a total loss. 
Sen. Tom Umberg, the bill’s author, felt badly that Morrison got cut off and arranged for him to speak on a related measure.
Umberg, a Democrat representing the Santa Ana area, said it was the least he could do for a “civilian” — his term for those who aren’t paid advocates. As chairperson of the Senate Judiciary Committee, he said he tries to prioritize bills with more “civilian” speakers.
Still, Morrison said that while Umberg treated him well, the experience was a letdown. 
He thought testifying would be “an honor and a prestige.” Instead, “It’s like well, no, that’s really not that big a deal,” he said. “They slap you to the side.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/031224_Happiness-Comittee_FG_CM_02.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-05-19 09:06:50.535511

Climate change has thrown insurance markets into dysfunction, and the situation is about to get more dire. As the epicenter of a global insurance crisis, it is critical that California formulates a strong response. 
Creating and funding public catastrophe models, like the one called for in California’s Senate Bill 429, is a good start. It seeks a model that would help regulators, insurers and others assess wildfire risk and future losses.
Under the Trump administration, the federal government is abandoning its responsibility to support communities facing climate catastrophe. It’s shifting costs onto state governments by gutting FEMA and slashing funding for crucial weather data and climate adaptation. Many businesses, including insurance companies, rely heavily on this data. These harmful federal cuts are leaving the public vulnerable.
Public catastrophe models like the one proposed in SB 429 can serve as a check on the proprietary “black box” risk prediction models insurers use to justify rate increases and to conceal information from customers about how to reduce risk.
California has smartly invested billions of dollars in wildfire mitigation over the past decade. Insurers should be required to factor that into their underwriting.
Unfortunately a bill requiring them to do so stalled in the California Senate last session, exacerbating concerns over whether Californians will be able to access the insurance market after January’s devastating wildfires.
Public catastrophe models can help solve these problems. By providing greater transparency around modeling, they can blunt the negative fallout of our insurance crisis for consumers. By collecting sophisticated, granular information about climate risk, these public models can help inform and drive greater public investment in climate resilience. 
This data can be used to inform government investments in risk reduction, such as ecological forest management and floodplain management, which will likely make insurance markets much healthier over time. 
Without a public alternative, the proprietary models used by insurance companies are what we are left with.
There is little information about the inputs used in these private models, and they have been shown to have big flaws. Analyses of some of the most commonly used proprietary risk modelers from insurance companies have revealed glaring inconsistencies that could increase costs for Californians and elevate the risks for homeowners.
In a March report outlining a road to recovery from the Los Angeles wildfires, researchers at UCLA and the University of Southern California called for more reliable data and stronger coordination between government agencies, the insurance sector and individual households. They argued for substantial investments in climate resilience and urged that those investments be incorporated into insurance models. 
A public catastrophe model would be useful in supporting all of that work. It would also help guarantee that Californians see the benefits of the mitigation investments they are making through more widely available and affordable insurance policies. 
During the Biden administration, the Federal Insurance Office recommended that state insurance offices build a platform to collaborate on catastrophe model data and methodology. Biden’s White House even floated the concept of a national catastrophe model to host that effort. 
Trump is now dismantling all of the federal agencies that might have housed such a platform, while also failing to act on Gov. Gavin Newsom’s request for federal aid for the L.A. wildfires. 
With the federal government no longer a reliable partner, it is more important than ever that states like California take the lead in protecting consumers.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/010824_Eaton-Fire_JH_CM_37.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-05-19 09:06:50.535511

The farm was one of thousands benefiting from a local food program recently cut by the Trump administration. (Helaina Thompson/Courtesy of Over the Moon Farm)Anna Pesek saw a federal program supporting local food purchases as much more than a boost to her Iowa pork and poultry farm.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture grant program that allowed schools and food banks to buy fresh products from small farms helped her forge new business relationships. It allowed her to spend more with local feed mills and butchers, and was starting to build a stronger supply chain of local foods.
But now that the Trump administration has yanked the funding, she worries that rural economic boost might end, too.
“With the razor-thin margins on both sides, those partnerships are just really hard, if not impossible, to sustain,” she said.
The co-owner of Over the Moon Farm, Pesek said her operation was never entirely reliant on the local food programs; it represented about 10% of her business. While she knew the federal money wouldn’t last forever, she was planning on the funding lasting through 2028 — but then the Trump administration last month nixed more than $1 billion for local food programs.
The federally funded Local Food Purchase Assistance and the Local Food for Schools programs, both begun during the pandemic, focused on small, local farms in aims of building stronger domestic food supply chains. Grants allowed schools and food banks to buy meat, dairy and produce from small farms — including many healthy products that are often too expensive for those institutions.
USDA’s local food programs specifically aided some of the nation’s most disadvantaged farmers and ranchers, including newcomers, small farmers and those who have faced racial discrimination.
 

The local food programs were initially funded by 2021’s American Rescue Plan Act but were later expanded by the Biden administration. The Trump administration, though, has cut the funding that went to thousands of small farms, saying that it’s instead “prioritizing stable, proven solutions that deliver lasting impact.”
Pesek noted that the federal government has subsidized commodity agriculture like corn and soybeans for more than a century.
“It’s not a novel idea, right? This is how the relationship between the federal government and farmers has looked,” she said. “And so all this program did was allocate some of the funds to go to different kinds of farmers versus just commodity farmers.”
Just after cutting the local food programs, USDA announced it was expediting $10 billion in direct payments to commodity farmers through the Emergency Commodity Assistance Program, which helps farmers offset high input prices and low sale prices for crops. The White House is reportedly considering billions more in farm subsidies as President Donald Trump escalates global trade wars.
Andy Ollove, food access program director at Fresh Approach, a California nonprofit that works on building a healthier and more resilient food system, said the government’s long-standing farm subsidies flow to some of the nation’s biggest operators. Conversely, the local food programs benefited small farmers and communities directly.
“The economic multiplier to this program just seems way more impactful than the traditional subsidy model of the USDA that the administration is continuing to invest in,” he said. “It’s just a giveaway.”
Fresh Approach has helped administer the food bank program in California. While implementation delays mean farmers won’t lose access to the program as quickly as in other states, he expects elimination of the program to put small farmers out of business across the country.
Some states have launched their own local food programs, but nothing on the scale of the federal investment. That’s left advocates for small farmers, local foods and food banks pushing for reinstatement of the federal program or getting it included in the next round of farm bill negotiations, when Congress outlines a five- or six-year spending plan for the nation’s food policy and agriculture sector.
Ollove expects philanthropists will fund parts of California’s program after federal money is depleted. But it won’t have the same reach.
“I do feel confident that these types of programs will continue in California … sporadically and piecemeal,” he said. “But not in the way that we’re administering it, in a way that I think is changing a lot of things and improving the food system.”
 A mixed response from states 

The noncompetitive USDA local food grants allowed many new farmers to break into markets. And the aid for food hubs, which link small producers to larger markets, helped farmers distribute products to schools and food banks.
In Wisconsin, for example, more than half of the nearly 300 farmers who benefited from the food bank program were early career farmers, according to state officials.
In Illinois, the state prioritized funds toward socially disadvantaged farmers, such as those who have faced racial or ethnic prejudice.
“Attacking this program was really an attack on Illinois’ most vulnerable, whether it’s a socially disadvantaged farmer or the food recipient,” said Kristi Jones, deputy director of the Illinois Department of Agriculture.
Her department administered the federal food bank program, which helped beginning farmers get their businesses off the ground.
“A lot of these farmers, they’re living their dreams,” she said. “They are living their goals because of this program.”
Illinois had been planning on nearly $15 million from the next round of funding for the food bank program. Jones said farmers already had begun planning and spending on seeds and equipment.

“You just don’t put something on the ground and have the product the next day,” she said. “ … So that uncertainty was incredibly challenging for farmers who already deal with enough uncertainty.”
Democratic leaders have bashed the Trump administration’s decision: Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, for example, called it “a slap in the face to Illinois farmers and the communities they feed.”
But conservative leaders in other states have downplayed the cuts.
In Texas, Agriculture Commissioner Sid Miller characterized USDA’s decision as “a reassessment.”
He said the state was not dependent on the federal funds and would continue its Farm to School and Farm to Food Bank programs, which encourage the local purchase of Texas agricultural products.
“There’s always room for refinement, and we may see a revised version of the policy down the road that is even better for agriculture producers,” he said in a statement last month.
Texas funds programs to help distribute excess food to schools, food banks and charities. But it does not have a grant program like USDA’s to help those organizations purchase local food, said Marshall Webb, spokesperson for the state agriculture department.
Iowa’s agriculture department recently started its own local food program.
The Choose Iowa program has made about $300,000 available to support local food purchases — though the state lost out on about $11.3 million because of the federal cuts.
Don McDowell, spokesperson for the Iowa Department of Agriculture & Land Stewardship, said the agency would continue to ask lawmakers to expand funding for the Choose Iowa program.
“Programs designed to forge relationships between Iowa farmers, food hubs, food banks and schools are important to our farmers and communities,” he said.
Iowa Farmers Union President Aaron Heley Lehman said his organization, which represents family farmers and ranchers, would like to see the state step in to fill the void.
“But we don’t anticipate that that’s going to be an easy thing for the state of Iowa to do,” he said. “So not only is it local farmers that are feeling like they’ve had the rug pulled out from underneath them, but the state of Iowa has, too.”
  Creating a new food system 

In Southern California, Dickinson Family Farms has worked to gather produce from dozens of small farms across the region, allowing even the smallest operators without distribution capabilities to sell to local food banks.
 

Andrew Dickinson, who owns the farm with his father, said the federal local food program also helped reduce food waste. Farmers were able to get fair market prices for vegetables with cosmetic damage or fruits deemed too small or large for grocery store shelves.
Dickinson said the federal program has provided a reliable marketplace for small operators that otherwise depend on more inconsistent sales streams like farmers markets.
“It will create a vacuum,” he said.
About 60 miles east of Los Angeles, sixth-generation farmer Anna Knight said the federal funds were much more than a handout to farmers. To her, they were about creating a new kind of food system.
She said supporting local producers creates more supply chain resilience — something many people didn’t appreciate until the pandemic.
“We don’t want to go back to that world,” she said. “When we invest in our local food system, we’re really investing on onshoring our food production system, on making new food systems local and increasing their resiliency in moments of crisis.”
Old Grove Orange, her California farm, has been supplying citrus to some local school systems for years. But she said the federal funds were the “single biggest changemaker” for pushing schools to buy local for the first time.
To her, that’s key in promoting lifelong healthy eating: Local produce like her freshly picked oranges pack more of a nutritional punch and just taste better than produce that takes weeks to ship from abroad.
“When you are giving a child a delicious piece of fruit, you are really cultivating their palate for life,” she said. “You are setting this expectation of what a fruit is supposed to taste like, and you are sparking this love for fruits and vegetables for the rest of their life.”
Knight said the nation doesn’t have to choose between big and small farms. But small farms are vanishing all around her.
“This is a ticking bomb,” she said. “The clock is running out if we don’t really find a way to help make these small, medium-sized farms sustainable.”

This reporting was supported by the International Women’s Media Foundation’s Fund for Indigenous Journalists: Reporting on Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women, Girls, Two Spirit and Transgender People (MMIWG2T).









On a summer evening in 2019, a man living in a hilltop house in the Navajo community of Nenahnezad called 911 to report a body in the dirt road in front of his home.“The guy is not breathing, nothing,” he told the operator.
The person he discovered was Kyle Jackson, a 31-year-old citizen of the Navajo Nation.
Kyle had fought with another man at a nearby house hours before his body was found, according to witness interviews by law enforcement. Severely injured, Kyle was kicked out of the house. It’s unclear how long he lay in the road before dying, but at least one other person passed by without stopping to help him, about six hours before the call to police.
In the following weeks, his mother, Colleen Harrison Jackson, visited the spot where his body was found and spoke with the 911 caller, along with some of his friends who had been with him in the days leading up to his death.

She put her faith in the Navajo Department of Criminal Investigations and the FBI — one of the agencies on the case because Kyle’s body was found on the reservation. Over the next few years, she called investigators from both agencies for updates. They would get back to her sometimes, but not always. She also reached out to an FBI victim specialist, who would tell her the investigators were still working on the case, so she remained hopeful they would eventually make an arrest.
Then she got the letter.
The FBI had closed its investigation, the specialist wrote to Colleen in March 2022.
The letter provided a nine-word explanation: The United States Attorney’s Office had declined to prosecute.
Standing in front of the post office, Colleen cried as she read those words.
“No one called me and said, ‘We’re going to close this case, this is why.’ No one called me,” she said. “I just get this letter, and I was very upset because I didn’t know what happened. I really just broke down.”
To this day, no one has been tried for killing Kyle.
Colleen isn’t alone. She’s one of thousands who have lost loved ones to a national crisis of Indigenous people disproportionately dying of homicide or going missing.
Infrequent updates from law enforcement, many affected families say, have intensified the pain they’re already feeling. That was one of the key findings of the federal Not Invisible Act Commission, which, in a 2023 report, made numerous recommendations aimed at police and prosecutors improving the way they communicate with families.
In an interview with New Mexico In Depth last year, former U.S. Attorney for the District of New Mexico Alexander Uballez and two prosecutors in the office’s Indian Country Crimes section acknowledged the harm done to families when the federal government delivers difficult news about their loved ones’ cases through the mail.
During his tenure, which began in May 2022, the office established a policy of updating families in person when possible, according to Uballez.
A Not Invisible Act Commission member says that’s a step in the right direction.
But Uballez, who announced his run for Albuquerque mayor in April, has since resigned at the request of President Donald Trump.
The new U.S. attorney for the district, Ryan Ellison, didn’t answer a question about whether the policy Uballez described will remain, but said in an email that prosecutors working closely with families is important.
Growing up in northwestern New Mexico, Kyle spent time playing along the San Juan River, fishing at a nearby dam with his grandpa, and helping take care of his siblings and cousins. He was an avid reader and enjoyed working on science projects for school fairs.
His childhood love of the outdoors continued into adulthood, and he often went on hikes and camping trips. In 2016, he graduated from San Juan College with an associate of applied science degree in the college’s industrial maintenance mechanic program.
Kyle “never let things get him down,” Colleen said, and looked out for others. As a teenager, he urged his mom to let friends who had unstable home lives stay with their family, she said.
A former girlfriend, Christa Perez, first met Kyle when they were in high school. They reconnected over a decade later and started dating. Perez is a single mom with three kids and was struggling at the time, she said.
“If it wasn’t for Kyle, I think I’d still be drinking. I’d still be lost,” Perez said. “He was there for me no matter what.”
He taught her kids how to play a card game, and to this day, Perez said, they ask, “Are we going to play Kyle’s cards or regular cards?”
They broke up about a year before his death but kept in touch, up until the week he died.
A violent evening
Colleen shared with New Mexico In Depth a Shiprock police incident report, the letter she received from the FBI in 2022, and a report of findings from the University of New Mexico’s Office of the Medical Investigator, which found Kyle had died of blunt head trauma. The news organization obtained the recording of the 911 call and dispatch log from San Juan County, along with records maintained by the FBI, primarily summaries of witness interviews from which names have been redacted.
On the night of Friday, June 21, at about 9 p.m., Kyle and two other people went to a nearby store to pick up alcohol. Later that night, he ended up at a house in Nenahnezad, where, according to the witness interviews, he and another man fought.
Kyle “may have been struck with a hammer,” according to the report of findings. He then “moved about the home, bleeding on various surfaces, before being kicked out” early Saturday morning with facial and skull fractures.
At about noon on Saturday, a man driving to visit a friend in the area saw Kyle lying in the road, he later told a Navajo criminal investigator. The man believed Kyle, who appeared to have been “beaten badly,” was dead. He continued up the road and saw busted windows on the house he intended to visit.  Not wanting to get involved, he turned around.
When he drove past Kyle again to leave the area, he was “moving around a little bit.” The man “was afraid the guy might get up and turn on him,” so he drove off just as it began to rain.
Trying to make sense of why the man didn’t help Kyle, Colleen said she thinks people in her community are hesitant to call law enforcement because they’re skeptical arrests will come out of it, and there are fears about retaliation.
The 911 call didn’t come in until about 6:30 p.m. that day.
The caller told the operator he had just arrived home from Farmington when he found Kyle’s body in the road out front.
“Does he look to be beyond any help?” the operator asked.
“Nope, nope, not even breathing, nothing,” the caller said. “He looks—he got hit or something. There’s a hole in the side of his temple.”
Emergency medical services and then officers with the Navajo Nation’s Shiprock Police District arrived over the next 40 minutes. Several other people later arrived at the scene, a police officer wrote in his report, including Kyle’s grandmother, who asked to see his body.
At about the same time, Colleen was a few miles away, hosting a birthday party for her daughter. She learned about her son’s death later that night from his grandmother.
“I knew something was wrong already. I could feel it,” Colleen said. “And when she told me, I don’t even know what happened after that. I couldn’t even breathe.”
The letter
Early on in the investigation, the family was told there was a suspect, and the suspect’s arrest might be on the news in another week, Colleen said.
Weeks turned into months, though, and that never happened. But when Colleen would call for updates, an FBI victim specialist would sometimes get back to her and say investigators were still working on the case.
So the letter — dated March 17, 2022, nearly three years after Kyle’s death — came as a shock.
The FBI had closed its investigation because the U.S. Attorney’s Office had declined to prosecute, the victim specialist wrote. The decision didn’t “lessen the important contribution” Colleen made to the investigation, the letter reads, and her “assistance and cooperation were greatly appreciated.”
Colleen called the Navajo criminal investigator and asked him to explain.
The investigator arranged a meeting with the FBI agent. During that sit-down, which Colleen remembers happening about four months after she received the letter, they told her there wasn’t enough evidence to prosecute.
They said the case could be reopened if another witness came forward, Colleen said.
That was almost three years ago. There have been no updates since.
In a late February interview, Uballez, the former U.S. attorney, wouldn’t talk about Kyle’s case, saying the office typically doesn’t comment on investigations, whether they’re open or closed. But he spoke more generally about how a federal prosecutor decides whether to file charges. (Uballez was sworn into office in May 2022, two months after Colleen received the letter from the FBI.)
FBI agents assigned to a case, Uballez said, can “procedurally, look at it themselves” and decide to not refer it for prosecution. Or “they could look at it and say, either, ‘We’re sort of on the fence and we want you guys to make the call,’ or, ‘We think there’s a charge there,’” Uballez said.
Federal prosecutors then evaluate whether there were any constitutional rights violations and whether they think a case could be proven to a jury, he said.
“It’s a different calculus,” Uballez said. “Even though we may agree we know who did this, what happened, it doesn’t mean that we should charge.”
In the dark
In 2023, the federal Not Invisible Act Commission heard testimony from at least 260 people who have lost loved ones to the crisis of missing and murdered Indigenous people or survived human trafficking. The commission visited seven cities, including Albuquerque.
One of the major themes from the hearings, the commission wrote in a report published in October that year, was that “authorities at all levels must improve communications with family members, who are too often left in the dark for days, weeks, or months about the investigation.”
“Tragically, a case may be declared ‘cold’ without a family receiving any information about the investigation,” the report reads.
Asked what has stuck with her most from the hearings, Amber Kanazbah Crotty, a commission member and Navajo Nation Council delegate, said families’ disappointment with law enforcement either communicating with them infrequently or in ways that don’t feel compassionate.
“They’re dealing with their missing relative, or there may have been violence, a homicide or a criminal element to their case, but with the lack of communication from law enforcement, it just adds on another layer of, they don’t feel that their relatives mattered,” Crotty said in an April interview.
Instead of mailing a family a piece of paper informing them their relative’s case has been closed, she said, the commission recommended “a warm hand off.”
“It’s not the U.S. attorney themselves, but at least a victim advocate to be there to answer any questions they have, and they’re then referring them or connecting them to community resources like behavioral health, mental health support groups, so they’re not feeling like this is only happening to them and nobody cares about their relatives,” Crotty said.
Improving communication
The Justice Department since 2010 has required every U.S. Attorney’s Office with tribal lands in its district to develop an operational plan for addressing public safety in Indian country.
“A trauma-informed approach both considers the emotional impact on victims and their families and is culturally sensitive,” reads the New Mexico office’s plan, last updated in 2024. “The relationship between Tribal communities and the federal government is a fraught one. [Assistant U.S. attorneys] and law enforcement need to acknowledge this history and work hard to gain the trust of Tribal members who may have reasons to distrust the federal government and law enforcement based on past experiences and long histories.”
While the office can’t share all the details of an investigation or why it made a particular decision, staff have been working to do a better job of communicating with affected families, Assistant U.S. Attorney Eliot Neal said during an interview last year. Neal was hired in 2023 as part of the Justice Department’s Missing or Murdered Indigenous Persons Regional Outreach Program.
One “challenge” the office identified in recent years, Neal said, was families not hearing from law enforcement for long periods of time and then receiving letters — like the one Colleen got — “out of the blue.”
In response, the office instituted a policy of giving families case updates in person when possible, Indian Country Crimes Section Supervisor Elisa Dimas said during last year’s interview.
“We’ve made it a real priority to understand the emotional impact that these cases have on families, to make sure that we go out and deliver this news in person, if we can, along with the victim advocate,” Dimas said. “Because even though we might not be pursuing a criminal case at our office, we know that there are still resources and support that we can provide, either through the victim advocates or community resources, to these families.”
That practice “came naturally to a lot of us” based on prior experience working with crime victims and their families, Uballez said in the February interview.
“What we did was expand the responsibility to include this more victim-centric, community-centric—you know, to build in time for people to build those relationships. And of course, if resources get drawn down there, either in personnel, or priorities elsewhere get expanded, that could change,” Uballez said, referring to Trump administration directives.
Asked if the in-person-when-possible policy will remain, Ellison, who was sworn in as New Mexico’s U.S. attorney on April 18, said in an email sent by spokesperson Tessa DuBerry that he understands “the importance of working with families of violent crimes to ensure there is justice for what they have suffered.”
“I encourage the prosecutors working with victims of violent crimes, including those in Indian Country, to work closely with these families as their cases proceed through federal court,” Ellison wrote.
‘All for Kyle’
In the spring before his death, Kyle gave his mother a packet of flower seeds.
Colleen enjoyed gardening, but she hadn’t done it in a long time, and the packet ended up in a drawer somewhere.
A few years ago, she was cleaning up around her house when she came across it.
“I just broke down. I remembered him giving that to me, and I said, ‘I’m going to make a garden.’ So I put flowers all over my front yard, and I’m starting on the back. Trees, flowers, and it’s growing,” she said. “It’s all for Kyle.”
Colleen has worked doggedly to find answers and get Kyle’s case reopened since receiving the letter in 2022.
She’s attended events, sometimes as far away as three hours south in Albuquerque, to ask for help from federal and tribal officials. She’s created posters with photos of her son and information about his death to take to rallies and gotten to know other Indigenous families with relatives who have been killed or gone missing. And she has repeatedly followed up with the investigators and filed records requests to try to learn more about their efforts.
She has her own theories about what happened to Kyle, but she worries she’ll never know definitively who killed her son or why they did it, let alone that they’ll face criminal charges.
“It’s a nightmare, and my family is not the same,” Colleen said. “And I don’t know how—you never come back from this. You don’t come back from it. You can adjust to it, but my life is different now, it’s just so different.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/nmindepthmay191-1024x763.jpeg,,,2025-05-19 09:06:50.535511

It and other waterways raged out of their banks in overnight flash flooding, only to recede with debris strewn about.
County commissioners huddled inside the courthouse, one block from a muddy rodeo ring, discussing bridge inspections and the path forward. Some washed-out areas were only accessible by four-wheel drive.
They’d put up more “road closed” signs, the commissioners said, if only people would stop stealing them. 
Ozark County — estimated population 9,090 — is used to doing without. A mere nick in the Bible Belt, it doesn’t even have a stoplight.
What it does have is a 24-bed jail with a cattle trough baptismal pool in the recreational area. 
It also has an ambitious sheriff who sees his prayers answered in a new contract with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement that could boost his $1.1 million annual budget.

“It’s a pain in the butt because this is a whole new ground that we are covering, but then, you know, when you are one of the poorest counties in the state of Missouri, I’ve got to figure out how to pay for law enforcement,” Sheriff Cass Martin told the Marshall Project – St. Louis. “And that’s not easy, especially when you can’t even get new recruits. Nobody wants to be in law enforcement. It’s dying.”
Ozark County is one of many places, big and small, that the Trump administration is depending on to pull off one of the largest mass deportations from the U.S. in recent history. An enormous ramp-up in detention capacity is underway. New contracts are being negotiated. Existing contracts with the federal government are being expanded. In the ICE contract’s infancy, Ozark County is already reaping the benefits by raising wages and hiring for new positions in law enforcement.
As of early May, tracking reports show ICE contracting with or operating 147 public and private detention facilities, including three in Missouri. That’s up from 107 facilities reported in the final days of the Biden administration. On Feb. 24, Martin signed a contract for Ozark County, which isn’t yet on the list.
ICE plans to spend $45 billion on new contracts to hold and transport detainees and provide detainee services, according to a federal request for proposals. Counties like Ozark are getting a taste in federal dollars of what that expansion means. 
Sheriffs say the feds pay well, yet the detention and transportation contracts come with much more scrutiny and oversight than typical jail work, especially in Missouri, which doesn’t have statewide jail standards. 
Still, ICE reported that eight detainees had died nationally while in custody this year, as of May 5, including one death in a rural Missouri jail that the local coroner ruled a suicide. In 2024, ICE reported 11 deaths.
Some groups that advocate for ICE detainees are concerned that people from all over the world are increasingly being held in communities without well-established legal watchdogs and medical services.
Contracting with local jails “is the easiest way to get a (detention) facility up and running without any of the risk to the federal government,” said Romelia Graefrath, co-executive director of Mariposa Legal, a nonprofit in Indianapolis that fights for immigrant rights. “The end result is people get hurt, and then that is a huge liability for these communities that are already suffering.”
 ICE detention

Martin said he applied for an ICE contract under the Biden administration when his department faced a budget crisis from falling revenue.
“We were really hurting,” he said. “We were basically praying that next month will be better.” The ICE application lay dormant until Trump was elected, he said. 
“The day after the inauguration, a federal inspector showed up here at the jail wanting to look at everything throughout the facility,” he said.
The negotiated ICE contract will breathe new life into his department at a rate of $110 a night per detainee and $1.10 per mile when transporting detainees, Martin said. 
He said Ozark County was still working out medical care so it could be cleared to hold detainees longer than overnight. Meanwhile, it has three transport vans out on the road, sometimes driving hundreds of miles per day.
He said they’ve made 525-mile runs from Ozark County to the federal building in St. Louis, down to the Greene County Jail in southwest Missouri, then back home. They’ve picked up detainees 325 miles away in Oklahoma and taken them to the tarmac at Kansas City International Airport. Sometimes detainees spend the night in the Ozark County Jail, on the way to Little Rock, Arkansas, for example, which is about a 3½-hour drive. 
“We’ll feed them, we’ll house them, we’ll take care of them, and then the next morning they’ll go back out,” Martin said. “We are just kind of a spot in the road.”
Because of the ICE contract, Martin said, he’s been able to attract more jail staff and raise the pay from about $13 to $18 an hour. In addition to mileage, he said ICE pays $18.50 an hour for drivers transporting detainees, as well as time and a half for overtime.
Martin plucked one new employee who speaks Spanish from a local real estate office. She went through a short training program to be a transport officer. 
“It definitely enlightened her a little bit,” Martin said. “They are able to talk to her and tell her if something is going on.”
The staffing bump was reflected in the public payroll. 
In February, the county paid five jail employees a total of $12,900 in earnings, which came to an average of $2,580 each. By March, it had 14 employees earning $54,193, including about $10,500 in overtime, or an average of $3,871 each. 
“We’d like to add another pod to the jail and at some point help pay livable wages,” said Brian Wise, the county clerk. “Around here, local law enforcement doesn’t have tons of money. Without extra revenue, they can’t function.”
It’s hard to gauge what local residents think. Just one attended a recent county commissioner meeting. Two years’ worth of meeting minutes didn’t mention the ICE contract in detail. Wise said he wanted to wait until federal money started coming in before listing projected revenue in the county’s $7 million annual budget.   
Other elected local officials also see the contract as a boon.  
“It’s going to work out to be a great thing for us,” Ozark County Presiding Commissioner Terry Newton said.
 Death in a Missouri jail

While cash-strapped jails see opportunity in ICE contracts, Brayan Garzón, a former street vendor in Bogotá, Colombia, saw opportunity in the United States. 
He left in 2023 and crossed the U.S. border into southern California. Garzón was then detained for three months before settling in St. Louis, where he held various odd jobs doing roofing and food deliveries, his family said.
On May 27, 2024, Garzón was arrested for shoplifting in Missouri. Two weeks later, an immigration judge in San Diego, at a hearing Garzón wasn’t present for, ordered him removed from the country, ICE officials said.
In late March, St. Louis police arrested Garzón on a charge of using a stolen credit card at a smoke shop. He was arrested along with a friend from Colombia who was accused of stealing credit cards, a watch and more than $25,000 in jewelry while cleaning hotel rooms for a temp agency, according to court records. ICE took both into custody. 
Garzón ended up being held 100 miles southwest of St. Louis in the Phelps County Jail. On March 27, a medical intake screening of Garzón at the jail noted that he had anxiety and a history of a heart murmur. He denied having suicidal thoughts. A routine mental health referral was made, according to an ICE report.
Two days later, Garzón had severe head pain, body aches and sweating. A tuberculosis test came back positive. He was diagnosed with COVID-19 at a local hospital’s emergency room after being taken there by the jail staff. He was returned to the jail a day later, on March 30, with normal vitals. But a few days later, he was treated for vomiting. His mental health appointment was rescheduled because of “mental health clinic time and staff” and his COVID-19 diagnosis.
Around 9:50 p.m. on April 7, Garzón was found near death in his cell with a blanket wrapped around his neck. He was pronounced dead the following day, after being flown to a hospital in the St. Louis area for a higher level of care, ICE said in its report. 
Garzón was in his cell alone prior to his suicide, according to Phelps County Coroner Ernie Coverdell. Garzón had given a letter to his jailers written in Spanish, requesting to speak to his mother by telephone. Coverdell said surveillance footage showed Garzón praying before entering a bottom bunk, hidden by a draped blanket. When a jailer found him unresponsive about 20 minutes later, Coverdell said Garzón looked like he was asleep, but with bedding around his neck.
Emergency responders and doctors kept his heart beating for several days after he was declared clinically dead, Coverdell said. With his family’s permission, Garzón’s heart and several organs were donated to people in need. 
“He saved more than one life,” Coverdell said. 
Garzón, one of six siblings, was 27. 
His mother, Adriana, said in Spanish that she’d spoken to her son several times by phone from the jail. He’d complained about the food and being sick, but she was blindsided by his suicide.
“My son had more will to live than to die,” she said. “He was a very happy person.”  
She struggled to comprehend how he fell through the cracks of a country rich in resources and modern technology. 
“How is it possible that my son could do this?” she said. “He’s a human being. They should have been watching.”
The Phelps County Jail has a long history of holding detainees for the federal government. In an effort to hold more, the facility just underwent a $21 million expansion that doubled the size of the jail to 400 beds.
A few weeks prior to Garzón’s arrival, Phelps County Sheriff Michael Kirn’s department was struggling to pay January and February invoices “due to lack of funds,” according to county commission meeting minutes. 
Kirn told commissioners that it was imperative to get the ICE agreement in place because he expected it to generate an additional $3.6 million a year on top of the sheriff’s typical budget of $5.5 million.
Kirn declined to comment about the death because it was under investigation by state and federal authorities. He said no policies or procedures have been changed or added since Garzón’s death. 
The county’s existing contract with the U.S. Marshals — who track down dangerous fugitives and enforce federal law — was expanded to include ICE detainees, Kirn said. He declined to share the rate. 
“The feds are a little funny about stuff, and I don’t want to cause ripples,” he said.
He said they were hovering at about 300 out of 400 beds filled, half of them with federal detainees.
“We had to slow down,” he said. “It’s not the amount of people; it’s the paperwork.” 
ICE officials didn’t respond to a request for comment. An April press release about Garzón’s death stated that the agency “remains committed to ensuring that all those in its custody reside in safe, secure and humane environments.”
 Brayan Garzón

Garzón’s death seemed to weigh on Martin, the sheriff in Ozark County. 
“He was so young,” Martin said. 
He wondered if there were any red flags leading up to the incident. And how did ICE respond?
Martin said if a jail resident is in a mental crisis in Ozark County, they rush them to the hospital for an emergency hold. That hadn’t been an issue with any of the ICE detainees they’d been transporting, he said.
“These guys are a little bit easier to deal with than our local inmates on most points,” he said. “They are, ‘Thank you, thank you for this. Thank you for food.’ They are appreciative of what we’ve got.” 
Martin said he doesn’t know all the ins and outs of why ICE detainees are in custody, but he wants to do a professional job.
“It’s not like going to the stockyard up here and watching cattle run through the chute. They are human beings,” Martin said. “My thing is, I promise that I can give them a safe place to put their head at night. I will feed them, and I will make sure that they are taken care of.
