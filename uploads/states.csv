Matt Morawski, director of communications and external affairs for the Wayne County Airport Authority, confirmed on Tuesday that the TSA was playing the video on monitors in the space it leases at Detroit Metro Airport.
On Wednesday, the airport authority issued a statement noting that it had asked the TSA to stop playing the video. The airport authority reiterated that it does not control the checkpoint monitors within TSA-leased airport space, and that the administration did not request permission to play the message. 
The airport is also displaying signs at the entrances of TSA checkpoints that read: “The views expressed in this TSA controlled video do not represent the views of the Wayne County Airport Authority. The Wayne county airport authority does not engage in partisan politics. Thank You.”

In the video, Noem says that Democrats in government have refused to fund the federal government, noting that most TSA employees are working without pay.
“We will continue to do all that we can to avoid delays that will impact your travel,” Noem said. “And our hope is that Democrats will soon recognize the importance of opening the government.”
When asked about the Wayne County Airport Authority’s request via email, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security – which oversees the TSA – responded with a statement from Assistant Secretary For Public Affairs Tricia McLaughlin.

“It is TSA’s top priority to ensure that travelers have the most safe, pleasant and efficient airport experience possible,” McLaughlin said. “However, Democrats in Congress refuse to fund the federal government, and because of this, most of our TSA employees are working without pay. While this creates challenges for our people, our security operations remain largely unimpacted at this time.”
McLaughlin added: “It’s unfortunate our workforce has been put in this position due to political gamesmanship. Our hope is that Democrats will soon recognize the importance of opening the government.”
On Monday, spokespeople for Gerald R. Ford International Airport Authority and Flint Bishop International Airport confirmed they were not playing the video.
On Thursday, Heidi Groenboom, communications and events associate for the Gerald R. Ford International Airport Authority, also said that the digital screens owned by the airport authority are designated for static content offering travel information and helping travelers find their way.
Kasey Posa, director of marketing and public relations for Flint Bishop International airport, said the airport is not showcasing the video on any monitors owned or operated by the Bishop International Airport Authority.

However, Posa also said that the TSA is an independent federal agency that  manages security in leased space within airports. For this reason, the TSA has its own internal communications system and has the discretion to air federally distributed content independent of the Airport Authority.
“Because the message in the referenced video violates [Bishop International Airport Authority’s] Airport Rules and Regulations, we have requested that TSA stop playing the video,” Posa said. 
Since the shutdown began, the Trump Administration has taken to blasting Democrats through various official channels, displaying messages on several federal agencies’ websites blaming Democrats for the shutdown
However, Democrats have pushed back, noting that Republicans, as the party in control of the White House and both chambers of Congress, the government shutdown is the GOP’s crisis to own. 
The Hatch Act bars federal employees from engaging in partisan political activities while on duty, and the federal government is now facing several legal challenges due to its shutdown messaging. 
Consumer advocacy watchdog Public Citizen filed legal challenges against nine government agencies, while the Center for Biological Diversity filed complaints against the U.S. Forest Service and the Department of Health and Human Services.
Democracy Defenders Fund, a nonpartisan organization focused on protecting democracy and defending the rule of law, filed two letters with the Government Accountability Office calling for an investigation into whether the U.S. Departments of Housing and Urban Development, Treasury, Agriculture, Justice, State, and Health and Human Services violated the Anti-Deficiency Act, as well as other bans against using federal funds for political propaganda.

“My mantra is, ‘trying to get as comfortable as I can with discomfort’ — because that’s a constant right now,” said Sarah Clark, Gov. Scott’s secretary of administration, on Thursday.

MONTPELIER — State fiscal leaders said Thursday they believe Vermont has the money to keep key federally-backed programs running, at least for now, if funding for those programs lapses because of the federal government shutdown. But they’re worried the feds might not repay the state after the fact — something that could make it harder to pay for other programs in the future.
Historically, states are reimbursed for costs incurred during a shutdown once Congress reaches a new spending deal. But President Donald Trump’s pattern since he won a second term of slashing previously-promised federal funding — and his administration’s recent targeting of money for Democratic-led states — has leaders in Vermont and other states concerned about what will happen after the impasse ends.
The Vermont Legislature’s Joint Fiscal Committee, which oversees state spending when lawmakers aren’t in session, met on Thursday, which was the 16th day of the government shutdown. Lawmakers heard from leaders in Gov. Phil Scott’s administration, Vermont’s three congressional offices and the state treasurer’s office about the impacts of the stalemate so far.
Rebecca Ellis, state director for U.S. Sen. Peter Welch, D-Vt., told the committee the shutdown would continue at least through the weekend, and a resolution in the near term seemed unlikely.
State leaders said federal funding is in hand to operate Vermont’s Medicaid program through the end of the year, and to operate its Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children, or WIC, into at least early December. 
Their more pressing concern, as of Thursday, was about whether the federal government would provide funding for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, or LIHEAP, which helps many households afford fuel to heat their homes. The state was also worried Thursday whether federal funding would be available starting next month for federal nutritional benefits, known in Vermont as 3SquaresVT, though officials emphasized that could change in the coming days or weeks.
“My mantra is, ‘trying to get as comfortable as I can with discomfort’ — because that’s a constant right now,” said Sarah Clark, Scott’s secretary of administration, to the committee. 
According to Mike Pieciak, the state treasurer, as of Thursday, Vermont could be facing some $30 million to $50 million in funding that the feds may not reimburse. 
That’s “very different” from the last federal government shutdown, which spanned 35 days between December 2018 and January 2019, Clark said, when the person with her job at that point would have been “much more confident that we were going to get reimbursed.” 
“So, how do we navigate that uncertainty?” she continued. “I don’t think anybody has a playbook.”
Pieciak estimated that the state has at least $700 million it could draw on to plug gaps caused by lapses in federal funding — enough to cover his office’s estimates. But the challenge, he and other leaders said, is that would put Vermont in a more precarious financial position heading into what is already expected to be a difficult state budget-building process due to increasing costs and other cuts to federal revenue.
Legislative leaders have started warning their colleagues that some existing state programs could need to be scaled back or cut during the upcoming legislative session, which starts in January.
Thursday’s discussion also comes as the Trump administration has threatened to withhold back pay from tens of thousands of federal workers who are furloughed during the shutdown after it ends — despite a 2019 law requiring payment, which Trump signed that year.
“It’s difficult dealing with an unreliable — but very important — partner in the federal government,” said Rep. Charlie Kimbell, D-Woodstock, during the meeting. “We can’t quite secede from the Union, though.”

On Wednesday, 20 attorneys general plus two governors sued the Trump EPA for canceling a national initiative to promote solar energy.

Vermont joined a lawsuit directed at the Trump administration on Wednesday for abruptly cutting $7 billion in federal funding for nationwide solar energy projects.
The complaint joins together a coalition of 20 states from Arizona to Maine, including Vermont Attorney General Charity Clark. The complaint, filed in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims, targets the Environmental Protection Agency’s cancellation of the Solar for All program under EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin.
The state was first notified that their grant would be terminated in a letter from the agency on Aug. 7. The next day, Zeldin posted a video that said his agency “no longer has the authority to administer the program or the appropriated funds to keep this boondoggle alive.” He called Solar for All a “grift,” with 15% of programmatic costs going toward “middle men taking their own cut.”
A week later, on Aug. 13, the EPA suspended Vermont’s account, which included more than $62 million in federal funds. By Sept. 19, the account was “liquidated,” and more than 90% of the funds were drained, according to the attorney general’s office.
The program was designed to pass on solar benefits to more than 900,000 households in low-income and disadvantaged communities, according to the Environmental Protection Agency, the federal office that administered the grant to 49 states and six tribes, among others.
“In keeping with a longstanding practice, EPA does not comment on pending litigation,” the agency’s press office said in an email Thursday.
The White House declined to comment.
The program was part of the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, $27 billion that aimed to reduce carbon emissions and was repealed under President Donald Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill on July 4. The Solar for All page on the Environmental Protection Agency’s website has since been replaced with a quote from Zeldin that claims cutting federal programs would reduce “frivolous” spending “in the name of ‘climate equity.’”
Vermont’s congressional delegation championed the initiative, including U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., who introduced Solar for All into the Inflation Reduction Act. The 2022 act, under the Biden administration, channeled hundreds of billions of dollars toward the clean energy transition. Much of those programs have since been defunded by the Trump administration.
“I introduced the Solar for All program to slash electric bills for working families by up to 80% — putting money back in the pockets of ordinary Americans, not fossil fuel billionaires,” Sanders said in the attorney general’s Thursday press release. “Donald Trump wants to illegally kill this program to protect the obscene profits of his friends in the oil and gas industry.”
Last year, Vermont received $62.5 million from the federal program through the Vermont Department of Public Service. Funds were temporarily frozen in February, but in May, Vermont had allocated more than $22 million of the state’s total grant to help install solar panels on low-income housing through the Vermont Housing Finance Agency, a quasi-public entity that acts like a bank for affordable housing.

At that point, the state had spent roughly $150,000 on staffing that was billed to the agency on a month-by-month reimbursement basis, Melissa Bailey, director of the state energy office within the Vermont Department of Public Service, previously said.
Kerrick Johnson, the department’s commissioner, said he hoped the funding for the program could be restored.
“Thousands of Vermonters stand to benefit if we can get this done,” Johnson wrote in an email.
The state expected to serve about 8,300 low-income households, reduce electric bills by at least 20% and create about 300 new jobs, according to the release.
In May, Sanders said that Trump’s budget bill that canceled the program could not legally rescind the funds. 
“Vermont has an agreement with the EPA for this money, and the Trump Administration cannot go back on this deal,” Clark said in the release.

Brad Little and U.S. Senator for Idaho Jim Risch were caught by surprise Friday when U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth announced a deal with Qatar for a training facility at Mountain Home Air Force Base, records show. 
Risch also serves as chairman of the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee.
The deal would involve new permanent training facilities for Qatari troops to fly F-15QA aircraft at the base.
A text message from Risch’s Chief of Staff Ryan White to Little’s Chief of Staff Zach Hauge included a post about the announcement and said, “this was news to us,” to which Hague responded, “same,” according to public records obtained by the Idaho Capital Sun.  
A spokesperson for the governor’s office confirmed Thursday in an email that Little’s office was not made aware of the announcement beforehand. 
Hague wrote that “Brass at (Mountain Home Air Force Base) was also unaware.” A spokesperson for the Mountain Home base could not immediately be reached for comment. 
When Hague asked via text message if Risch’s office planned to respond, White said, “My boss is in the air, I’d prefer not.” 
Risch’s office did not respond to multiple comment requests by the Sun made between the announcement Friday and Wednesday. He told the Spokesman-Review in a statement late Tuesday that the move “is in line with other preexisting U.S. military agreements with important allies like Singapore, which has been hosted at the base for years.” 
Little’s office also did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the facility announcement until Wednesday, when his office provided a statement from Little that said, “Secretary (Pete) Hegseth confirmed that Qatar is not building a military base in Idaho. I am in communication with Idaho’s congressional delegation and the Trump administration to ensure Idahoans’ concerns are raised. It is critical we work with the administration to ensure this agreement is done in a way that protects Idahoans’ interests as further details are finalized.”
 U.S. Department of Defense sent talking points to Idaho military officials after announcement

On Friday afternoon, a public affairs officer for the Air Force’s 366th Fighter Wing, which is housed at the Mountain Home base, sent several Air Force officials talking points from the U.S. Department of Defense — which President Donald Trump through an executive order has said is now called the “Department of War.” The name change requires congressional approval to become permanent.  
“The Department of War is proud of our military partnership w/ Qatar, including today’s announcement on cooperation around F-15QAaircraft,” the email said. “While we are cooperating — to be clear — Qatar will not have their own base in the United States, or anything like a base. Today we simply announced a partnership — on a U.S. controlled base only — much like we have with  many other countries.” 
The talking points include answers to potential questions about the deal, such as about construction, training and costs. 
If concerns about costs were raised, the talking point included, “We are actively working with our Qatari partners to finalize the cost associated with facilities construction to support the Qatari F-15 fleet at Mountain Home Air Force Base, with the goal of concluding these details over the coming weeks.” 
The email also noted the underlying case cleared congressional review in April and included a link to the 2022 environmental impact statement regarding the proposed facility at the Mountain Home base. Work began on the assessment in 2020, the Associated Press reported. 
The agreement to sell the fighter jets to Qatar was announced in 2017, the AP reported. 
 Risch’s office later provided governor’s office with additional talking points

Risch’s Press Secretary Madison Hardy on Wednesday morning emailed Little’s communication staff with background information and talking points regarding the facility. 
The email includes clarification that Qatar would not build a military base in Idaho and that “Military equipment sales and training agreements with allied foreign countries are standard practice under any administration.” 
Hardy wrote that, “Senator Risch and the entire Idaho Congressional Delegation are in communication with the Trump administration to ensure the proper safeguards are in place and that the concerns of Idahoans, which they share, are addressed.” 
The email also noted that Mountain Home’s base already hosts troops from Singapore to train them to use F-15s, and that the Mountain Home base will retain full control and ownership of the facilities.

(Sue Dorfman for Votebeat)
As the 2025 municipal election approaches, Pennsylvanians have until 5 p.m. Monday to register to vote.
“For the many eligible Pennsylvanians who have yet to register to vote, it’s not too late to do so,” Pennsylvania Secretary of the Commonwealth Al Schmidt said last week. “I encourage any eligible Pennsylvanian who is not registered to visit vote.pa.gov, register, and avoid missing out on the opportunity to have their voices heard in this important election.”
What big races are on the ballot?
There are a few races with statewide implications on the ballot this November.
Garnering the most attention are the retention races of Pennsylvania Supreme Court Justices Christine Donohue, Kevin Dougherty and David Wecht. Those three were elected to a 10-year term as Democrats in 2015.
Under the Pennsylvania Constitution judges run for election in partisan competitive partisan races. They don’t have to run for reelection against challengers, but rather face voters in a “yes” or “no” referendum on whether they should be retained for subsequent terms.
There are also vacancies on the state’s Superior and Commonwealth courts.
Democrat Stella Tsai, a Philadelphia Court of Common Pleas judge, is facing Republican Matt Wolford, an Erie-based environmental attorney, in the race to fill a vacancy on the Pennsylvania Commonwealth Court.
Vying for an open seat on the state’s Superior Court are Brandon Neuman, a Democrat who serves as Washington County Court of Common Pleas judge; Maria Battista, a Republican who is the president of a consulting firm, and Daniel Wassmer, an attorney who is running under the Liberal Party banner.
Local elections are also taking place up and down the ballot across the commonwealth, including the race for Philadelphia district attorney, and the mayor of several of the state’s biggest cities including Pittsburgh, Allentown, and Scranton.
Republicans continue to narrow voter registration gap in Pennsylvania
Continuing the trend of the past few years, Democrats will likely enter this upcoming election with a more narrow voter registration advantage than the previous election.
According to data from Pennsylvania Department of State (DOS), as of Oct. 13, there are 167,715 more registered Democrats than Republicans in Pennsylvania.
During the 2025 primary election a few months ago, Democrats held a 178,070 voter registration advantage. For the 2024 general election, there were 286,283 more registered Democrats than Republicans in the state. In Nov. 2023, the last time Pennsylvania voters had a decision to make for a statewide judicial election, there were 446,566 more voters registered with the Democratic Party over the Republican Party. 
Who can vote?
According to DOS, the requirements to vote include being a U.S. citizen and Pennsylvania resident for at least 30 days before the election and being at least 18 years old on the day of the election.
Schmidt notes that using the Online Voter Registration (OVR) system is a “fast and convenient” way to register to vote, although it is not the only way eligible voters can register to vote by mail or apply in person.
Those interested can also register to vote at the following locations: 

a county voter registration office,  
county assistance offices,  
Women, Infants & Children (WIC) program offices, 
Armed Forces recruitment centers, 
county clerk of orphans’ courts or marriage license offices, 
area agencies on aging, 
county mental health and intellectual disabilities offices, 
student disability services offices of the State System of Higher Education, 
offices of special education in high schools, 
Americans with Disabilities Act-mandated complementary paratransit providers, and
Department of Transportation (PennDOT) driver and photo license centers.

Although Oct. 20 is the final day to register to vote for the 2025 election in Pennsylvania, voters have until Oct. 28 to apply for a mail ballot. Those ballots must be received by the county election offices by 8 p.m. on Election Day, according to the DOS.

Free.,Trump critic and former aide John Bolton indicted for mishandling classified documents,Jacob Fischler,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-critic-and-former-aide-john-bolton-indicted-mishandling-classified-documents,,"A federal grand jury indicted former National Security Advisor John Bolton, a one-time staffer to President Donald Trump who turned publicly against the president by the end of his first term, on charges he mishandled classified information.The 18-count indictment in district court in Maryland accuses Bolton of wrongfully storing and sharing classified documents.“Bolton abused his position as National Security Advisor by sharing more than a thousand pages of information about his day-to-day activities as the National Security Advisor—including information relating to the national defense which was classified up to the TOP SECRET/SCI level—with two unauthorized individuals,” the indictment reads.Both unauthorized individuals were related to Bolton. One also lived, as Bolton does, in Montgomery County, Maryland.According to the indictment, Bolton would write near-daily “diary-like” emails to the pair from a commercial email account, hosted on AOL and Google, describing his day-to-day activities as national security advisor, apparently taking them from private notes and rewriting them into a word processor, the indictment said.The communications contained classified information that the pair was not authorized to receive, and was transmitted through web services that were not authorized to host them, according to the indictment.And the use of a commercial email server increased the chances of a cyber attack, which eventually happened in July 2021.A hacker believed to be associated with the government of Iran hacked Bolton’s private email, the indictment said.“A representative for Bolton notified the U.S. Government of the hack in or about July 2021, but did not tell the U.S. Government that the account contained national defense information, including classified information,” the indictment said.Raid on Bolton home in MarylandFBI agents raided Bolton’s home earlier this year, leading to speculation that charges were coming.According to the indictment, Bolton had printed out and stored much of the correspondence he had sent to relatives while in the White House.The documents Bolton is accused of sharing were redacted from in the indictment. His misconduct is alleged from early in his time as national security advisor in April 2018 to August 2025.After campaigning against “lawfare” — the targeting of political opponents through the legal system — Trump has encouraged prosecutions of several rivals, including Bolton. Trump’s Justice Department has also won indictments against former FBI Director James Comey and New York Attorney General Leticia James. Wednesday, Trump called for investigations into U.S. Sen. Adam Schiff, a Democrat from California, and former DOJ special prosecutor Jack Smith.In a Thursday statement, U.S. Justice Department officials sought to rebut any accusations the investigation was politically charged.“There is one tier of justice for all Americans,” said Attorney General Pamela Bondi. “Anyone who abuses a position of power and jeopardizes our national security will be held accountable. No one is above the law.” FBI Director Kash Patel said the indictment was secured through “meticulous work from dedicated career professionals at the FBI who followed the facts without fear or favor. Weaponization of justice will not be tolerated, and this FBI will stop at nothing to bring to justice anyone who threatens our national security.”",,,,2025-10-16 19:04:52.993693

(Photo by Robin Opsahl/Iowa Capital Dispatch)The Iowa Revenue Estimating Conference on Thursday lowered its estimates for the state’s tax revenue in fiscal year 2026 by $375 million compared to predictions from March of this year.
The panel, chaired by Iowa Department of Management Director Kraig Paulsen, made changes to the revenue estimates in light of recent economic shifts and tax policy changes like the federal “One Big Beautiful Bill Act.” The nonpartisan Legislative Services Agency reported the state’s revenue in fiscal year 2025 was $198 million below the panel’s March forecast because of the impact of federal tax law changes.
Paulsen said the new REC estimates account for both the reduced state revenue due to federal tax policies, the impacts of the state’s 2024 acceleration of previously approved income tax cuts, as well as economic factors like rising unemployment rates and China’s move to import soybeans from South American countries instead of U.S. producers.

The state revenue is forecast to decline by 9% in FY 2026, more than the March forecast’s 4.8% estimated decrease. This lowers the predicted state revenue from $8.5 billion in the current fiscal year to a projected $8.1 billion.
Iowa lawmakers and Gov. Kim Reynolds approved a $9.4 billion budget this year, meaning the new projections have increased the expected gap between the state’s income and spending to $1.3 billion. Republican leaders have repeatedly said they were planning to take money from the Taxpayer Relief Fund and the state surplus to finance income tax cuts. Paulsen said the state has roughly $6 billion in the Taxpayer Relief Fund and other reserves that will be used to weather expected revenue decreases.
Paulsen said GOP leadership sees the state revenue change as allowing Iowans to keep more money through collecting less in income taxes.
“This reduction in revenue also does not mean the state is in a poor economic condition, but that revenue previously being collected by the state, once again, is being left in the pockets of hardworking Iowans,” Paulsen said. “Obviously, we are not in a period of state’s most robust growth, but we do continue to see to see growth.”
But Democratic state leaders said the latest REC figures show Republican budgeting practices will lead to financial struggles for the state government in future years. Sen. Janet Petersen, D-Des Moines, criticized GOP leaders for drawing from one-time funding through the state’s reserves for initiatives like the income tax cuts and Education Savings Account program, providing public funding for private school tuition and associated costs, while not providing more funding for public education.
“Statehouse Republicans created a billion-dollar budget deficit with their corporate tax cuts and private school vouchers,” Petersen said in a news conference. “This isn’t just a dip in revenues. This is a historic drop. The majority’s plan is to bleed our reserves dry to pay for their giveaways. The billion-dollar hole they created in the state budget is ongoing, but our reserve funds aren’t.”
Paulsen and the two other members of the panel said though they are predicting further drops in revenue in FY 2026 during a time when the state is already drawing on reserve funds, they believe Iowa is still in a strong financial position entering FY 2027 and future years.
Paulsen said he still believes revenue will rebound in future years, though Jennifer Acton, right, director of the LSA Fiscal Services division, said this prediction may be sidetracked if an economic recession occurs.
“Since the largest impact to the state income tax rate will materialize in FY 2026, we would anticipate seeing average general fund revenues begin to stabilize and increase starting in FY 2027, absent an economic downturn,” Acton said.
Paulsen said “based on what we know today,” the REC was not anticipating a recession on the horizon, but said he believes the state is in a sound fiscal place for fiscal years 2026 and 2027.
“Is this where we want to be? Is the most comfortable spot? No,” Paulsen told reporters. “But we’re in a really good spot, and … the state of Iowa is in a good financial condition.”
Rep. Gary Mohr, R-Bettendorf, who chairs the House Appropriations Committee, said lawmakers had “intentionally” chosen to allow the state budget to exceed state revenues by passing the income tax cuts “because Iowans were desperate for immediate relief from former President Biden’s failed economic policies” and because the state had reserves to make up for the drop.
“Despite a mixed economic picture locally and nationally, Iowa remains in a strong financial position,” Mohr said in a statement. “We have over $6 billion in cash on hand, and our reserve funds are at their statutory maximums. Iowa is in a better position than most states to handle economic uncertainties due to Iowa Republicans’ responsible budgeting over the past decade.”
The governor also released a statement saying Iowa was in a “strong financial position,” and that the changes to projected revenues were largely because of the federal budget reconciliation bill.
“Iowa’s strong fiscal health is due to a strong commitment to fiscal conservatism by my administration and legislative leadership, and we will continue to be good stewards of taxpayer dollars,” Reynolds said.
The REC meets again in December, when it will make the official revenue estimate to be used in the 2026 legislative session.

Clay Higgins is not amused. Donning a pair of tinted glasses, a Bluetooth earpiece and an “Israel Defense Forces” baseball hat, the congressman stands on a strip of grass next to the Coulee Ile des Cannes detention ponds near Judice, recording one of his signature selfie-style videos.
The subject of his ire that day? The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.
“The Corps of Engineers no longer serves our republic,” Higgins tells his followers, before launching a fusillade of criticism at the Corps’ work over the past two decades.
Higgins has reason to be mad. Four years ago, in 2021, he secured a major win for those who see dredging the Vermilion River as the answer to Lafayette’s flooding woes. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers had $50 million in its work plan to dredge the river. To date, Higgins laments, none of that money has been spent on dredging.
Dredging the Vermilion has been a focus of some Lafayette residents when it comes to flood prevention over the past decade. And to date, the cause hasn’t led to much action, apart from some river cleanup and maintenance by Lafayette Consolidated Government during the Josh Guillory administration.

Residents like Dave Dixon, a retired engineer who co-founded and now serves as president of the board of Dredge the Vermilion, a nonprofit founded in response to the 2016 floods that saw the river breach its banks and flood adjacent homes. Some 5,000 total homes were flooded during the historic event.
The flooding, Dixon and others say, can in part be attributed to a lack of river maintenance since the 1950s, pointing to limited flooding in the latter half of the past century that has worsened over time. The Corps has not dredged the Vermilion River in 20 years, with sections in the city averaging three to four feet in depth.
“The river can’t handle the volume of water we’re trying to send to the river right now,” Dixon told the Lafayette City Council in July, part of a refrain he has been echoing in meetings across the state. He often likens the river to a “heart patient” with clogged arteries.
But scientists and the Corps have questioned whether dredging the river would make a significant impact on flood risk across the city and parish.
“A watershed-centered approach, instead of a riverine-centered approach, is needed for flood management,” concluded a 2021 study of river dredging co-authored by UL professor Emad Habib, and based on models of the river and watershed, which would encompass all areas from and in which water collects during storm events.
The Corps itself determined a full-scale dredging of the river from Vermilion Bay would be too costly and do too little justify, an analysis that at one time spurred Higgins to determine dredging was not “the silver bullet that we thought it would be.”
The studies align much more with what Lafayette flood maps tell the naked eye.

The maps show that the high-risk areas around the river are very narrow, while vast flood zones in the city and parish have little direct relationship to the river.
In Lafayette’s Downtown, several businesses have flooded four times since 2019 alone; the flooding is often already in storefronts before the river’s flood stage rises. The city is pitching a plan to divert floodwater from where it overflows on Lee Avenue to under Johnston Street, but that project is not slated to start until late 2026.
Development throughout Lafayette Parish has also contributed to the increased runoff threatening to overwhelm even a deeper Vermilion, Habib’s study points out. Between 2001 and 2021, in Lafayette Parish, nearly 50% of housing development occurred in areas within the 500-year floodplain.

While the river does influence flood risk in the watershed, it’s not the primary cause of flooding in Lafayette Parish. But many of the city’s most valuable private properties are located along the river, contributing heavily towards the $200 million in flood insurance claims across the parish from the 2016 floods.
Even some river residents and dredging advocates have come to the conclusion that dredging alone won’t be the answer to Lafayette’s flooding problems.
“The name of the organization is Dredge the Vermilion, and that is a very small part of the solution,” says Jeremiah Supple, a river resident and member of the advocacy group.
Instead, Supple points out, collective decision-making and improved communication among municipalities would likely provide for more effective flood mitigation. The group even went as far as to draw up a plan for the entire watershed.
“What I found interesting is all the parishes that are involved in the watershed all impact each other, and everything one parish does impacts the other, even though they all act independently of one another,” Supple says.
The conclusion that dredging the Vermilion will only be a small part of the solution raises questions about whether spending $50 million in federal dollars on it is worth pursuing, given the scope of the problem across the parish.
Higgins seems to think so. In social media and Congress, the representative has derided the Corps for its inaction and even called for it to be dissolved in response, calling out its “thick bureaucracy” as standing in the way of “protecting lives and property.”
The Corps told The Current its availability to engage with media was limited due to the federal government’s shutdown, but said it was currently working with nonfederal partners to identify and acquire dredge material disposal sites, an effort that includes obtaining environmental clearances.
“Our current target to advance dredging operations is the 2026 fiscal year,” a spokesperson for the Corps told The Current in an email. The project, the spokesperson noted, is authorized for both navigation and flood risk management purposes.
Meanwhile, Higgins has called for the agency’s dissolution on both social media and the U.S. House of Representatives floor. He’s made a broader case for shuttering federal agencies, and transferring their authorities and obligations over functions like emergency response and water management to state governments.
“These projects should be 100% turned over to the sovereign States and local government partners,” he wrote on X earlier this month. “I intend to force this debate into the House of We the People, and to the attention of our President.”",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/TG8_9961-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-10-16 19:04:52.993693

(Photo: Jesse Pluim/U.S. Bureau of Land Management)Environmental groups are preparing to sue the federal government for approving a mining exploration project near the Ash Meadows National Wildlife Refuge, a desert wetland that supports a trove of endangered and threatened species found nowhere else in the world.
On Thursday, attorneys for the Center for Biological Diversity and the Amargosa Conservancy filed a formal notice of intent to sue the Bureau of Land Management over the project, accusing the agency of violating the Endangered Species Act.
In July, the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) greenlit a proposal by the St. Cloud Mining Company to drill dozens of boreholes in an area of critical environmental concern just north of the Ash Meadows National Wildlife Refuge in the company’s search for clinoptilolite – a clay-like mineral used in water filtration, odor control, and soil conditioner.
Despite the project’s location, federal land managers concluded the project would have “no significant impact” on the environment and did not require a more in-depth environmental analysis before being approved.
Under the proposed plan, the mining company would drill as many as 43 boreholes up to 200 feet deep across less than one acre of public land adjacent to the company’s existing mine located about one mile south of the Nevada state line in Inyo, California.
St. Cloud Mining, who’s existing mine was approved in 1987, did not respond to a request for comment.
In the notice, the conservation groups say federal land managers violated the Endangered Species Act by approving the project without consulting the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, who are responsible for ensuring developments don’t jeopardize the survival of listed endangered or threatened species or damage their designated critical habitat.
Conservation groups say the mining exploration project could potentially harm several federally listed endangered and threatened plants that rely on groundwater-fed springs in the area, including the Amargosa niterwort, the Ashe Meadows gumplant, and the spring-loving centaury.
All three plants are also listed as “fully protected species declared to be threatened with extinction,” by the Nevada Division of Forestry.
“The Ash Meadows Mine threatens the groundwater that sustains dozens of imperiled species and one of the crown jewels of our public lands, Ash Meadows National Wildlife Refuge,” said Patrick Donnelly, Great Basin director at the Center for Biological Diversity. “The BLM’s job is to protect biodiversity when permitting mining exploration. It can’t dodge the Endangered Species Act and we’ll go to court to make sure it follows the law.”
Federal hydrologists acknowledged that groundwater at the site of the proposed project was relatively shallow, making it likely that boreholes drilled beyond 100 feet would hit groundwater in the area.
The BLM also acknowledged that groundwater connectivity for the area is not well understood, and it was possible the proposed project could affect groundwater downstream from the Amargosa River if drilling reached groundwater and was left unplugged.
Hitting an aquifer in the region could potentially damage groundwater dependent springs if large volumes of that groundwater burst above ground due to high pressure, creating an uncontrolled water flow that can be difficult or even impossible to stop.
Still, federal hydrologists maintained it was unlikely the project would hit a pressurized water zone, adding that the risk of creating an uncontrolled water flow was low. 
Any alterations to the flow of the “groundwater aquifer could have catastrophic consequences on the Listed Plants,” the notice says. 
“All three rely on sustained supplies of shallow groundwater keeping their habitats wetted. Any change to discharge, decrease in groundwater levels, or other perturbations in the aquifer system could dry up habitats for the Listed Plants, including adversely modifying their critical habitats,” the notice continues. 
Since the U.S. Bureau of Land Management approved the project in July – noting the project was in line with President Donald Trump’s executive order to boost domestic mineral production – several rural counties have urged the BLM to deny the project.
Nevada’s Nye County Board of Commissioners, along with the towns of Beatty and Amargosa Valley, warned that it could threaten the refuge and Nevada’s water resources.
While the proposed projects falls outside of Nye County’s jurisdictional boundaries, elected officials said they were concerned hydrologic impacts could directly affect “Nye County’s water resources and groundwater-dependent communities.”
“Exploratory drilling and mining operations occurring downstream of the refuge pose significant risks to these fragile groundwater-dependent ecosystems. Penetration of the water table during drilling could induce dewatering, disrupt spring discharge, and irreversibly damage the aquifer,” reads a September letter.
Exploration is typically the least environmentally damaging stage of mining, but even shallow drilling in the Amargosa Basin groundwater system can puncture an aquifer, which has resulted in changes to groundwater and surface water in the past.
One example is Borehole Spring in Inyo County, California. In 1967, a mining company drilled the exploratory borehole which punctured an aquifer at a depth of 350 feet. Several attempts to plug the well failed, and the leak diverted water flow from several natural springs, substantially reducing water flow. 
The exploratory drilling operations will require somewhere between 20,000 – 40,000 gallons of water for the project. According to the operation plan, the water used will be trucked in from either Longstreet Inn in Amargosa Valley or Wolfenstein Construction in Pahrump.
Mason Voehl, the executive director of the Amargosa Conservancy, said he’s confident locals can replicate the successful campaign that held back a previous attempt by a lithium company from completing an exploratory mining project in the area nearly two years ago. 
“The Amargosa Basin is one of the most sensitive hydrological systems in the country,” Voehl said. “A broad and powerful coalition rose up once to save Ash Meadows, and now we’re mobilizing again. The Amargosa is too special to take shortcuts on permitting.”",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Amargosa_River-cr-Jesse-Pluim-BLM-1024x674.jpg,,,2025-10-16 19:04:52.993693

Angie Craig raised $2.2 million in the third quarter for her Senate primary campaign against Lt. Gov. Peggy Flanagan, who brought in around $914,000 over the same period. 
Ten months out from the primary, campaign finance reports released Wednesday show Craig has nearly $3 million in cash on hand to Flanagan’s $836,000. 
To date, Craig has been her own biggest donor, transferring more than $650,000 from her House campaign to her Senate campaign. She’s also received more than $100,000 from Majority Fund, a political action committee affiliated with Majority Democrats, a group of centrists aiming to remake the party’s image in the wake of Donald Trump’s election. 
No other individual donor or PAC has contributed more than $14,000 to Craig’s Senate primary; 92% of donations were less than $100, according to the campaign. 
Flanagan, who has said she will not accept donations from corporate PACs, is relying heavily on small-dollar donors. The average contribution to her campaign was $29, and 98% of donations were under $100, according to her campaign. Many of her largest donations have come from Native American tribes around the country — if elected, Flanagan would be the first Native woman in the Senate.
The highest-profile Republican in the race, Royce White, raised a fraction of the two Democratic candidates: $94,000.

Mark Pocan of Wisconsin, Jared Huffman of California and Pramila Jayapal of Washington. The letter comes just two days ahead of thousands of nationwide demonstrations, dubbed “No Kings Day,” against the activities of the Trump administration, including the deployment of federal law enforcement and National Guard troops in major American cities.“Regardless of whether the President agrees with someone’s political views, the Constitution guarantees their right to speak and assemble peacefully. Officials must not label individuals as ‘supporting Antifa’ or ‘coordinating with Antifa’ based solely on their protected speech,” according to the letter. “Antifa” is not one group. Rather, it’s an ideology that disapproves of the fascist style of governance.The letter continues: “In fact, neither the memo nor the executive order clearly defines ‘Antifa’ as a specific entity. Instead, the executive order conflates nonviolent protest and activism with doxing and violent behavior. Without clear definitions and limits, this vague framing could subject lawful political expression and assembly to the same treatment as terrorism.”Twenty-eight other Democratic lawmakers signed alongside Pocan, co-chair of the Congressional Equity and Labor caucuses; Jayapal, former head of the Congressional Progressive Caucus; and Huffman, founder of the Congressional Freethought caucus.Trump memoTrump’s Sept. 25 national security memo orders the National Joint Terrorism Task Force and its local offices to create a comprehensive national strategy to not only disrupt and prosecute political violence but also to investigate funders and employees of organizations “that aid and abet” those who commit violence or who are “recruiting and radicalizing” people to do so. There are about 200 such task forces in the U.S., including at least one in each Federal Bureau of Investigation’s 56 field offices and the rest in local, state and other federal agencies, according to the FBI.The memo states that “Common threads animating this violent conduct include anti-Americanism, anti-capitalism, and anti-Christianity; support for the overthrow of the United States Government; extremism on migration, race, and gender; and hostility towards those who hold traditional American views on family, religion, and morality.”Such conduct, according to the memo, is organized “through a variety of fora, including anonymous chat forums, in-person meetings, social media, and even educational institutions” and then escalates “to organized doxing.”The directive also instructs Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and the commissioner of the Internal Revenue Service, who also happens to be Bessent after Trump fired his original pick two months into the job, to be on the lookout for suspect funding streams and ensure no tax-exempt entities “directly or indirectly” finance political violence or domestic terrorism. ‘Fever dream of conspiracies’The memo does not create any new parts of the criminal code or grant any new powers to federal law enforcement, including the FBI and agents who work in the criminal investigations units at the Department of Treasury and IRS.The American Civil Liberties Union described the memo as “a fever dream of conspiracies, outright falsehoods, and the president’s distorted equation of criticism of his policies by real or perceived political opponents with ‘criminal and terroristic conspiracies.’”“Through the memo, the president instructs federal departments and law enforcement agencies to use authorities they already have and focus them on investigations of civil society groups — including nonprofits, activists, and donors — to ‘disrupt’ and ‘prevent’ the president’s fever-dream version of ‘terrorism’ and ‘political violence,’” the ACLU’s Hina Shamsi wrote in an Oct. 15 article posted on the organization’s website.The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",,,,2025-10-16 19:04:52.993693

(Photo by Alex Wong/Getty Images)President Donald Trump’s former national security adviser John Bolton was charged Thursday by a federal grand jury in Maryland with transmitting and illegally storing classified information.
Bolton, 76, faces 18 counts – 10 for unlawful retention of national defense information and another eight for transmitting the information. Bolton, a Bethesda resident, was charged in U.S. District Court for Maryland, after the FBI raided his Montgomery County home and Washington office in August.
“Keeping Americans safe always has been, and always will be, the top priority for the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Maryland,” said U.S. Attorney for Maryland Kelly O. Hayes, who was appointed to the job this year. “If anyone endangers our national security, we’re committed to holding them accountable.”
The Bolton indictment is just the latest filed against a Trump enemy: Former FBI Director James Comey, who was fired by Trump in his first term, was indicted in September on charges that he lied to Congress during its Trump-Russia probe, and New York Attorney General Letitia James, whose office successfully brought fraud charges against the Trump Organization in 2022, was indicted earlier this month with fraud for statements she made in a mortgage application to buy a second house in Norfolk, Virginia.
Both of those indictments were returned in the Eastern District of Virginia, where U.S. Attorney Erik Siebert resigned shortly before Comey’s indictment.

Bolton served as U.S. ambassador to the United Nations during the George W. Bush administration in 2005 and 2006, and was Trump’s national security adviser from 2018 to 2019.
But Bolton, an important member of the Bush administration national security team that favored active military involvement in the Middle East, has since emerged as a chief Republican foreign policy critic of Trump. He wrote a 2020 book that blasted the president and widened the public rift between the two men.
The first Trump administration launched an investigation to determine if Bolton improperly used sensitive information in his book. The current search involves federal officials investigating Bolton’s actions over the last four years, according to the New York Times, which cited a federal law enforcement official.
Earlier this year, the president revoked the security detail for Bolton.
When informed of the indictment during an Oval Office event Thursday afternoon, Trump said he had not seen the indictment and was not even aware it had been returned. But he welcomed charges against Bolton, whom he called “a bad guy.”
“I didn’t know that, you’re telling me for the first time, but I think he’s a bad person,” Trump said in response to a reporter’s question.
According to a statement from Hayes’ office, Bolton used his personal email and messaging apps to transmit send sensitive documents, some classified as high as Top Secret, that prosecutors said revealed intelligence about future attacks, foreign adversaries and foreign policy. The indictment alleges that Bolton illegally kept the documents at his home, according to the news release.
The 18 charges carry a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison each, if convicted, Hayes office said.
“There is one tier of justice for all Americans,” Attorney General Pamela Bondi said in a statement on Bolton’s indictment Thursday. “Anyone who abuses a position of power and jeopardizes our national security will be held accountable. No one is above the law.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/John-Bolton-Donald-Trump-700x477-1.jpg,,,2025-10-16 19:04:52.993693

Prior to federal reclamation laws in 1977, coal mines across the country, and in Iowa, were not required to remove hazards or stabilize the mined land after closing. This left thousands of acres of land with acidic soils, dangerous piles, embankments and other conditions that are inhospitable to a native ecosystem. 
IDALS, using funding from the U.S. Department of the Interior, has cleaned up and reclaimed more than 120 abandoned coal mine sites in the state, and is constructing or designing 22 additional sites.

Iowa’s abandoned mine reclamation program is viewed nationally as a leader for its innovation in such projects. Iowa Secretary of Agriculture Mike Naig said the projects are a result of private and public partnerships and reflect Iowa’s “ongoing investment in conservation.”
Naig said the reclamation sites are a “visible sign of progress, producing cleaner water, healthier soil, and safer land for future generations.” 
“These AML (abandoned mine land) projects reduce hazards, improve wildlife habitat and create new opportunities for agriculture, conservation and recreation in Iowa,” Naig said. 
The eight new projects represent more than $5 million in combined investments and are expected to be completed by the end of 2026, according to the press release. 
Each land reclamation project site is different. Of the eight newly announced projects, one is as small as three acres, while the largest stretches 99 acres and will involve moving approximately 884,000 cubic yards of earthwork. 
The new projects are in Marion, Van Buren and Wapello counties.

People in both states who are covered by the federal health insurance program that primarily serves older adults have more trouble accessing and affording care than those in other states, and the quality of care they receive is lower, according to a report released Thursday by the Commonwealth Fund, a private foundation that studies health care access in the U.S. 
Medicare costs in Louisiana and Mississippi are some of the highest in the nation, but do not correspond to better health outcomes for patients. The states’ life expectancies at 65 are some of the lowest in the country, according to federal data. Mississippi comes in last place, with people living two years shorter than the national average. 
Lower ranking states have weaker overall health infrastructure, a trend across Southeastern states, said Gretchen Jacobson, the Commonwealth Fund’s vice president for Medicare. 
The report used 31 metrics to assess each state’s care, including strictness of prior authorization policies, access to outpatient care and how much beneficiaries pay. 
About 650,000 Mississippians and 960,000 Louisianans – over 20% of each state’s population – are enrolled in Medicare, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The program provides coverage to nearly all people 65 years or older and covers some younger people with disabilities. 
Sixty-nine million Americans are enrolled in Medicare, making it the largest payer for health care in the country. The program was established in 1965 by President Lyndon B. Johnson to provide health insurance to older Americans. It has changed over the last six decades, expanding eligibility to more people and offering additional benefits, like prescription drug coverage and Medicare Advantage plans. 
Private companies run Medicare Advantage plans and provide an alternative to traditional Medicare. About half of Medicare beneficiaries are enrolled in such plans. 
Medicare was designed to deliver uniform benefits to older Americans regardless of where they live, but states differ widely in their delivery of quality care, the report authors said. 
“We have more work to do to ensure it delivers the care equally and effectively for people in every state,” said Dr. Joseph Betancourt, president of the Commonwealth Fund, during a press conference Wednesday
Some disparities stem from how the program is structured, because Medicare relies on private providers to deliver care, said Mark Diana, associate dean for research and graduate programs at the University of West Florida who has researched health policy and management. 
“All of the variations in how private medical care is provided across the country exist in the Medicare program, just like everywhere else,” Diana said. 
While coverage may be the same across states, the services that patients are able to access may differ. 
In Louisiana and Mississippi, older Medicare recipients are prescribed medications that should be avoided in the elderly at higher rates than in other states, according to the report. Such medications increase the risk of confusion, falls, bleeding risk and other potential harms.
Nursing home residents who are hospitalized are readmitted to the hospital more frequently in Louisiana and Mississippi, and avoidable emergency room visits are more common,the report said.
Patients are sicker when they enroll in Medicare in Louisiana and Mississippi, where there are high rates of uninsurance and poverty, said David Radley, a senior scientist for the Commonwealth Foundation, during a press conference Wednesday. For example, more than two out of three Medicare beneficiaries in Mississippi and Louisiana have three or more chronic conditions, like diabetes or high blood pressure.
“When people are sick coming into Medicare, they tend to be really sick when they’re in Medicare,” Radley said. 
Research has shown that people who are uninsured before age 65 have higher health care costs when they enroll in Medicare. 
Improving health care systems’ ability to care for people of all ages will enhance care for Medicare recipients, Jacobson said. 
Even with the support of Medicare, older people in Mississippi and Louisiana struggle to afford the costs of health care. More Medicare recipients in Mississippi and Louisiana went without care because they couldn’t afford it in the past year than in most other states. 
Experts say the Medicaid spending cuts passed this summer in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act may impact low-income Medicare beneficiaries, many of whom are enrolled in both programs. 
Cuts to Medicaid may make it more difficult for dually enrolled beneficiaries to access services that aren’t required to be provided by traditional Medicare plans, like dental care or home and community-based services, Jacobson said. 
More than a third of Mississippians and Louisianans over 65 went without a dental visit in the past year, the report said.
The legislation also imposed a moratorium on changes that aimed to reduce enrollment barriers for Medicare Savings Programs, which allow Medicaid to pay Medicare premiums and other costs for low-income beneficiaries. These changes will not be implemented until 2034.

(DOC photo)Blaming 1970s infrastructure that apparently has not been properly maintained, the Montana Department of Corrections presented the beginning of a plan to permanently address water issues at the Montana State Prison.
In a late Wednesday news release, the department said it would “begin installing new, modern and permanent water infrastructure” with a $21 million appropriation after receiving approval from Gov. Greg Gianforte.
On Friday, DOC said a pipe broke at the prison in Deer Lodge that left it without running water or flushing toilets. Inmates have described concerns about food, sanitation and a lack of drinking water. 
The reported break took place while the prison is in the midst of a $211 million reconstruction that’s part of a large effort to improve and expand the state’s correctional system, a policy priority for the governor and many members of the legislature.
“Director (Brian) Gootkin instructed teams contracted to work on the construction of the new units at the prison to develop a design and plan to move forward with this (water) project as early as next week,” the release stated. “MSP’s water and sewer infrastructure was largely built in the 1970s. Since that time, work on the system has for the most part been limited to fixing problems, not maintaining or improving the system for the long haul.”
Gootkin said the prison will continue providing water to inmates while it takes  on “this longer fix.”
“Years of deferred maintenance have caught up with us and we’re finding multiple failures throughout the system,” Gootkin said in a press release.
On Wednesday morning, members of the Montana Air National Guard set up a portable shower unit outside on the low security side of Montana State Prison. (DOC photo)
DOC officials said they have tried to find the source of the problem, calling in multiple water experts, the state’s National Guard and a Department of Natural Resources and Conservation command team. The department has brought in portable toilets and water bottles for inmates.
The prison in Deer Lodge houses 1,600 prisoners. It also has an economic impact on the local community, Powell County Commissioner Dan Sager said on Thursday.
Sager, whose district includes the prison, called the difficulties at the prison an “unfortunate situation” but said he felt they are being addressed and will be resolved.
The National Guard has been transporting water from the City of Deer Lodge fill station to the prison, the city’s public works superintendent, Trent Freeman, said in an email.
Money for ancillary items such as portable showers is coming out of state disaster emergency services funds. The emergency declaration Gianforte signed last week authorized funds from the Governor’s Emergency Appropriation, Kaitlin Price, the governor’s press secretary, wrote in an email.
Cost estimates are being compiled by each agency involved, she added. A total was not available from the Governor’s Office.
The new unit construction is part of the $211 million project at the prison stemming from 2023 legislation that will replace three of the four low-security housing units at the facility. Money for the new water repair is coming out of House Bill 5, which set aside $21 million for infrastructure at the prison.
The money was appropriated during the 2025 legislative session before the crisis.
“The department may also extend existing design, construction, and other contracts at its sole discretion, in order to expedite the project,” House Bill 5 reads.
Sen. Tom McGillvray, a Billings Republican who sat on a legislative committee that deals in part with DOC funding, said the legislature was ahead on this issue.
“Fortunately, we have the money set aside for that,” McGillvray said. “They’re just going to speed up the timeline.”
Construction companies at the site, including Sletten Construction, are assisting DOC in repairs by providing additional excavation equipment, a release from the state said late last week.
Sletten Construction did not respond to a voicemail left to regional company leadership. 
Construction on the housing units began in April, and it’s unclear how far along the project is, or whether the problems with water and construction are related.
DOC said it has found multiple leaks over the past two days.

“We are going to simultaneously continue our work to identify the issues with the existing system and install a modern system that will take us into the future,” Gootkin said. “This is not going to be an easy couple of months for inmates or staff, but the end result will be worth it.”
According to the DOC, water access will be rolled among units “throughout the day” to allow for work to occur on the system, though it was not immediately clear what parts of the prison have access to running water.
DOC reported that resources on site at the prison include 153 portable toilets (including 12 ADA-compliant) and 43 portable showers.

“It was a financial decision, but you're in our community,” one impacted parent said. “Your business thrives when our community thrives.”
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Mount Snow to reduce child care offerings, citing ‘long-term sustainability’.","The Good family. Contributed by Amber Good
Theo Wells-Spackman is a Report for America corps member who reports for VTDigger.org.
Mount Snow Child Care in West Dover plans to scale down slots and staffing in its child care program for community members starting in November, resort leadership announced earlier this month. 
Alternative providers available on short notice are scarce in Dover and the surrounding Deerfield Valley, according to Amber Good, an affected parent. 
Good works as a physical therapist and has been supporting her family on one income after her husband was diagnosed with cancer in the spring. If her family cannot find a viable child care option, Good said she would have to step away from work to care for her children. 
Given her role as the region’s only full-time physical therapist who does at-home care, Good said the resort’s decision has left her concerned for her patients’ continued health access as well as her family’s finances.
In an Oct. 2 letter, Mount Snow Child Care Manager Katelyn Roske and Skier Services Director Brian Donovan wrote that the resort is shifting to an “employee-first” model, phasing out enrollment of non-employee families by Nov. 15 and creating a waitlist for children of local community members. Temporary child care slots for visitors to the resort are expected to remain.
The cuts will affect 16 non-employee families, according to Samara Sausville, a spokesperson for Vail Resorts, which since 2019 has owned and operated Mount Snow. Some parents believe the number of impacted families is higher. The resort declined to provide the number of staff positions it will eliminate.
With looming layoffs at the child care center, Good questioned whether Mount Snow’s move to decrease child care offerings is truly an “employee-first” approach to operations as the Oct. 2 letter suggested — or instead about cutting costs. 
“I understand you’re a business, and it was a financial decision, but you’re in our community,” Good said. “Your business thrives when our community thrives.”
Sausville said high costs, state-specific child care regulations, and challenges posed by Vermont’s “rural nature” have made the program unsustainable. Parents and advocates emphasized the difficulty the shift is causing to an area where child care offerings are relatively thin, as the community considers its relationship with one of the region’s largest employers.
The child care program has always operated at a loss, Sausville said, and — at least for the portion of the program that serves the children of employees year-round — will continue to do so. The decrease in offerings was necessary to “ensure the long-term sustainability of our operations,” she said in an email.
Erin Roche, director of the Vermont office of First Children’s Finance, said that while this change does not spell catastrophe for the region’s child care landscape in the long term, these cuts leave a “big gap.”
“It probably means that somebody in (each affected) household isn’t going to be able to keep a full schedule at work, or they’re going to have to reach out to friends and family,” she said. “This is an economic development issue, as much as it’s anything.”
Mount Snow Child Care has been a “cornerstone for families” in the Dover area for more than two decades, according to a petition circulated last week by affected parents. The aim of the petition — which has garnered 218 signatures as of Thursday afternoon — is to reverse Mount Snow’s decision and call on the resort to negotiate alternatives based on feedback from community stakeholders. 
The petition called the cuts “an act of corporate carelessness.”
Sausville said in an email Tuesday that the cuts were “a local decision made by the team at Mount Snow” and is unconnected with the company’s global two-year push to save $100 million in operating costs by the end of fiscal year 2026.
Richard Allin, an impacted parent in Wilmington, wrote an open letter posted on social media, urging Mount Snow and Vail Resorts to work with families and local governing bodies to devise sustainable solutions such as “limited community slots, exploring partnerships, or creating a cost-sharing model that works for everyone.”
“This decision separates children who have grown up together, leaves dedicated teachers without jobs, and forces many parents to make impossible choices about their own employment or even staying in the area,” Allin wrote.

‘Logistical and financial hurdles’
The cuts at Mount Snow come at a time of ongoing concerns with rural child care access. Though Roche cited significant improvements in Vermont’s child care coverage since the passage of Act 76 in 2023, she said the growth is still “not fast enough.”
Winston Prouty Center in Brattleboro is among the child care providers that received an uptick of enrollment requests since Mount Snow’s announcement despite having a waitlist, according to Kim Simeon, the organization’s Early Learning Center adminstrative director.
Andrea Sumner, the program director at East Dover’s Kids in the Country, said she had limited availability for toddlers, and more in her 3-and-up classroom. Though recent child care reforms have eased the financial position of her business, a lack of staff has kept her program from expanding to full capacity, she said.
“At this point, I don’t think it’s available child care slots. I think it’s finding available workforce,” she said.
In this period after the partial loss of a program, Roche said there may be opportunities for those who were laid off to join other providers to expand their capacity or to start their own business to fill the newly created need. First Children’s Finance offers some grants to assist in those efforts.
Vail Resorts acquired Mount Snow as part of a $264 million deal in 2019, which saw the complex’s former operator Peak Resorts subsumed into its new owner. The move added 17 ski areas to the Vail portfolio. It now runs 42 in total — and at least one is expanding rather than downsizing its child care offerings. At Vail’s Heavenly Mountain Resort in California, leadership announced in August that the resort would begin offering year-round child care to the local community. 
Sausville said that Vermont-specific factors heavily influenced the decision. State staff-to-child ratio regulations, as well as rules limiting price increases to families, contributed to an environment that the company deemed unsustainable.
The state’s rural layout presents “logistical and financial hurdles,” according to Sausville, that are less prevalent in relatively urban states like California, “where facilities may benefit from economies of scale and broader infrastructure support.”
At the moment, according to Sausville, a higher number of child care slots at Mount Snow translates to greater financial losses.
Roche also pointed to recent expansions and investments in child care programs from a number of other Vermont ski areas, including Stratton Mountain Resort and Vail’s own resort at Stowe, as well as the state’s massive investment in child care through tuition subsidies and other supports in Act 76.
“Part of me wonders if (Mount Snow was) taking full advantage of the sort of business and financial opportunities that the child care law (Act 76) would offer them,” Roche said.
Rep. Laura Sibilia, I-Dover, said her children attended the Mount Snow program and emphasized that the impact would reach beyond Dover to surrounding towns. The area’s child care offerings had been in “decent shape” in the past, she said, in large part because of Mount Snow, in addition to local pre-K programming.
“It feels most productive at this point to also be trying to think about ways to bring additional child care here to the valley,” Sibilia said.

(Getty Images)A long-running court battle over how to balance protections for endangered fish with hydropower dams in the Columbia River Basin has resumed after a two-year pause. 
Conservationists, anglers and clean energy groups, along with the state of Oregon, asked a federal court Tuesday to grant a preliminary injunction that would change how eight dams on the lower Columbia and Snake rivers operate. They argue that these changes would improve the conditions for salmon and steelhead survival.  
The state of Washington and the Nez Perce Tribe are supporting the request. 
The conservation groups and other plaintiffs want to see reservoir levels lowered and more water poured over spillways at the dams, starting in March 2026. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers operates the dams. 
“Columbia River salmon and steelhead have declined to dangerously low abundance levels and have faced a highly precarious status for years due in large part to the Corps’ operation of the Columbia River System dams and reservoirs,” says a request for a preliminary injunction that Earthjustice filed on behalf of the groups in federal court in Oregon.
The Public Power Council, which represents utilities and joined the suit on the side of the defendants, opposes the requested changes. 
In particular, the group says that the spill increases are “scientifically unproven, counterproductive to real salmon recovery, extremely costly to electricity consumers, and could spell disaster for our region’s grid reliability.” 
There are 18 dams on the mainstems of the Columbia and Snake rivers, including the eight targeted by the litigation. 
Overall, the federal hydropower system in the Columbia River Basin provides about 28% of the Pacific Northwest’s electricity, according to the Public Power Council. 
The dams provide irrigation and emissions-free hydropower for nearby communities, but have also contributed to the near extinction of 13 salmon and steelhead populations that return to the Columbia Basin from the Pacific Ocean to spawn. 
The fish are important to tribal health and sovereignty and to basin ecosystems, and the declines are hitting southern resident orca whales off the coasts of British Columbia, Washington and Oregon that rely on salmon for food and that are federally listed as endangered.
In addition to changes in dam operations, the groups behind the litigation are requesting other emergency conservation measures, including removing passage barriers for spring Chinook in the Tucannon River and increasing federal efforts to control predators that feed on salmon and steelhead. 
Earthjustice filed the request for a preliminary injunction on behalf of the National Wildlife Federation, Pacific Coast Federation of Fishermen’s Associations, Institute for Fisheries Resources, Sierra Club, Idaho Rivers United, Northwest Sportfishing Industry Association, NW Energy Coalition, Columbia Riverkeeper, Idaho Conservation League and Fly Fishers International, Inc. 
New chapter in a long-standing fight
This is the latest maneuver in litigation that dates back to 2001 and was paused as part of a multi-year agreement involving the federal government that was reached in 2023 under the Biden administration. 
President Donald Trump withdrew the federal government from that agreement in June.
“When the Trump administration reneged on this carefully negotiated agreement — and offered no alternative plan to restore imperiled salmon and steelhead — we had no option but to resume our longstanding litigation to protect endangered salmon,” said Earthjustice Attorney Amanda Goodin. 
As part of the “historic” deal — which was reached by the U.S. government, four tribes, Washington and Oregon — environmental groups agreed to pause litigation, and the federal government committed to investments in restoring Columbia River fish runs. 
Trump called the agreement “radical environmentalism” and said completion of the restoration initiative would “be devastating for the region.”
Washington state and the Nez Perce Tribe intend to formally support the conservation groups in their lawsuit as amicus parties, which allows them to offer information, expertise, or insight to aid the plaintiffs’ case in court. 
Oregon was not part of the 2001 case but joined Monday as an intervenor on the side of the conservation groups.
The federal government asked the court to pause the case until the federal government shutdown that began Oct. 1 ends, but a judge denied that request on Oct. 14, allowing Earthjustice and Oregon to file their injunction request that day. 
White House spokespeople did not respond to a request for comment. 
Utility groups point to strained grid
The Trump administration’s decision to withdraw from the 2023 agreement was supported by the Northwest Public Power Association. The group also opposed this week’s court filing. 
“Our electric grid is under unprecedented strain, this motion risks plunging our region into crisis,” said Kurt Miller, the association’s CEO and executive director.
Public Power Council CEO and Executive Director Scott Simms said the federal withdrawal from the 2023 deal opened the door for renewed negotiations, and that the council was ready to participate in those talks. 
“Unfortunately, the plaintiffs chose litigation over collaboration, but it is not too late to engage in productive settlement conversations,” Simms said. 
The Northwest Public Power Association does support a return of salmon to blocked areas in a way that does not impact hydropower operations, referring to a 2022 proposal by the Upper Columbia United Tribes as a preferable option.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/snake-river-dam-lower-monumental-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-10-16 18:03:14.654820

A sustainable aviation fuel developer plans to shift investment from South Dakota to North Dakota, in part because of delays in the development of the multi-state Summit Carbon Solutions pipeline. 
Colorado-based Gevo had obtained a $1.46 billion loan through the U.S. Department of Energy to build a jet fuel plant at Lake Preston, South Dakota. Company officials told the North Dakota Monitor on Thursday that it instead will push ahead with making jet fuel at the Richardton, North Dakota, ethanol plant it bought last year. Gevo is working with the Department of Energy to transfer the loan to expand the North Dakota site. 
Red Trail Energy at Richardton in 2022 became the first ethanol plant in the country to capture and store carbon dioxide, taking advantage of its location in an area with the right geology for permanent underground storage. 
Gevo plans to expand the North Dakota ethanol plant, which turns corn into fuel. It would convert the ethanol into higher-value aviation fuel in a process it calls alcohol to jet. Carbon capture is a key part of making sustainable aviation fuel.
“We don’t have to share pipelines. We don’t have to wait. We’re already doing it,” CEO Pat Gruber said of carbon capture at the North Dakota site. 
Gevo’s South Dakota site relied on the planned Summit Carbon Solutions pipeline to take carbon dioxide to an underground storage site in North Dakota. But the future of that project in South Dakota is in doubt because of landowner resistance and state permitting hurdles. 
North Dakota attorney general says legal action against South Dakota pipeline law not an option

Iowa-based Summit is seeking to change its pipeline permit in that state. Summit wants to remove North Dakota as the designated end point for the pipeline. 
A spokesperson for Summit said Friday the change “keeps open the option to transport CO2 west through Nebraska or north through South Dakota,” reported the Iowa Capital Dispatch. 
Gruber said the jet fuel production in North Dakota would be 30 million gallons of jet fuel a year, half of what was planned for South Dakota. But he said the 500 acres at Richardton could allow for expansion. 
He said the jet fuel plant would cost about $500 million. Gruber noted that is substantially less than $2.6 billion it planned to spend on the South Dakota site. 
Gevo is hosting a meeting Monday to answer questions for farmers and others in the Richardton area. The meeting will be from 6 to 7:30 Mountain Time at WIX Barn near Richardton. 
Gruber said building in North Dakota also opens the door to Gevo selling its carbon to the oil industry. North Dakota oil producers could buy the carbon dioxide for enhanced oil recovery — pumping gas into the well to help the well produce more oil. 
“This is a great opportunity for us, and we sit right next to Bakken,” Gruber said, referring to the Bakken Formation. North Dakota is the nation’s No. 3 oil producing state, with most of it coming from the Bakken. 
Oil industry and state leaders have touted enhanced oil recovery as a way for North Dakota to sustain oil production for decades to come and continue to provide the state with tax revenue. 
Gruber said Gevo has started discussion with oil companies, but he said the infrastructure to make enhanced oil recovery possible is still years away. 
Ethanol plants are seen as a prime source for carbon dioxide because the gas is captured from the fermentation process of turning corn into ethanol instead of from the burning of fuel. 
“It’s pure, concentrated CO2,” Gruber said. 
Another benefit of carbon capture for Gevo is the ability to sell carbon credits to other industries with high carbon emissions. Gevo in September announced it is partnering with Biorecro North America on carbon credit sales generated at the North Dakota facility.
Gruber said he was grateful the Department of Energy for working with Gevo on transferring the federal loan, though there are steps remaining to complete the process. Gevo filed a document with the federal Securities and Exchange Commission on Tuesday of its intent to use the loan money in North Dakota. 
As for the future of the eastern South Dakota site, Gevo officials said it remains a great industrial location and will be developed. 
“The are other things we can do at that site,” said Paul Bloom, Gevo’s chief business officer. “It’s a matter of when.” 
But the Gevo officials said the demand for sustainable aviation fuel meant the company could not wait for the Summit pipeline. Summit had hoped to be operating in 2024 but has yet to start construction as it tries to secure all the permits it needs. 
“We can’t sit around for that,” Gruber said.  “We’ve got a mission here.”

The studio’s founder, lead designer and artist checked in on the latest progress. Colorful glass mosaics, including the studio’s iconic spirit bird, spiff up the floor of a renovated bathroom. A new kitchen awaits catered events, and the reworked marketing space holds stained glass windows studio visitors always want to see. A former ceiling joist is charred and treated for a second life in a window. Young happily demonstrated an ADA accessible automatic door, among upgrades possible by a Mississippi Arts Commission Building Fund for the Arts grant, for the relatively new Pearl River Glass Conservatory, a sister nonprofit with glass art classes for the public. 
A huge window, encased in a steel frame Young salvaged from a downtown office demo 21 years ago, streams natural light for the new ceramics studio. Asiatic jasmine twigs peek up from a thick blanket of pinestraw in a sidewalk bed with two young tulip poplars, and transplanted irises settle into their new home along a border. 
All point to a visionary creative, businessman, gardener even, playing the long game.

A golden anniversary salute to that long game happens Saturday, Oct. 18, as the studio celebrates 50 years in business with a reception that honors its past and looks to the future. The 2-6 p.m. event is free, welcoming the public to its home at 142 Millsaps Ave. in Jackson, with a live demonstration of leaded stained glass window construction, refreshments, music, door prizes and giveaways. 
Tickets are on sale now for an accompanying raffle with the grand prize of a year of free classes (a $1,340 value) at the Pearl River Glass Conservatory. Proceeds from the raffle and a 4-6 p.m. silent auction at Saturday’s event benefit the conservatory.
“My legacy project” is how Young, 73, describes the Pearl River Glass Conservatory, started two years ago this January. With its own dedicated space in the Wesley Avenue building that once held Patton Publishing and Offbeat, the conservatory is dedicated to preserving and advancing the art of glass. 
“We have spent all this time learning how to do all these wonderful things,” Young said of studio innovations in fused glass, acid etching and more that pushed the expressive potential of the medium. “I didn’t want it to just disappear without making an effort.
“It’s always been about creativity,” he described the studio renowned for church window creation and restoration, architectural installments, contemporary art works in glass and home and garden decor. 
“We wanted to find a way to share that with the community at large, too.” 
Weekly classes do that, from introduction to leaded glass to fun seasonal projects like fused pumpkins or spooky garden stakes this month. Christmas ornament classes start in November, and plans are to expand offerings in the coming year.
Such efforts address multiple fronts, from providing an authentic, creative experience increasingly rare in today’s consumer society, to giving back to a community for their decades of support, Young said. He sees a deeper value as well. 
“As we move forward, people are going to need to have as many creative skills as they can, to cope with the changing dynamic of our society.
“And also, I’m a businessperson, so I’m always interested in trying to ingratiate myself with the public as much as possible,” he confessed with a chuckle. “That’s how we stay alive, you know?”

Pearl River Glass Studio began in a one-car garage in downtown Jackson in 1975, and within the next year moved to what became its forever home on Millsaps Avenue in the city’s Midtown neighborhood, drawn by cheap rent and available space in what was the city’s first industrial and wholesale commercial district.
It started with a single building on Millsaps Avenue, rented for $200 a month. “If the rent hadn’t been so cheap, I don’t think we would have been able to last in business,” he said with a fond look back at the cozy, efficient, 2,000 square-foot starter space. 
One Christmas break, his drive-around survey of the area’s empty buildings found about 200,000 square feet of vacant space in a few blocks. “I realized if there was going to be an arts district, it could be here.” 
Additional artists moved into studio spaces in the area, with a Midtown Arts District heyday in the 1990s and early 2000s. Though the scene is quieter now, it remains abuzz with working artists and other creative professionals, and continues to inspire the next generation of artists.
The studio bought its home building from the landlord’s heirs in 1985, renovated a second building in 1995 and bought more property and continued to expand about 15 years later. It remains a high-profile art anchor in the district.
 “We are proud to celebrate Pearl River Glass Studio’s 50 years of creativity and excellence!” Midtown Partners Executive Director Kristi Hendrix said in an email. “They have long embodied the spirit of innovation, craftsmanship, and even planted the early seeds for what has now developed into Midtown’s Creative Economy Initiative.” The studio’s visitorship and artist support demonstrate the impact a creative enterprise can have within a community.
“They have also been a constant reminder of what’s possible when creativity and community grow side by side,” she said.
Over the years, Pearl River Glass Studio has grown to its current 17 employees and 17,000 square feet across multiple buildings in a campus that spreads from the original Millsaps Avenue building north to Wesley Avenue, which the conservatory fronts.
The studio has always been a collaborative, Young said. The nature of the art form, and the series of functions it requires, demands more people. 
“It was never just me,” he said.

Many area artists have worked there at one time or another, including Bebe Wolfe, Jerrod Partridge, Ron Lindsey and more, and so have successful lawyers downtown when they were students at Millsaps College, Young said. The different contributions feed an atmosphere of creative problem-solving.
“The creativity part of it is a key component in the success of the company — the idea of innovation,” Young said. “All of that is a sort of cornerstone to how we operate, and so, having the various creative artists as part of that has been part of the special sauce.”
Glass painter and artist Rob Cooper came to Pearl River Glass Studio first as a Forest Hill senior and an internship through APAC in 1994. This year he marks 31 years at the studio. Stained glass church work is the studio’s bread and butter. 
“Andy was keeping up with design work, and meeting the churches in a more modern way,” he said. “Innovation is one thing Andy likes to do — leaning into the curve of what glass can do.” 
That was a key spark for Cooper’s imagination as well. 
From the early days of fusing glass to create imagery (now a big staple), to painting, acid etching and different mark making techniques, “I got to be on the ground floor of trying new things,” Cooper said.
Some key projects over the years include Pearl River Glass Studio’s 2015 restoration of the more than 100 outside stained glass windows in the 1903 Mississippi State Capitol, including the three stunning monumental figures that grace its staircase landing, and the restoration of the House of Representatives Chamber stained glass skylight dome, completed last July (now safely stored and awaiting reinstallation).

 “Mississippians should really be proud of that structure,” he said of the historical building. “It’s really a tour de force as far as design and execution.” 
The commission for stained glass windows for Christ United in Jackson ranked among Young’s favorites, for their large size, the creativity required and the way it suited his skills. 
“The stained glass windows were my particular style — kind of contemporary with Christian symbols,” Young said. “The stained glass windows are always telling a story.”
He also noted the windows at St. Francis of Assisi Catholic Church in Madison, another large-scale commission for a new church and point of pride, with stained glass windows that told the saint’s story.
While the studio remains interested in new church commissions, church construction seems less robust than in years past. The business has adapted, focusing on repair, restoration and maintenance of church windows around the state.
“We’ve had wonderful opportunities over the years,” Young said, highlighting the conservatory as a way to continue engaging with a community that has embraced their art from the start, and continues to a half century later.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/16102212/restoration-MS-State-Capitol-House-of-Representatives.jpg,,,2025-10-16 18:03:14.654820

Two months after its severing, a vital transportation link for small cities in two of Washington’s largest counties will reopen Friday.
The White River Bridge connecting eastern King and Pierce counties has been closed since mid-August when it was struck by an overheight truck and significantly damaged. It will open for traffic between 5 p.m. and midnight on Friday, Gov. Bob Ferguson announced Thursday.
“We’re hoping it’s on the earlier side of 5 p.m., but it’ll be in that window. We’re extremely excited about that,” Ferguson said at a news conference at the bridge.
“We understood how challenging the situation was for the community,” he said. “A lot of things could have gone in a different direction, but through a lot of hard work and a little bit of luck, we’re super excited to be opening up this early, literally weeks early.”
Enumclaw Mayor Jan Molinaro, Buckley Mayor Beau Burkett, and King County Councilmember Reagan Dunn were among a throng of local officials, business owners, and workers who joined Ferguson for the announcement.
The steel truss bridge, built in 1949, is on State Route 410 and is a lifeline for the cities of Enumclaw and Buckley. Before the crash, it carried more than 22,000 vehicles per day, according to the state Department of Transportation.
The closure disrupted daily life of residents and the economies of the two cities.
“Economically, we’ve been hurting,” Molinaro said. ”We really want to get life back to a normal situation, and this allows us to do that.”
State transportation officials ordered the bridge closed Aug. 18, citing the severity of damage. 
Nine days later, Ferguson declared a state of emergency in the two counties, enabling the state to pursue federal funds for reimbursement of repairs. The emergency proclamation estimated repairs could exceed $2 million. Updated information on costs was not immediately available Thursday.
There’s no guarantee the state will recoup its expenses. The Federal Emergency Management Agency this year has twice rejected the state’s request for federal help to cover tens of millions of dollars in damage caused by a bomb cyclone late last year.
The disaster declaration could help provide funding to businesses hurt by the closure. King County is looking at a loan program run by the U.S. Small Business Administration to potentially help local establishments. Some businesses have applied, according to speakers at Thursday’s event.
The incident is spurring the Washington State Department of Transportation to put in additional signs on both sides of the span warning of the bridge height. Also, the state is looking to install an advanced warning system, such as a flashing sign or road bumps, for the bridge, WSDOT Secretary Julie Meredith said.
Ferguson said his proposed 2026 supplemental budget will seek more dollars for maintenance and preservation of Washington’s highways and bridges. He will release his proposal in December. 
State transportation officials warned again this week that underfunding has put the state’s transportation system in the “early stages of critical failure.”SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/410-tearing-921x1024.jpg,,,2025-10-16 18:03:14.654820

Katie Britt, an Alabama Republican, for bringing the issue to his attention. “She's the first one that told me about this,” he said. “I had not known too much about it, and we worked very rapidly together.”Britt advocated for IVF after an Alabama Supreme Court ruling last year made the treatment illegal in the state. The state Legislature soon passed a law to ensure IVF remained legal.At the Oval Office event Thursday, Britt offered high praise for Trump, saying he had prioritized the issue since the first time the pair spoke by phone.“IVF is what makes the difference for so many families that are facing infertility,” she said. “The recommendations today that President Trump has set forth are going to expand IVF coverage to nearly a million more families, and they're going to drive down cost significantly. Mr. President, this is the most pro-IVF thing that any president in the history of the United States of America has done.”Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. added that Trump was also “addressing the root causes” of infertility through a Make America Healthy Again agenda that seeks to avoid exposure to chemicals. Trump, asked about potential opposition from religious conservatives who oppose IVF, said he was unconcerned. “This is very pro-life,” he said. “You can't get more pro-life than this.”",,,,2025-10-16 18:03:14.654820

Dubbed the FastSites program, the initiative is backed by $150 million from a Site Investment and Infrastructure Fund state lawmakers approved earlier this year, according to the Louisiana Economic Development agency.  
FastSites relies on participation from local governments, nonprofit groups, development authorities and private landowners who can apply and compete for the funding. The allocations from the fund will be structured as forgivable loans or a partnership deal with the state. 
The money can be used to purchase tracts of land and partially develop it by, for example, demolishing old buildings, clearing trees, providing road and rail access or upgrading utility connections to the site.  
“This is one of the most forward-thinking site development models in the country,” LED Chief Economic Competitiveness Officer Ileana Ledet said in a news release. “FastSites aligns government efficiency with private-sector speed, ensuring Louisiana can meet the demands of global investment while strengthening our communities and infrastructure.”
The funding awards will range from a minimum of $1 million to as much as $25 million. Applicants must match the funding by as much as 50% to 80%, depending on the project type. Private landowners who qualify for the funding will have higher matching requirements and won’t be eligible for future loan forgiveness, according to LED. 
The application period for the inaugural round of funding opens Oct. 30 and closes Dec. 15. LED will host an informational webinar about the program at 2 p.m. Monday, Oct. 27.

“We look forward to speaking with you. All information is valuable,” said Robert Eikhoff, special agent in charge of the FBI office in Jackson. 
But the public wants answers, too. 
“What assurance do we have that all of this is going to stop or it will come to a close?” Reseann Mitchell, a Leland resident, asked the police. 
“I understand. We can’t stop it but we can slow it down,” Chief Jimmy Myrick replied. 
When asked for details about the shooting, including motives, whether the shooting was random or if the suspects had any relation to the victims, Myrick said he couldn’t answer because of the ongoing investigation.

After the press conference, Mitchell said her son, Terregernal S. Martin, is among those charged in the shooting. She said he did not fire a weapon, but was working as security at a building near where gunfire broke out.
She said it’s been frustrating trying to get in touch with law enforcement agencies that are involved in the investigation and to advocate for her son. She has been able to talk to him on the phone while he is being held at the Washington County jail. 
“I hate to see this happen,” Mitchell said, noting how her son grew up with one of the victims. She said she was inside a club near the Leland block party and dropped to the floor when she heard gunshots and saw bodies lying on the ground. 
Nine arrests have been made in Leland, but only five names have been made public, including Martin, 33, who is charged with capital murder. The others are Morgan Lattimore, 25, charged with capital murder; Teviyon L. Powell, 29, capital murder; William Bryant, 29, capital murder; and Latoya A. Powell, 44, attempted murder.
The FBI said Martin’s bond was set at $1 million cash. Bond information for the rest was not immediately available. 
The shooting was one of several that happened during homecoming festivities on high school and college campuses last weekend, which left another four people dead and more injured. 
Two people in the Leland shooting remain in critical condition. More than 25 were hit by the gunfire.
Those killed have been identified as Oreshama Johnson, 41; Calvin Plant, 19; Shelbyona Powell, 25; Kaslyn Johnson, 18; Amos Brantley Jr., 18; and JaMichael Jones, 34.
At Thursday’s news conference, officials recognized the tragedy that the community has experienced and the grief it is processing, and said they will hold those responsible accountable.
The officials were asked about how to ensure public safety in Leland and in communities having homecoming celebrations. They responded that there would be an increased law enforcement presence. 
Mississippi Public Safety Commissioner Sean Tindell said there is much to be done to answer questions of why the shooting happened. When asked what can be done to prevent similar shootings, he said that is a question communities will need to answer. 
A day earlier in Columbus, Gov. Tate Reeves offered his potential solutions after the recent shootings: Convince young people who are committing crimes to value life and to know that actions have consequences.

,Mississippi Today,2025-10-16 21:42:25+00:00,Mississippi Today,Report: Mississippi schools face chronic absenteeism,Devna Bose,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/10/16/report-mississippi-schools-face-chronic-absenteeism/,"Chronic absenteeism, or students missing 10% or more of the school year, has more than doubled in Mississippi since 2018.","More than a quarter of Mississippi students are chronically absent from school.
A new report from the Mississippi Department of Education revealed that rates of chronic absenteeism, defined as missing at least 10% of the year or 18 days of school, are on the rise. 
While chronic absenteeism rates decreased slightly for middle and elementary schools, overall the percentage has more than doubled from 13% during the 2018-19 school year to 27.6% during this past school year, or 120,408 students. The increase is largely due to a huge uptick among high schoolers — a 9% increase in the past two years — especially toward the end of the year when some students are exempt from exams. 
It’s not a Mississippi-specific issue, State Superintendent Lance Evans stressed at Thursday’s state Board of Education meeting. Nationwide, chronic absenteeism rates nearly doubled during the COVID-19 pandemic. The U.S. Department of Education reports that 28% of students were considered chronically absent during the 2022-23 school year. 
But the report comes at a precarious time for the state’s public education system. After years of huge academic gains, Mississippi students have slipped slightly in some areas, recent tests show. Absenteeism is directly tied to student achievement — when students miss school, they miss essential instruction time. It can add up, leaving chronically absent students far behind their peers. 
That’s why the agency is working hard to combat it, Evans said. 
“We already have a plan moving forward,” he told state board members on Thursday. “We’re beefing that up even more.” 
Legislators have increasingly expressed concern about the state’s chronic absenteeism rate. Evans said at the meeting that Lt. Gov. Delbert Hosemann is particularly interested in the numbers, and lawmakers heard the agency’s strategies to get more students to school at a Senate education committee meeting last week. 
Mississippi Department of Education officials told senators that moving forward, the agency would implement consistent systems for documenting absenteeism, focus on graduation success rather than dropout prevention and build outreach systems to intervene earlier when students start missing school. Evans said at the board meeting that the agency’s plan also calls for more personnel and an overhaul of the office that oversees attendance. 
The report also said that the agency is encouraging districts to “adopt recognition programs to reinforce positive attendance habits, build partnerships with health care providers, provide flexibility for families facing extenuating circumstances.” It is also asking them to “implement grade-specific supports — such as advisory periods, peer mentoring, and career or technical pathway connections — to strengthen engagement among older students.”
The merits of engaging families on the importance of getting their child to school is clear because of the low absenteeism rates among younger students, the report notes. By grade, chronic absenteeism is lowest in Mississippi in the 4th grade, steadily decreasing each year from kindergarten. But as students advance into higher grades, rates go up again, hitting a peak in the 12th grade. 
Senators were especially concerned about the 12th-grade numbers and asked the state education agency to prioritize making senior year more about college and career preparation, so students would take attendance more seriously. Some districts permit seniors who aren’t taking a full load of classes to leave school during the day. 
That was shocking news for Sen. Hob Bryan, a Democrat from Amory, who conveyed his disappointment to education officials at the committee meeting. 
“It seems to me that what we’re doing … is signaling to students it’s not really important to come to school,” he said. “We’re shifting from the concept of, there’s an infinite number of things to learn … to something that is so focused on the requirements and testing.”
Districts with the lowest chronic absenteeism rates in the state, all lower than 15%, are Okolona School District, Jefferson County School District, East Jasper School District, New Albany Public Schools and Rankin County School District.
Jackson Public Schools, despite its chronic absenteeism rate of 37.7% district-wide, has the lowest school-specific rate in Mississippi. Just 2.5% of students at McWillie Elementary School are considered chronically absent. 
The state’s highest chronic absenteeism rates are in Claiborne County Public Schools, Moss Point School District, Simpson County School District, North Panola School District and Holly Springs. Nearly half of students at the districts are considered chronically absent. 
Smaller schools in districts with high-poverty rates have higher chronic absenteeism rates, data show. 
Superintendents for three of Mississippi’s four school districts under state control — all in areas with large low-income populations — gave presentations to state Board of Education members Thursday, directly tying chronic absenteeism to their academic struggles.
Stanley Ellis from Humphreys County said the school district was incentivizing attendance with ice cream socials, “dress down days” and recognition for students with perfect attendance. 
Yazoo City High School saw a surge in absenteeism at its high school and a 20-point drop in graduation rates, said Superintendent Earl Watkins. He stressed that improving the numbers will require a shift in perspective among parents and community members about the importance of attending school and staying the whole day.
“Parent liaisons are calling home when kids aren’t at school,” he said. “We need to change the mindset around kids needing to be at school every day.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/18114610/3X0A8609.jpg,,,2025-10-16 18:03:14.654820

Free.,"National parks, public lands feared at risk of long-term harm as shutdown drags on",Jacob Fischler,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/national-parks-public-lands-feared-risk-long-term-harm-shutdown-drags,,"Bare-bones staffing during the government shutdown across the Interior Department and the U.S. Forest Service is leaving America’s treasured natural assets vulnerable to lasting damage, according to advocates for public lands, including current and former agency employees.National parks and most public lands remain accessible to visitors, including those run by the National Park Service, Bureau of Land Management and Fish and Wildlife Service. But the lack of staff already has led to reports of bad behavior, like illegal camping and BASE jumping at California’s Yosemite National Park, and parks advocates and workers told States Newsroom they fear more to come as the shutdown that began Oct. 1 continues with no end in sight.Adjustments to park staff meant to “front-load visitor services” hide some of the long-term harms, said John Garder, the senior director of budget and appropriations at the advocacy group National Parks Conservation Association. The NPS furloughed more than 9,000 of its roughly 14,500 workers, according to a planning document published just before the shutdown began on Oct. 1. That has left the people responsible for protecting ""irreplaceable resources” and trail management workers needing to instead clean visitor centers and oversee parking, Garder said.“What that's done is created this facade for the visitors, so that in many cases they don't see the damage that's happening behind the scenes,” he said in a phone interview Wednesday.Should parks be closed?The NPCA, a nonprofit that advocates for national parks, has called for parks to close during the shutdown to avoid lasting damage. Others in the conservation community have joined in.Aaron Weiss, the deputy director of the conservation advocacy group Center for Western Priorities, likened the situation to allowing visitors to ramble through an unstaffed Smithsonian museum.“The national parks are effectively museums,” he said. “This would be like the Smithsonian saying, ‘Well, you know, we don't have the staff to keep the Smithsonian museum staffed, but we'll go ahead and leave the gates, the doors open, and come in and take a look, do what you want.’ “That would be horrifically irresponsible of the Smithsonian, but that is exactly what the National Park Service is saying.”The nature of many park sites makes closing difficult. The largest parks, comprising sprawling lands, often lack comprehensive fencing or other ways to keep people out. Public lands outside the Park Service, including those managed by BLM and the Forest Service, are even less likely to have barriers to entry.Still, the Interior Department under President Donald Trump has prioritized keeping parks open to an extent other administrations have not planned for during shutdowns, by transferring funds meant for park maintenance to be used for operations.Interior Secretary Doug Burgum has downplayed reports of improper behavior in the parks while blaming the closures on congressional Democrats who have mostly opposed a stopgap spending bill that would reopen the government. Democrats want Republicans to negotiate on expiring health care tax credits.“Of course, all of our many sites…. would be better operated and better staffed if the Senate would just get us back in the government,” Burgum said in a Fox News interview Tuesday. “Way to go, Senate Democrats.”Spokespeople for the NPS did not return messages seeking comment this week. Many communications staff across the federal government have been furloughed during the shutdown and are not legally allowed to respond to messages.BLM spokeswoman Alyse Sharpe said in an email that the agency would “keep public lands as accessible as possible” during the shutdown. “Critical functions that protect life, property, and public health will remain in place, including visitor access in many locations, law enforcement, and emergency response,” she wrote.Sharpe did not respond to questions about the concerns over lands’ long-term health.‘Demoralizing’ atmosphereMeanwhile, the shutdown has accelerated a drop in morale for the federal workforce responsible for public lands, at least some of whom are exasperated by what they see as the Trump administration’s failure to value their work. More than half of Interior’s nearly 60,000 employees have been furloughed during the shutdown. That reality, on top of staff reductions earlier this year and threatened additional layoffs by Trump and White House budget director Russ Vought, have added to a sense for many resource managers that the administration doesn’t place a priority on their jobs.Chris Tollefson, a former communications official at the BLM and the Fish and Wildlife Service who took a buyout this year after a nearly 27-year run at the Interior agencies, said the administration’s posture was “demoralizing” for the agencies’ career employees who consider their work on behalf of public lands a calling.“The people I know get into this because they care passionately about the land and about the resources they protect,” he said. “Most of them have deep roots in the communities they come from, and it's really demoralizing to feel like your life's work has been devalued and that what you're doing doesn't matter, that the people in charge feel like it doesn't matter. So it's been really hard.”One furloughed Interior Department worker, who requested her identity be withheld because she is not authorized to speak to reporters, said the department may have trouble attracting qualified employees in the future.“I came to the government to get a little bit more stability, thinking that it was going to be a safer bet,” the furloughed worker said. “And that has definitely not been the case. It's not felt as stable as other positions. … I think a lot of folks that are with the federal government are there because of the perception of stability. When you take away that perception of stability, those positions aren't going to be quite as attractive to talent that you would have attracted.”Oil and gas permitting continuesFurther irritating advocates of conservation, the shutdown has not slowed oil and gas development despite furloughs of staff responsible for science and recreation.As of Oct. 15, the BLM had issued an average of 19.8 oil and gas permits per day since the shutdown began at the start of the month. That’s roughly on par with a typical month during Trump’s second administration, and represents the highest per-day average since May, according to an analysis of publicly available data by Weiss.“It's a statement of values,” Weiss said. “The Interior Department is telling the agency and telling America, ‘The folks who manage drilling on public lands are more important than the folks who actually do the day-to-day caring for our public lands.’ You don't have the biologists, you don't have the land managers, you don't have the folks doing the trail maintenance. Those folks have all been furloughed, but the folks doing the oil and gas permitting are somehow essential.”Agencies and departments can list some workers as exempt from furloughs. Those employees are kept on the job, though they generally do not receive paychecks until the government is reopened. In a post to Instagram on the first day of the shutdown, the Interior Department said it would continue issuing permits “and other efforts related to American Energy Dominance” despite a lapse in appropriations.",,,,2025-10-16 18:03:14.654820

The issue plays a central role in ongoing negotiations for the state’s struggling flagship medical institution, UConn Health, to acquire Waterbury Hospital currently owned by Prospect. The acquisition is part of a UConn Health expansion plan, which also includes the proposed acquisition of two independent hospitals, Bristol Hospital and Day Kimball Hospital in Putnam. 
Earlier this month, the University of Connecticut’s Board of Trustees and the UConn Health Board of Directors authorized a bid of up to $13 million to acquire Waterbury Hospital — along with its land and buildings. Some level of tax forgiveness will also be part of the deal, Scanlon confirmed.
But right now, the parties can’t even agree on what Prospect owes.
“Tax liability was always going to be factored into the ultimate purchase price of this hospital as part of the negotiation,” Scanlon said. “The reason why it’s hard to give a definitive number is because that is being negotiated right now as part of this bankruptcy.”
Spokespeople with Medical Properties Trust and Prospect Medical Holdings did not respond to requests for comment. 
Prospect Medical Holdings filed for bankruptcy protection in January, and the sale of its hospitals around the country is being overseen by the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Northern Texas. The hospital’s landlord, Alabama-based Medical Properties Trust, has played a key role in the negotiations of the hospital sales.
In 2019, Medical Properties Trust, one of the country’s biggest hospital landlords, purchased the land and buildings of Prospect’s hospitals in Connecticut, California and Pennsylvania for $1.4 billion. The deal, referred to as a “sale-leaseback,” helped to fund a $457 million dividend to Prospect’s private equity owners and investors, but left the three Connecticut hospitals with a new expense: rent payments to MPT. 
MPT also owned the hospital buildings of the Steward Health Care system — a for-profit chain that operated hospitals in multiple states, including Massachusetts, and also filed for bankruptcy protection.
When Prospect filed for bankruptcy, Gov. Ned Lamont insisted that he didn’t think keeping the hospitals open would require “taxpayer subsidies.” Now, the state seems poised to forgive millions of dollars in unpaid taxes to facilitate the UConn deal.
Spokespeople for Lamont did not respond to a request for comment. 
The tax forgiveness would require legislative approval. 
In conversations earlier this week, House Speaker Matt Ritter, D-Hartford, said the legislature would likely approve waiving Prospect’s tax bill.
“If we want to support UConn Health’s taking over the hospital then we will have to if it’s part of the deal,” Ritter said. “Otherwise you have to consider the alternatives — that the hospital could potentially close or some other private equity firm could come in and buy it.”
House Minority Leader Vincent Candelora, R-North Branford, said that while he agrees it’s vital to consider the needs of the state’s health care system, he’s not going to give a deal the OK before seeing the details.
“I’m not going to make it easy for Prospect to get the best deal they can. So if they think that the legislature is just going to rubber-stamp because we’re desperate, they’re wrong,” Candelora said. “I think it’s important for us as legislators to make it very clear that what Prospect did to the state of Connecticut hospital systems is egregious.”
What does Prospect owe?
In December 2023, the state’s Department of Revenue Services filed liens showing Prospect Medical Holdings had neglected to pay $67 million in taxes.
During a press conference in January of this year hosted by Gov. Ned Lamont, Attorney General William Tong said Prospect owed Connecticut “more than $100 million.” 
CT Mirror reached out to DRS to clarify Prospect’s current tax liability. 
DRS spokesperson Tiffany Thiele said the agency cannot disclose what Prospect owes in taxes because the department is prohibited by statute from releasing “taxpayer information, including liabilities.”
Earlier this week, CT Mirror reported that the state plans to borrow $390 million to fund the expansion of UConn Health. The funding would primarily go towards capital improvement projects at all three hospitals, though it would also support the acquisition of Waterbury Hospital, Scanlon said. Funding to acquire Bristol and Day Kimball hospitals would be handled separately, he added.
Waterbury Hospital, in particular, would need a major influx of capital funding to bring it up to the state’s standards for its medical facilities, Scanlon said.
“There are significant capital expenditure needs to maintain what I would say is the level of public health care that our citizens deserve and expect. And, frankly, that’s not possible in the condition that this hospital is in right now,” he said.
Also at issue are taxes owed to municipalities. As of January 2025, Prospect and MPT owed upwards of $23 million to Waterbury, Manchester, Vernon and South Windsor, according to a report from the Journal Inquirer. 
Waterbury accounted for over $20 million of the funds owed. At the time, MPT had filed a tax appeal regarding the appraised value of the hospital building at 64 Robbins Street, according to city officials. 
The city of Waterbury’s Director of Finance Michael LeBlanc said negotiations are “ongoing” and “confidential.”
“There have been ongoing negotiations between the City’s Representing Counsel and Debtor’s Counsel in furtherance of reaching a settlement on the real and personal property taxes,” LeBlanc said in emailed comments. “We cannot comment further at this time.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/2023_0927_SR_WaterburyHospital_027-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-10-16 18:03:14.654820
,Connecticut Mirror,2025-10-16 21:16:05+00:00,CT Mirror,Bridgeport student assault raises questions about walking distance to school,Emilia Otte,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/10/16/bridgeport-walk-school-student-assault/,"Bridgeport high schoolers are expected to walk up to 2 miles before being eligible for the bus, which one parent called ‘ridiculously long.","The sexual assault of a Bridgeport teen during her Tuesday morning walk to the high school has raised concerns about the distance that some students in the urban district must travel on foot each day. 
The teenager who was assaulted on Railroad Avenue in Bridgeport was on her way to the new Bassick High School on the University of Bridgeport campus. The road where she was assaulted runs alongside a raised railroad track and through an industrial district. 
Bridgeport Police charged 28-year-old Cordero Javier Greaves later that day with first-degree sexual assault, risk of injury to a minor, illegal sexual contact with a person under 16 years of age, first-degree unlawful restraint and second-degree threatening. 
In Bridgeport, high school students are expected to walk up to 2 miles before they are eligible for a bus ride, while elementary students are expected to walk up to 1 mile — distances that are consistent with other urban districts and state guidance on the issue. 
The assault has sparked enough concern that the Bridgeport Board of Education is planning to hold a special meeting next week to discuss busing and student safety, said board member Albert Benejan Grajales.
“It’s our concern and it’s our priority right now,” said Benejan Grajales.
Connecticut state law requires school districts to provide transportation when it is “reasonable and desirable.” But state guidelines published in 2022 leave specific details like walking distances up to local school boards. Although the 2022 document does not give any distance recommendation, a 2008 document showing sample policies for districts recommended the maximum walking distance for students be 1 mile for children in grades K through 3, 1.5 miles for students in grades 4 through 8, and 2 miles for high school students. 
Hartford Public Schools and Waterbury Public Schools also list their maximum walking distance for high schoolers as 2 miles; in New Haven, the distance is 1.5 miles. 
The 2022 document does note that a district can make exceptions for students who could encounter “hazardous conditions” on their way to school. 
“This heartbreaking assault on a young student is deeply concerning. Decisions about walking distances and student transportation are made locally, and we trust that districts will take all local conditions into consideration—especially student safety—as they review and implement their transportation policies,” State Department of Education spokesperson Matt Cerrone said in a statement Thursday.
This is not a new issue for the district. Over the summer, Bridgeport officials, hoping to save $4.6 million, approved cuts to the education transportation budget that would have increased the distance some 629 high school students had to walk to school from 2 to 2.5 miles.
The cuts didn’t sit well with everyone on the Board of Education, with one member calling the increased walking distances “really concerning” because kids would be forced “to walk on dangerous streets without sidewalks,” according to published reports, but the board approved the distance changes anyway. 
A sudden infusion of funding from the city and state in late August, however, allowed the district to keep existing bus routes intact. The state Department of Education, which contributed $825,000 for transportation costs, also worked with the district to renegotiate its busing contract in a way that “restores and streamlines” the bus routes the district planned to cut, according to a press release. 
Despite the last-minute funding from the state, Board of Education members voted in September to rewrite their policy to increase the maximum walking distance by half a mile for all students. 
“The reason we’re doing this is because, yes, transportation was saved for this year only, but there was no guaranteed funding for next year in the budget to maintain those distances,” Joseph Sokolovic, a member of the Board of Education, said during an August meeting when the policy was discussed. 
It is unclear whether that policy will be changed in the wake of the sexual assault.
Callie Heilmann, parent of a student in Bridgeport Public Schools and founder and president of Bridgeport Generation Now, said that hearing about the assault made her feel sick, but not surprised. 
“ There really is no safe walk to school if you’re coming from the West Side, West End, Black Rock neighborhood to Bassick,” she said. “The most direct route takes you along the highway, along the railroad, into industrial-zoned areas that are not pedestrian friendly at all, and they’re not even frequented by people. There’s barely any car traffic over there.” 
This fall, Bassick High School opened its newly constructed building. The old school is located roughly a mile away on Fairfield Avenue. Heilmann said the change made a difference. 
“This high school used to be centrally located in the middle of a neighborhood, and now it’s not. It’s far from all the neighborhoods that it’s zoned for,” she said. 
Heilmann also expressed concern about the distances that students in Bridgeport are expected to walk before they qualify for busing, saying that 2 miles is “ridiculously long,” particularly for high schoolers who might be walking in the dark, early morning hours. 
Another parent, Becky, who asked to be identified only by her first name in order to protect her daughter’s privacy, said her child is friends with the student who was assaulted. Becky said that her daughter used to walk less than 10 minutes to get to school at the Fairfield Avenue campus. 
Now that the school moved to the University of Bridgeport campus, she said, her daughter’s commute to school on foot is 40 minutes and 30 minutes on a bike. 
Becky said she disagreed with the new location of the school. 
“It’s a very high crime area. There’s a lot of drug addicts that hang out on the corners that she has to walk past every single day,” she said. “It’s not safe at all and there’s no crossing guards.” 
Becky said her daughter has been afraid to walk to school alone since her friend was assaulted, and that she’s been driving her back and forth. “It’s kind of hard with me, because I have to be in work by six and I really can’t drop her off at seven,” she said.
Leslie Caraballo, a former Democratic candidate for the Board of Education, told CT Mirror that she felt parents have been left in the dark about the incident.  
Like Heilmann, Caraballo said the new location of Bassick High School is in a more dangerous area than the Fairfield Avenue location, requiring students to walk underneath an underpass to get to the school. She disagrees with the policy change that would lengthen the walking distance to 2.5 miles.
“Just because they’re high schoolers does not mean anything. They’re still students. They’re still kids,” she said. 
She also criticized the Board of Education for cuts to school staff, like counselors, who could help students work through their feelings in the aftermath of the incident.  
“We have a serious situation going on and now we don’t even have people to handle the students properly to make sure that they’re okay,” she said. 
But Board of Education member Willie Medina disagreed that the assault had any connection to the new location of the school. Instead, he said it was a singular, isolated incident. 
“In a perfect world, do we want to have a crossing guard in every corner? Absolutely,” Medina said. But he added that high schoolers would have to walk the same streets whether they were attending Bassick High School in its former location or where it is currently located. 
Lawmakers who spoke to CT Mirror this week were hesitant when asked whether the state should create a statewide maximum walking distance for students.
State Rep. Antonio Felipe, D-Bridgeport, a member of the education committee, said that while “obviously anything we can do to make sure we protect our young people from violence is important,” he wanted to make sure the facts of the assault are known before lawmakers consider drafting legislation to address the problem. 
Felipe noted that the state was able to supply Bridgeport Public Schools with enough funding to cover their transportation costs this year, and said he hopes the state will be able to continue that funding over the next few years. 
State Sen. Eric Berthel, R-Watertown, ranking member on the Education Committee, said he understood that further walking distances for students could lead to higher absenteeism, and said that busing students was “the safest thing to do.” 
But Berthel said he was concerned that creating a statewide walking distance maximum would force additional transportation costs onto the districts. 
“The reality is that we may have more of a Bridgeport problem than a problem that is affecting all of Connecticut,” Berthel said. 
Asked whether districts should be given more money to fund transportation, Berthel said the legislature needed to look more closely at costs and budgeting in the school districts before making the decision to allocate more money. He said the state has allocated more money per student in the largest urban districts than anywhere else in Connecticut. 
Bridgeport officials had nothing to say publicly about the issue this week. Communications officials for Bridgeport Public Schools referred questions to a spokesperson for the City of Bridgeport. That spokesperson, Shawnna White, said she could not comment on concerns about the distance students are walking or the school’s location.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/BRIDGEPORT-SPED-COMPLAINT-0807-DE-006-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-16 18:03:14.654820

Ron DeSantis and Chief Financial Officer Blaise Ingoglia promising Floridians a chance to substantially reduce if not outright eliminate property taxes, eight Republican members of the Florida House filed legislation Thursday to achieve that goal.
All but one of the measures were filed as joint resolutions, meaning that if 3/5ths of the Legislature approves them in both chambers, they would appear on the 2026 statewide ballot, where they must get 60% support to become law.
All of the measures have language that specifically prohibits local governments from reducing funding for law enforcement. They all exempt school taxes. Property taxes comprise around 46% of school funding, according to the Florida Education Association.
Some are wider ranging than others, and it remains to be seen how many of these proposals will get through the Legislature and arrive on DeSantis’ desk. The governor said in Jacksonville earlier this month that if he isn’t particularly enamored by what the Legislature proposes, he could call a special session during the summer to address the issue.
He added it was important to write an amendment(s) in a manner “that resonates with people” and not “written in legislative, bureaucratic speak.”
House Speaker Daniel Perez said in a memo that the ultimate decision on what should happen doesn’t belong with elected officials, but the public at large.
“If we have faith in the voters to elect us, we should not be afraid to let them be a part of the conversation about the taxes they pay,” he said. “It is our position that the House does not need to limit itself in presenting one single plan, but instead allow the people of Florida the ability to choose some, all, or none of the proposals on the 2026 ballot.”
The most expansive measure is a joint resolution (HJR 201) sponsored by Republican Kevin Steele, R-Dade City, which would eliminate all non-school homestead property taxes.
A joint resolution (HJR 203) filed by Republican Monique Miller, R-Palm Bay, would phase out non-school homestead property taxes annually over ten years.
Miami-Dade Republican Juan Porras has filed a joint resolution (HJR 205) that would exempt Florida residents over the age of 65 from paying non-school homestead property taxes.
Florida law now allows up to $50,000 to be deducted from the assessed value of a primary or permanent residence. The first $25,000 of value is entirely exempt. The second $25,000 exemption applies to the value between $50,000-$75,000 and does not include a benefit on the school tax. Some of the proposals would provide additions to those homestead exemptions.
Rep. Shane Abbott, R-DeFuniak Springs, has filed a joint resolution (HJR 207) that would create a new homestead exemption for non-school property taxes equal to 25% of the assessed value of the House.
Rep. Demi Busatta, R-Miami Dade, has filed a joint resolution (HJR 209) that would create a new property insurance relief homestead exemption of $100,000 — as long as the property is covered by a comprehensive “multiperil” property insurance policy.
Under Florida’s Save Our Homes benefit, the maximum amount of a portability transfer from a single homestead is $500,000. However under a proposal (HJR 211) filed by Rep. Toby Overdorf, R-Palm City, that cap on portability would be eliminated, allowing a homeowner to transfer their entire accumulated Save Our Homes benefit to their new home, even if that home has a lesser value.
Overdorf is co-chair of the House Select Committee on Property Taxes, formed by Speaker Perez earlier this year to craft potential constitutional amendments on property tax reduction.
Rep. Philip “Griff” Griffitts, R-Panama City Beach, has filed a joint resolution (HJR 213) to limit the growth in assessed value of non-school homestead property to 3% over three years (it’s now 3% per year) and 15% over three years for non-homestead property (it’s 10% per year now).
The only bill filed to address property tax reduction that would only need to pass the Legislature and get signed by the governor to become law is a measure (HB 215) filed by Rep. Jon Albert, R-Frostproof, that would make various statutory changes including requiring a 2/3 vote for any increase in the millage rate by a local government and allow newly married couples to combined their accumulated Save Our Homes benefits, not exceeding a total of $500,000.
Perez noted that the joint resolutions won’t have “accompanying implementing legislation,” meaning there would be no need for the Legislature to do anything more. But he did say that decisions “should be made by the Legislature once they know which proposals have been approved by the voters and can devise an appropriate statutory framework that accounts for how the various provisions might work together.”

(Micah Drew/Daily Montanan)A federal judge in Missoula dismissed a youth-led climate change lawsuit challenging several presidential executive orders on the grounds the district court did not have jurisdiction to provide the sweeping relief asked for by the plaintiffs. 
Judge Dana Christensen on Wednesday issued an order “reluctantly” dismissing Lighthiser v. Trump, saying the scope of the requests made by 22 young people seeking relief from fossil fuel-driven climate change was “an unworkable request.”
“While this Court is certainly troubled by the very real harms presented by climate change and the Challenged EOs’ effect on carbon dioxide emissions, this concern does not automatically confer upon it the power to act,” Christensen wrote. 
Granting the plaintiffs request to roll back executive orders and subsequent agency actions would require the court to “monitor an untold number of federal agency actions to determine whether they contravene its injunction,” the order wrote. “This is, quite simply, an unworkable request.”
Lighthiser v. Trump is the latest of a series of youth-led climate change lawsuits brought by Our Children’s Trust, an Oregon-based advocacy law firm. 
Judges at the federal level have similarly dismissed other cases brought by the organization, namely Juliana v. United States, which Christensen cited extensively in his order. 
But other state-focused cases with youth plaintiffs have been successful. In 2023, a district court judge in Montana ruled in favor of plaintiffs in Held v. Montana, which found Montanans have a constitutional right to a clean and healthful environment that is infringed on if the state ignores potential impacts of greenhouse gas emissions. Youth won another case in Hawaii against that state’s Department of Transportation. 
Plaintiffs from Juliana and Held, along with youth from Florida, California, Hawaii and Oregon, joined together in Lighthiser to sue the Trump administration over the president’s executive orders aimed at supporting the fossil fuel industry, curbing renewable energy and suppressing climate science.
During a two-day hearing in September, attorneys for the plaintiffs argued for an injunction against the three orders, as well as an order halting roughly a dozen federal agencies from implementing any policies related to the orders. 
Meanwhile, the Justice Department, backed by several states including Montana, which joined the lawsuit, argued Christensen should dismiss the case, saying plaintiffs lacked standing and were asking the court to set federal environmental policy. 
“It’s unprecedented,” federal attorney Michael Sawyer said during the hearing. “There is no basis in law for stepping in and going back,” to a previous administration’s policies. 
Several youth plaintiffs testified to the harms they suffer from climate change, including increased experiences with environmental disasters, respiratory issues exacerbated by wildfires and heat waves, and concerns that their future families and careers could be jeopardized by federal actions. 
 In addition, many expert witnesses testified as well, including Steven Running, a renowned climate scientist who said every additional ton of greenhouse gas emissions would hasten climate change, and the plaintiffs’ injuries.

In his order, Christensen said the court was presented with “overwhelming evidence that the climate is changing at a staggering pace, and that this change stems from the rise in atmospheric carbon dioxide, caused by the production and burning of fossil fuels.”
The court record, he wrote “demonstrates that climate change and the exposure from fossil fuels presents a children’s health emergency,” and that implementing Trump’s executive orders “will increase the concentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide, thereby exacerbating the harms plaintiffs experience from an already-warming climate.”
But despite his findings that the plaintiffs adequately showed they have injuries that can be concretely traced to increased fossil fuel production as sought by the federal government, their requests for relief exceeded the court’s authority, a concern he had raised during the hearing.
“At the heart of Plaintiffs’ request is that the Court wind back the clock to the regulatory framework that existed on January 19, 2025,” Christensen wrote. 
And while preventing an estimated 205 million metric tons of annual greenhouse gas emissions tied to the executive orders is enough to consider addressing the complaint, Christensen said it would be nearly impossible to “scrutinize every climate-related agency action taken” by the federal government to determine if it was following an injunction. 
“Plaintiffs effectively seek to enjoin not just three executive orders, but also tens — if not hundreds — of policy decisions, regulations and projects promulgated by 12 Federal agencies,” he wrote. “Plaintiffs’ request effectively amounts to hundreds of lawsuits being brought in a single case.”
Julia Olson, chief legal counsel at Our Children’s Trust, said the legal team would appeal Christensen’s decision. 
“Every day these executive orders remain in effect, these 22 young Americans suffer irreparable harm to their health, safety, and future. The judge recognized that the government’s fossil fuel directives are injuring these youth, but said his hands were tied by precedent,” Olson said in a press release. “We will appeal—because courts cannot offer more protection to fossil fuel companies seeking to preserve their profits than to young Americans seeking to preserve their rights. This violates not only the Constitution and Supreme Court precedent, but the most basic principles of justice.“

The Lighthiser suit named Trump as a defendant along with 11 federal agencies and their respective agency heads, including the Department of Energy, Department of Transportation, Environmental Protection Agency and NASA.

The Conservation Law Foundation filed a notice of intent to sue the Vorsteveld Farm for pesticides flowing into Dead Creek and Lake Champlain.

Photo courtesy of the Addison Unit of the Vermont Superior Court
A major dairy in Addison County learned on Thursday that a pair of environmental nonprofits intended to sue the farm for violating the federal Clean Water Act.
The nonprofits alleged Vorsteveld Farm, a concentrated animal feeding operation in Panton, has poured pesticides directly into Dead Creek, a tributary of Lower Otter Creek and Lake Champlain, according to the notice of intent to sue, but did not have a legally required federal pollution permit for those discharges. The chemicals from the farm have exceeded state and federal safety standards and could be harmful to human and environmental health, the notice alleged.
The dairy, owned by brothers Gerard, Hans and Rudy Vorsteveld, has 60 days to respond. If they don’t voluntarily take actions to clean up its operations and cease the alleged pollution of Vermont’s waterways, the Conservation Law Foundation, an advocacy group in New England that filed the notice along with the Vermont Natural Resources Council, a nonprofit dedicated to protecting Vermont’s environment, could file a formal lawsuit. 
“Our state economy heavily depends on the health of our waterways, and no farm should be allowed to pollute at these exceptionally high levels,” said Lauren Hierl, executive director of the Vermont Natural Resources Council, in a press statement. 
Gerard Vorsteveld did not respond to a phone call from VTDigger by the time of publication.
Claudine Safar, an attorney who represents the Vorstevelds, said she and her clients didn’t have adequate time to review the notice to comment on Thursday.
Vijay Nazareth, the executive director of the Champlain Valley Farmer Coalition, a farmer advocacy group that includes Vorsteveld Farm, said in an email that it was too early to comment on the impact the notice could have on the farm or the farming community.

Vorsteveld Farm has almost 3,000 cows that annually produce almost 20 million gallons of liquid manure and waste. Some of that waste is stored in lagoons before it’s spread on almost 300 acres of cropland, including corn and soybeans, according to the farm’s permit application to expand. In July, the state approved a permit to expand the farm by almost 600 cows, adding more than 6 million gallons of manure to its waste stream every year.
The manure, pesticides and fertilizer can move underground through an extensive series of pipes installed beneath the cropland. The system, known as tile drains, can work to empty water from fields faster.  Such systems are implemented to conserve farmland and water quality under the Natural Resources Conservation Service, a federal agency dedicated to conserving natural resources through agricultural practices. But pollutants applied to the surface can also drain out into the water. Outfall pipes from those drainage systems discharge into Dead Creek and other waters, the organizations allege.  
The argument could be an uphill battle for the environmental nonprofits after a September decision by the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals determined that water discharged through agricultural drains were exempt from federal permitting requirements.
“That 9th circuit decision is not applicable to the facts here,” Elena Mihaly, vice president of the Conservation Law Foundation, said in a text.
The state was actively reviewing the notice, Julie Moore, secretary for the Agency of Natural Resources, said on Thursday. 
“To my knowledge, this is a pretty novel argument in Vermont that CLF has raised regarding the management and regulation of tile drainage,” Moore said.
Since April 2024, the nonprofits spent two years working with Burlington-based engineering firm VHB to collect 92 water samples from public access points to the Vorsteveld pipes. According to the notice, 99 percent of those samples contained clothianidin, a neonicotinoid insecticide that can hurt pollinator populations, at concentrations exceeding the EPA’s safety benchmark. Atrazine, an herbicide linked to birth defects and cancers, according to the notice, was found in concentrations that are 50 times higher than what the EPA considers safe for drinking water. 
The Conservation Law Foundation has never sued the Vorstevelds before, but the farm faced a previous lawsuit by neighbors who were concerned about the impact of the farm on local water quality. After the state Supreme Court found the farm failed to reduce runoff onto a neighbor’s land, the court also found the brothers in contempt of court by failing to reduce pollution in May. 
“Unregulated pollution poses a grave risk to people, plants, and wildlife in our communities,” Mihaly wrote in a press statement. “No one should have to worry that a major agricultural operation next door is poisoning their water.”
The farm is also facing an ongoing case from the Environmental Protection Agency alleging that, when the Vorstevelds ripped up their fields to install the tile drains, they failed to secure a permit to fill a federally protected wetland on their property. 
The notice letter is meant to begin the conversation with the Vorstevelds, Mihaly said Thursday. The nonprofits want the farm to join them, and likely the state, in finding a solution: likely applying for coverage under a Clean Water Act permit. 
Vermont’s Agency of Natural Resources was subject to an earlier complaint by the Conservation Law Foundation that alleged the state was failing to enforce the Clean Water Act. The complaint led to enforcement actions from the Environmental Protection Agency. The state now has to fix the way it monitors farms that are considered concentrated animal feeding operations, and the agency is working to shore up their permit program for large farms like the Vorstevelds. Such a permit for a concentrated animal feeding operation could draw down the farm’s pollution over time, Mihaly said.
But the law foundation had no indication that those permits would include regulations for discharges from these particular pipes at this particular farm, Mihaly said. Without those assurances, the nonprofit decided to bring its own enforcement action. 
“The legal amount of pollution is zero without a permit,” Mihaly said. She said the law foundation was not currently looking into legal challenges at any other farms.

(uscoastguard.maps.arcgis.com)Guided by the comments of more than 3,000 New England boaters and advocates, the U.S. Coast Guard has scaled back plans to remove hundreds of navigational buoys across the region, including in Rhode Island.
Rhode Island is now poised to lose 20 buoys, rather than 37, under a revised plan unveiled by the Coast Guard in September. Across the Northeast, the maritime agency is looking to remove 233 buoys from federal waters, down from an original 350.
The Coast Guard will add lighting and sound signals to nearly one-third of those still slated to be discontinued to help reduce negative impacts for mariners. 
The Coast Guard maintains roughly 400 buoys across Rhode Island. The buoys targeted for removal in the revised plan are identified online in an interactive map.

The Coast Guard billed the removal of navigational markers as an embrace of modern technology, targeting the oldest buoys that were put in place before modern GPS systems. But mariners, environmental groups and lawmakers, including U.S. Sen Jack Reed, criticized the cuts, which they said could compromise safety for boaters who rely on the markers in bad weather, and when GPS systems are unavailable.
Reed touted the results of public feedback in a statement on Thursday, while urging affected mariners to continue to write in during a reopened public comment period.
“Rhode Islanders know these waters best and their voices have already made a difference,” Reed said. “Because of strong public participation earlier this year, the Coast Guard scaled back its removal list by nearly half. That shows how important it is for mariners, fishermen, and harbor officials to speak up again.  Even during a government shutdown, this comment window is open — and every perspective matters.”
The U.S. Coast Guard will continue to accept written public comments on its navigation plan changes through Nov. 15. 
Coast Guard officials specifically would like those providing feedback to indicate “the size and type of your vessel, how you use the buoys to navigate and the distance at which you start looking for and using it.”

Don Davis (D-N.C.) (Source: ncleg.gov)Republican legislative leaders in North Carolina unveiled a mid-decade redistricting proposal aimed at drawing out Rep. Don Davis (D-N.C.) ahead of an expected vote next week.
Under the current map, Davis’s 1st District voted Democratic in the 2020 presidential race by a little over 1%. The new map redraws it to create a district that voted roughly 55% Republican to 44% Democratic in the 2024 presidential election — putting him at a more than 10 percentage point deficit.

This represents Republicans’ second attempt to draw Davis out, after a new map drawn in 2023 changed his district to one that voted 52% to 46% in favor of Republicans in the 2022 U.S. Senate campaign. But Davis still won reelection in 2024 by a margin of about 50% to 48%.
Under the new map, the 11th Congressional District held by Rep. Chuck Edwards (R-N.C.) is set to become the closest in the state, with a margin of just under 54% Republican votes to 44% Democratic in the 2024 presidential race. It would be the only district in the state decided by less than 10% of the vote, leaving North Carolina with no swing districts.
Davis did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The map comes three days after House Speaker Destin Hall (R-Caldwell) and Senate President Pro Tem Phil Berger (R-Rockingham) announced an agreement to draw up a new map, responding to President Donald Trump’s call to Republicans across the country to eliminate Democratic seats wherever possible to help maintain Republican control of the U.S. House in the 2026 midterms.
“President Trump earned a clear mandate from the voters of North Carolina and the rest of the country, and we intend to defend it by drawing an additional Republican Congressional seat,” Hall said in a statement Monday.

“The #NCGA is ready to help Republicans secure Congress and move @realDonaldTrump’s agenda forward!” Berger wrote in a statement on social media after the map’s release Thursday.
Democratic leaders in the state and around the country have condemned the move as antidemocratic. House Democratic Leader Robert Reives (D-Chatham) called it “stealing a congressional district” while Gov. Josh Stein said Monday that the state’s Republicans are “failing you, the voters.”
“These shameless politicians are abusing their power to take away yours. I will always fight for you because the voters should choose their representatives, not the other way around,” Stein said in a statement.
Hall’s office stated in a press release announcing public comment has opened on the map that both the House and Senate expect to consider it next week. Only a simple majority is required to pass the new map, which Republicans easily hold in both chambers, and it is not subject to the governor’s veto — rendering the map’s passage a foregone conclusion.

(Getty Images)Despite facing no challengers thus far in his 2026 re-election campaign, Attorney General Raúl Torrez, a Democrat, raised over $385,000 between April and September, according to the latest campaign filings.
His total campaign haul so far ranks third in the state, according to the New Mexico Secretary of State’s office, behind the two Democratic frontrunners in the gubernatorial primary: former U.S. Interior Secretary Deb Haaland and Bernalillo County District Attorney Sam Bregman, who have already raised millions.
Including $114,000 from his first election in 2022, Torrez has more than $622,000 cash on hand, which includes 800 individual donations in the past year. His top donors include Brady Lovelady, the Perfection Honda dealer based in Rio Rancho; The New Beginnings, which offers residential and other care for people with disabilities based in Albuquerque; and the Parnall Law Firm.
Statewide candidates’ most recent campaign reports in advance of the June 2, 2026 primary election were due Oct. 14. They won’t file again until next year.
Lieutenant governor
So far, three Democratic candidates and one Republican have declared candidacies to become the lieutenant governor. The position is both the state’s second-in-command to step in when the governor is absent and to oversee the New Mexico State Senate during legislative sessions.
Stephanie Garcia Richard, a Democrat and the outgoing New Mexico commissioner of public lands, raised $165,000 from more than 450 individual donors.
“I’m proud and grateful for the outpouring of support,” Garcia Richard said in a statement to Source NM.
Her largest donors include the Fort Sill Apache Tribe, which entered into a land exchange with the state for ancestral lands near Luna County in 2022; Los Alamos resident Karyl Armbruster, a former commissioner on the Public Education Commissioner; and Vicki Gottlieb, an IT consultant from Placitas.
Garcia Richard loaned $5,000 to the campaign and her husband Eric Vasquez lent it another $2,000. She entered the race with $32,000 cash on hand.
Albuquerque Democratic New Mexico State Sen. Harold Pope reported just over $7,000 in donations from just over 50 donors.
Voters reelected Pope to a second term in November to represent Albuquerque’s far northwest side.
Earlier this year, Pope transferred just over $10,000 from his senate reelection campaign. His top donors include fellow Democrat Sen. Antoinette Sedillo Lopez from Albuquerque; and Christopher Jones, a salesperson from Powder Springs, Georgia.
The third Democratic candidate, Loving Village Councilor Jackie Lee Onsurez, reported $350 in total donations from three contributors in September: Joy Bordenave in Alamogordo; Rosie Garcia in Artesia; and Moses Ayoub in El Paso, Texas.
Manny Lardzibal, the only declared Republican candidate so far, reported more than $6,700 in contributions from 16 donors since April. He self-funded nearly half of that with $3,200 in loans to his campaign. His other top donors include Fulcrum Contracting, a Las Cruces-based contracting company; and Hudson, New Mexico retirees David and Gloria Chapman.
Secretary of State
Current Secretary of State Maggie Toulouse Oliver, a Democrat, has served two consecutive terms and cannot run for re-election. So far, three Democrats are vying to replace her. No Republican candidates, as yet, have entered the race.
Rocking the Vote

Amanda López Askin, the Democratic Doña Ana county clerk, reported nearly $147,000 in campaign contributions from more than 600 donors.
Her top donors include Antonia Roybal Mac, an Albuquerque attorney; San Marcos, Texas resident Vina Turner; and the election committee for Albuquerque Democratic Sen. Katy Duhigg.
Katharine Clark, the Democratic Santa Fe county clerk, reported raising more than $81,000 from nearly 900 donors. Her top donors included Laraine Clark, a retiree in Santa Fe; lobbying firm JD Bullington Governmental Relations; and Placitas IT consultant Vicki Gottlieb.
Sonya Smith, a veteran and former New Mexico cabinet member for Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham, reported contributions of just over $10,000 since April from just over 100 donors. Her largest donors included Dewayne Wilcher, a Maryland sales representative; and Virginia State Sen. Angelia Williams Graves. Nearly half of the 47 donors lived in either Maryland or Virginia. Smith, a Democrat, returned to her home state in Virginia to care for her mother in 2022, and returned to New Mexico recently.
Land Commissioner
Juan Sanchez, a former natural resource specialist for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and consultant for the New Mexico Acequia Commission, led the three Democratic candidates in total funds raised in his campaign for state commissioner of public lands. Garcia Richard, the current land commissioner, is termed limited from running for the office again.
Sanchez reported $120,000 in campaign contributions from nearly 400 contributors. All four of his top donors donated the campaign limit maximum of $6,200: New York real estate developer Greg Manocherian; Kennen and Jonathan Bruser from Baton Rouge, Louisiana; and Jacob Bracken, a real estate manager in St. George, Utah.
Democratic Rep. Matthew McQueen (Galisteo) reported just over 300 donations totaling more than $88,000 since April. His largest donors included Alan McQueen, a retired financial advisor in Ranchos Palos Verdes, California; Lynne Horning, a Washington, DC arts education advocate and philanthropist; and Margaret Detwiler, a Santa Fe retiree.
Jonas Moya, a rancher from Tucumcari and former Biden-appointed state director for the Farm Service Agency, reported nearly 150 donors that contributed $22,000 since April. His top donors include Scott Goodman, an Albuquerque realtor; Corey Rivas, an Albuquerque-based campaign consultant; and Peralta-based consulting firm founder Lily Vitela.
Michael Jack Perry, the only declared Republican so far, reported receiving more than $37,000 from nearly 50 donors.
His top donors included Roswell car dealership owner Thomas Krumland – who, according to the documents, donated $12,400, which would exceed campaign limits for non-gubernatorial candidates.
Perry told Source NM that the donation from Krumland came from a joint account with his wife and included the maximum donation of $6,200 from each of them.
“I have a treasurer looking at the records, and I certainly wouldn’t want to do anything inappropriate,” he told Source NM.
A voicemail left at Krumland’s office went unreturned Thursday. An email requesting comment from the Secretary of State’s office remained pending Thursday.
Independent candidate Destiny Mitchel reported no expenses or contributions to her campaign so far. Mitchell is a current Truth or Consequences city commissioner whose term expires in 2026.

The measures were announced Thursday in response to Gov. Jeff Landry’s call for enhanced security earlier this week. 
Interim LSU President Matt Lee did not specify how many more law enforcement officers will be on patrol, saying that more information would be released next week. LSU hosts Texas A&M on Oct. 25 in what will be a midafternoon or night game at Tiger Stadium. 
Lee and LSU Board Chairman Scott Ballard also did not provide information regarding how much the increased security or drone presence would cost, who would be responsible for the bill or which police agency will monitor the drone footage. 
Baton Rouge Police said at least two people exchanged gunfire near Highland Road and Dalrymple Drive as the homecoming game against South Carolina took place Saturday, resulting in minor injuries to two men. A 16-year-old has been arrested in connection with the shooting and charged with attempted first-degree murder, bringing a firearm to a school campus and illegal use of a weapon.
Before Saturday’s game, police said a Jefferson Parish man accidentally shot himself in the leg on South Stadium Drive. Lawrence Hubbard, 18, was arrested after being treated at a hospital and charged with illegal use of a weapon and bringing a firearm on campus.
During the Sept. 13 game against Florida, police responded to shots fired near LSU’s law school. The incident remains under investigation.
Other security measures planned for LSU’s next home game include shutting down an unspecified section of Highland Road. 
Unity Field, a tailgating area at the northeast corner of the intersection of Highland Road and South Stadium Drive, will be fenced off to all tailgates as a result of the violence, Lee said. The area has historically been the gathering spot of Black Greek organizations and other Black student groups. 
“This isn’t about race. This is about place,” Lee said. “We’ve had a place that has been the source of significant problems for us, and so in advisement with law enforcement and with my own cabinet, we decide that we’ll fence that place off.” 
Lee said the shootings have been traced to a student organization tailgate that gave inaccurate information on their request for tailgate permits. The student organization will be subject to discipline, though Lee declined to name the group.
Ballard said the university will also use the increased law enforcement presence to police nonviolent offenses to improve the game-day experience. Anyone caught smoking marijuana at the stadium will be ejected, he said. If they are season ticket holders, they will be prohibited from attending the next game, and anyone caught with illegal amounts of marijuana on campus will be arrested, he added.  
“It’s just an overall sense of disorder that we have to tamp down on, because our priority is a premier game day experience,” Ballard said. 
Lee would not address whether LSU would accept assistance from the Louisiana National Guard if they are deployed in Baton Rouge. Last month, the governor requested President Donald Trump’s support to activate the Guard to address crime in Baton Rouge, New Orleans, Alexandria and Shreveport. 
“I’m not going to speak to that at this moment,” Lee said. “Where we’re working right now is with local and state law enforcement agencies. We’re going to implement that on campus for the next game, and then we’ll see where we go from there.”

(Kevin Mohatt for Colorado Newsline)Colorado election experts say the state will continue to have “gold standard” elections after a former Republican election official purchased Dominion Voting Systems, which provides voting machines in most Colorado counties. 
Scott Leiendecker, a former Republican elections director in St. Louis, purchased Denver-based Dominion and renamed the company Liberty Vote. 
“Liberty Vote is committed to delivering election technology that prioritizes paper-based transparency, security, and simplicity so that voters can be assured that every ballot is filled-in accurately and fairly counted,” Leiendecker said in a statement.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The press release announcing the transition emphasized Liberty Vote’s commitment to election integrity, full American ownership, a focus on paper ballots, and third-party auditing, using language that aligns with so-called election integrity efforts centered around the false claim that the 2020 presidential election was stolen.  
It also said the company will prioritize compliance with President Donald Trump’s executive order on elections, which election experts have said is unconstitutional and has been preemptively blocked by the courts. 
Matt Crane, executive director of the Colorado County Clerks Association, said Colorado elections will look exactly the same as they have following the change of ownership and that Leiendecker assured him the company does not plan to start from scratch. Dominion has changed ownership and changed names several times before, Crane said. 
“We have multiple safeguards in place to make sure that the voting systems are functioning properly and are audited properly,” Crane said. “The product … in counties now, formerly Dominion, now Liberty Vote, is a really, really solid voting system, and nothing’s going to change from that.” 
Of Colorado’s 64 counties, 60 use Dominion voting machines, Crane said. 
Clerks didn’t know about sale 
Colorado law allows counties to change their election equipment providers if they have the money to do it, as Crane said it is a costly process. But he doesn’t anticipate a “mass exodus” away from the Liberty Vote machines following the change in ownership. The timing of the announcement is unfortunate given county clerks are in the middle of administering the 2025 election, Crane said, and they are all still learning about the new company. 
Jack Todd, spokesperson for Colorado Secretary of State Jena Griswold, said her office is “monitoring this development” and looks forward to “continuing Colorado’s gold standard elections.” Crane said Griswold is likely trying to gather information and learn about the new company just like the county clerks are. 
A handful of clerks spoke with Leiendecker in a call Friday, and all Colorado clerks were invited to a larger call with him Monday. Crane said he appreciates that Leiendecker committed time to address concerns from Colorado election officials after they learned about the new company in charge of their election equipment. 
Crane told Leiendecker that he wished election officials knew about the sale before it was publicly announced. 
“If there’s an absence of official information, then the disinformation vacuum is just going to go crazy, and that’s what happened here,” Crane said. “So it should have been, they reached out to us first before going public, and hopefully that’s something that in future communications that they will improve upon.”
That disinformation included claims that Leiendecker is “MAGA,” or aligned with Trump and his administration’s priorities, and that he is an election denier, Crane said. 
Affiliation with Logan Circle Group
Denver Clerk and Recorder Paul López, a Democrat whose elections division uses Dominion voting machines, said he had concerns because of the language in the statement announcing the sale and because of Leiendecker’s affiliation with the Logan Circle Group, a conservative public relations firm. He said the firm’s proximity to the Trump administration and election denialism is what gives him “some pause.” 
“It seemed to validate these debunked election conspiracies,” López said about the announcement. “That’s concerning to me when people use that language.”










Trump’s executive orders are bombastic, and they’re bombastic because of the fact that states run elections. Those executive orders fly in the face of the Constitution, they’re not constitutional.


– Paul López, Denver clerk and recorder


Election officials have been vilified and targeted by “MAGA extremists” the firm represents who believe the 2020 election was stolen, López said. But Leiendecker was sympathetic to the concerns López presented him related to the firm and the commitment to abide by Trump’s executive order. 
“I said I just want to make sure that this move isn’t a move that’s going to compromise our model here, or isn’t going to roll over every time the federal government puts out an executive order,” López said. “Trump’s executive orders are bombastic, and they’re bombastic because of the fact that states run elections. Those executive orders fly in the face of the Constitution, they’re not constitutional.” 
Claims of widespread fraud in recent U.S. elections have been debunked by elections officials, experts, media investigations, law enforcement, and the courts.
Third-party audits
Election deniers who have targeted Dominion will continue those actions even with the change in ownership, Crane said, because those who believe conspiracy theories about the 2020 election “don’t care about fact” and are “willing to steal and cheat to get different political outcomes or policy outcomes.” 
“I think Jesus Christ could come down himself and take ownership of this company and they wouldn’t care,” Crane said. “These people, they don’t care about facts. They don’t care about data. They only care about what their desired outcomes are.” 
Despite his concerns about the new ownership, López said he is still confident in Colorado’s election system, because vendors alone cannot alter a county’s election machines, and those machines have no internet connection. He told Leiendecker that he will explore other vendors for Denver’s election equipment if he starts to see “any kind of change that would compromise the integrity of our elections or trust in our elections.”
“My concern is just making sure that voters have trust in the American electoral system,” López said. “Anything that would come to threaten that or violate that, we don’t want any part of that.”










I think Jesus Christ could come down himself and take ownership of this company and they wouldn’t care ... These people, they don’t care about facts.


– Matt Crane, executive director of the Colorado County Clerks Association


Mesa County Clerk and Recorder Bobbie Gross, a Republican, said she has concerns about third-party auditing, continuation of existing contracts, potential decertification of elections equipment and accessibility under the new company. Leiendecker told clerks on Monday that he plans to use “reputable, independent testing labs such as Idaho National Labs and SLI Compliance,” Gross said. She said existing contracts with Dominion will not change, Colorado does not use any outdated equipment that could be up for decertification, and equipment will continue to comply with Americans with Disabilities Act requirements. 
Colorado voters should see no difference in how local elections are run, Gross said, and Mesa County has no need to replace or update its current equipment. She said the primary change in the sale is the name of the company. 
“If any software updates are introduced in the future, they must first undergo state and federal certification before being implemented,” Gross said in a statement. “It is important for voters to know that every piece of equipment is thoroughly tested with a representative from both major political parties before each election and we audit the elections after to ensure accuracy and integrity.”
The third-party audits Leiendecker plans to implement mirror the current state testing process that ensures the machines’ software works properly, Crane said. They won’t be anything like the dubious Cyber Ninjas “audit” in Arizona following the 2020 election, Crane said.
All paper ballots 
Aly Belknap, executive director of Colorado Common Cause, said state laws and processes put in place by the secretary of state and county clerks govern elections in Colorado, and a vendor cannot change that. 
“The vendor doesn’t determine the type of equipment we use, how voters cast their ballots, and how those ballots are audited,” Belknap said in a statement. “Colorado voters should continue to have confidence in our elections process. Voters rightfully expect that elections will be run fairly — regardless of who is in office or who is on the ballot.”
The clerk’s association has been cynical about Trump’s executive order, Crane said, but in the call with Colorado clerks Leiendecker “made clear that he was talking about the voting systems part” of the order, which Crane said Colorado is already in compliance with because it uses all paper ballots that don’t have barcodes on them. Gross also said Colorado “already meets or exceeds many of the standards” outlined in Trump’s executive order.
“Our focus remains unchanged, we are committed to conducting fair, (secure), accurate and accessible elections for every eligible Colorado voter,” Gross said.

The Connecticut Siting Council — which has the authority over the placement of power plants, transmission lines and other critical infrastructure — voted 5-3 to reject United Illuminating’s application to build its proposed Fairfield to Congress Railroad Transmission Line.
The decision marked the latest twist in the years-long saga over the project, which has been subject to a lawsuit and unsuccessful efforts to get UI to agree to a costlier design that would bury the transmission line underground.
In September, the Siting Council held a non-binding straw poll in which a majority of members signaled their intent to support UI’s application. That was a reversal of the council’s previous stance in June, when a majority of members voted to oppose the project.
There was little public discussion among council members on Thursday to shed light on why several members changed their minds.
The only member who spoke, Brian Golembiewski, said he supported an alternative route previously developed by the Siting Council which has been rejected by the courts.
“This is a tremendous win for Fairfield and Bridgeport, and for every resident who showed up, spoke up, and worked tirelessly in opposition to a project that was damaging to the very foundations of our community,” Fairfield First Selectman Christine Vitale said in a statement. “The Siting Council listened to the people of our communities, and was convinced by the irrefutable facts that this was a flawed design.”
Gov. Ned Lamont, who stepped into the controversy last month by urging the two sides to work out a compromise, also voiced support for the council’s decision to reject UI’s proposal for an overhead line. 
“Our hope is an alternative plan will be presented that minimizes the impacts to these communities while strengthening the reliability of our grid and protects rate payers,” Lamont spokesman Rob Blanchard said in a statement.
A spokesperson for United Illuminating was not immediately available to comment on the decision. 
Prior to the vote on Thursday, local opponents of the project in Fairfield and Bridgeport filed a letter with the Siting Council seeking a 6-month delay in order to allow for more time to attempt to negotiate with the utility over an alternative route. Those talks began last month at Lamont’s urging.
In their letter, however, representatives from the two towns accused UI of being unwilling to negotiate during meetings to discuss potential alternatives.
Bruce L. McDermott, an attorney for UI, rejected that characterization in his own letter to the Siting Council, saying it was was the towns that had failed to put forward their own ideas. That letter asked the Siting Council to reject the proposed delay and proceed with a final vote.
“It is UI’s position that in the more than two years since the application was filed with the Council that the Town and City have failed to present a design alternative that achieves one of the main purposes of the Public Utility Environmental Standards Act: to balance the need for adequate and reliable public utility company services, including electric transmission, at the lowest reasonable cost, with the protection of environmental resources and to minimize damage to scenic, historic and recreational values,” McDermott said in the letter.
Much of the criticism of the project focused on the visual impact of the proposed transmission line, which would have been suspended from steel monopoles up to 195 ft. high. UI’s existing transmission lines in the area are attached to support structures above the Metro-North railroad tracks that officials say are in need of replacement.
The company’s proposed 7.3-mile route for the Fairfield-Congress project would shift the line south of the railroad tracks before crossing parts of Bridgeport’s South End, where it would pass by several churches and historic buildings, including the city’s Freeman Houses.
“These are very dense communities,” said David Scott Parker, an architect whose office in Fairfield’s Southport neighborhood is situated directly in the path of the proposed wires. 
“This line is not going through, you know, a field somewhere where it had no impact,” he added. “It’s hard to imagine anything that would be more impactful than this.”
Burying the transmission lines would add up to $500 million to the project’s existing $300 million price tag, according to estimates provided by UI. Critics argued that the utility’s figures were significantly inflated compared to similar projects.
Under rules established by the regional electric grid, ISO New England, costs associated with building overhead transmission lines can be spread across the nearly 14 million electric customers in the six-state region. If a decision by a state’s siting agencies forces those lines to be buried, however, the additional costs are borne by electric customers in that state alone.
UI did not immediately say Thursday whether it would appeal the Siting Council’s decision, seek some alternative route or abandon the project altogether.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/tranmsission_line.jpeg,,,2025-10-16 17:03:30.608618

Andy Beshear. (Kentucky Lantern photo by Liam Niemeyer)Democratic Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear has joined elected Democrats from other states in suing the Trump administration to stop what they call the  “unlawful termination” of billions of dollars for residential solar projects. 
A press release Wednesday from California Attorney General Rob Bonta stated the cancellation of the $7 billion “Solar for All” program denied states “critical funds they were depending on for solar energy in low-income and disadvantaged communities nationwide.” 
Bonta is among more than a dozen Democratic attorneys general, along with Beshear and Democratic Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, who are plaintiffs in the lawsuits alleging the program’s termination is illegal and unconstitutional.  
When the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency terminated the program in August, Administrator Lee Zeldin in a statement on social media said the agency’s authority to administer the program was eliminated through the passage of a tax-and-spending law signed by Trump this summer. The Associated Press reported Zeldin characterized the program as a “boondoggle.” 
An email received Thursday from the EPA’s press office stated the agency doesn’t comment on pending litigation.
 Congress created the “Solar for All” program through the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act, and the program aimed to expand residential solar energy projects to hundreds of thousands of low-income households across the country. 
Kentucky officials planned to use a portion of $62 million from the program to install residential solar panels paired with battery storage systems on homes in “disaster-impacted communities.” A group of stakeholders had met several times this year in planning how the state would use the funding in communities affected by floods and tornadoes.
Robin Hartman, a spokesperson for the Kentucky Energy and Environment Cabinet, in an early September email to the Lantern said the state couldn’t access its “Solar for All” funding because it  was being “unlawfully withheld by the federal administration.” 
“Team Kentucky is working hard to ensure the federal government makes good on its promise to our people and delivers the entirety of this funding,” Hartman wrote in her email.",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/IMG_0351-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-16 17:03:30.608618

As the federal government pushes more disaster recovery responsibilities onto states, they are “sitting ducks” for contractors.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  How Vermont lost track of millions in FEMA flood recovery funds.","This story was first published by Grist. 
On the afternoon of August 21, Jason Gosselin raised the alarm: The flood recovery project he managed was running out of money faster than he had anticipated. One email he sent his colleagues ended with an anxious parenthetical: (calm down, Jason, calm down).
In July 2024, Vermont was hit by 100-year flooding for the second summer in a row. Among the aid that the Federal Emergency Management Agency approved was a $2.9 million grant to hire an 11-person disaster case management team to help victims navigate their FEMA applications, find other available resources, and rebuild their homes. The money was supposed to last two years but was on pace to be gone far sooner. The morning after his first email, Gosselin, who is the emergency management director at the Vermont Agency of Human Services, sent another message detailing the likely source of the unexpected financial drain. The corporate contractor Vermont used to hire the team, he calculated, was actually billing nearly half of the budget for its own staff.  
“We cannot / will not be able to support this,” concluded Gosselin. According to documents obtained by Grist, Gosselin was right — and the problem was even worse than he seemed to realize.


Records show the state kept about $400,000 for hiring its own administrative staff. The rest — $2.5 million — was allocated to Guidehouse, a multinational consulting company, to hire the frontline workers. But Guidehouse only subcontracted seven people, instead of 11, for $1.1 million. That left more than a million dollars that the company could use toward its own services.
“There is a huge need in the state,” said Prem Linskey, the case management supervisor at a local Vermont aid group, the Recovery After Floods Team. The amount of work is often untenable, with so many people that need help. “The state’s case management plan could have been much more effective if they had hired more people.”
A state official told Grist the program cost more than expected to get started, and it has since reined in costs. But although Vermont’s grant is relatively small compared to the billions of dollars that FEMA doles out each year, experts say the poor state oversight, vague contract terms, and high-priced consultants that accompanied it are unfortunately common. Cracks like these are only set to widen as climate change fuels extreme weather and President Donald Trump’s administration pushes more response and recovery responsibilities onto states that, too often, lack experience, expertise, and capacity. And if a federal grant is mishandled, it’s usually not FEMA or the contractor holding the bill but the state — and the stakes can be enormous.

Late last month, FEMA sent Gosselin and his team an informal yet stern email warning what would happen if they didn’t correct course. “Deficiencies can result in a range of consequences, including corrective action plans, formal audit findings, and heaven forbid, clawbacks,” wrote Penelope Doherty, who works with the agency’s regional office. “Any of these can affect a state’s ability to receive federal funding of any kind, not just from FEMA.”

Last year’s flooding was the result of two separate severe storms. On July 10, up to 7 inches of rain dropped on parts of Vermont in a matter of hours. On July 30, with the soil still soaked and rivers high, the Northeast Kingdom region got upward of 8.4 inches. The torrential rains killed two people, ripped apart homes, and caused billions of dollars’ worth of damage. Within weeks, FEMA approved an official disaster declaration and Vermont stood up a temporary “bridge” team of case managers that were largely reassigned from other state positions. That program was set to wind down at the end of the year and there were still dozens of active cases. So two days before Christmas, the state submitted a grant application to FEMA aimed at addressing the “unmet needs” of Vermonters.
In its application, the state estimated that 134 flood survivors still needed so-called “disaster case management,” or extra assistance developing and implementing a recovery plan. Some $2.5 million of the grant would “be specifically for” seven disaster case managers, or DCMs, three construction managers and a supervisor. There are no other positions mentioned in the state’s application or included in its budget.

In February, FEMA approved Vermont’s $2.9 million Disaster Case Management Program. The state in turn hired the consulting firm Guidehouse, which used to be the public sector arm of PwC (formerly PricewaterhouseCoopers). Through various mergers and acquisitions, it’s since grown into a $7 billion company now owned by the private equity giant Bain Capital.
Vermont had been working with Guidehouse since 2020, when the global COVID-19 pandemic took hold. The state competitively bid and signed a five-year master contract with Guidehouse that let any of its agencies issue a “task order” for services from the company, without having to seek bids again. While the bulk of the work seems to have stayed in the COVID realm, the governor told reporters in 2024 that the company was also helping to “augment” the state’s flood response effort. 
This April, Vermont’s secretary of human services, chief recovery officer, and an assistant attorney general signed a nearly $2.5 million task order with Guidehouse to help with the FEMA disaster management grant. It names Gosselin as a primary contact and includes language such as, “The contractor shall support the state in administering its DCM program” and “provide implementation and strategic advisory assistance to the state.” It doesn’t have the specific staffing requirements.
With its orders in hand, Guidehouse then did its own subcontracting for the frontline workers. It turned to the New England Annual Conference of the United Methodist Church, or NEAC, which had been involved with previous flood recovery efforts in Vermont. But that subcontract proved to be significantly narrower than what was in the FEMA agreement. NEAC would provide only four case managers, not seven, and just two construction coordinators, not three. Guidehouse would also pay the organization just $1,098,875 to get the job done, including a travel budget. That’s less than half what Guidehouse got from the state and what FEMA awarded for the work. It’s unclear exactly what the company’s plan was for the other $1.4 million, but the NEAC agreement lists six Guidehouse employees working on the project — a nearly 1:1 ratio with frontline workers.

All federal grants involve some level of administrative costs, explained MaryAnn Tierney, a former FEMA regional administrator and acting No. 2 at the agency. But when money that is meant to go to services goes to overhead, she said, “that’s not acceptable.”
Another former FEMA official, who asked not to be named publicly because they are now a consultant who works with the federal government, said the agency would start to get upset when such expenses reached 20 percent. “It doesn’t necessarily mean that I would have thought it was fraudulent,” they said. “I would just be grumpy because it’s a waste of money.”
Vermont’s case is a “classic” example of what happens when a state or municipality writes a vague contract, said Craig Fugate, who was the FEMA administrator from 2009 to 2017. He explained that any contract should provide clear and measurable deliverables, with penalties for not performing. 
Without a strong agreement, a consultant can largely dictate their own boundaries. “You see a lot of money getting spent on process. More meetings, more reviews,” said Fugate. While no one technically violates the contract, “it doesn’t seem that much work is getting done, and you end up with a lot of billable hours.”

By the time Gosselin did his August accounting, Guidehouse had already billed 4,877 hours of time — worth over half a million dollars. The Guidehouse report to the state that his math was based on shows 48 percent of that money going directly toward Guidehouse staff. The consulting firm also added overhead to the NEAC staff’s hourly rates, meaning that an even greater share went to the company.
According to two people involved in the grant, it was common for multiple Guidehouse employees to attend meetings, and it was often unclear why they were necessary. “It muddied the waters a little bit,” said one of them. Both mentioned that the role of Lina Hashem, a director at Guidehouse, was especially confusing and redundant, especially given her billing rate: $293 per hour.

Before becoming FEMA administrator, Fugate spent decades as an emergency manager at state and local levels. The role of contractors has expanded dramatically, he said. Where companies used to be selling mostly goods or products — say generators, or computer systems — many are now offering services, such as consulting. 
Outside companies can be a useful force multiplier in the wake of a disaster, and offer expertise that states may not have. “For state governments, you’re never going to have enough people to handle Hurricane Katrina,” he said. “But you always have to keep the idea that we’re not turning over running the response or the recovery to a vendor.”
FEMA spends tens of billions of dollars every year on disaster recovery, but there is also additional funding available across the federal government: more than two-dozen other agencies run nearly 100 different response or recovery programs. 
There have been several high profile instances of either contractor abuse or state mismanagement. Following a 2014 tornado in Louisville, Mississippi, the inspector general overseeing FEMA recommended that the agency claw back $25 million because the city didn’t follow proper procurement procedures. Last year, the consulting firm Horne paid a $1.2 million fine for improper billing in the wake of extreme rainfall in West Virginia in 2016. Horne now holds a controversial $81 million contract to help North Carolina recover from Hurricane Helene.
Guidehouse’s work has also come under scrutiny. Last year, it paid a $7.6 million fine for a data breach tied to the company’s work administering New York’s rental assistance program during the pandemic. Still, it’s become a major player in the disaster space nationwide. It won the $135 million contract to revamp the National Flood Insurance Program and a $38 million one to do identity verification for FEMA. It also acquired part of a company that worked with New Jersey in the wake of Superstorm Sandy and Florida after Hurricane Irma. 
Vermont’s vendor payment portal shows $41 million in payments to Guidehouse since 2020, and not all the state’s experiences with the company have been bad. It was instrumental in helping Vermont navigate both the COVID pandemic and 2023 flooding, said Ben Rose, who retired as Vermont Emergency Management’s recovery and mitigation section chief at the end of 2024. 
“It’s really hard to hire people through the state system,” he said. “You can be more nimble by hiring consultants when you need help.”
That said, Rose was cognizant that Guidehouse was a for-profit company and said keeping tabs on its scope of work and spending was important. “They would sometimes say, ‘Hey, we’ll make it easy for you, let us show you a draft task order,’” he recalled. Rose would then take off things that he didn’t need. “It was a healthy back and forth.”
In his August emails, Gosselin appears surprised by how much of the grant money was going to Guidehouse. And when FEMA started asking for more details, the state dragged its feet in explaining what happened. Initially, Dougherty wrote in her warning note, the state had “revealed a decision to reduce service delivery staff,” which would have been acceptable as long as the budget was reduced as well. But after more than two months, and three draft proposals, she noted that there still wasn’t a formal update to the original plan. 
“We have been requesting this articulation since mid-July,” wrote Dougherty, in late September. “[It] really must be finalized to avoid risking corrective actions.”

The state continues to work with FEMA on an updated plan, said Douglas Farnham, Vermont’s chief recovery officer. But he defended the state’s use of Guidehouse, which he said was a natural fit for the project because it already worked with the state and was best positioned to rapidly stand up this program, too.  
“They’re not the cheapest partner to work with, but they have great expertise,” said Farnham, adding that moving quickly adds expense as well. He blamed the high initial billing ratios — with nearly half going to Guidehouse — on startup costs for the project. 
“Ideally, you wouldn’t see it bump that high,” he said, but after the state reviewed the expenses, they found them to be reasonable. “At the end of the day, we believe the costs were appropriate. They were necessary to build the program, and we’ll work it out with FEMA.”
FEMA could not be reached for comment due to the current government shutdown.
Farnham said that the state has since set a new target of 17 percent for Guidehouse’s share of billable work, with the rest going toward program delivery. “It definitely stops the major bleed,” said one person familiar with the changes, though they still question why Guidehouse has to remain involved at all. And because the changes come months into the project and more than a year after the flooding, some say much of the harm has already been done.
Guidehouse, Inc. presentation, dated September 8, 2025, stating the State of Vermont had asked the company to reduce the amount it was billing.
For one, Vermont has already paid Guidehouse hundreds of thousands dollars that FEMA has yet to reimburse. If the agency doesn’t do that, Farnham said the money would come out of the state’s reserve fund for federal denials. Timing was also a problem. The FEMA-funded case management program wasn’t approved until seven months after the disaster declaration. Farnham, while grateful for the money, said that was a result of FEMA’s “very long and complicated” application process.
The state also hired fewer workers than planned because there weren’t as many cases as expected, Farnham said. The benefit of a contractor, he said, is that the number of workers can be adjusted up or down. But the company’s own October 1 report listed a “medium” risk that the caseload “may exceed budgeted project team capacity.”
Farnham doesn’t think that will happen, and would rather extend the length of the program to help handle cases that come up later. FEMA has not approved that extension, but in her September email, Dougherty did tell the state to “be aware of the inherent conflict in simultaneously saying you’re behind/need more time and saying outreach results indicate you can reduce the work force/work pace.”
Guidehouse’s agreement with Vermont only covered disasters that happened through June 2025, and the state has chosen another company for its next master contract. Farnham declined to explain why, and Guidehouse declined to comment for this story, as did NEAC. Gosselin didn’t respond to multiple interview requests or a list of written questions. But long-term recovery groups say that, even when the state did finally get involved in case management, it failed to coordinate well with those already on the ground. “They confused everybody,” said Meghan Wayland, president of the Kingdom United Resilience & Recovery Eﬀort. “They called all of the people in our neighborhood. It creates chaos and we have to go clean up their messes.”
Wayland and Linskey, from the Recovery After Floods Team, say that better collaboration with organizations like theirs could have meant more work for the FEMA-funded folks, too. For example, the NEAC team could have taken on particularly difficult cases or focused on areas of the state where the local capacity isn’t as robust. “They could have designed a program that would have benefited Vermonters and not compromised the efforts that are underway,” said Wayland. “That would have been a really lovely thing for them to do.”

Multiple people pointed to Gosselin as a major source of the state’s issues. “He doesn’t have the appropriate skill set for the thing he’s been put in charge of,” said Wayland. But Gosselin notably wasn’t the signatory on the Guidehouse task order or the FEMA application, which were ostensibly reviewed by officials higher up in government. That includes Farnham, who praised Gosselin for flagging Guidehouse’s invoices for review and said “everything that I worked with him on this, I believe he took the right course of action.”
For now, FEMA’s review of Vermont’s spending is still underway. But the lesson may already be clear: As floods multiply and dollars surge, America’s recovery system is only as strong as the contracts holding it together. And, currently, states could be a weak point in that chain. 
“By shoving responsibilities from the federal level onto the state’s shoulders, it is creating a market for private contractors,” said one FEMA employee, who asked to remain anonymous because they weren’t authorized to speak publicly. “They’re sitting ducks.”

John Larson, but some candidates are using new strategies in a race becoming increasingly skeptical of traditional ways of amassing donations.
Bronin’s money advantage in the most recent fundraising quarter was expected, as it was previewed before the filing deadline by the campaigns themselves. The former mayor raised nearly $1.2 million since announcing in late July, compared to Larson’s $809,000 haul over the past three months. But Larson has had more time to fundraise and has raised nearly $1.1 million this year.
The fundraising reports publicly released this week are the first real look inside what’s fueling each campaign, where the money is coming from and how much they’ll be working with in the fight for the nomination in the safely Democratic Hartford-based district.
Bronin and Larson are well ahead of most of the other candidates in fundraising, though Southington Councilman Jack Perry loaned his campaign $500,000. That gives him a boost over state Rep. Jillian Gilchrest of West Hartford and Hartford school board member Ruth Fortune. But when it comes to individual contributions, Perry raised the least of any candidate.
Each of the five declared candidates needed to file a report with the Federal Election Commission by Wednesday that detailed the money raised and spent between July and September. Some of Larson’s challengers jumped into the race part of the way into the third fundraising quarter of the year.
The fundraising battle has largely centered around the origin of donations, particularly from Bronin on outside groups. Larson’s other challengers bemoaned the heavy emphasis on fundraising altogether, despite the reality of needing enough funds to afford advertising in the Hartford media market and boost name recognition competing against Larson, a 14-term congressman, and Bronin, a former two-term mayor of Hartford.
Bronin has sworn off campaign contributions from corporate political action committees, commonly referred to as PACs, and has taken multiple swipes at Larson for heavily relying on such money in past campaign cycles.
Bronin’s $1.2 million haul comes completely from individual contributions and no PAC money. Much of his fundraising comes from within Connecticut, though he still raised a lot of money from elsewhere, including Washington, D.C., and New York. The report shows he largely dedicated the last couple of months to raising money and spent only about $90,000. That leaves him with the biggest cash reserves of all the candidates.
Bronin’s campaign anticipates Larson could raise more than him in the future but said outraising the congressman in the past quarter reflects the appetite for the generational change that’s been at the center of Bronin’s campaign.
“John Larson has been in office for almost three decades, he’s taken millions of dollars from corporate PACs, and we still expect he’s going to out-raise us,” Bronin campaign senior advisor Amanda Sands said in a statement. “But outraising him this quarter without a cent of corporate PAC money shows that there’s a lot of enthusiasm for Luke, and there are lots of people who know it’s time for change.”
In the most recent fundraising quarter, Larson raised a substantial portion of his money from PACs — nearly $310,000 — including those representing businesses and corporations. But he raised more money from individual contributions — $495,000 — with the overwhelming majority of it coming from contributors in Connecticut. His most recent haul from individual contributions was far more than the past two fundraising quarters this year, before he had any competition.
Some of the PACs that donated higher sums of money to Larson during the past quarter include American Institute of Certified Public Accountants PAC, Boeing Company PAC, Cigna Corporation PAC, Employees of RTX Corporation PAC, and Eversource Energy PAC.
Larson also spent more money than Bronin and the rest of his challengers. But Bronin’s cash on hand outpaced everyone in the field, going into October with $1.1 million compared to Larson’s $879,000 in the bank.
Larson said he’ll continue to focus on his opposition to President Donald Trump rather than his Democratic competitors.
“At a time when President Trump and his allies are attacking our democracy, targeting immigrant families and labeling me an agitator for standing up to them, this campaign is powered by people who know what’s at stake,” Larson said in a statement. “This support — over $1.2 million raised this cycle — sends a clear message: the people of the First District are ready to fight back. I will continue to stand up to Trump’s authoritarian overreach and protect our community, our democracy, and the values we share.”
While he’s slightly behind Bronin, Larson’s fundraising has improved compared to earlier quarters this year, as well as previous election cycles. He’s already raised more in the first nine months of the year compared to the last off-year, in 2023, which was about $724,000 for that entire year.
The congressman also raised more in 2025 than in all of 2024, an election year. But he didn’t have any primary challengers, and raising money wasn’t as crucial.
In his fundraising pitches before the deadline, Larson’s campaign drew a lot of attention from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, which added his name to a list of Democrats and groups whom the agency characterized as having “hateful and violent” rhetoric, specifically in regard to immigration enforcement officials.
DHS singled out Larson’s comments at an August press conference in Connecticut. In it, the visibly frustrated congressman shouted about the Trump administration’s immigration enforcement and compared masked ICE agents, who are conducting raids and arrests across the U.S., to the “SS” and “Gestapo.”
Larson said earlier this month he didn’t see the remarks as hateful and said they were “intended to make a point.” He’s raised concerns about the raids carried out by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement in the 1st Congressional District.
The congressman has also highlighted the support he’s getting from colleagues in Washington who have worked with him for years. 
He held a formal event last weekend to announce the endorsement of his colleague U.S. Sen. Chris Murphy, who has been a national figure for being an outspoken Trump critic and a fundraising juggernaut.
Murphy’s own political action committee, American Mobilization PAC, contributed $5,000 to Larson’s campaign, according to his FEC report filed this week.
Larson has also benefited from support from past and present House Democratic leadership. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries and one of his deputies, Pete Aguilar, both donated to Larson’s campaign in the past few months. Larson also got a donation from former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. The two worked together closely when Larson served in House Democratic leadership from 2009 to 2013.
For Bronin, he’s been trying to distinguish himself from the Democratic establishment in Washington, even as a two-term mayor of Hartford who worked in the Obama administration.
Calls for generational change and new candidates throughout the Democratic Party have grown since across-the-board losses during the 2024 elections.
Bronin’s team highlighted that sentiment with an interview between former President Joe Biden’s press secretary Jen Psaki and Democratic strategist Lis Smith, who questioned why Democrats aren’t “lifting up” the next generation. They specifically mentioned Bronin and the primary for Larson’s seat.
“This constant circling of the wagons, I think, is what is so frustrating to people. Why are you afraid of change? Why are you afraid of this? And so I think they’ll get a wake-up call in the Larson race,” Smith said in an interview Thursday on MSNBC.
Perry, Gilchrest, Fortune taking different approaches
Because the 1st Congressional District is a safe district, securing the Democratic nomination virtually means the candidate is on a glide path to victory. That’s why candidates need to raise enough funds over the next few months to afford things like television ads and securing their name on the ballot for the primary.
Perry loaned his campaign $500,000 in the past fundraising quarter. He is the former owner of a waste hauling and recycling business, HQ Dumpsters, that he sold to a larger competitor. He only raised nearly $29,000 from individual contributors, but he goes into the final months of the year with a decent cushion because of the loan.
Perry, who serves as a town councilman in Southington, said he doesn’t plan to keep self-funding but wanted to show that he has a serious campaign that is viable. He noted that federal campaign finance regulations are very different from Connecticut’s, where more money can come into play. And he said a lot of the support right now in the state should go to the local municipal races that are coming up.
“It takes time to build the infrastructure, and we’re trying to fundraise, but [at] the same time, I don’t want to also make it that we have to focus on just asking people for money,” Perry said in an interview. “I think the balancing act — yes we need to do fundraisers, reach out and raise money, but it’s also important that we can talk about the issues, listen to the issues that the working and middle class are facing, because I feel the Democratic Party has failed all of us right now.”
Gilchrest’s contributions are mostly from donors in Connecticut, with a mix of nonprofits, state legislators and government staffers, attorneys, those in health care, religious institutions and teachers and professors. She raised more than $54,000, spent almost $10,000 and has almost $45,000 cash on hand. Some of her biggest spending of the quarter was on texting and phone banking services through a political consulting firm in Avon.
Gilchrest said she’s been more focused on outreach and building relationships with voters who in turn would consider donating to the campaign — something she said takes time. She expects to turn more attention to fundraising over the coming weeks and months. More recently, she has spent time meeting with voters at coffee shops, playgrounds and Democratic Town Committee events.
She’s been critical of the reliance of congressional candidates on fundraising, particularly in this primary. But Gilchrest acknowledged she’ll need more money to compete and said she views it “as a marathon versus a sprint.” She said she was told a candidate will need at least $1 million to $1.5 million “to get my message out.”
“I just feel like if the race is decided because of fundraising numbers, we’ll get the exact same kind of ineffective Congress we’ve had for years,” Gilchrest said in an interview. “I think people are very frustrated by the constant onslaught of fundraising texts and emails that they receive and then no action on the part of the politicians they elect. And so we need to do politics differently, and I need to build those relationships with folks before they’re willing to invest in the campaign. And that makes sense to me.”
Gilchrest, who noted she doesn’t come from a wealthy background, said what she raised in a month is more money than many people earn in a year.
Fortune offered a similar sentiment about her own fundraising. She was the first person to enter the race for the Democratic nomination and raised about $41,000 and spent about $5,600.
“I raised more money this quarter than my mother ever earned annually and spent $5,644.60 as a first-time candidate who built a campaign from scratch. Yet, the two well-funded candidates in this race spent a combined $283,000 this quarter, and it’s not their first rodeo,” Fortune said, referencing the combined spending over the past few months by Bronin and Larson. “Every year, campaigns spend more money than it would take to end homelessness and hunger in America.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/2025_0118_SR_PeoplesMarch_990-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-16 17:03:30.608618

Members of the bipartisan Michigan Association of County Clerks on Wednesday said they unanimously voted to oppose the pending 2026 ballot measure, which would establish ranked choice voting for all elections. Clerks aligned with the association said the measure being pushed by Rank MI Vote was concerning. The group cited timeliness issues related to election certification and delays in the recount or audit process.
Among their members is Ingham County Clerk Barb Byrum, who is currently seeking the office of Michigan secretary of state in the 2026 contest. Byrum also holds multiple leadership positions with the association, according to its website.
On Thursday, following the association’s announcement opposing ranked choice voting, the Michigan Conservative Coalition and Pure Integrity Michigan Elections released a joint statement thanking the association for its opposition to the Rank MI Vote measure.
“When the very people responsible for running our elections speak with one voice against a proposed system, Michigan voters should take notice,” said Patrice Johnson, chairperson of Pure Integrity Michigan Elections, in a statement. “These clerks aren’t politicians or activists. They’re the dedicated public servants who ensure every legal vote is counted accurately and transparently.”
It was a moment of rare unity, not just between the bipartisan association for county clerks in Michigan, but also for a group like Pure Integrity Michigan Elections and Byrum, who has in the past called the group, and others like it, a vassal of election deniers conspiracy theories related to the 2020 election.
Election denialism has strong roots in Michigan given the fact that Detroit and its absentee board counting center was at the heart of some of the conspiracies bandied about after former President Joe Biden won the state by a wide margin in 2020, helping in his overall victory against then- and now current President Donald Trump.
In a report published by Progress Michigan in 2022, the progressive advocacy group noted the intricacies of the Michigan Republican Party and its relationship with election conspiracy theorists.
The very first quote in the report comes directly from Byrum.
“These workers and volunteers can easily disrupt the process by challenging everything they see,” said Ingham County Clerk Barb Byrum. “Or by intentionally slowing down their work, or leaving the polling place or the absentee counting board when they aren’t supposed to. … “Disenfranchising even one voter is too many.”
Deep within the Progress Michigan report is a section detailing the different groups that have worked to further those conspiracies, and Pure Integrity Michigan Elections is featured in a full page spread.
Progress Michigan wrote in 2022 that Pure Integrity Michigan Elections, which was formed after the 2020 election, at one point employed Linda Lee Tarver as its spokesperson. Tarver is a prominent Michigan GOP activist, party fixture and a former candidate for the state Board of Education.
Tarver was a key voice in the push to have the 2020 election decertified.
Neither the Michigan Association of County Clerks nor Byrum responded to questions from Michigan Advance about the support they received from Pure Integrity Michigan Elections, and what it means for them to both be in the same boat now.
When asked by the Advance about the endorsement of the clerks’opposition by Pure Integrity Michigan Elections, Joe Spaulding, campaign director for Rank MI Vote, did not directly address that point, but did say that ranked choice voting gives power back to voters, not parties. 
“It encourages candidates to build broader coalitions, focus on issues that unite communities, and win on ideas instead of partisan outrage,” Spaulding said. “Michigan voters are smart enough to rank their preferences. What county clerks are calling ‘confusing’ is really just more democratic.”

Berny Jacques in Tampa on Sept. 19, 2025. (Photo by Don Kruse for the Florida Phoenix)A Florida Republican on Thursday re-filed a bill from last year requiring all private employers to use a federal database verifying whether new hires are legally in the country.
Rep. Berny Jacques, a Seminole Republican, issued HB 197 to mandate all private businesses use E-Verify, a federally operated system allowing employers to electronically verify whether new employees can legally work in the United States. Florida already requires all public agencies, their contractors, and their subcontractors to use E-Verify.
“Beginning on July 1, 2026, a private employer shall use the E-Verify system to verify a new employee’s employment eligibility,” the bill reads, striking existing language that only requires businesses with at least 25 employees to use E-Verify.
More than 475,000 small businesses in Florida have fewer than 20 employees, according to a 2025 report by the Small Business Administration. Not counting businesses without employees — of which there are more than 2 million — there are fewer than 518,000 total small businesses employing one to 499 Floridians.
Jacques, who had not responded to a request for comment at the time of publishing, had tried to pass this measure during the 2025 session, but it never made it to its final committee stop. This came despite favorable votes from Republican-dominated committees at both of its earlier committee meetings.
E-Verify in Florida
Immigration has been a headlining topic for Florida Republicans in recent years, dominating the past few sessions.
In 2023, former senator — now Chief Financial Officer — Blaise Ingoglia, a Spring Hill Republican, sponsored a massive immigration crackdown. The sweeping law required private businesses with at least 25 employees to use E-Verify and mandated Medicaid-accepting hospitals to question whether patients are citizens and report that information quarterly to the state.
During the 2025 session, GOP lawmakers upped the ante with another immigration package, this time forcing all counties to partner with ICE, removing in-state tuition for undocumented college students, and creating a state-level crime of illegally entering Florida.
The anti-undocumented immigration fervor has been reflected on the national stage under President Donald Trump, who’s expanded Immigration and Customs Enforcement, encouraged construction of detention centers nationwide, and promised federal grants to states aiding in the arrest and detention of undocumented immigrants.
Last session, Sen. Jason Pizzo of Sunny Isles Beach, then a Democrat and now an independent, filed a competing bill that would have severely punished businesses for flouting E-Verify requirements. Although it similarly required all private companies to use the system, it would have revoked the business license of an employer who hires an immigrant illegally in Florida and charged him tens of thousands in fines.
Under existing law, the Florida Department of Commerce can fine violators $1,000 per day three times within two years, place them on probation for a year, and have them report to the department quarterly.
Pizzo has yet to file a similar bill for the 2026 session. He had not responded to a request for comment at the time of publishing.

(Photo by Christopher Shea/Rhode Island Current) The quasi-governmental agency that finances affordable home construction in Rhode Island has consolidated its pay grades down from over two dozen separate classifications down to 16.
RIHousing’s board of directors on Thursday unanimously approved changes to the agency’s executive compensation package within three minutes without any questions for the agency’s general counsel. The approval comes about a month after House Minority Leader Mike Chippendale criticized the agency for not answering his inquiries about its finances.
Chippendale, a Foster Republican, had called for a forensic audit after accusing RIHousing of being “bloated” and inefficient. House Republicans released a report that found the agency had the second highest combined administrative and personnel costs in the region at $46.4 million. 
Chippendale was not present for Thursday’s board meeting. Before the meeting, he issued a statement calling out the board for even considering a discussion on compensation packages
“Are they serious?” Chippendale said in a statement Thursday. “Under the Quasi-Public Corporations Accountability and Transparency Act, the board is expected to provide active oversight, ensure fiscal discipline, and hold the agency accountable to the public it serves.”
RIHousing’s board was supposed to consider the updates to executive compensation during its meeting on Sept. 18, but that meeting was canceled due to a lack of a quorum.
Christine Hunsinger, spokesperson for RIHousing, claims Chippendale is making a big deal out of something the commission does every three to five years.
“We’re required to do this by law,” she said in an interview.
Ohio-based CBIZ Compensation Consulting was contracted in 2024 by RIHousing to study the latest compensation rates, making its official recommendations in May — namely reducing the number of pay grades to be in line with its 16-grade scale.
Since 2021, RIHousing had used a 25-grade scale compiled by MGT Consulting of Tampa, Florida.
“It’s really just to streamline and ensure everyone gets a fair salary and predictability,” Hunsinger said. “Having broader ranges allows more people to fit into them.”
Executive Director Carol Ventura is in the top pay grade level, which now ranges from $182,095 to $282,247 a year. Under the two-year contract approved by the board in June, Ventura makes an annual salary of $232,171.
The top pay grade in the last compensation schedule adopted in 2022 ranged between $154,746 and 223,927.
Under the new compensation schedule, the lowest pay grade ranges from an annual salary of $48,828 to $56,152. Under the 2022 salary structure, the lowest-paid executive staff made between $44,012 to $59,935.
In addition to the updated salary ranges, RIHousing’s new executive compensation includes minor updates to job descriptions for the chief administrative officer and president of proactive development.
During Thursday’s meeting, Ventura acknowledged Chippendale’s request of a forensic audit requesting, characterizing his request as seeking “details on certain RIHousing-financed developments.”
“Staff are currently in the process of assembling the information requested by Leader Chippendale and providing background information on the extensive auditing that is conducted every year on RIHousing and its programs for House and Senate leadership,” Ventura wrote in a memo to the board.
Chippendale’s request for an audit will be formally considered by the General Assembly’s Joint Committee on Legislative Services, which will meet some time in November, House spokesperson Larry Berman said in an email Thursday.

(Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images) North Carolina is joining a coalition of nearly two dozen states suing the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency for rescinding more than $156 million pledged for solar projects in the state.
Attorney General Jeff Jackson and representatives of 22 other states, as well as the District of Columbia, sued the EPA on Wednesday, saying the agency illegally canceled the Solar for All program.
Solar for All, a Biden-era initiative launched as part of the Inflation Reduction Act in 2022, allocated $7 billion in grants nationally to 60 recipients including states, tribes, and regions. The funds were earmarked for solar projects like rooftop solar and community solar gardens for more than 900,000 lower-income households.
The program’s discontinuation signified the Trump administration’s push away from cleaner energy, following additional cuts in the “One Big Beautiful Bill.”
Democrats in North Carolina’s congressional delegation sent a letter to EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin in August, asking him to reconsider and ultimately reverse the program’s termination, NC Newsline previously reported.
Jackson said the funds would have helped low-income and rural North Carolinians save money on their energy bills.
“Thousands of families were going to have the option to install solar power, save money, and have another energy option after a major storm,” Jackson said in a statement. “Now EPA has illegally cancelled those funds — so I’m going to court to bring $150 million back to our state.”
North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality Secretary Reid Wilson said the program’s cancellation eliminates the installation of rooftop solar panels for more than 12,000 low- and medium-income families.
Projects using Solar for All funds were planned to start in fall 2025, according to Jackson’s office.
“Rooftop solar drives down utility bills, reduces air pollution and creates jobs. The program’s cancellation would hurt the electric grid’s ability to be resilient to future disasters, and would hamper North Carolina’s efforts to ensure reliable, clean and affordable energy supplies to meet the needs of a rapidly growing population and rising energy demand,” Wilson said in a statement.
Representatives for the EPA did not immediately respond to NC Newsline’s request for comment.
Plaintiffs described the EPA’s cancellation of the program and subsequent unilateral termination of all grant agreements as “a clear, unambiguous, and material breach of the agreements between the EPA and Plaintiffs,” the lawsuit read.
The plaintiffs’ grant agreements allowed for termination “only in the narrow circumstances of substantial noncompliance that materially impairs performance, adequate evidence of waste, fraud or abuse, or material representation of eligibility status,” the lawsuit read. Plaintiffs said these matters did not occur.
A few days after the cancellation in August, the EPA withdrew about 90% of grant funds from plaintiffs’ Automated Standard Application for Payment (ASAP) accounts, according to the lawsuit.
“The administration is again targeting people struggling to get by in America, this time by gutting programs that help low-income households afford electricity,” Washington State Attorney General Nick Brown said in a statement. “Congress passed a solar energy program to help make electricity costs more affordable, but the administration is ignoring the law and focused on the conspiracy theory that climate change is a hoax.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/solar-panels.jpg,,,2025-10-16 17:03:30.608618

China imported a record amount of soybeans in September. But the world’s largest soybean purchaser has not bought any American soybeans this year as a result of ongoing trade wars. “This is the worst economic situation for the Mississippi Delta since the early 1980s,” according to an article from The Clarion Ledger.

(Wes Muller/Louisiana Illuminator)Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry has summoned the Louisiana Legislature for a three-week special session starting next week to address next year’s election plans. 
The special session will begin Thursday, Oct. 23,  and end no later than Nov. 13.
Lawmakers will be allowed to file bills related to “election code, election dates, election deadlines, and election plans for the 2026 election cycle” and funding bills related to those items. 
The governor’s call is broadly written and could allow for a wide variety of election bills. 
Senate President Cameron Henry, R-Metairie, said that the governor told him that Landry’s priorities are to move back qualifying deadlines for next fall’s election to give the state an opportunity to react to a U.S. Supreme Court’s ruling expected sometime next spring. Justices heard arguments Wednesday in Callais v. Louisiana, a decision that could require or allow the adoption of new congressional maps. 

Supreme Court seems open to limiting key voting protections in Louisiana redistricting case


Henry said no new maps would be drawn in this session. 
Questions from justices during Wednesday’s hearing indicated they are open to limiting the consideration of race in the redistricting process. Depending on the outcome of the case, Louisiana could redraw its congressional boundaries to reduce or eliminate the number of majority Black districts. Currently, two of Louisiana’s six congressional districts are majority Black. 
Louisiana will move to closed primaries starting with next year’s congressional elections, and the current election calendar for 2026 does not give lawmakers an opportunity to change district boundaries after a decision comes out. 
Party primaries for the fall congressional election are currently scheduled for April 18, and the Supreme Court decision could come as late as the end of June.

(Photo by Ann Froschauer/USFWS)The Chinese drone company DJI is appealing a court ruling that upholds a U.S. Department of Defense decision to list it as a “Chinese military company.” 
As the ruling stands, DJI, which is one of the leading camera, civilian and agricultural drone companies, continues to bear the Chinese military company label which, the court wrote, “stigmatizes” the company and excludes it from certain contracts, grants and programs. 
According to the opinion from the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, the Department of Defense first listed DJI as a “Chinese military company” in 2022, then relisted it with the same designation in 2024. DJI pushed back on the designation and the department’s lack of notice or opportunity for DJI to be heard in the matter. 
As drones are becoming useful tools in all sorts of industries, including agriculture, some operators worry the drone industry would suffer — at least temporarily — without the prevailing Chinese technology on the market.

DJI filed a suit in October 2024 with the district court, the DoD responded that it was reevaluating the designation and in January 2025, it again reestablished that DJI was a Chinese military company. 
The department explained its designation by saying DJI was state-owned entity, had “received an unknown amount of funds” from several People’s Republic of China owned entities and “knowingly” received assistance from either the Chinese government or the Chinese Communist Party in the form of “science and technology efforts initiated under the Chinese military industrial planning apparatus.” 
The already-filed case was expedited because of the January designation, and DJI argued to the court that the department committed procedural errors in its designation and failed to evaluate contradictory evidence. 
The opinion, written by U.S. District Court Judge Paul Friedman for the District of Columbia, sided with the Department of Defense and upheld its designation, but also noted that the department “failed to proffer substantial evidence to support its finding that DJI meets the definition of ‘Chinese military company.’”
DJI officials, in a news release announcing the company had filed an appeal, said the arguments the court upheld were “limited findings that reaffirm DJI’s lack of military affiliation.” 
“We respect the Court’s process but are disappointed that the designation remains in place despite findings that reject the core of the DoD’s allegations,” a spokesperson for DJI said in the release. “We will continue to defend the integrity of our company as the findings reaffirm what we have maintained all along — that DJI operates independently, has no government or military affiliation, and is committed to the responsible development of drone technology.”
DJI maintains that it has never manufactured military drones or marketed equipment for combat.

The scorecard combined a number of factors into these rankings — and Michigan’s performance varied across them. Michigan ranked at 13th in access to care, but fell into the third quartile in the other categories — 37th in quality of care, 30th in costs and affordability and 32nd in population health. 
Vermont, Utah, and Minnesota received the highest scores overall, while Louisiana, Mississippi, and Kentucky ranked lowest.

The report shows that Michigan stands out regionally in certain metrics — in the Great Lakes region, Michigan had the lowest number of potentially avoidable emergency department visits age 65 and older, as well as the lowest share of older adults reporting loneliness or lack of emotional support.
Also in the Great Lakes region, Michigan was particularly affordable for drug costs in the Part D program for Medicare recipients, with the lowest average out-of-pocket spending and lowest total share of drug costs paid by individual beneficiaries. 
However, Michigan struggled in other areas. In multiple categories of “quality of care,” including hospital admissions for ambulatory care-sensitive conditions and 30-day hospital readmissions, Michigan ranked 48th and 46th, respectively
22.4% of Michiganders are enrolled in some kind of Medicare plan, among the highest in the nation — and over half of those are on a Medicare Advantage plan, a private alternative to Original Medicare that can come with more limitations on doctor and hospital choice but can also come with additional care benefits. Behind Maine, that is the highest percentage of the population on a Medicare Advantage plan, nearly 14%. 
“Medicare is a lifeline for millions of Americans, and for the first time this scorecard shows how people’s experiences with the program vary widely depending on where they live,” wrote Gretchen Jacobson, the Commonwealth Fund’s Vice President for Medicare, in a press release accompanying the scorecard. “In some states, beneficiaries can see doctors quickly and afford their prescriptions; in others, they face higher costs, delays, or red tape. By learning from states where Medicare works best, policymakers and health leaders can strengthen the program for everyone.”

Free.,"With funding for courts in question, Congress stuck in shutdown gridlock for day 16","Jennifer Shutt, Ariana Figueroa",,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/funding-courts-question-congress-stuck-shutdown-gridlock-day-16,,"WASHINGTON — The U.S. Senate left for its customary long weekend Thursday afternoon, following a brief three days in session despite the ongoing government shutdown. The House remained on an extended break from Capitol Hill, where neither Democrats nor Republicans seemed motivated to talk to each other despite mounting repercussions from the funding lapse.Federal courts, for example, reported just as the shutdown began Oct. 1, they could use “fee balances and other funds not dependent on a new appropriation” to keep up and running through Friday, Oct. 17. “If the shutdown continues after Judiciary funds are exhausted, the courts will then operate under the terms of the Anti-Deficiency Act, which allows work to continue during a lapse in appropriations if it is necessary to support the exercise of Article III judicial powers,” the announcement stated. “Under this scenario, each court and federal defender’s office would determine the staffing resources necessary to support such work.”A spokesperson for the courts wrote in an email to States Newsroom there were no updates to offer on funding or operations as of Thursday but signaled there could potentially be an announcement Friday. Trump spending cuts, layoffs The shutdown has had widespread ramifications across all three branches of government, including the Trump administration’s decision to cut spending approved by Congress and lay off thousands of federal employees, though that was temporarily halted by a federal judge this week. Federal workers who are categorized as essential will not receive their paychecks until after the shutdown ends. Furloughed employees may never receive the back pay authorized in a 2019 law if the Trump administration reinterprets it, as officials have said they might. None of the consequences produced any real sense of urgency this week on Capitol Hill, where West Virginia Republican Sen. Jim Justice organized a birthday party for his dog, or at the White House, where President Donald Trump held a ball for donors to his ballroom and focused on foreign policy. Just as they have for the last several weeks, members of Congress and administration officials continued holding separate press conferences and TV news appearances, lambasting their political opponents, none of which will help move the two sides closer together to reopen government. Failed vote No. 10Senators failed for the 10th time to advance the stopgap government spending bill on a 51-45 vote, short of the 60 needed to move forward under the chamber’s legislative filibuster. Republicans control the chamber with 53 seats.The Senate was also unable to move past a procedural hurdle on the full-year Defense Department funding bill after a 50-44 vote. The Senate Appropriations Committee approved the bill this summer on a broadly bipartisan 26-3 vote. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer told reporters ahead of the vote that Democrats want some of the other annual appropriations bills added on to create a larger bill, though he didn’t say which of the dozen he prefers. ""It’s always been unacceptable to Democrats to do the Defense bill without other bills that have so many things that are important to the American people in terms of health care, in terms of housing, in terms of safety,” Schumer said. He added later that leaders from both political parties “have always negotiated these appropriations agreements in a bipartisan way. Once again, they’re just going at it alone.” Senate Appropriations Chairwoman Susan Collins, R-Maine, appeared to offer a package of bills negotiated between the parties before the vote on the defense bill. “We want this to be an open process with an opportunity to add additional bipartisan bills that address vital domestic priorities, including biomedical and scientific research and infrastructure,” Collins said. “And we want members to have a voice in the funding decisions that affect all of our states and constituents back home.”Stopgap bills in 2025Senate Majority Leader John Thune said during a floor speech earlier in the day the short-term government funding bill is needed to give lawmakers more time to negotiate final versions of the full-year spending bills. “We're simply asking them to extend current funding bills for a few weeks while we work on full-year appropriations,” Thune said. Congress is supposed to work out a bipartisan agreement between the House and Senate on those bills by the start of the fiscal year on Oct. 1, but hasn’t finished on time since the 1990s. So every September, once back from their August recess, the House and Senate write a stopgap spending bill that typically keeps the lights on until mid-December. Those short-term measures, sometimes called continuing resolutions or CRs, were traditionally negotiated among Republican and Democratic leaders in both chambers until earlier this year. House Republicans, bolstered by a sweep in last year’s elections, decided in March to write a six-month stopgap spending bill on their own, after two bipartisan short-term bills were approved earlier in the fiscal year. Senate Democrats voiced frustration with the process but ultimately helped Republicans get past a procedural vote that required the support of at least 60 lawmakers, allowing the March stopgap to advance toward a simple majority passage vote. House Republicans repeated their previously successful maneuver last month, writing a stopgap spending bill on their own that would fund the government through Nov. 21. Senate Democrats, however, changed tactics and have voted repeatedly to block the House-passed stopgap bill from advancing. Health care standoffDemocrats maintain that Republican leaders must negotiate to extend the enhanced tax credits that are set to expire at the end of the year for people who buy their health insurance from the Affordable Care Act Marketplace. Republican leaders have said publicly over and over that they will, but cannot guarantee Democrats a final agreement will be able to pass both chambers. They also say talks will only begin after the stopgap bill becomes law and the government reopens. “Despite the fact we’re only in this position because of Democrats’ poor policy choices, Republicans are ready for that discussion,” Thune said. “But only once we’ve reopened the government.”Thune also raised concerns over what message it would send for GOP leaders to negotiate during the shutdown, which he said would endorse the use of funding lapses to achieve policy or political goals. Shutdowns in historyRepublicans forced the last two government shutdowns; the first in 2013 over efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act and the second in 2019 over Trump’s insistence lawmakers approve more funding for the border wall. Both were unsuccessful. Schumer, D-N.Y., said in a floor speech Thursday that Republicans drafting the stopgap spending bill on their own is a stark contrast to how things have worked for years and that they can’t expect Democrats to vote for something in which they had no say.  “For the last month, the Republican leader’s favorite number has been 13. He keeps citing 13 CRs that we passed when I was majority leader. Of course we did,” Schumer said.  “What he fails to mention — I'm not sure if he forgets, or he’s deliberately trying to ignore it — is that those 13 CRs were the product of bipartisan negotiation, of serious conversation. We had to make changes in those bills when our Republican colleagues suggested it,” he added. “They were in the minority, but they had the right to be heard, a right that has been completely shut out for Democrats under this new Republican majority.”Schumer warned Republicans about open enrollment for the Affordable Care Act Marketplace beginning on Nov. 1, saying tens of millions of Americans will soon realize what congressional inaction means for their family budgets. He said Republicans’ unwillingness to negotiate before the shutdown began or since shows they “either don’t understand it or they’re brutally callous.” ‘I want to be happy Mike’House Speaker Mike Johnson said during a Thursday morning press conference that Republicans “have no idea” how the government shutdown will end, and blamed Democrats in the Senate for not voting to advance the stopgap bill. House Homeland Security Committee Chair Andrew R. Garbarino of New York said the government shutdown is undermining the day-to-day operations of the Department of Homeland Security.“This shutdown is making our country less safe,” he said. Garbarino said roughly 90% of federal employees at the Department of Homeland Security are required to continue working because they have essential roles such as vetting customs at ports of entry and monitoring air space at airports. He said those working without pay include 63,000 U.S. Customs and Border Protection employees; more than 61,000 Transportation Security Administration agents; and 8,000 Secret Service agents. Garbarino added that he was grateful Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem was using funds from the “One Big Beautiful Bill” to pay the roughly 49,000 Coast Guard personnel. In a statement to States Newsroom, DHS said it would be able to continue hiring U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents and “deploy law enforcement across the country to make America safe again” due to funding from the “One Big Beautiful Bill.” Amid the government shutdown, the Trump administration has continued its aggressive immigration crackdown.Johnson expressed his frustration that some Homeland Security employees were working without pay.“We should not have Border Patrol agents not (being) paid right now because Chuck Schumer wants to play political games to cover his tail,” the Louisiana Republican said. “I don’t like being mad Mike, I want to be happy Mike … but I am so upset about this.”",,,,2025-10-16 16:03:59.379003

As a candidate for New Mexico governor, she’s amassed nearly $7 million from every state in the country, according to a Source New Mexico analysis of her Oct. 14 campaign report.
 (Photo by Andi Murphy / Native America Calling)Donations from every state in the country — not to mention territories, military bases and Washington, DC — have poured in to support Deb Haaland’s Democratic campaign for New Mexico governor, according to her latest campaign filings.
In total, former U.S. Interior Secretary Haaland has reported more than 180,000 individual donations since her campaign began, helping her amass nearly $7 million. Of that, $4 million came in the last few months, according to her Oct. 14 report to the New Mexico Secretary of State’s Office. 
The sheer number of donation records “was so large it overwhelmed the SOS website,” a spokesperson said Wednesday. A Source analysis of the report illustrates Haaland’s widespread support.
Slightly more donations came from California than from New Mexico: 33,277 donations, totaling about $1.1 million. Haaland received 33,269 donations from New Mexico, totaling about $1.9 million.
Governor’s race pulls in big bucks for Democratic frontrunners

North Dakotans gave $5,700 in 180 donations. Hawaiians gave $34,993. The Virgin Islands gave $45. 
The number of donations to Haaland, a member of the Pueblo of Laguna and the nation’s first-ever Indigenous cabinet secretary under President Joe Biden, demonstrates her nationwide profile and towers over her closest opponent in the Democratic primary, Bernalillo County District Attorney Sam Bregman. He’s earned about $2.6 million from a little more than 2,200 donations. 
Many of Haaland’s donors gave multiple times and often just a few dollars at a time. More than 37,000 donations were for just $5. Her average donation is $37. 
The most recent filings cover donations between April and September, with about seven months until the June 2, 2026 primary election.
In a statement about the donations, Haaland thanked her supporters, noting the number of donations from New Mexicans since announcing her campaign in January. 
DA Sam Bregman enters race for governor

“I look forward to continuing to travel the state, hearing directly from New Mexicans about their struggles, and what they want to see in plans for affordability, healthcare, education, and public safety,” she said.
The biggest donation of $215,000 came from Haaland’s congressional campaign account. After that, a few other top donors who gave around $12,000 each include Illinois Gov. Jay Pritzker; Gerald Singleton and Brett Schreiber, the namesakes of a prominent law firm with business in New Mexico. Several Indigenous tribes across the country also donated, and Haaland received donations from campaign committees for U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Massachusetts) and Rep. Steny Hoyer (D-Maryland).
Of Bregman’s reported donations, about 20% were from out-of-state contributors, according to his filings. 
“This campaign is powered by New Mexicans who want a candidate with a real common-sense plan for the future.” Bregman said in a statement. “As the outsider in this race, nobody expected us to raise this kind of money. But I’ve never been one to shy away from hard work. This incredible show of support proves folks are ready for something new.”

(Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)Iowa’s largest health insurer, Wellmark Blue Cross-Blue Shield, is suing the Iowa insurance commissioner to block enforcement of a new state law that attempts to regulate pharmacy benefit managers.
Earlier this year, state lawmakers and the governor approved Senate File 383, which regulates pharmacy benefit managers, employee benefit plans, insurance carriers, and other third-party payors that provide or administer prescription drug benefits.
The Iowa Association of Business and Industry filed a lawsuit in June to block enforcement of the new law. On July 21, 2025, a federal judge ruled the law was, in some respects, illegal and invalid and issued an injunction blocking its enforcement

However, that court ruling was limited in that it prevents the state from enforcing the law only against the plaintiff in the case, ABI, and its members and contractors.

In its newly filed lawsuit over Senate File 383, Wellmark notes that nowhere in the ABI ruling did the court suggest that non-parties to that case were precluded from similarly challenging any future enforcement efforts, although the injunction in the ABI case is currently on appeal to the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals.
In its lawsuit against Iowa Insurance Commissioner Doug Ommen, Wellmark says the scope of the injunction raises the question of whether Ommen can “legitimately seek to enforce” the new law.
“The answer to that question, in Wellmark’s view, should be ‘no,’” Wellmark argues, stating that the court found the law is preempted by the federal Employee Retirement Income Security Act, or ERISA, and that it also violates the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.
Despite that, Wellmark argues, on Sept. 24, 2025, Ommen issued guidance in the form of a bulletin indicating he believes he is “obligated” to enforce the new law “in its entirety” against all regulated entities who were not plaintiffs in the ABI case.
In addition, Wellmark says, the commissioner recently asked Wellmark for information regarding the new law’s implementation, signaling possible investigatory and enforcement efforts.
“Wellmark believes that the appropriate scope of the preliminary injunction should include Wellmark’s administration of all of its business accounts and individual insurance products — but Wellmark acknowledges the full scope of the preliminary injunction in this respect is subject to reasonable competing interpretations,” the lawsuit states. “That lack of clarity now necessitates Wellmark seeking relief in this court.”
The insurer says its legal action will help prevent “many piecemeal complaints” being filed to extend the ruling in the ABI case to others who weren’t part of that lawsuit.
“Wellmark had hoped to avoid filing this lawsuit,” the company states in its petition, adding that the commissioner’s position on enforcement, as well as Wellmark’s own interests and those of the people it insures, necessitates court intervention.
“The court should issue an injunction halting, and declare illegal, (the commissioner’s) enforcement of Senate File 383 with respect to the plans and policies Wellmark insures and administers for those who are not parties to ABI,” the petition states.
In addition to Wellmark Blue Cross-Blue Shield of Iowa, the plaintiffs in the case include affiliates Wellmark Inc., Wellmark Health Plan of Iowa, and Wellmark of South Dakota. The Iowa Insurance Division and Ommen have yet to file a response to the lawsuit, and the Iowa Capital Dispatch was unable Thursday to reach the division’s spokesperson for comment.
Wellmark is Iowa’s largest provider of health insurance and related administrative services, and also is Iowa’s largest provider of health insurance for individuals, such as those served by the health insurance exchange through the Affordable Care Act. According to the company, through its plans and policies, Wellmark now serves more than 800,000 people in Iowa.
New law backed by pharmacy lobbyist turned legislator
Senate File 383, which supporters have said will help financially support Iowa’s pharmacies, imposed new regulations on the pharmacy benefit managers, or PBMs, that negotiate drug prices on behalf of health insurers.

The floor manager of the bill in the Iowa House was Rep. Brett Barker, a Story County Republican who is vice president of pharmacy for NuCara Management Group, an Iowa company that oversees 35 pharmacies. Barker has also served on the board of the Iowa Pharmacy Association, which lobbied the Iowa Legislature to approve the bill earlier this year. In 2022 and 2023, before his November 2024 election to the Iowa House, Barker worked as a lobbyist for the pharmacy association.
Among other requirements, the bill includes a provision for pharmacists to be paid a dispensing fee of $10.68 for preparing and dispensing medications. Opponents of the bill have argued it will increase Iowa consumers’ pharmaceutical costs by tens of millions of dollars annually.
As part is its lawsuit, Wellmark claims the legislation is one of “the most expensive, single Iowa legislative enactments ever passed effecting an increase in costs for health-benefit plans,” and says it will lead to the “largest increase in health benefit plan costs for Iowa’s third-party payors from any source of legislation — federal or state — since the enactment of the Affordable Care Act by Congress in 2010.”
The company estimates that for the plans and policies it insures or administers, the new law will increase costs by nearly $100 million annually, and that the individuals covered by Wellmark policies will face an additional $40 million in costs.
When signing the bill into law, Reynolds indicated it was a “difficult decision” for her.
“After extensive research and thoughtful conversations with employers and stakeholders on all sides of this complex issue, I made the decision to sign Senate Filed 383 in an effort to continue improving our health care system by bringing greater accountability to the role of pharmacy benefit managers,” she said in a written statement. “My administration will closely monitor implementation to mitigate and ensure that any unintended consequences for private employers are addressed.”

When the head of the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s urban search and rescue team resigned after the deadly July 4, 2025, Texas floods, he told colleagues he was frustrated with bureaucratic hurdles that had delayed the team’s response to the disaster, according to media reports. The move highlighted an ongoing challenge at FEMA.
Ever since the agency lost its independent status and became part of the Department of Homeland Security in the early 2000s, it has faced complaints about delays caused by layers of bureaucracy and red tape, leaders at the top with little experience in emergency response, and whiplash policy changes.
Now, the Trump administration is cutting jobs at FEMA and talking about dismantling the agency, which would push more responsibility for disaster response to the states.
Yet, federal emergency management is crucial in America.
I run the Hazards Vulnerability & Resilience Institute at the University of South Carolina and for years have worked with states and communities facing hazards and disasters.
To better understand FEMA’s value, let’s take a look back at how the nation responded to disasters before the agency existed, and what history reveals about when FEMA was most effective.
Disaster response without the U.S. government
Before 1950, disaster relief and response were not considered a federal responsibility. When a hurricane, flood or tornado hit, community members and humanitarian groups, such as the American Red Cross or Salvation Army, brought in food, shelter and medical aid and solicited charitable donations to help people rebuild.
State and local governments had primary responsibility for disaster response. But mostly people relied on family, neighbors and charity.

Federal aid was approved on a case-by-case basis. War Department guidelines in 1917 stated that aid would be allowed only if a senior military officer certified that responding to the disaster would exceed local and state resources.
Then the Great Mississippi Flood of 1927 and the 1930s Dust Bowl gave new meaning to the concept of disaster in America.
In 1927, the Mississippi River broke through its levees, submerging more than 1 million acres of land across seven states. An estimated 700,000 people were displaced from their homes and workplaces.
Herbert Hoover, then U.S. commerce secretary, was given full authority to create, coordinate and carry out the federal relief effort.
The Red Cross set up camps using tents provided by the War Department. Coast Guard and Navy boats rescued people stranded by flooding.

But the response drew criticism for the lack of direct federal money to help flood survivors and the treatment of Black sharecroppers and laborers.
A few years later, the droughts of the Dust Bowl era began destroying crops in the Great Plains, causing widespread damage.
Federal disaster aid begins to take shape
After the flood, the federal government began to formalize its role in disaster management.
Flood control projects became a federal responsibility with the passage of the Flood Control Act of 1928.
President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s New Deal provided emergency relief to farmers in the Great Plains and set up the Soil Conservation Service to help them reduce the effects of future droughts.
These were among the first disaster mitigation policies at the federal level.
There was little coordination among agencies, however. Various aspects of disaster relief and recovery were handled by the departments of Defense, Agriculture, and Housing and Urban Development and the Small Business Administration. Each had its own rules and requirements.
In 1950, Congress passed the Federal Disaster Relief Act, establishing the first permanent authority for federal disaster relief.
The act gave the president the responsibility to determine how aid would be distributed and which agencies would be involved. The legislation also broadened the federal mission to include disaster preparedness and mitigation and formalized the process for issuing presidential disaster declarations.
The creation of FEMA
By the 1970s, large-scale disasters such as hurricanes Betsy (1965) and Camille (1969), and the fragmented disaster response, led the National Governors Association to call for a single comprehensive emergency management agency.
Its report provided the blueprint for President Jimmy Carter’s 1979 executive order that established the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or FEMA.
The new agency became the home for emergency management within the executive branch. It was intentionally designed as an independent federal administrative agency that could work across federal agencies to support state and local governments in times of crisis.
FEMA wasn’t created to lead the disaster response.
Instead, it helps state and local officials by mobilizing federal resources, such as search and rescue, debris removal and funding when a disaster overwhelms the state’s capacity.
FEMA could do this quickly because of established federal contracts and its ability to move equipment and responders into the region before a disaster hits.

When things began to fall apart
However, FEMA’s ability to act fast changed after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. The agency was restructured as a unit in the newly formed Department of Homeland Security.
But the Department of Homeland Security’s focus was on terrorism and law enforcement, not natural disasters.
The loss of autonomy and direct reporting to Congress, unfunded mandates outside the scope of the 1988 Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act, and major increases in the number of large and complex disasters stretched FEMA’s capabilities.
When Hurricane Katrina hit New Orleans in 2005, FEMA’s response drew widespread criticism.
It was slow to deploy people and supplies and lacked enough experienced responders who knew what to do. Decision-makers were not familiar with new national response plans. Further breakdowns in communications and a lack of coordination among agencies led Congress to declare the Hurricane Katrina response a failure of initiative and agility.
FEMA’s reputation improved after the government brought in more experienced leadership and committed to preparedness planning and better response capabilities.
However, the first Trump administration, from 2017 to 2021, reversed those gains. Three different heads of FEMA in four years led to understaffing and conflicting directions.
As Trump took office for the second time in 2025, he and his administration talked about dismantling FEMA and pushing more disaster management to states.
A series of disasters taught SC how to work with FEMA. Leaders encourage reform, not ending it.

Job cuts and resignations at FEMA reduced the number of employees with training and experience vital in disasters. Political appointees to senior roles in the agency and in the Department of Homeland Security lacked emergency management training and experience.
A new policy that all purchases over $100,000 be personally approved by Homeland Secretary Kristi Noem led to more resignations. For disaster response, a delay in waiting for a signature to work its way up the chain can cost lives.
What now?
Dismantling FEMA and leaving little or no federal coordination of disaster response puts states in a difficult position.
States must balance their budgets every year, and increasingly “rainy day” funds are insufficient to cover unexpected large disasters. As the federal government shifts other financial responsibilities to states, funds will diminish further.
A single disaster can cause hundreds of millions of dollars in damage and require widespread disaster response and then relief efforts. Since 1980, the cumulative cost of weather-related disasters has exceeded $2.9 trillion. With a warming atmosphere producing more intense storms, increasing human and economic harm are likely.
Members of Congress have proposed making FEMA an independent, Cabinet-level agency again. I see some distinct advantages in doing so:

Fewer management layers would enable faster deployment of federal supplies and personnel to assist disaster response.
A streamlined, more nimble agency could cut red tape for disaster survivors needing assistance, meaning delivering relief funding faster and more equitably.
If an independent FEMA had responsibility for recovery beyond its current 180-day reimbursement limits, that could improve long-term recovery efforts, especially if Congress provided permanent funding streams and consistent rules and regulations.

The Trump administration’s efforts to dismantle FEMA are shortsighted in my view. Instead, I believe the best move is to restore FEMA as an independent executive agency as it was originally envisioned.

But it was rage that Blais felt when she read an Oct. 2 letter from Blue Cross & Blue Shield of Rhode Island, announcing that its subsidized insurance coverage for her 85-year-old aunt was ending Jan. 1. A copy of the letter was shared with Rhode Island Current. 
“It just sent me right over the edge,” said Blais, a nurse at Our Lady of Fatima Hospital and president of the United Nurses & Allied Professionals. “She’s relying on health care the most she ever has in her entire life. To get blindsided with this notice, it’s just so inappropriate.”
Peggy — Blais asked not to print her aunt’s full name out of respect for her privacy — is among 275 Rhode Island seniors who will lose access to a discounted Medicare Advantage plan available to former company workers and their families at the end of the year, Rich Salit, a Blue Cross spokesperson, confirmed in an email on Thursday. The end of coverage was first reported by WPRI-TV 12 on Wednesday.










She’s relying on health care the most she ever has in her entire life. To get blindsided with this notice, it’s just so inappropriate. 


– Lynn Blais, whose aunt’s health insurance is covered by a Blue Cross & Blue Shield of Rhode Island retirees plan


Salit cited “skyrocketing medical and prescription drug costs” and multimillion dollar operating losses as the impetus for the coverage ending, along with other cost-cutting measures. Health insurers nationwide, including Blue Cross, have faced major blows to their balance sheets and operating margins. The pressure is expected to intensify as health care costs swell and federal tax subsidies through the Affordable Care Act expire at the end of the year.
Other cost-cutting measures Blue Cross has planned include reducing spending on vendors and “working to proactively support members with complex needs to avoid more costly interventions,” Salit said. 
Blue Cross ended 2024 $115 million in the red, alongside a $113 million underwriting loss, prompting layoffs for 30 employees, or 3% of its staff, according to news reports. Its financial standing improved slightly as of June 2025, down to a $3.7 million loss, according to filings with the Rhode Island Department of Business Regulation. 
Ending the subsidized Medicare Advantage group plan for former company retirees and their spouses will save the company $125,000 a year, while eliminating a $6 million liability from its balance sheet, Salit said.
The discounted plan was only available to former Blue Cross employees hired before 1992 who met age and years-of-service criteria, and their spouses, and who retired before April 1, 2013.

Blais’ aunt and her aunt’s late husband, Elia, have relied on the discounted insurance plan for over a decade, Blais said. Elia worked as chief legal counsel for the health insurer for a decade, leaving in the early 1990s to take a job with the state of Rhode Island. Elia died in April. But Peggy still uses the coverage to pay for physician visits to the nursing home and for medication to manage her Parkinson’s symptoms, Blais said.
Her aunt’s short-term memory and general health worsened considerably over the last year after she fell and broke her hip in January. She moved into a nursing home a few months later. Blais, who now serves as power of attorney for her aunt, had no intention of telling her aunt about the loss of coverage through Blue Cross.
“I wouldn’t want to stress her out,” Blais said. “It’s just not worth putting her through that.”
Blais is shouldering the stress alone as she considers alternatives.
Affected plan participants can choose another Medicare Advantage plan through Blue Cross, or other insurers, during the annual enrollment period that began Tuesday, and runs through Dec. 7. Salit said Blue Cross’ alternative plans for Medicare-eligible patients offer monthly premiums “as low as $0 to $35.”
But Blais was bracing for pricier premiums, given the nationwide trend in health insurance costs and her aunt’s age and existing health conditions.
“It’s not like I am insuring some 65-year-old, newly retired person,” Blais said.
Blue Cross offered a specialist and phone number in its letter to assist retirees and their spouses with preparing for  the end of subsidized insurance coverage. But Blais said she has not called the number.
 “That would not have been a fun conversation,” Blais said. “I am still too angry.”
Her indignation was not only for her aunt, but for other seniors set to lose insurance coverage who might not have someone to rely on for making health care decisions.
“Think of all those people who don’t have anybody who can stick up for them or help them in this,” Blais added. 
Blais also said she filed a complaint with the Rhode Island Attorney General’s office. Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha denounced health insurers for hiking costs to consumers, urging the Rhode Island Office of the Health Insurer to reject any requested rate increases for commercial insurance plans. Neronha’s office did not immediately respond to inquiries for comment on Thursday.
The approved 2026 commercial premiums, which do not cover Medicare Advantage plans, mark the largest increases in over a decade, though they are less than what insurers, including Blue Cross, requested. Medicare Advantage plans are regulated primarily through the federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. Rhode Island’s health insurance commissioner also licenses the companies that sell Medicare Advantage plans and considers their overall financial health in reviews of other commercial insurance premiums.

David Rosenberg College of Law in Lexington. (Kentucky Lantern photo by McKenna Horsley)LEXINGTON — Kentucky Supreme Court justices must once again balance power between the state’s executive and legislative branches. 
The high court heard oral arguments in two cases Wednesday involving separation of powers between Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear and Republican office holders — a recurring theme during the governor’s two terms in office. 
One case centered on a 2021 law that shifts control of the State Fair Board from the governor to the agriculture commissioner. The second restructures the Executive Branch Ethics Commission, allowing each of the constitutional officers (with the exception of the lieutenant governor) to appoint a member. The governor, who now appoints all five members, would have only two appointments under the contested law and the rest would go to Republican office holders — Attorney General Russell Coleman, Secretary of State Michael Adams, Auditor Allison Ball, Treasurer Mark Metcalf and Agriculture Commissioner Jonathan Shell 
Beshear and lieutenant governor are the only two Democrats in the executive branch. He has repeatedly tried to fend off legislation that bolsters the authority of the General Assembly, which is controlled by Republican supermajorities in both chambers. 
Though the cases deal with two different laws, lawyers before the court offered similar arguments in both of them. Matt Kuhn, the solicitor general in the attorney general’s office, argued that it is in the General Assembly’s purview to redistribute power within the executive branch. While discussing the Ethics Commission lawsuit, Kuhn pointed to Beshear’s disbanding of the previous commission in 2020 by way of executive order. 
“No other governor has abolished the commission. No other governor has ensured immediately that that governor has a majority of appointees. That’s what the General Assembly was responding to,” Kuhn said, adding that legislators wanted to “spread the appointment power.” 
The commission oversees ethical standards for all executive branch officials and employees. 
Meanwhile, Beshear’s General Counsel Travis Mayo argued that governors typically enjoy “supreme” power as the head of the executive branch, elected by voters every four years. One of those powers is the ability to appoint members of commissions and boards and is in the state Constitution, he added. 
The contested law involving the Ethics Commission removes “supreme executive power of appointment” from the commission that would “ensure that the commission faithfully executes the laws.”
“That violates the Constitution because it deprives the governor of the supreme executive power, and his ability to use that power of appointment, to ensure the laws are faithfully executed,” Mayo said. 
The justices had questions for both sides. Justice Angela McCormick Bisig raised concerns during the Ethics Commission hearing about the court having to weigh the checks and balances between the legislative and executive branches under the state Constitution.

“So my concern, as may be articulated in the previous oral argument, is having that ‘check’ go too far in either direction, because we are tasked with enforcing all of those sections of the Constitution holistically, and they must work in harmony together,” she said. 
Speaking to reporters after the hearings, Coleman, the Republican attorney general, said that he felt his office gave “two very successful arguments.” The attorney general also added that the crux of both cases is “the fact that the governor doesn’t like laws passed by the General Assembly — full stop.”
Asked if legislators would still feel motivated to enact such laws if the governor were a Republican, Coleman said the laws “just makes sense — Republican or Democrat.” 
“The General Assembly under our Constitution makes policy,” Coleman said. “They make these determinations of how to shift power. We enforce them on the first floor (of the Capitol).” 
Scottie Ellis, a spokesperson for Beshear said Thursday afternoon that the state Constitution says the “governor has the duty to ensure our laws are followed.”
“To do so, Gov. Andy Beshear should have the same authority as every governor before him,” she added. “The attorney general’s argument is that the General Assembly can take any executive power and move it away from any governor from a different party. It would render whole sections of the Constitution meaningless, take away the voters’ choice of who should have the powers of the governor, and eliminate the very separation of powers created by our Constitution.”

Konstantinos “Kosta” Diamantis, Connecticut’s former state deputy budget director, took the witness stand in federal court in Bridgeport on Thursday in an effort to fend off allegations that he used his position overseeing the state’s school building office to solicit tens of thousands of dollars in bribes from construction contractors.
For several hours, Diamantis testified about his past work on school construction projects in Connecticut and his relationship with three construction officials, all of whom have previously admitted in court to paying him bribes.
Federal prosecutors spent the first six days of the criminal trial presenting evidence that Diamantis had received payments from two officials with Acranom Masonry, which won multimillion-dollar contracts to help build schools in Hartford and Tolland.
Diamantis and his defense attorney, Norm Pattis, sought to explain away the emails, text messages and other direct evidence presented in the case. And they attempted to reshape the narrative that prosecutors put forward: that Diamantis eagerly traded his influence over school building projects for bribes and other favors from construction contractors.
“Mr. Diamantis will tell you he never took a bribe,” Pattis told the jury an opening statement. “And he will tell you he never used undue influence on school construction projects.” 
The only goal that Diamantis had as the head of Connecticut’s school construction program, Pattis argued, was to save taxpayers money. 
“He gave everything he had for the job he loved,” Pattis said. 
When he took the stand, Diamantis admitted that he accepted money from Acranom’s president Sal Monarca and vice president John Duffy, which the text messages in the case highlighted. But he said that money was not for helping the company win school construction contracts.
Instead, Diamantis said, he collected a “fee” for introducing Acranom’s leaders to the executives at D’Amato Construction, whom Diamantis is close friends with.
“Contractors are always looking to expand their network,” Diamantis said. 
“I made an introduction between John Duffy and D’Amato construction,” he added. 
Diamantis, who previously served in the legislature and practiced law, told the jury that he personally researched the state ethics code to determine if collecting that type of “fee” crossed the line.
That testimony stood in stark contrast to what Duffy and Monarca told the jury just days before. Both of them admitted under questioning that the money they delivered to Diamantis at a Dunkin’ Donuts, at his home and in restaurant bathroom were bribes that were meant to win them contracts on school construction projects.
Diamantis, who looked directly at the jury as he testified, challenged the prosecution’s assertion that he ruled the state’s school construction office with an iron first. And he repeatedly told the jury that he had no control over what companies got hired on school construction projects. 
He said that type of decision was up to local officials in Connecticut’s towns and cities.
“The state of Connecticut is not party to any of those contracts,” Diamantis said.  
That testimony also ran counter to what several local officials in Tolland and Hartford told the jury last week. The head of Hartford’s School Building Committee and the superintendent of Tolland schools said Diamantis told the municipalities what companies to hire in several instances.
They said they went along with those instructions because of the grip that Diamantis had on state funding for school construction projects.
At times, Diamantis’ answers to his attorney’s questions turned into history lessons about Connecticut’s school construction policies and his time in the state government. At one point, Diamantis named all of the people he managed in the school construction office.
Some of those answers stretched on for so long that prosecutors actually complained to the judge during a break that Diamantis’ testimony was irrelevant to the trial, and they said he seemed to be “filibustering” in order to drag out the trial for some reason. 
Anastasia Diamantis testifies
Diamantis’ daughter, Anastasia, was also called as a defense witness on Thursday to testify about the work she performed as an administrative assistant for Antonietta DiBenedetto Roy, the owner of Construction Advocacy Professionals, a firm that won several contracts for school projects in Tolland, Hartford and New Britain.
While being questioned by Pattis, Anastasia Diamantis said it was Roy who approached her and asked her to apply for the job at her firm. 
But under cross examination, she acknowledged to prosecutors that it was her father who encouraged Roy to contact her for the administrative assistant job. She also admitted that she asked Roy to pay her $20 per hour, but Roy chose to pay her $45 per hour instead.
Roy previously told the jury she paid a higher rate in order to keep Diamantis happy and to gain work on school construction projects. 
Diamantis told jurors that the federal investigation into his work within the state government had turned his life and that of his family’s into “a living hell.” 
“My family and myself have been dragged through the mud,” he said.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2025_1006_SR_KostaTrialDay1_139-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-10-16 15:02:38.461865

Amy Rosenthal, executive director of the nonprofit Health Care For All, will join state government next month as undersecretary of health, the Executive Office of Health and Human Services announced Wednesday.
Rosenthal will step into the role Nov. 17, succeeding Kiame Mahaniah, who was elevated to secretary of health and human services this summer after former Health and Human Services Secretary Kate Walsh stepped down.
Rosenthal is leaving Health Care For All as lawmakers look to the nonprofit to play a leading role in the effort to make sure people retain their health insurance.  The House on Wednesday passed legislation that allocates $10 million for a Health Care For All public awareness campaign to “inform vulnerable populations about new Medicaid work requirements put in place by the Federal Government.”
Rosenthal has led Health Care For All since 2017, expanding its size and sharpening its focus on health equity, community engagement and access to affordable health coverage, according to the organization. The nonprofit is a prominent voice for expanding subsidized insurance and preserving free preventive health care.
“Amy is the health policy leader and convener we need to drive creative solutions,” Mahaniah said in a statement released by the agency. “Her deep understanding of the people we serve – particularly access and affordability issues – and her strong relationships across the health care system in our state will serve Massachusetts residents well.”
Rosenthal previously spent more than a decade at the national advocacy group Community Catalyst, where she led campaigns to pass and defend the Affordable Care Act. 
She also worked in the Massachusetts Legislature in the Senate Post Audit and Oversight Bureau, on Democrat Myrth York’s unsuccessful run for governor of Rhode Island in 2002 and at pediatric hospitals on public health initiatives, according to LinkedIn. Since 2014, she has lectured at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.
Her appointment comes as the Healey administration continues to navigate high-level turnover. Walsh was one of six Cabinet members to announce their departure a little over halfway through Healey’s first term. Transportation Secretary Monica Tibbits-Nutt became the latest to resign Thursday morning.
Rosenthal’s appointment does not require legislative confirmation. She will report directly to Mahaniah.
Health Care For All on Thursday afternoon announced that Ashley Blackburn has been promoted to deputy executive director, a new and permanent leadership role, and will also serve as interim executive director while the board conducts a national search for a permanent executive director.
“The strong team at HCFA is unwavering in their commitment to the organization’s mission. Whether they are answering calls on the HelpLine, staffing tables at community events or lobbying for policy changes at the State House, HCFA’s team is making a difference each and every day. We know the organization will continue to thrive and excel long after Amy’s departure,” HCFA Board Chair Trishan Panch said in a statement.",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/IMG_5699.jpg?fit=1024%2C774&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-10-16 15:02:38.461865

(Getty Images)The U.S. Department of Agriculture has informed states that there are insufficient funds to pay for SNAP benefits in November — unless Congress passes a spending bill by the end of the month.
SNAP benefits, also referred to as food stamps, help low-income families buy food. About 440,000 Minnesotans rely on SNAP. Most of them are children, seniors and people with disabilities. 
The Minnesota Department of Children, Youth, and Families instructed counties to stop approving new SNAP applications, effective Wednesday. That means families in need won’t be able to get approved for benefits until the shutdown ends.
“Pausing even a single day of applications for SNAP benefits could delay approval for hungry kids and families who don’t have a day to spare,” Senate Majority Leader Erin Murphy, DFL-St. Paul, said in a press release. 
Food shelves are worried about their ability to feed hungry families if benefits expire. Second Harvest Heartland, the state’s largest food bank, estimates that SNAP can provide nine times the amount of food as the food bank. Even small cuts to SNAP — let alone a complete expiration of funding — would have an outsized impact on the state’s emergency food system. 
The temporary lapse in funding comes amid other major changes to SNAP. A GOP mega-law signed into law by President Donald Trump on July 4 will cut funding for SNAP by around 20%, or $187 billion over 10 years, in order to offset the cost of extending the tax breaks Trump spearheaded in his first term, in addition to some new ones.
The SNAP cuts come from expanded work requirements for parents of teenagers and people between the ages of 55 and 64; changes to how utility and internet bills are counted against an applicant’s income when determining benefits; and cost shifts to the states.
The law also eliminated the SNAP-Ed program, which educated SNAP recipients on healthy eating and how to lead a physically active lifestyle. Those cuts resulted in 60 layoffs at the University of Minnesota.
The new work requirements for SNAP are scheduled to take effect on Nov. 1.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/gettyimages-1287472642-2048x1365-1-1024x6831746533271-1.jpg,,,2025-10-16 15:02:38.461865

He lost his job months after he canceled a class “to mourn and process this racist fascist country"" when Donald Trump won another term as president.","After spending nearly a year living in professional limbo, former Millsaps College professor James Bowley was terminated from his tenured position in early September. But the saga that began on Nov. 6, 2024, after Bowley’s remarks in the wake of the presidential election, continues. 
Bowley, who taught religious studies, had emailed his class of three students telling them their class had been canceled, “to mourn and process this racist fascist country” after Republican Donald Trump won a second, non-consecutive term as president.  The very next day, Bowley was placed on paid administrative leave while the college reviewed his use of an institutional email account “to share personal opinions” with students. 
Throughout the tumultuous grievance and appeals process in the months that followed, Bowley has maintained he does not regret his actions. A faculty grievance committee recommended Bowley be restored, but the college administration and ultimately the board of trustees overruled its decision. 
Now, he’s taking Millsaps to court. 
In his lawsuit filed Sept. 26 in Hinds County Circuit Court, Bowley alleges the college violated its contractual obligations and promises by punishing him for his speech. 
For a tenured professor to be dismissed from employment, Millsaps’ faculty handbook requires documented evidence of “neglect, indifference, incompetence, professional or personal misconduct” that “substantially” impairs the faculty member’s fulfilment of their institutional responsibilities. In its initial decision to dismiss Bowley, the college claimed he was improperly grading assignments, that attendance was being incorrectly logged and that he was neglecting and routinely canceling one of his classes. 
Bowley’s lawsuit says the college fabricated those charges against him after already having made the decision to fire him for his email. 
“What they have done to me is censorship. There’s no other way to define it,” Bowley said in an interview with Mississippi Today. “Once they get away with censorship of one person, then everybody else either protests or self censors.”
A representative for Millsaps confirmed in a statement that the college was aware of the lawsuit. “We believe the facts of this matter will speak clearly during the court process ahead,” said Joey Lee, who is Millsaps’ director of communications and community engagement. 
Bowley’s termination and subsequent lawsuit come amid a nationwide battle over academic freedom, with a spate of faculty firings in universities such as the University of Mississippi, the University of South Dakota, Clemson University and Texas A&M University. There has been pushback by civil liberties organizations such as the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression and the ACLU, some of which have also mounted legal challenges to these firings on First Amendment grounds.
“We are concerned that universities and colleges continue limiting the ability of professors to comment on important matters of public concern,” said Joshua Tom on behalf of the ACLU of Mississippi, clarifying that the organization was not commenting specifically on Bowley’s dismissal. “It is important especially in higher education for professors and students to be able to talk about and debate topics from different viewpoints. Firing people results in a shutdown of that opportunity and a worse academy.”
In the days since his termination, Bowley says, he has witnessed an outpouring of support, both from Millsaps alumni and other community groups, but still longs for justice from the courts. 
“I just do not want to be that person who bows down,” Bowley told Mississippi Today. “Freedom of speech, academic freedom – those principles, those ideas, are super important to me, and I’m willing to spend money and put time in to defend them.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/31153800/James-Bowley-5.jpg,,,2025-10-16 15:02:38.461865

Mallory McMorrow, who is a candidate for Michigan’s U.S. Senate seat, recently called the Israeli war in Gaza a genocide on the Palestinian people – a move that sparked a series of tough questions for her campaign on Wednesday evening during a forum focused on Arab and Muslim voters.
The event, hosted by Emgage Michigan, featured McMorrow and progressive candidate Abdul El-Sayed. U.S. Rep. Haley Stevens (D-Birmingham), who is considered the Democratic establishment’s favorite in the race, did not attend the forum due to a scheduling conflict, her campaign said.
Stevens’ absence allowed McMorrow and El-Sayed a platform to answer questions posed by Emgage moderators, which for the most part focused on free speech and were questions fielded to both candidates so voters could compare their answers.
El-Sayed, McMorrow highlight free speech policy at U.S. Senate forum focused on Muslim community

But the moderators took McMorrow to task with a series of individualized questions aimed at just her, almost exclusively related to her shifted stance on the genocide occuring in Gaza and reports that she filled out a position paper for the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, or AIPAC, the largest pro-Israel lobby in the United States.
Democratic candidates across the board, in Michigan and abroad, are getting hammered with questions about whether they would accept money or logistical support from AIPAC, which has funded candidates to the tune of millions of dollars. Several of those candidates who have received money from the committee have been friendly toward Israel, have voted in favor of sending defensive and offensive weapons to Israel in its war in Gaza, and have refused to call Israel’s actions a genocide.
Stevens has reportedly accepted a sum total of $5.17 million from the organization, according to AIPACTracker, which tallies money spent on candidates through the PAC.
In Michigan,  Lt. Gov. Garlin Gilchrist was among the few gubernatorial candidates willing to plainly call the Gaza situation a genocide, and he did so recently at a national Arab American convention held in Dearborn.SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
El-Sayed was early in his support for Palestine, has called the situation a genocide since the launch of his U.S. Senate bid and has said publicly that he would not accept money from AIPAC.
McMorrow’s stance became clearer earlier this month. On a brewery tour stop, McMorrow was pressed with a question on Gaza and accepting money from AIPAC.
The state senator from Royal Oak said that she would not be accepting money from AIPAC, not now or in the future, nor was she seeking its endorsement.
She also called the war and the strife there a “moral abomination.” When asked if she would call it a genocide, McMorrow, after a deep breath and long pause, said it was by definition a genocide.
That news of McMorrow’s opinion on Gaza was blunted, so to speak, by an article published by Dropsite News, a Substack blog covering national politics and foreign affairs. The blog reported in September that McMorrow had privately produced an AIPAC position paper that at least one pro-Israel donor said was “outstanding.” Those details came from a donor call obtained by Drop Site news, which was also published online.
McMorrow clarifies stance on Gaza, joins Michigan Democrats calling situation a genocide

On Wednesday, Emgage moderators at the event asked about McMorrow’s response to the Gaza question during her brewery tour. The senator was asked if she was willing to go beyond rhetoric and support blocking weapons sales to Israel if elected to the U.S. Senate. She was also asked if she would impose sanctions on Israel, and if her response to the question was genuine, as opposed to well-timed due to the changing view on Gaza.
McMorrow said she appreciated the question, and that the north star on her moral compass was rooted in believing that no life was worth more than any other.
“I am somebody who is married to a Jewish man who feels deeply about what is happening in the Middle East and also still faces scars from having family members who were killed in the Holocaust,” McMorrow said. “I understand how much pain there is. And after Oct. 7, 2023 as the war raged on, it got worse. I don’t know how anybody could look at photos and videos of what we saw coming out of Gaza and not be absolutely heartbroken at the starvation, at the suffering, and realizing this was not just about retaliation, it got so much worse.”
McMorrow said her position was that the United States should use “every tool at its disposal, especially in this moment now, where there is a very tentative cease fire, to ensure that this is a permanent cease fire, it’s not another fleeting one, and that Palestinians can have long term peace and security.”
In the Dropsite News article, McMorrow said she wanted to be clear that what she’s said in public is the same rhetoric that she espouses behind closed doors.
“You can view my position on my website. You can view it in public statements. I do anywhere from half a dozen to a dozen public events every single week, and we have hard conversations in the room on my statewide brewery tour,” McMorrow said. “I am proud to say that no question is off limits, and we talk about this frequently, but we have to acknowledge that in our state, we have Arab American communities, Muslim American communities and Jewish American communities. Some members of our community are involved with AIPAC. I believe in meeting with everybody.”
McMorrow also said she did not intend to seek AIPAC‘s support or endorsement, not even from the very beginning.
“But I believe in meeting with everybody, because we have been able to have these difficult conversations and bring together what is a shared goal of a permanent cease fire of the violence, ending of the killing,” she said. “Is that going to be everybody’s position? No, but what I say in private is exactly what I say in public.”

Tommy Tuberville Thursday praised President Donald Trump; accused Democrats of bringing the federal governor shutdown and outlined several goals he wanted to accomplish should he be elected governor.
Speaking to the Montgomery Area Chamber of Commerce on Thursday, Alabama’s senior U.S. senator said “we all need to come together,” then provided an update on the government shutdown where he said he would “blame people on the left for this.”
Republicans, who control the House and the Senate, have not been able to overcome a filibuster on a budget resolution from Democrats, who want Affordable Care Act tax credits extended to the end of the year and guarantees that the Trump administration will spend allocated money as intended. The federal government shutdown is in its third week.
Tuberville said he voted for a continuing resolution to reopen the government and retain the current funding levels even though the budget spends $2 trillion more than what the government collects in revenue to allow Social Security payments and payments to military personnel.
He added that he firmly rejected the budget that Democrats have proposed, falsely saying that immigrants without status in this country receive federal health care benefits.
“If we continue to fund, educate, give health care, to people in this country who don’t pay taxes, who are here illegally, we won’t make it,” Tuberville said. “They want to do that. Our health care has got a long way to go to be improved. We have got good health care, not great. But at the end of the day, we cannot afford to pay for people who are not citizens of this country.”
Immigrants without status may not purchase Affordable Care Act plans through exchanges and are not eligible for Medicaid, Medicare or CHIP. Immigrants with status face eligibility restrictions for Medicaid and CHIP, and many must be legally present for five years before accessing benefits. All immigrants pay sales taxes.
President Joe Biden’s administration applied enhanced tax credits for people who purchase health insurance through ACA exchanges, reducing the cost of accessing health care. If the credits expire,  health insurance premiums for ACA recipients could more than double.
The tax credits are tied to income and will affect many lower income households.
According to a study published in September by the Kaiser Family Foundation, a person who currently earns $28,000 annually can expect to pay roughly $325 for a silver plan through the exchange. However, if the tax credits expire, the premium increases to $1,562.
Tuberville also praised Trump for imposing tariffs while acknowledging that they  are hurting domestic farmers.
“President Trump, he is a smart guy,” Tuberville said. “He understands it. He is not doing it to punish the American people. He is doing it to help the American people. Sometimes, you have to take a step back before you go forward.”
Prior to that statement, Tuberville said that the tariffs have placed a burden on American farmers, particularly with the trading relationship with China regarding soybeans.
“China normally buys 700 million bushels of soybeans from the United States of America,” Tuberville said. “Our soybean farmers have benefitted from that to some degree. You know how many they are buying this year; zero. Our soybean farmers are in trouble; they are in trouble.”
Throughout the address, Tuberville said he will improve Alabama’s education system when he is elected governor by incorporating vocational training into the curriculum in high schools.
“We need to start workforce development after the 10th grade,” Tuberville said. “Kids will have the opportunity to learn a skill or a trade, whether it is welding or plumbing or as an electrician. We have to get in on this because if we don’t, we are going to have to bring people in from other countries to do our jobs for us. That is not what we want.”",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/20251016_090716-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-10-16 15:02:38.461865

After a two-plus-year tenure dotted with both achievements and controversies, Tibbits-Nutt stepped down and Gov. Maura Healey turned to Eng — now one of the governor’s most trusted deputies — to fill the hole on an interim basis. 
Healey also promoted Highway Administrator Jonathan Gulliver, another veteran highly regarded among transportation insiders, to undersecretary as part of the shakeup. Like Eng, Gulliver will retain his prior role while gaining additional responsibilities. 
The staffing overhaul significantly changes the makeup atop MassDOT more than halfway into Healey’s term, just a bit more than a year before she is up for reelection.  
Healey’s office said Tibbits-Nutt “plans to return to private industry” and will continue to serve as an advisor through the end of the year, but otherwise did not provide any additional details about the reason for her departure.  
Tibbits-Nutt notched several transformative milestones, including the launch of a new low-income fare option on the MBTA and receipt of a nearly $1 billion federal grant toward a project to replace the Sagamore Bridge. She also drew ire over candid comments she made about tolling at the state’s borders and was caught up in a major fight about how the department awarded a lucrative contract to operate highway service plazas. 
Healey said Thursday she did not ask Tibbits-Nutt to step down. Asked if the secretary left because of the service plaza controversy or her highly scrutinized remarks at a Walk Massachusetts event in 2024, Healey replied, “No, absolutely not.” 
“We’ve been with Secretary Tibbits-Nutt for a while, and we wish her all the best in her next chapter as she moves back to private industry,” Healey told reporters at an unrelated event. 
Healey’s decision is a ringing endorsement of Eng, whom she described as the most important appointment of her tenure when she hired him in March 2023. He arrived with the MBTA largely in disarray after years of deferred maintenance and safety problems; while the agency still faces a slew of obstacles today, service has improved and public confidence in the T  is trending upward. 
“Over the last [two] and a half years, Phil Eng has demonstrated that he’s a terrific manager. He gets it done,” Healey said. “The trains are running on time, and a lot has happened because of his leadership and his management. I expect he’ll bring that same level of management and leadership statewide.” 
It’s also a sign of confidence in Gulliver, whom Healey’s office described as the longest-serving highway administrator. 
Eng will not receive any extra pay for his work as interim transportation secretary, a Healey spokesperson said. Last year, he earned a total of $546,684 as MBTA general manager, according to state payroll data. 
It’s not clear how long he will hold both roles. Eng said he is “open to holding [the interim job] as long as it’s needed,” and has not had any discussions about taking over as secretary on a permanent basis. 
“I’m taking it day by day,” Healey said. “In evaluating what to do in the wake of Secretary Tibbits-Nutts’s departure, I thought Phil was the right person for the job. I’m focused right now in the immediate on getting him onboarded.” 
“Obviously, an interim can’t last forever, but we’re going to take that all as it comes,” she added. 
Both Healey and Eng said they are confident he will not be spread too thin, suggesting the additional duties would not have been offered and accepted if they posed too heavy a load. 
“I intend to stay just as engaged as I’ve been with [the] MBTA, and I know that doesn’t sound feasible, but it is,” Eng said. “They know what they’re doing. MassDOT people know what they’re doing.  What I’ve done is really empower them. Once we’re all moving in the same direction, I don’t need to be told every single thing. We know how to operate.” 
MBTA Advisory Board Executive Director Brian Kane, who represents municipalities that help fund the T, praised Tibbits-Nutt for her work and said he hopes Eng’s tenure as interim will be short so he can return his attention to trains, buses, trolleys, and ferries. 
The one-two pairing of Eng, a “train guy,” and Gulliver, a “highway guy,” should help balance the department’s work, Kane said.

“Phil’s a safe pair of hands. If anything has been shown in the last two years, it’s that he can handle it,” he said. “He used to work for [the New York Department of Transportation]. He has the experience. He knows how to run bridges and roads and highways. I think he’s the right call.” 
Still, Kane said the decision to give additional responsibility to Eng and Gulliver — who are already responsible for two of the largest workloads in state government — reflects a “short bench” within MassDOT. 
It’s not the first time a member of Healey’s Cabinet has held two roles at once. Education Secretary Patrick Tutwiler spent a few months also working as interim commissioner of the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education before Pedro Martinez started on the job. 
After spending years on the Fiscal and Management Control Board that oversaw MBTA operations, Tibbits-Nutt started in the Healey administration as an undersecretary. She took on the top job on an interim basis following the abrupt resignation of Transportation Secretary Gina Fiandaca in August 2023, and officials dropped the “acting” part of the title a few months later. 
While she had the backing of many transportation activists, her approach to the job ruffled some feathers, especially after she signaled an openness to raising fees on ride-hailing services such as Uber and Lyft and expanding tolls to the state’s borders — an idea Healey quickly rebuked. 
“Governor Healey should have fired Secretary Tibbits-Nutt the moment she declared she wanted to ‘go after anyone who has money’ and vowed to create more and raise tolls across the Commonwealth,” Republican gubernatorial candidate Mike Kennealy said Thursday in response to the MassDOT baton-pass. “The era of appointing extreme progressive activists to run our government and tax our citizens into leaving Massachusetts will end when I’m Governor. It’s time for leadership that values competence, accountability, and affordability – not ideological crusades.” 
Eng is now the third person to hold the job of transportation secretary on an interim or permanent basis since Healey took office in January 2023.  
Tibbits-Nutt becomes the latest in a string of cabinet members heading for the exit, following former Health and Human Services Secretary Kate Walsh, former Economic Development Secretary Yvonne Hao, retired Public Safety Secretary Terrence Reidy, and Veterans Services Secretary Jon Santiago, who plans to step down this fall. 
“I think it’s normal if you look back at other administrations,” Healey said of the turnover. “These are hard jobs. These are really hard jobs, and I’m just really grateful to the strength and the quality of all who have served.” 
Eng will now lead MassDOT as the department attempts to chart a path forward for highway service plaza operations. 
Earlier this year, officials awarded a 35-year contract for redevelopment and management of the plazas to Irish retailer Applegreen. That set off a political firestorm, with losing bidder Global Partners mounting an all-out offensive that included intense public pressure and a lawsuit alleging their rivals had an unfair leg up. 
Applegreen dropped out of lease negotiations, and MassDOT opted this week to redo the bidding process rather than turn to Global. 
Eng said the initial procurement “was done in a transparent way.” 
“Having said that, one of the things that I’ve been focused on at the T and I’m going to focus on at MassDOT is: How do we get more competition? How do we get more interest in doing these projects? And was that structured in a way that maybe we can change it a little bit to encourage more bidders?” he said. 
“We’re going to take the next couple of months as we prepare for the procurement and really look at what the market can do, where we think we can do better, maybe specify some different things in our procurement documents,” Gulliver added. “We’re really going to be evaluating all the different options, and our goal is to deliver the best service plazas for the travelers in Massachusetts and at the best value for taxpayers.”",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/10-16_Eng_presser_2-scaled.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-10-16 15:02:38.461865

(Courtesy of Sioux Falls School District)A South Dakota board voted on Thursday to expand teaching scholarships for areas of critical need to cover all prospective K-12 teachers, in response to teacher shortages around the state.
Currently, South Dakota’s Critical Teaching Needs Scholarship targets college students studying for specific teaching fields such as special education, high school math and science, and career and technical education. Awardees must maintain a 2.8 grade-point average and teach in the state for five years. 
“You could argue that any certified teaching position, right now, remains in a shortage,” state Department of Education Secretary Joseph Graves said during the virtual meeting of the Critical Teaching Needs Scholarship Board. 
South Dakota’s ACT score declines but outperforms similar states and national average

State officials presented data showing persistent turnover and vacancies across nearly all teaching disciplines. At the end of the 2023-24 school year, public school districts reported 1,178 full-time equivalent instructors no longer employed, and at the start of the current school year, 137 full-time equivalent teaching positions were unfilled statewide.
The scholarship board agreed that narrowing eligibility no longer makes sense when most districts are struggling to attract applicants.
Parkston Superintendent Patrick Mikkonen said “there is just no candidate pool” for his school district in southeastern South Dakota. 
“I can’t get anything, as far as an applicant,” he told the board.
The board approved a motion to open the scholarship to all K-12 teacher education students and to make it auto-renewable for recipients who maintain the required GPA. Currently, students have to reapply after the first year. 
Twelve students were awarded a combined total of $120,732 in scholarships for the 2023-24 school year, an average of about $10,000 per student. The funding comes from interest earned on the state’s Education Enhancement Trust Fund. 
The state’s Critical Teaching Needs Scholarship application window opens on Nov. 1 and closes on Dec. 15.

(Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Kansas Supreme Court Chief Justice Marla Luckert likely suffered a stroke, doctors determined after she was involved in a minor traffic accident.
Luckert, 70, was elevated to chief justice in 2019 and has been on the state’s highest court since appointed by Republican Gov. Bill Graves and sworn into office in 2003.
In a statement, Luckert said the accident occurred Oct. 9 while driving home from work.
“Fortunately, I did not hit any other vehicle or hurt anyone,” she said. “Doctors believe I had a stroke, which caused the accident.”
Luckert was hospitalized for several days and is recuperating at home while on medical leave from the Supreme Court.
“It does not appear that I will need speech or physical therapy, but I have been ordered to rest for at least the next few weeks,” her statement said. “I’m resting comfortably at home.”
Luckert expressed gratitude for prayers, expressions of concern and warm thoughts about her situation. She said she would release public updates in the future.
Luckert was born in Goodland and earned a law degree at Washburn University in Topeka. She worked in private practice for more than a decade. Democratic Gov. Joan Finney appointed her to the Shawnee County District Court in 1992.

The program helped over 8,000 households keep warm last winter, but can only provide a fraction of that assistance now. 
The post Low-income Wyomingites shut out of heating help during shutdown appeared first on WyoFile .","The federal government shutdown has forced state officials to pause a program that helps thousands of Wyoming residents stay warm in the winter.  
The Wyoming Low Income Energy Assistance Program helps eligible households by paying a portion of their winter home heating costs. However, the Wyoming Department of Family Services, which administers the program, has halted approval of new applications because it has run out of federal funding.
The stoppage comes as temperatures in Wyoming have begun plunging into the 30s as winter approaches.
“The program has been paused because there are no remaining federal funds to authorize new benefit payments or to approve applicants until Congress passes a spending bill, the federal government reopens, and funding has been received by DFS,” according to a press release from the agency. 
When the application window opened in September, the department experienced high call volumes. That may have been related to Rocky Mountain Power’s rate hike, Kelly Douglas, a DFS spokesperson, told WyoFile. 
Before the funding ran out, DFS was able to approve 1,168 households for this winter. Those residents will be supported through May. However, they represent just a fraction of the 8,236 households the program was able to assist last season. 
“This is hard for them,” Douglas said. “And we are doing our best. At DFS, we work directly with clients, and we understand the hardship. And it’s been hard.”
While approvals are paused, Douglas said new applicants should continue to submit applications and respond to requests from DFS for additional information. That way, Douglas said, delays can be minimized once the federal government reopens and the agency receives funding. The federal shutdown has already lasted two weeks, and there is little sign in Washington that things will change anytime soon.
The department is looking to community partners in the meantime to help bridge the gap. 
“Sometimes crisis prevention can be as simple as food on the table and heat in the house,” Douglas said. “We know this can help with all kinds of crises that come down the line. So we really work for concrete support for our families and individuals that need that extra boost.” 
Both renters and homeowners can qualify for the program, but must meet the income requirement of no more than 60% of the state median income level. The amount awarded is based on several factors, including energy needs, income and family size. The program prioritizes households with children 5 years old and younger, residents who are 60 and older, as well as residents who are disabled. 
Republicans and Democrats appeared no closer to an agreement on Thursday when the Senate again failed to advance a bill to reopen the government. A split between the two parties over extending subsidies for the Affordable Care Act marketplaces — which drastically reduce health insurance premium costs — led in part to the current shutdown. 
Between 11,000-20,000 Wyoming residents are at risk of losing their coverage due to the anticipated cost increases, according to Healthy Wyoming. 
Republicans have promised to discuss health care subsidies once the government is funded, but Democrats have rejected that, insisting instead on legislation.

Davids says she is planning to take legal action if Republicans gerrymander her district. (Chloe Anderson for Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Kansas’ lone Democratic congresswoman is preparing legal strategies to fight Republican redistricting efforts in court, should the need arise.
U.S. Rep. Sharice Davids, whose 3rd District seat is the target of a proposed November special session in Kansas, told reporters Wednesday she will fight efforts by Republicans to shift voting districts.
The special session will only take place if 84 of the 88 House Republicans sign on, and legislators have indicated they are short a few votes.
“Instead of changing their policies, they’re changing the rules,” Davids said. “Let’s call this what it is. It’s cheating. Most Kansans might not know what gerrymandering is, but they do understand what cheating is, and they know when something isn’t fair.”
Davids said she will take steps should the redistricting occur.
“We’re absolutely gearing up and will be ready to fight this in court if they continue down this road and are able to get a redistricting or gerrymandering done,” she said.
When the Kansas Legislature changed district maps in 2022, also targeting Davids’ seat, the congresswoman said she challenged the changes in court. Although she didn’t win, the changes Republicans made in the Kansas City-area district did not unseat Davids. She won reelection that year by a wider margin than before, then won her fourth congressional term in 2024. 
As a former MMA fighter, Davids said that whether she’s in the cage or the halls of Congress, she wants to win but she wants to do so “fair and square.”
“It’s not fair to Kansans to manipulate district boundaries just to give one political party more power, and it sure isn’t fair to Kansans to take marching orders from Washington extremists instead of listening to Kansans that you’re supposed to be serving,” she said. 
“This is a blatant power grab,” Davids added. 
A Republican contingent traveled to Washington, D.C., this week to meet with President Donald Trump. Although Senate President Ty Masterson, R-Andover, said redistricting was not on the agenda, Davids believed it would be discussed. 
“All of this is happening behind closed doors, which is one of the one of the more frustrating parts about this,” she said. “We know that the Republican legislators are coming out to the White House and are going to get their marching orders, but Kansans have yet to see what their plan is. I can’t tell you what the future steps look like.”
A photo posted on social media showed 34 Kansas House and Senate Republicans posing with thumbs up for a group photo behind a sign that read “White House State Leadership Conference.”
A separate photo showed a program agenda that included meetings with various Trump administration officials, including White House deputy chief of staff James Blair and White House Office of Political Affairs director Matt Brasseaux. The others were Veterans Affairs Secretary Doug Collins, Housing and Urban Development Secretary Scott Turner, Kelly Loeffler of the Small Business Administration, and White House Office of Intergovernmental Affairs director Alex Meyer.
Earlier this week, Johnson County community leaders spoke out against redistricting efforts at a rally in Mission.
To drive Davids out of office, a new map would have to fracture Johnson County into two or three districts.
“Johnson County is the economic engine of Kansas,” said Tiffany Stovall, CEO of Kansas Manufacturing Solutions. “Splitting up our region — which leads the state in economic power — threatens our business community. Our workforce, our community, our families are all interconnected. Dividing us just so politicians can hand-pick their voters is wrong.”
Laurel Burchfield, advocacy director of Mainstream Coalition, which helped organize the Tuesday night rally, said she hoped the event would signal community opposition to any plan to “rig the system.”
“Our elected officials’ job is to listen to us and try to help make life better for families,” Burchfield said. “But when districts are manipulated and gerrymandered to make elections less competitive, officials listen less to voters, and more to special interest groups.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/KVP-09-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-10-16 15:02:38.461865

Ciattarelli said the NJ governor should work with Trump.,"The future of the Gateway project, which would build two new rail tunnels under the Hudson River, is again in doubt after President Trump said Wednesday he is terminating billions in infrastructure projects for New York. (Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images)The massive project to fund construction of new Hudson River rail tunnels again took center stage in our gubernatorial race Thursday, a day after President Trump said he was terminating New York-based infrastructure projects because of Democratic opposition to a GOP federal budget bill.
Democrats widely believe Trump’s comments in part target the Gateway project, two new rail tunnels to bring trains across the Hudson River and replace 115-year-old tunnels that regularly snarl rail traffic into and out of New York City.
Democrat Mikie Sherrill, a four-term congresswoman hoping to be elected governor on Nov. 4, appeared at the Secaucus train station Thursday to take aim at her Republican opponent, Jack Ciattarelli, arguing he would do little to curb Trump on issues like Gateway. Ciattarelli has said on the campaign trail that if elected, his attorney general would not sue Trump over presidential executive orders.
“In order to get good results for people, you have to fight back. You have to be willing to go toe-to-toe. You have to be willing to have your AG take him to court. My opponent has pledged never to take the administration to court. He says he agrees with everything the president does,” Sherrill said.
Governor Murphy’s energy policy scrutinized as his two terms wrap up

Ciattarelli has argued that New Jersey’s chief executive should work with Trump, not in opposition to him. He echoed those thoughts on social media Wednesday following Trump’s remarks.
“New Jersey needs a Governor who has the standing to work with, and when necessary disagree with, the President and advocate for New Jersey’s fair share of federal tax dollars — including the Gateway Tunnel,” Ciattarelli said. “This is a critical infrastructure project and I will fight to get it done.”
Trump, whose administration two weeks ago said it would freeze federal funding for the $16 billion tunnel project and for New York City’s replacement of the 2nd Avenue Subway, said during a press conference Wednesday that numerous “Democrat projects” are being terminated because of the federal budget impasse.
“The project in Manhattan, the project in New York, it’s billions and billions of dollars that Schumer has worked 20 years to get — it’s terminated. Tell him it’s terminated,” Trump said, referring to Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-New York).
He said the White House was terminating programs on a “permanent basis.” The U.S. Department of Transportation, which administers the funding, and the Office of Management and Budget, which Trump said made the rescission, did not immediately return requests for comment.
A spokesperson for the Gateway Development Commission, a bistate agency tasked with overseeing the Hudson tunnel project, declined to comment, as did a spokesperson for NJ Transit, whose trains run through the existing 115-year-old tunnels into New York.
The mechanism used for the termination is unclear, as is whether Gateway may continue to receive funding.
The Gateway project has topped Sherrill’s list of priorities since before she was elected to Congress in 2018. On Thursday, she stressed the project’s importance to the regional economy and residents’ quality of life.
“This is critical, and it’s critical to the economy of the United States, but it’s also critical to the men and women who commute every single day because without these improvements, it means continuing to miss dinner, to miss soccer games, to not be able to coach teams, to not get time with your family. It’s a quality-of-life issue day after day,” she said.
Laborers International Union of North America Vice President and Eastern Regional Manager Mike Hellstrom, whose members work on the Gateway project and whose union has endorsed Sherrill, on Thursday said already disbursed funds could support the project for about 45 days.
Once that money is spent, the project would face $1 million in daily costs and potential lawsuits over contract violations related to a work stoppage spurred by funding lapses, he said.

,California,2025-10-16 18:00:37+00:00,CalMatters,"Cal State workers are getting a one-time bonus, paid for by a $144 million loan due next year",Mikhail Zinshteyn,,,,,https://calmatters.org/education/higher-education/2025/10/cal-state-loan/,The $144 million loan will be used to pay for one-time bonuses for faculty and staff.,"In summary
The $144 million loan will be used to pay for one-time bonuses for faculty and staff. 


The California State University system will seek a state loan of $144 million that it’ll have a year to repay at no interest, even though current projections show the system will have to add to its deficit to repay the debt.Cal State’s chief financial officer says the loan will be used to offer one-year bonuses to faculty and staff. While salaries vary widely across the system, the extra $144 million is roughly a 3% increase in the total pay for Cal State’s workers, including executives. State law says the loan needs to be repaid by next July.Despite months of hesitation, the system today took the first step to request the loan and will likely get the money in 60 days or less, said Cal State’s interim chief financial officer, Patrick Lenz, in an interview. The process involves approval from state lawmakers, who are likely to support the move.State lawmakers made the loan available to Cal State after they cut state funding to the system by $144 million this year. Cal State has 22 campuses and enrolls 460,000 students.
The system’s largest union, the California Faculty Association of 30,000 workers, is cheering this decision but says more work is needed to bring back lecturers whose contracts were cancelled as many campuses contend with shrinking budgets. The union’s contract is expiring but negotiators from the union and Cal State leadership haven’t met since April.“We will take this as a win, but we have so much work to do, and I do hope that this provides an opening for the management to come to the table with us and negotiate fairly,” said Elaine Bernal, a lecturer at the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry at Cal State Long Beach and senior member of the faculty association.“The one-time investment, great, but we really got to focus on long-term investment,” she said.The Legislature intends to increase state spending for Cal State in 2026-27 by just $101 million — far lower than previous promises from Gov. Gavin Newsom of about $250 million — so the system will effectively be $43 million short once it repays the loan, Lenz said. The decision to take the loan came “after careful deliberation, conversations with the chancellor, conversations with our Board of Trustees,” Lenz said.
Money is chronically tight at CSU. Since 2023 the system has battled ongoing deficits that have led to hundreds of degree and course cuts, fewer lecturers and hiring freezes. Back then, the system said it was spending $1.5 billion less than it should to adequately educate its students.
Over the past two years that figure has grown by several hundred million dollars as costs rise for campus utilities, insurance, health benefits and more. The deficits exist even as the system in 2024 began increasing tuition annually; the added costs outweigh the new revenue from charging students more. However, most students don’t pay tuition because of state and system financial aid.
Despite those fiscal pressures and likely new expenses to replace the Trump administration’s cuts to federal education grants, Lenz said system leaders want to spend the money on workers.
Unions wanted loan
The zero-interest loan has been the source of intrigue and scrutiny since July as unions representing Cal State workers have been pressuring the system to agree to borrow the money so campuses can offer pay increases for workers. Unions and some lawmakers argued that the the system was fully funded because the state budget gave CSU the option to borrow the loan, which should trigger collective bargaining contract language that stipulated that ongoing raises would kick in if the system received an increase in state funding.But Cal State officials say that even if they take the loan, it’s not new or ongoing funding — it’s money they’d have to repay after a year — so the system isn’t obligated to increase wages like those contracts dictate.Lenz reiterated that point during an interview, even after indicating the system will take out the loan.“Clearly, anything that is one time is not ongoing,” he said of the loan. So any raise “would be only for the 12 months of the budget year.” But maybe the state will send more cash to the system than what lawmakers and Newsom signaled in the annual budget deal they solidified in June, Lenz said. He also suggested that CSU could negotiate more time to repay the loan.“There’s a long way to go in this process, and there’s a lot of unknowns,” he said.
How CSU got here
That the loan even exists is itself an example of curious budgeting tactics by lawmakers and  Newsom. Last year they passed a state budget that gave Cal State a moderate increase in state funding with a warning of huge cuts of $375 million this July — equal to about 8% of what the state spends supporting the CSU.After a half-year of fierce advocacy from Cal State officials, students and workers, the final 2025-26 budget approved in June applied just a 3% cut to CSU, with a promise that the cut — $144 million — would be restored in the 2026-27 budget year that begins next July. To help Cal State manage its finances this fiscal year, the state said the system could borrow $144 million this year and repay it by the end of June 2026.The loan option was extended to multiple state agencies, including the University of California.
System budget leaders, including Lenz, in July expressed wariness over taking out the loan because if the state’s budget picture remains shaky — it’s already projecting billions of dollars in deficits — then lawmakers may decide to apply further cuts to the CSU. That means the system would be in a deeper deficit and be on the hook for a loan they couldn’t repay.
The fiscal malaise could have been worse. In 2022, Newsom promised the CSU and University of California five years of increasing budget support totaling more than $1 billion for each system in new, ongoing funding. But because of state budget constraints, that so-called “compact” has only been partially funded. And new funding pain points are likely on the horizon. Congressional Republicans and President Donald Trump approved spending plans that Newsom says will kick millions of low-income Californians off public health insurance. If the state plans to pay for that care, budgets for other agencies, especially those that can raise tuition, may need to decrease.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/050625_CSU-San-Marcos_AH_CM-01.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-10-16 14:03:19.432967

(Cindy Gonzalez/Nebraska Examiner)McCOOK, Neb. — Thirteen McCook residents filed a lawsuit this week to stop Nebraska officials from converting a state prison into an immigration detention facility with the backing of a former lawmaker who helped pass the law directing the state’s use of the facility.
The 24-page lawsuit, filed Tuesday in Red Willow County District Court, argues Gov. Jim Pillen’s in-progress plan to convert the Work Ethic Camp in McCook would “usurp” legislative authority and violate separation of powers under the Nebraska Constitution and state law. Pillen and Rob Jeffreys, director of Nebraska’s correctional system, are named in the case.
“Nebraska state law is clear: The governor does not have the unilateral authority to change the purpose of any public building,” said Robert McEwen, legal director of Nebraska Appleseed, which is leading the case. “That’s the Legislature’s job.”
Nebraska Appleseed is a nonprofit organization advocating for people in need, including immigrants.
‘Supreme executive power’
Pillen and state and federal officials announced plans on Aug. 19 to repurpose the Work Ethic Camp from a state prison offering rehabilitative programming for low-risk felony offenders to a “Midwest hub” for immigration enforcement. Pillen and U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem have sought to rebrand the facility as the “Cornhusker Clink.”
Pillen, at that time, said the facility would remain state-owned and operated and be operational by mid-October. Earlier this week, he said it would instead be operational by November.


Alleged violations of the separation of powers
Nebraska Constitution: “The general management, control and government of all state charitable, mental, reformatory, and penal institutions shall be vested as determined by the Legislature.”
Nebraska state law: “Any public building that is erected or repaired and for which an appropriation is made by the Legislature shall be constructed or repaired in a complete manner within the limits of such appropriation. Except as provided in sections 72-811 to 72-818 and 79-11,109, no building shall be changed or diverted from the use or purpose, kind, or class of building from that for which the appropriation was originally made.”


“There’s some little details, but everything’s been moving in great progress,” Pillen said Tuesday, according to reporting by KETV. “We’re really excited about it.”
Pillen has previously argued state law gives him authority through the creation of the Nebraska Department of Correctional Services, plus a clause in the Nebraska Constitution that “supreme executive power rests with the governor.”
Spokespeople for the Nebraska Governor’s Office, Nebraska Attorney General’s Office and Nebraska Department of Correctional Services had no immediate comment on the lawsuit Thursday.
Following the money
The lead plaintiff, DiAnna Schimek of Lincoln, served in the Nebraska Legislature between 1989 and 2009, including as chair of the Legislature’s Government, Military and Veterans Affairs Committee. She was one of 41 lawmakers who approved the Work Ethic Camp in 1997 at the request of then-Gov. Ben Nelson, a McCook native and the state’s last Democratic governor. 
The facility was meant to reduce prison crowding by moving out low-risk offenders and making space for more violent offenders elsewhere. The Work Ethic Camp opened in 2001, and since then, the Legislature has repeatedly appropriated state funds to keep up the facility. 
As of last year, the facility had a state budget of at least $9.5 million and about 85 staff, according to September 2024 state budget documents.
Schimek and the 13 McCook residents argue that without legislative approval, Pillen, Jeffreys and other officials can’t convert the facility or use state funds other than how lawmakers have specified. The lawsuit also states the Corrections Department has authority over state prisoners, not non-citizens awaiting civil proceedings seeking to deport them.
The Corrections Department contracted with Outback Fence, a Lincoln-based fencing company, paying $750,000 to install a 12-foot razor-topped fence at the prison by the end of the month, with at least $187,500 already spent, according to the lawsuit.

To get their feet in the courthouse door, Schimek and the McCook residents argue the case concerns an unlawful expenditure of public funds and a “matter of great public concern.”
Lawyers on behalf of Schimek and the McCook residents sent a demand letter Tuesday to the Nebraska Attorney General’s Office, asking that the “unlawful” actions stop. The plaintiffs had threatened to sue by Wednesday if those demands were ignored or rejected.
“Without an injunction, the plaintiffs will suffer substantial, irreparable harm, which is a hardship that outweighs any hardship the defendants may face,” the lawsuit states. 
While many public records requests seeking information about the state-federal plan have been denied, documents released to a government watchdog group indicated that negotiations between Nebraska and federal officials started in March or sooner, while the Legislature was still in session.
McCook residents speak out
In separate affidavits, Schimek and the 13 McCook residents attested to their concerns about the state-federal plan, expressing concern about not having an opportunity to participate in the policy decision before Pillen and others acted.
“I am concerned about the community that I live in becoming a more toxic environment as a result of the WEC being repurposed to become an immigration detention center,” Catherine McDowell of McCook said in her affidavit.
Dale Dueland, a 49-year resident of Red Willow County, said he is an active volunteer for community and civic organizations in McCook. He said his focus has been on building McCook into a “thriving rural community.” He wrote that he worried about “irreversible damage to the economic development and community growth that I have spent my whole life working to build.”
“Specifically, I am concerned that the repurposing of the WEC to be an immigration detention center will negatively impact local businesses, home values and create reputational harm to the organizations that I have served,” Dueland continued.

Some McCook residents expressed concern for McCook children and the “toxic public dialogue” or “fear” the decision had already caused. Ronda Graff said she worried the prison’s repurposing would undermine long-time efforts to create a “welcoming, friendly and engaging community.”
Many inmates work in the community, and multiple residents said they appreciate those connections. Will Branham, a member of the McCook Arts Council, said inmates have contributed to the growth of McCook’s arts scene. Matt Sehnert said he’s spoken with men at Work Ethic Camp about career prospects and that they appreciate being seen as “valuable human beings.” 
“It was clear to me that the men took great pride in working to improve our community,” Sehnert said in his affidavit.
State Sen. Victor Rountree of Bellevue, a member of the Legislature’s Judiciary Committee, also submitted an affidavit as part of the lawsuit regarding information he had gathered from the executive branch.
The lawsuit seeks preliminary and permanent injunctive relief to halt the state-federal plan and prevent officials from pursuing a similar plan or contract without proper legislative authority. 
Red Willow County District Judge Patrick Heng denied the initial request for a temporary restraining order but will hear the case during a Thursday afternoon hearing.

Republican U.S. Sen. Susan Collins said Wednesday she strongly supports the nomination of David St. Pierre to fill the position that acts as the enforcement arm for federal courts. His nomination will need to be confirmed by the U.S. Senate. 
St. Pierre served in the Lewiston Police Department for more than 30 years, including as the chief of police from 2021 until his retirement last month. While at the helm of the department, he led nearly 100 employees and managed a budget of more than $10 million. He had a central role in coordinating the local, state and federal officers who responded to the state’s deadliest mass shooting in October 2023 in his home court.
“His steady leadership during the most challenging moment in Maine’s recent history, the tragic mass shooting of 2023, demonstrated his professionalism, composure, and deep commitment to both public safety and public service,” she said in a statement. “With his extensive experience and unique skill set, I am confident that Chief St. Pierre will serve the people of Maine admirably as U.S. Marshal.”
Having graduated in 2018 from the FBI National Academy in Quantico, Virginia, St. Pierre is an active member of the FBI National Academy Associates. He’s also a member of the International Association of Chiefs of Police and the Maine Chiefs of Police Association.

(Photo by Emma Murphy/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — The new Oklahoma state superintendent on Thursday led his first CareerTech board meeting since being appointed and said he plans to continue attending these monthly meetings. 
This is a marked change from former Superintendent Ryan Walters who attended only one meeting this year, according to an Oklahoma Voice analysis of meeting minutes. The same analysis found him to be chronically absent from other boards he had a seat on as state superintendent. 
As state superintendent, Lindel Fields also serves as the chair of the state Board of Career and Technology Education. Fields was appointed by Gov. Kevin Stitt on Oct. 2 to replace former Walters, who resigned to lead a conservative teacher organization. 
Fields, a retired CareerTech administrator, said having an amicable relationship between the agencies will help them work together and he “doesn’t know any other way” to operate. 
“Attending this meeting is really important,” he said. “It’s important for CareerTech and the state Department of Education to be aligned.” 
As for the other boards he’s assigned to as state superintendent, Fields said there are around 15 boards he’s part of. For those he’s statutorily required to sit on, Fields said he or a proxy will attend. Other boards will, in most cases, have an appointee attending. 
CareerTech is a state agency that provides K-12 and postsecondary students with skills, training and hands-on education throughout the state in their classrooms and technology centers.
Brent Haken, director of Oklahoma CareerTech, often led the board meetings in Walters’ absence. He said it’s “vital” to have Fields and staff from the Education Department at the meetings so the agencies are aligned.

“I can’t be successful unless he is being successful, and we really partner on a lot of programs,” he said. “So what it means to me is that we not only have partnerships, but we can collaborate and we can discuss what makes a difference in this state.” 
There’s been a “drastic” shift in attitudes and tone surrounding the partnership of the two state agencies since Fields’ appointment, Haken said. People are “excited” to be part of this transformation and are more engaged, he said. 
Brian Bobek, a new board member for Oklahoma CareerTech and state Board of Education, was sworn in by Haken on Thursday. He previously served on both boards and was re-appointed by Stitt Oct. 2 to replace Zachary Archer.

There are five zoos in the state accredited by the Association of Zoos and Aquariums: Binder Park Zoo in Battle Creek, the Detroit Zoo in Royal Oak, John Ball Zoo in Grand Rapids, Potter Park Zoo in Lansing and Saginaw Children’s Zoo. This accreditation is centered on animal welfare, and of the 2,800 animal exhibitors licensed by the United States Department of Agriculture, less than 10% have received this accreditation. 
Michigan law currently bars accredited zoos from participating in breeding programs if they receive a critical citation from the USDA, even if the citation is for an issue unrelated to large carnivores, such as infrastructure or record keeping, Amanda Hanlin, chief of staff for the Detroit Zoological Society told to the committee. 
“This is really problematic because it can disrupt species survival plans that have been in place for decades and that are vital to supporting some of the most endangered large carnivores, including Amur tigers, polar bears, snow leopards and lions,” Hanlin said.

Hanlin pointed to an incident in Detroit last year where a raccoon had breached several layers of concrete and fencing to get into the zoo, where it attacked five mouse birds in an indoor aviary. SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
The zoo self-reported the incident to the USDA and received a critical citation. While the facilities team went into the habitat and performed extensive repairs, reinforced roof venting and installed trail cameras in order to ensure something similar would not happen again, there is not an option to have that citation removed despite taking corrective action, Hanlin said. 
“This is incredibly, incredibly significant for our zoo in particular, because we have two breeding licenses coming up in January that will expire, one for polar bears and one for lions,” Hanlin said. “So if we are not able to see this amendment through, then we would not be able to breed those animals beyond the time that those permits exist.” 
Andy McIntyre, the chief operating officer at John Ball Zoo detailed another incident in 2023, where a sitatunga – a species of antelope native to Africa – was killed when it was introduced to the zoo’s pygmy hippopotamus Jahari. 
Andy McIntyre, chief operating officer at John Ball Zoo, testifies before the House Regulatory Reform Committee. Oct. 16, 2025. | Photo by Kyle Davidson/Michigan Advance
Pygmy hippos have been housed with animals of this type at 15 other institutions, McIntyre noted. While the two animals had been introduced to each other visually without issue, the hippopotamus attacked the sitatunga during their physical introduction, killing it. 
As a result the zoo received a critical non-compliance citation from the USDA. Despite taking steps to address the USDA’s concerns, McIntyre said the zoo will be unable to continue supporting science-based breeding efforts with Association of Zoos and Aquariums partners across the country when its breeding license for Amur tigers expires in December and its licensing for snow leopards expires in February. 
However, Rep. Matthew Bierlein’s (R-Vassar) House Bill 5092 would amend state law to clarify that a zoo remains eligible for a breeding license so long as its exhibitor’s license from the USDA has been in good standing for the previous five years, McIntyre explained, meaning the license has not been suspended or revoked and the license holder has not been subject to any cease and desist orders.
The update would also bring the state into alignment with federal policy eliminating “teachable moments” where certain issues that might not have previously triggered citations now do so, McIntyre said. 
“House Bill 5092 strengthens both animal welfare and conservation leadership. It keeps the original intent of a large carnivore act intact, protecting the public and stopping irresponsible ownership, while also removing unintended barriers for institutions that follow the law,” McIntyre said. 
The 13 committee members in attendance voted unanimously to refer the bill to the House floor for further consideration.

“This should be the kind of candidate that Democrats want in every state in the country,” Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders said talking about Zohran Mamdani during a town hall event with Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez on CNN.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., as they speak during a stop of their “Fighting Oligarchy” tour at Civic Center Park, March 21, 2025, in Denver. Photo by David Zalubowski/AP
This story by Torrie Herrington was first published by NOTUS on Oct. 15. It was produced as part of a partnership with NOTUS and the nonprofit, nonpartisan Allbritton Journalism Institute.
Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-VT, and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-NY, pushed Democratic Party leadership to endorse New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani Wednesday night during a town hall event broadcast by CNN.
The pair of progressives even suggested that candidates in the same mold as Mamdani may be the antidote to the “doldrums” Democrats currently find themselves in.
“The guy is running an extraordinary campaign,” Sanders said. “He has something like 80,000 volunteers knocking on doors. He is bringing people out who never voted. He is bringing Blacks and whites and Latinos and Asians — everybody together around a really strong agenda talking about affordability in New York. What is not to like?”
“This should be the kind of candidate that Democrats want in every state in the country — strong grassroots campaigns, a willingness to take on the oligarchs and the big money interests and stand up for working class people,” he added.
Host Kaitlan Collins asked Sanders, “Are you speaking directly to [House Minority Leader] Hakeem Jeffries and [Senate Minority Leader] Chuck Schumer when you deliver that message?”
He responded, “Sure, I am. Hakeem, you watching this?”
NOTUS previously reported that Mamdani met with Schumer in September — and Jeffries earlier in the summer — but neither have issued a formal endorsement of the self-proclaimed democratic socialist.
When asked by Collins what she thought about Jeffries and Schumer’s decision to hold back from endorsing Mamdani, Ocasio-Cortez repeated her previous public statements that she believes it is crucial for the party to endorse its candidate once a primary has ended.
“Democrats have primaries for a reason,” Ocasio-Cortez said. “We may have our differences amongst one another within the party — some may be more conservative, some may be more liberal, or any other number of differences. That’s what we have primaries for. I believe in endorsing the nominee of the party after a primary has resolved itself.”
Ocasio-Cortez gave a related example: her decision to endorse former President Joe Biden after he won the Democratic primary in 2020.
“We all had to come together and do the work of supporting our party’s nominee in order to make sure that we win,” she said. “So I do worry about the example it sets when our leaders do not support the party nominee, because in the future, we will need folks to rally behind the presidential nominee.”
Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez spent the majority of the town hall discussing the ongoing government shutdown. During one particularly heated exchange, the pair called out their Republican colleagues for refusing to negotiate on measures that would end the standoff — namely, extensions to Affordable Care Act subsidies that would stave off massive increases in health insurance premiums.
Ocasio-Cortez said Republicans need to get to work, pointing out that House Republicans have been absent from Capitol Hill while House Speaker Mike Johnson keeps the chamber in an extended recess period.
“It is actually an unconscionable abdication and refusal to work,” she said. “I’ve never seen people who hate working so much in my life.”
She added, “Mike Johnson, you should be in that office negotiating with Hakeem Jeffries every damn day until we reopen this government, and any day that you don’t do that is a failure.”
Sanders echoed the sentiment, stating, “In the Senate, they need 60 votes. They don’t have 60 votes. They’ve got 53 or maybe 52 — that means you have to sit down and talk to the other side. It is not complicated. They are not doing that.”

Chellie Pingree at a launch event for her slow fashion caucus. (Provided by the office of U.S. Rep. Chellie Pingree)U.S. Rep. Chellie Pingree is seeking answers from the Trump administration’s top environmental official after reports that a long-delayed forever chemical risk assessment has been further postponed. 
The Democrat who represents Maine’s 1st Congressional District sent a letter to U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin on Thursday asking him to explain why a toxicity assessment for a particular compound of per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances, also known as PFAS, hasn’t been released. 
Earlier this month, the nonprofit news organization ProPublica reported that scientists confirmed a report outlining the health detriments of perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA) was “completed and ready to post” in April but waiting on final briefings from leadership.
Citing Maine Morning Star reporting, Pingree presses EPA on PFAS grant terminations

The assessment found that PFNA can cause developmental, liver, and reproductive harm, including lower birth weights and reduced testosterone and sperm levels, according to ProPublica. 
In her letter to Zeldin, Pingree argued the delay is part of a “growing pattern of interference with the Agency’s scientific work.” She pointed specifically to a decision in May to rescind some regulations under the PFAS safe Drinking Water Act, including ones that pertain to PFNA. 
“We both know that PFAS poses a significant public health threat to our water, food supply, and farming communities. It is necessary to take steps to combat PFAS contamination, yet this delay and erosion of capacity directly contradict your repeated public statements about both transparency and the need for strong, science-based PFAS policies,” she continued.
Pingree, who is a ranking member of the House Appropriations Interior and Environment Subcommittee, asked Zeldin when he will commit to release the PFNA assessment and ensure that future reports are “free from political interference.”
Earlier this year, Pingree also pressed Zeldin on why the EPA cut almost $5 million in grants for forever chemical research in Maine. Shortly after, some of the grants were restored without explanation. 
And in July, Pingree worked with a Republican congressman from North Carolina to reintroduce the Healthy Drinking Water Affordability Act, which seeks to provide grants to individuals and nonprofits in rural communities to identify and address PFAS and other contaminants in drinking water.

“In some states, beneficiaries can see doctors quickly and afford their prescriptions,” Gretchen Johnson, vice president at the Commonwealth Fund, said in a statement. “In others, they face higher costs, delays or red tape.”
Vermont, Utah and Minnesota ranked at the top in the report’s rankings, while Louisiana, Mississippi and Kentucky landed at the bottom.
Researchers scored states based on 31 indicators, including demographic data like age and income, as well as factors including having a usual care provider, preventable hospital stays, and the share of beneficiaries with potentially dangerous medication prescriptions.
For example, the share of hospital admissions in West Virginia that could have been avoided with quality outpatient care was more than double the share in Idaho.
Costs vary, too. Because traditional Medicare does not cover prescription drugs, people on Medicare usually purchase separate drug plans or purchase drug coverage as part of a Medicare Advantage plan.
But those out-of-pocket costs differ depending on where a person lives. Older people in North Dakota pay nearly 13% of their drug costs out of pocket, compared with people in New York who pay less than 5%, the report found.
High-performing states such as Vermont and Utah tend to share certain characteristics. Most have Medicare Advantage and prescription drug plans that offer better coverage than plans in other states. They’re also more likely to not require prior authorization for preventive services and specialty care.
Higher performing states also tend to have a health care system that performs well for people who aren’t covered by Medicare. States at the bottom of the rankings, such as Louisiana and Mississippi, have a much higher share of people who were uninsured or underinsured before they enrolled in Medicare.
“When people are sick coming into Medicare, they tend to be really sick when they’re on Medicare,” David Radley, a senior scientist at the Commonwealth Fund, told reporters on a press call earlier this week. “So if somebody is un- or underinsured before they age into Medicare, that might mean they have chronic diseases that may not necessarily be getting treated. They may be people that don’t get to see the doctor very often because they’re un- or underinsured.
“Then, when they age into Medicare, they can be much sicker on average than Medicare beneficiaries in other states.”

Roger Wicker. 
The measure passed the Senate 77-20, a rare bipartisan achievement in the chamber currently facing partisan gridlock and paralyzed by a government shutdown. The legislation is not final, but it sets Senate leaders up to begin negotiations with the House. 
Wicker, a Republican from Mississippi who leads the Senate Armed Services Committee, said in a statement that the legislation will help modernize the military and strengthen national security. 
“My colleagues and I have prioritized reindustrialization and the structural rebuilding of the arsenal of democracy, starting with drone technology, shipbuilding, and innovative low-cost weapons,” Wicker said. “We have also set out to enact historic reforms in the Pentagon’s budgeting and acquisition process to unleash innovation and root out inefficiencies.”   
The bill will now go to a conference committee to reconcile differences between the Senate measure and the version the House passed in September.
U.S. Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith, the junior Republican senator from Mississippi, also voted for the legislation. She said in a news release that the bill will help restore the strength of the country’s national defense. 
“The FY2026 NDAA builds on the down payment we made with the One Big Beautiful Bill by authorizing funding priorities and reforms,” Hyde-Smith said.  “I thank Armed Services Chair Roger Wicker for his leadership on this bill.”

Yazzie is one of the lead plaintiffs in an education court case that began over a decade ago. (Bella Davis/New Mexico In Depth)Indigenous education experts and advocates are outraged over the state’s draft action plan for improving education, which they say lacks detail and fails to meaningfully incorporate community input.
“We may be stuck with something that is unconscionable” if the Public Education Department doesn’t make changes before it submits the final plan to the court in early November, said Regis Pecos, a former governor of Cochiti Pueblo and co-director of the Leadership Institute at Santa Fe Indian School. “There has been a growing consensus that this is not what we need, and this is not what our children deserve.”
Pecos made those remarks Tuesday during a five-hour gathering attended by dozens of people just north of Albuquerque.

This story was originally published by New Mexico In Depth.

It’s been over seven years since a state judge in the landmark Yazzie/Martinez court case found New Mexico was violating its constitutional duty to provide a sufficient education to Native American and low-income students, English language learners, and students with disabilities.
The plaintiffs went back to court last fall, arguing the state wasn’t complying with the 2018 ruling. In April, another state judge agreed, setting an October deadline for PED to deliver a draft plan.
The 70-page document the agency crafted in response is “dismal,” said Melissa Candelaria (San Felipe Pueblo), education director at the New Mexico Center on Law and Poverty and attorney for the Yazzie plaintiffs. The draft, she said, is limited in concrete goals and funding estimates.

It’s so vague that it’s “almost useless,” said Rep. Derrick Lente, a Democrat from Sandia Pueblo who’s considered a champion for tribal education.
Asked for a response to those criticisms, PED spokesperson Janelle Taylor García wrote, “We appreciate the engagement from education experts, tribal leaders, and community stakeholders during this critical period.”
Any feedback “will help shape the final version of the plan,” García said. The final plan is due Nov. 3, after which the plaintiffs will be able to file objections.
But some education experts and advocates are frustrated that, in their view, the department hasn’t fully integrated feedback it’s received for years, most recently at public meetings held around the state in August.
Tribal communities have long called on the state to carry out the 2003 Indian Education Act, which is meant to ensure students receive an education that connects to their cultures, in part through Native language instruction, following a not-so-distant history of violent attempts at assimilation.
“Where our children spend the greater amount of their time during the course of the day, during the course of the year, that’s where they should also see themselves, their languages, their cultures and their history,” Pecos said. “The survival of language and culture is truly at stake.”
Christine Sims (Acoma Pueblo), an associate professor in the University of New Mexico’s Department of Language, Literacy, and Sociocultural Studies, presented a number of gaps she identified in the draft.
For instance, one of the goals the draft sets is that every community will have access to high-quality programming that leads to literacy in English and a second language, including Native languages.
But the draft doesn’t spell out how schools will provide more Native language classes. It lists “tribal partners” as one of the parties responsible for helping to meet that goal of increased biliteracy, but it doesn’t factor in how districts and schools could collaborate with tribal nations to evaluate existing language programs and design new ones. The draft also doesn’t list specific instructional materials needed for language classes, Sims said, adding that teachers are often left to create such materials on their own.
Christine Sims talks about her analysis of what the Yazzie/Martinez draft action plan says about Native languages. “My initial reaction was disappointment, because it just seemed to be a listing of ideas that had no link to one another,” Sims said. (Bella Davis/New Mexico In Depth)
And aside from one mention of Jicarilla Apache students, the draft does not name the eight Native languages spoken by the 23 federally recognized tribes in New Mexico, nor does it mention tribes by name.
That’s a problem, Sims said, because identifying those languages is the first step in assessing the programs schools offer and what’s needed.
During a presentation focused on well-being and behavioral supports, Chenoa Bah Stilwell-Jensen (Diné), a UNM instructor focused on health education, said a man in Farmington she spoke with was troubled that he and his wife were not contacted about the individualized education program for the grandson they’re raising, who has autism.
Some Taos families have similar concerns, said Glenabah Martinez (Taos Pueblo/Diné), director of the Institute for American Indian Education at UNM. She questions what the state plans to do to make sure special education is culturally relevant.
The draft doesn’t meet nine key components the Yazzie legal team outlined earlier this year, Martinez said. Those components — including developing robust accountability mechanisms — “push the boundaries of what we should do in terms of curriculum, instruction, assessment, policy,” Martinez said.
“We’re this many years in, and we’re still fighting for our children,” plaintiff Wilhelmina Yazzie (Diné) said. “Coming to you as a mother, it’s heartbreaking to see.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/photo1-1024x683.png,,,2025-10-16 14:03:19.432967

Andy Barr. The three spoke at the annual Fancy Farm Picnic on Saturday, Aug 2, 2025. (Kentucky Lantern photo by Austin Anthony)FRANKFORT — U.S. Rep. Andy Barr continues to hold a big fundraising lead in the hotly-contested primary battle among three top Republicans hoping to succeed longtime U.S. Sen. Mitch McConnell.
Andy Barr for Senate reports having nearly $6.7 million on hand at the beginning of the month, compared to $630,000 on hand for former Kentucky Attorney General Daniel Cameron’s campaign fund, according to recent filings with the Federal Election Commission.
Entrepreneur Nate Morris’ campaign reported having a bit over $1 million on hand, while three-fourths of the money taken in by Morris’ campaign came in a $3 million personal loan from Morris.
While Barr has raised more money from individuals than his two rivals, reports reflect his big money lead is largely the result of the experience and connections he’s gained during 16 years representing Kentucky’s 6th Congressional District.
The foundation of his war chest is nearly $3.7 million he transferred from his old Andy Barr for Congress committee early this year when he announced he would run for U.S. Senate in 2026. Also, FEC reports show that Barr’s Senate campaign has raised more than $1.2 million from traditional political action committees, most of them based in Washington. 
Morris has reported just $30,000 in contributions from political action committees (PAC)  and Cameron just $1,000.
Meanwhile, any analysis of the money affecting this race must also consider the millions of dollars that are already being spent (with much more to come) by super PACs to support or attack the candidates.
Money isn’t everything
Stephen Voss, associate professor of political science at the University of Kentucky, cautioned against exaggerating the importance of money in this campaign ahead of the May primary. “Nate Morris and Andy Barr have spent a lot already,” but Cameron still has a solid lead in the polls due to his high name recognition statewide due to his successful race for attorney general in 2019 and his unsuccessful campaign for governor in 2023,” Voss said.
Stephen Voss
Cameron’s high name recognition, combined with a sufficient amount of money he will raise, makes him a viable candidate, Voss said. And Voss said Barr is viable because he has a brimming war chest to spread his name and message to Republican voters outside his congressional district.
Morris is more reliant on what all three candidates are desperately seeking, an endorsement from Republican President Donald Trump, Voss said.
“More important than all of the money is what Donald Trump decides,” Voss said.
Barr campaign spokesman Alex Bellizzi released a statement Monday that said in part, “Andy Barr is the only candidate to have won tough races and helped President Trump implement the America First agenda. Now Andy Barr is also the only candidate with the resources, grassroots support and momentum to put this Senate race away for Republicans.”
The Cameron campaign released a statement that read in part, “The real question is — do these other guys have enough to catch Daniel. He’s up 20 points in poll after poll … Voters matter most — and voters LOVE Daniel Cameron.”
Kentucky Lantern was unable to contact the Morris campaign.
Here’s a look at what reports filed this week with the FEC show:
Andy Barr for Senate Inc.
Barr started the recent quarter on July 1 with $6.1 million on hand. During the quarter he raised just over $1.8 million; of that $1.2 million came from individuals, $127,000 from traditional PACs, and about $450,000 in transfers from people and PACs who previously gave to a different Barr political committee.
Barr reported spending more than $1.2 million during the quarter. And on Oct. 1 his campaign reported having $6,686,700 on hand.
Cameron for Senate Inc.
Cameron began the quarter with about $532,000. During the quarter he raised $411,200 from individuals. His campaign spent more than $313,000 during the quarter. The campaign reported having $629,700 on hand at the start of this month.
Morris for Senate
Morris officially launched his campaign around July 1 and the report it filed this week is the first it has filed with the FEC. It shows Morris got nearly $1 million in contributions ($30,000 from PACs and the rest from people) during the quarter. Also, Morris loaned his campaign fund $3,027,000. As of Oct. 1, the report shows the Morris campaign has $1,070,400 on hand, but a debt of $3,027,000 owed to Morris.
Democrats
 

	As for the Democrats running in next May’s primary for U.S. Senate, Joel Willett, an Army veteran and former CIA officer, has the fundraising lead. Willett, who opened his campaign in September, reported raising $119,800, and he loaned his campaign $200,000. As of Oct. 1 his campaign reported having $315,200 on hand.
State Sen. Pamela Stevenson, of Louisville, who launched her campaign early this year, reported raising $41,600 and spending $65,400 during the recent quarter. Because she had cash on hand at the beginning of the quarter she was able to report a campaign balance of $24,900 as of Oct. 1.
Logan Forsythe, a lawyer and former Secret Service agent who started his campaign in September, reported raising $39,800 and spending $1,400, leaving a balance of $38,400 at the beginning of this month.
Amy McGrath, the former Navy pilot who has lost prior campaigns for the U.S. House and Senate, did not open her current campaign for the Senate until earlier this month and will not have to report any campaign finances until January.

Those taken by Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, included the parents of children who were in school at the time of the raid, Hamden Mayor Lauren Garrett said.
“Their children are in school,” Garrett said at an afternoon press conference. “We don’t know which community. We don’t know how to contact that school. We are still trying to find out how to get in touch with this family so that their kids don’t go to an empty house when they get off of school.”
ICE did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the raid.
“The actions from the administration and ICE are deplorable, they are disgusting, they are not what we represent in Hamden,” Garrett said. “We are here today to stand up for the people of Hamden, for the families that are living in fear because of an inhumane presidency.”
A witness at the press conference, who gave only the first name Rachel, said she saw masked agents in unmarked vehicles making arrests at the car wash.
Rachel said she asked one detained man on the ground if he was okay, at which point an agent threatened her with arrest.
“I told him that he did not have the right to speak to me that way and that I was an American citizen,” Rachel said.
U.S. Rep. Rosa DeLauro, who represents the area in Congress, said in a statement that she was working to confirm the “safety and status” of those taken.
“The aggressive tactics used by ICE and endorsed by President Trump have escalated tensions with communities here and across the country, exacerbating fear,” DeLauro said. “They are not making Americans any safer.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/AP25161836500390-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-16 14:03:19.432967

(Getty Images)Five in six Indiana parents who want an after-school program for their child can’t find one — largely because of cost, transportation and a lack of available options — according to new survey data from the Afterschool Alliance.
The “America After 3PM” household survey, released Wednesday, found that just 83,820 Hoosier children are enrolled in an after-school program even though parents of nearly half a million kids would like to be.
After-school programs range from academic tutoring and STEM clubs to sports, arts and mentoring activities that give students a “safe, structured” place to spend time after the school day ends.
“Right now, 411,972 Hoosier children whose families want them in afterschool programs don’t have access,” said Lakshmi Hasanadka, CEO of the Indiana Afterschool Network. “Afterschool programs keep kids safe, help them learn, and support working families. We’ll continue working with partners statewide to remove barriers until every student who needs an afterschool program can be in one.”
Story continues below.
IN-AA3PM-2025-Fact-Sheet
 
Nearly all Indiana parents whose children are enrolled in after-school programs rate them highly, with 91% calling their programs excellent or very good, according to the survey. But 53% of parents whose children aren’t enrolled said cost was a barrier, and nearly half cited transportation or inconvenient locations.
On average, Indiana children spend 5.8 hours per week in after-school programs, which cost families about $76.90 per week, according to the Afterschool Alliance’s state fact sheet.
The survey, conducted by Edge Research, included responses from 675 Indiana parents and is the first of its kind since the COVID-19 pandemic, according to the Afterschool Alliance. 
“Parents recognize that programs in Indiana are doing outstanding work,” said Jodi Grant, the nonprofit’s executive director, in a statement. “Every child deserves access to a quality afterschool program but sadly, this study shows we’re far from reaching that goal. We need greater support from federal, state, and local governments, businesses, and philanthropy to change that.”
The Trump administration withheld more than $1 billion in federal funding for after-school programming earlier this summer, leaving states and programs scrambling to fill in the gaps. Grants have since been released, but future after-school dollars remain in question, Grant said.
Indiana-specific data published by the alliance shows 84% of Hoosier parents said after-school programs give them peace of mind, and 83% said such programs help them keep their jobs or work more hours.
Indiana parents also overwhelmingly support more public funding, with 89% in favor, according to the Afterschool Alliance.
The survey also found that after-school participation gaps persist across income levels. Families with lower and middle incomes were significantly more likely to say they lack access to programs, mirroring national trends.

The Coastal Restoration and Protection Authority spearheads restoration projects to build land, storm resilience and habitat along Louisiana’s sinking coast. (Elise Plunk/Louisiana Illuminator)THIBODAUX – Members of the Coastal Protection and Restoration Authority want to know why their chairman decided to cancel another land-building sediment diversion project without first running the idea by them.    
At Wednesday’s CPRA meeting, chairman Gordy Dove defended his decision to cancel the Mid-Breton Sediment Diversion project without first consulting the board. The project would have channeled fresh water and sediment from the Mississippi River in upper Plaquemines parish to the dying coastal marshes of Breton Sound.   
Dove, an appointee of Gov. Jeff Landry, doubled down on the estimated $1.8 billion cost of the Mid-Breton project as the reason for pulling its permits, saying he wouldn’t bring anything not “fiscally responsible” before the board. The governor has supported the move away from major sediment diversion undertakings, including the end of the far larger $3 billion Mid-Barataria project despite $560 million having already been spent on it.   
“No use to keep bleeding on something you’re not gonna build, you don’t have the money to build,” said Dove. “At some point, you’ve got to have an adding machine.”
CPRA member Jerome “Zee” Zeringue, a Republican state lawmaker from Houma, complained there was no public discussion with the board before Dove ended the project. He also questioned whether reasons other than cost were behind its cancelation. 
Dwayne Bourgeois, who represents the Terrebonne Basin on the CPRA board, joined Zeringue in asking whether other portions of Louisiana’s Coastal Master Plan should be reevaluated based on Mid-Breton’s cancelation. The long-term, $50 billion blueprint to protect and rebuild the state’s fragile coastline has been in motion since 2007. 
“In terms of the master plan, these were two of the major ones,” Zeringue said, speaking on the Mid-Breton and Mid-Barataria sediment diversion projects.  “How are we going to address the interaction with the other projects?
Bourgeois asked CPRA executive director Michael Hare to see if the latest diversion project cancelation would impact any other projects.
Charles Sutcliffe, resilience adviser with the National Wildlife Federation, said the Mid-Breton project’s cancellation without consulting the board and a lack of communication around funding updates is concerning for coastal restoration efforts as well as maintaining public trust. 
“This is a public body doing the work of the public. It’s supposed to happen in plain view,” Sutcliffe said. “I’m worried about their commitment to transparency and commitment to following the master plan.”
The canceled sediment diversions were each expected to divert around 75,000 cubic feet per second of Mississippi River water into Breton Sound and Barataria Bay to rebuild degrading wetland habitat. Mid-Breton had not yet entered the construction phase, while work had already begun on Mid-Barataria when the project was canceled. 
Initial price estimates for the Mid-Breton Sediment Diversion rose from around $800 million dollars to $1.8 billion, Dove said at the CPRA meeting without offering details on the reason for the increase. He did not respond to attempts to reach him after the meeting.
Funding for Mid-Breton, in part, was expected to come from the 2010 BP Deepwater Horizon oil spill settlement. The National Fish and Wildlife Foundation also pledged $90 million in 2016 for the project’s engineering and design. 
Dove implied full funding would be needed for Louisiana to move forward with major coastal restoration projects. Zeringue countered the idea, saying, “We go forward on projects we don’t have all the money for in other cases.”

Waste is a pressing environmental issue in the state right now, evidenced by the upwards of 40 people that joined the tours. 
The day started at Municipal WasteHub in Hampden, a recycling facility that is in the process of installing an anaerobic digester to process organic waste, such as animal manure, food waste and sewage sludge. The next stop was Eagle Point Energy Center in Orrington, which is a waste-to-energy facility that can use solid waste to generate up to 25 megawatts of electricity. Since it came under new ownership last year, Eagle Point is still in the process of bringing operations back to full capacity.

With sweeping views of surrounding Penobscot County and even Mount Katahdin to the north, the tour climbed to the very top of the state-owned Juniper Ridge Landfill in Old Town for its final stop. A steady stream of trucks came into Cell 16, a plot of land where trash is actively being landfilled, while excavators and bulldozers prepared adjacent land to be the next active cell. 
Just over half of Maine’s landfill waste ends up in Juniper Ridge, which is expected to reach capacity in 2028. The state has signaled its support for expanding the facility despite objections from environmental advocates, the local community and the Penobscot Nation.
Rep. Dan Ankeles (D-Brunswick), a committee member, said the tours helped paint a better picture of waste processes in the state. He pointed out that all three facilities have plans to expand their capacity, but said the information he learned Wednesday showed that Maine’s trash challenges are about more than just filling up a landfill. 
“It’s not just about landfill capacity,” Ankeles said. “There’s a lot going on at once and this is a jigsaw puzzle with a lot of pieces and some of the pieces are changing shape.”
In particular, Ankeles, who sponsored a suite of legislation earlier this year in response to a spill of toxic forever chemicals in his community, was left thinking about the downstream effects of the water that goes from these waste facilities into wastewater treatment plants.
At Juniper Ridge, employees explained how the leachate, or the water that seeps through the waste and can pick up contaminants along the way, is transported to wastewater treatment plants that ultimately discharge it back into waterways.

Sewage sludge, which is known to be contaminated with per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances, otherwise known as PFAS, is mixed with the trash at Juniper Ridge — a process that Wednesday’s tour group was able to see up close when a bulldozer mixed a full dump-truck load of sludge into truckloads of trash. 
In addition to the challenges surrounding solid waste capacity, Ankeles said Maine’s current waste processes leave the state “in freefall when it comes to letting PFAS go into our water bodies.” 
PFAS have been tied to myriad health concerns, including elevated incidences of certain cancers and other illnesses.
Environmental groups, local residents and the Penobscot Nation, whose reservation sits downstream from the landfill, have raised concerns about insufficient treatment of leachate as the state considers allowing the landfill to expand operations to the north. The Maine Department of Environmental Protection has required the landfill operator, Casella, to install an  approved system for treating landfill leachate for PFAS before it could expand operations. 
Without action, Old Town residents worry town will be ‘sacrifice zone’ to Juniper Ridge

The tour included a look at where Casella plans to install that system. 
At the close of the tour, Ankeles said he was thinking about what his committee could do to address these challenges. While bills for the upcoming legislative session in January aren’t finalized yet, Tepler put in a request that seeks to install a sludge dryer at Juniper Ridge, which would decrease sludge volume and weight.
During the tour, a Casella employee said reducing wet waste could help decrease the need for additional bulky waste to be brought in to stabilize the trash mixture. However, there were questions raised about whether sludge could rehydrate.
That issue became a flashpoint last session due to a proposal — that was eventually signed into law — to allow even more out-of-state waste to be brought to Maine. 
During the debate on the bill, Tepler said she’s “not convinced the operator of the landfill is an honest broker,” but warned that without the ability to bring in more bulky waste to stabilize the sludge it could mean “serious problems at the landfill.”

The Indianola private university announced this week it has joined the consortium, a NASA-affiliated organization committed to supporting education, research and outreach in STEM and other areas aligned with NASA interests.
“This is incredibly exciting news,” said Aswati Subramanian, Simpson associate professor of biology, in a news release. “Simpson students and faculty across disciplines now have access to funding opportunities for research projects, as well as resources to develop curricula that support the development of Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) skills, with a focus on improving student outcomes.”

Consortium members, both students and faculty, have the chance to apply for different grants, scholarships and fellowships through the consortium, as well as internships at NASA centers and more. Affiliates of the consortium include Iowa State University, the University of Iowa, the University of Northern Iowa, Drake University, Des Moines Area Community College, Loras College and Morningside University.
Iowa Space Grant Consortium Director Sara Nelson visited the Simpson campus before the college was made a partner, the release stated, where Subramanian showed her lab areas and spoke about her work on space biology and a project for which she’s mentoring two students. Subramanian said in the release other faculty members and students are already interested in pursuing funds for their own research.
Brennan Voss and Brian Rollison, both set to graduate in 2027, are working with Subramanian and researching how “simulated micro gravity and hyper gravity” impact single-cell organisms. Voss said in the release he never expected to be able to conduct this kind of work at Simpson and he has “enjoyed the problem-solving that comes with stepping outside my comfort zone to explore new areas of science.”
“I had very little research experience before this, so this project is providing great insight,” Rollison said in the release. “Getting accepted into the Iowa NASA Space Grants Consortium is awesome because it not only opens the door for Brennan and me, but also for many students in the future.”

(Photo by Robin Opsahl/Iowa Capital Dispatch)Des Moines School Board President Jackie Norris ended her campaign for U.S. Senate Thursday, saying she plans to focus on efforts to investigate and bring accountability to Des Moines Public Schools following the immigration arrest of former Superintendent Ian Roberts.
Norris had entered the race in August as a Democratic candidate, focusing her campaign on supporting public education and aid programs cut by recent GOP-backed laws like Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program or SNAP. In a Democratic primary field that had some candidates getting more national or state attention, such as state Sen. Zach Wahls, D-Coralville, and Rep. Josh Turek, D-Council Bluffs, as well as former Knoxville Chamber of Commerce Director Nathan Sage, Norris’ campaign had a lower profile than some of her competitors.
But in the two months since her announcement, the Des Moines School Board has become a focal point in state and national politics. In late September, Roberts, who served as DMPS superintendent since 2023, was arrested and detained by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Federal officials have since confirmed Roberts, a citizen of Guyana, was given an order of removal by an immigration judge in May 2024.

Multiple reports had also found Roberts had falsified parts of his education credentials and resume during the DMPS hiring process. The background check process conducted during this process also did not reveal some of Roberts’ previous criminal charges or immigration status — issues which led to the school board moving to sue the search firm it used in hiring Roberts,  JG Consulting.
Norris said in a statement Thursday the Roberts situation has “demanded my full attention as Board Chair and, overnight, put the School Board, our community, and me personally in the crosshairs of vicious and coordinated attacks, …” and taken away her time and capacity to advocate for Iowans as a U.S. Senate candidate in the way she aimed to achieve.
“As Chair of the School Board, we stepped up and are bringing accountability — leading with grace, transparency, and resolve,” Norris said in a statement. “To that end, it’s clear I need to focus on the work at hand: leading the board through this transition, working to support the passage of the Reimagining Education bond, and fully participating in ongoing investigations to get the answers our community deserves.”
Republicans have attacked Norris for approving Roberts as superintendent, and for her fundraising efforts as the situation unfolded.
“As chair of the Des Moines School Board, Iowa Democrat Senate candidate Jackie Norris hired an illegal alien with a rap sheet to be her Superintendent and work with children,” National Republican Senatorial Committee Regional Press Secretary Samantha Cantrell said in a September statement. “Jackie Norris has put every single Des Moines student and family in danger. Democrats will stop at nothing to protect criminal illegal aliens.”
U.S. Rep. Ashley Hinson is the frontrunner to become the Republican nominee for Iowa’s U.S. Senate seat in 2026. She entered the race after U.S. Sen. Joni Ernst announced she would not run for reelection.
In addition to responding to the Roberts situation, Norris said she is advocating for the $265 million general obligation bond that will go before voters in the school district in the Nov. 4 election. The bond would cover the construction costs of the “Reimagining Education, Reinvigorating Schools” initiative, a five-year plan aiming at expanding all-day, 4-year-old preschool, creating more hands-on and technical programs for students and improving academic outcomes. The money approved through the bond would be paid back over 20 years through property taxes.
The school board and DMPS leaders announced Tuesday the creation of an independent, third-party oversight committee for the bond project, which would provide financial oversight and review of the initiative if the language is approved by voters.
Norris thanked Iowans who supported her Senate campaign in her announcement.
“I will keep fighting for a better politics,” Norris said. “I believe people will trust government again when politicians put people over a party label and get things done. I leave this race with my head high, and I’ll continue serving my community and doing everything I can to help Democrats win this seat.”

TOPEKA — El presidente y el vicepresidente de los Kansas Young Republicans (Jóvenes Republicanos de Kansas), participaron en chats encriptados con sus compañeros políticos que estaban plagados de retórica violenta, racista y antisemita, y se mezclaron con referencias a la supremacía blanca y la supresión de los archivos de Jeffrey Epstein.
El martes, el presidente del Partido Republicano de Kansas dijo que el artículo de Politico que reveló el comentario provocó la desactivación inmediata de la organización Kansas Young Republicans.
Politico, una empresa de noticias digitales especializada en la cobertura de la política estadounidense, informó que el presidente de los Kansas Young Republicans, Alex Dwyer, y el vicepresidente William Hendrix participaron en el chat grupal en Telegram.
En 2900 páginas de texto del chat, Hendrix elogió a los Missouri Young Republicans porque a los líderes de ese estado no les gustaba la comunidad LGBTQ+. Usó repetidamente insultos raciales para referirse a las personas negras, incluyendo palabras como “n-ga” y “n-guh”. En una conversación de julio en el hilo sobre afroamericanos, decía: “Mi colega está en un restaurante de pollo pidiendo su comida. ¿Le gustaría un poco de sandía y Kool-Aid para acompañar eso?”.
Él fue despedido de un trabajo de comunicaciones en la oficina del Fiscal General Kris Kobach mientras Politico preparaba su informe sobre el papel de Hendrix en el chat.
“Los comentarios en el chat son inexcusables”, dijo Kobach. “En cuanto la oficina se enteró de esos mensajes, despidieron a Will Hendrix”.
En los hilos de chat, Dwyer y otros profundizaron en debates sobre cómo los agentes republicanos podrían manchar la imagen de un candidato político al vincularlo con supremacistas blancos. La idea fue descartada, según Politico, porque el plan podría ser contraproducente en un lugar como Kansas, donde “los jóvenes republicanos podrían sentirse atraídos por ese oponente”. Posteriormente, una persona en el chat pidió a otros que adivinaran el número de habitación de un hotel.
Dwyer respondió: “1488”. Ese número es una forma abreviada entre los supremacistas blancos para referirse a sus creencias. Se refiere a las 14 palabras del lema: “Debemos asegurar la existencia de nuestro pueblo y un futuro para los niños blancos”. El “88” significa “Heil Hitler”, y la H marca la octava letra del alfabeto.
En otro momento, Dwyer abordó la controversia relacionada con la divulgación de archivos gubernamentales sobre Epstein, el delincuente sexual convicto. Republicanos y demócratas en el Congreso han solicitado la divulgación pública de archivos para exonerar o incriminar al presidente Donald Trump o a otras personalidades prominentes.
“Trump está demasiado ocupado quemando los archivos de Epstein”, escribió Dwyer en Telegram.
Dwyer no respondió a una solicitud de entrevista. Hendrix, quien se postuló sin éxito para el Concejo Municipal de Topeka en 2021, no pudo ser contactado para obtener comentarios.
Antes de que Politico revelara el comentario de los Jóvenes Republicanos, Dwyer y Hendrix fueron fotografiados en un evento de campaña con el presidente del Senado, Ty Masterson, republicano de Andover y candidato a gobernador en 2026. Una publicación en redes sociales de la foto, tomada durante el anuncio de la campaña de Masterson, los muestra a ambos con carteles que promocionan su campaña a la gobernación.

La campaña de Masterson emitió un comunicado después de que el presidente del Senado llegará a Washington, D.C., para reunirse el miércoles con funcionarios de la Casa Blanca. En dicho comunicado, Masterson culpó a sus oponentes políticos de “promocionar una foto, con intenciones engañosas, para desprestigiar”.
“Niego categóricamente cualquier vínculo con William Hendrix o Alex Dwyer, ya que ninguno de ellos forma parte, ni ha formado parte, del equipo ni ha sido voluntario en mi campaña para gobernador”, declaró Masterson. “Cualquiera que sugiera lo contrario miente o está mal informado”.
Además, dijo Masterson, él estaba guiado por una profunda fe cristiana y poseía antecedentes de condenar la retórica odiosa y violenta.
“Personalmente, me repugnan los comentarios atribuidos a individuos en el artículo, ya que tal comportamiento es totalmente contrario al mensaje de Cristo de que la vida es valiosa y todos somos iguales ante los ojos de Dios, y mi compromiso inquebrantable con estos valores no ha cambiado”, dice la declaración.
Un grupo de republicanos de Kansas y un candidato demócrata a gobernador denunciaron el contenido de este conjunto de mensajes de Telegram registrados bajo “RESTOREYR WAR ROOM” o Restaurar a los Jóvenes Republicanos.
Las comunicaciones registradas por Politico abarcaron un período entre enero y agosto, e involucran a líderes republicanos estatales de Kansas, Vermont, Arizona y Nueva York. Entre los miles de comentarios se incluía esta idea: «Si alguna vez se filtra este chat, nos van a matar».
“Las opiniones expresadas en esta charla no representan a los habitantes de Kansas. Punto”, dijo el exgobernador de Kansas Jeff Colyer, quien busca la nominación republicana a la gobernación. “Nuestro estado se fundó sobre la creencia de que todos somos creados iguales ante Dios, y cualquiera que se burle de esos principios deshonra el espíritu mismo de Kansas”.
Vicki Schmidt, comisionada de seguros del estado y candidata republicana a gobernadora, dijo que Dwyer y Hendrix deberían renunciar formalmente a sus cargos en los Jóvenes Republicanos porque “sus acciones son repugnantes y vergonzosas y manchan la reputación de Kansas a nivel nacional”.

Aseguró que el lenguaje extremista fue fomentado desde arriba por políticos que buscan dividir a los votantes en lugar de unirlos.
“Seamos claros: No son niños que hacen bromas”, dijo Holscher. “Son adultos de entre veinte y treinta y tantos años con roles de liderazgo en el Partido Republicano. El presidente de los Kansas Young Republicans, que participó en estos mensajes, tiene casi 30 años. Desafortunadamente, este tipo de retórica no es un caso aislado.

An outbreak of shootings occurred last weekend within a 24-hour period across the state, including at two historically Black universities, Alcorn State in Lorman and Jackson State at Mississippi Veterans Memorial Stadium. 
On Saturday night, a 29-year-old Vicksburg woman died and two others were wounded after a shooting near a building at Alcorn State’s campus. The university said Fisher was not a student. 
On the same night, a child was shot in the abdomen near the tailgating area outside Jackson State’s stadium and was taken to the hospital. One suspect was arrested in connection to the Alcorn State shooting, Mississippi Bureau of Investigation on Oct. 15. 
As a result, Mississippi Valley State University, another HBCU, announced it is beefing up its campus public safety presence this weekend by partnering with local, state and county law enforcement authorities. 
This includes a “series of proactive safety protocols,” like curfews for tailgating, vehicle inspections at all campus entry points and campus access restrictions with Valley State students being required to show valid ID. The university says it will step up enforcement of its ban on firearms. 
“The safety and well-being of our students, alumni, and guests remain our highest priority. We look forward to a weekend filled with school spirit, fellowship, and celebration — made even stronger by our shared commitment to keeping The Valley Safe,” a statement from the university said. “MVSU encourages all attendees to remain vigilant, respect the established guidelines, and contribute to a positive and secure Homecoming experience.”

Delta State, another public university in the area, said it will be enforcing a clear-bag policy at all events. 
The university said it has also moved its Homecoming Green Glow, a Friday student event, from outside to Kent Wyatt Hall Atrium inside to ensure safety. Additionally, tailgating events for Friday evening have been canceled. Kickoff is at 1 p.m. Saturday, and other tailgating events will end one hour after the end of the game. 
Homecoming is this Saturday at the University of Southern Mississippi and Oct. 25 at Mississippi State University. Officials at those schools also said they are taking precautions as they anticipate thousands of students, alumni and others to participate in festivities. 
As a former MVSU police chief, state Rep. Robert L. Sanders said he is saddened to hear about the shootings. The Democratic lawmaker from Cleveland said he anticipates,  as the next legislative session approaches, the House Universities and Colleges Committee will look at ways to enhance campus safety for all higher education institutions across the state. 
“We had a bad situation happen this past weekend, but this now gives us something to discuss and work toward,” said Sanders, a 1984 MVSU alum who serves on that committee. 
Senate Minority Leader Derrick Simmons, whose Delta district includes Leland, called the carnage in that city on Friday night, “senseless gun violence.” Six people were killed and multiple others wounded during a celebration downtown in what is the deadliest shooting in the country this year. 
Simmons, a Greenville Democrat, released a statement commending Valley State for its proactive measures and calling for a statewide commitment to safety as well as funding to achieve these efforts. 
“Students, alumni, families, faculty and staff look forward to homecoming,” Simmons, a Valley State alum, told Mississippi Today this week. “We don’t want the risk of violence to affect that spirit because we want to reconnect and honor our traditions of our respective schools.” 
While the shooting in Leland was at a block party, not tailgating, the Mississippi High School Activities Association is urging schools to stop on-campus tailgating in the wake of the shootings across the state, including Heidelberg and Sharkey County.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/02152225/3X0A0789.jpg,,,2025-10-16 12:04:40.336283

It’s called prison gerrymandering, and the study from the Prison Policy Initiative says that four state House districts in Florida illustrate how the decennial U.S. Census Bureau’s policy of counting prisoners where they are incarcerated instead of where they hail from distorts the process and gives some residents a louder voice in government.
The issue is not new to Florida counties with prison populations.
In 2015, the ACLU of Florida filed a lawsuit challenging district maps for county commission and school board elections in Jefferson County in North Florida, alleging the incarcerated population made up more than 42% of the voting age population in one district. A federal judge ruled in 2016 that the five county commission districts violated the constitutional principle of “one person, one vote.”
In the aftermath of that decision, six North Florida counties and two North Florida school districts avoided prison gerrymandering when drawing up their local districts after the 2020 U.S. Census, according to the institute. The report says that seven Florida counties and three school districts avoided prison-based gerrymandering after the 2010 Census.
At least 15 states have passed laws or adopted guidance modifying how incarcerated persons are counted and allocated during the redistricting process, according to a 2024 report from the National Conference of State Legislatures.
Florida House Democrats raised the issue during the 2021 legislative hearings regarding congressional and legislative redistricting in the state. The complaint didn’t move GOP lawmakers who were in charge of the process.
The four districts listed in the report are in mostly rural areas :
House District 7, which encompasses Gulf, Liberty, Franklin, Wakulla, Taylor, Dixie, Lafayette, Suwannee, Hamilton, and parts of Leon and Jefferson counties. The report says 10% of the district’s population is made up of the incarcerated.
House District 10, which includes Columbia, Baker, Union, Bradford, and part of Alachua counties. The report says 8% of the district’s population is made up of the incarcerated.
House District 5, which includes Walton, Holmes, Washington, Jackson, and Calhoun counties. The report says that 7% of the district consists of incarcerated individuals.
House District 52, which includes Sumter and parts of Hernando counties, where the report says that 5% of the district’s population is incarcerated. The largest prison facility in the district is Federal Corrections Complex Coleman, the largest federal prison complex in the nation, with inmates from all across the country.
The report says that only about 6% of the population at the Coleman Complex comes from Florida, “which means out of the 6,285 people held by the Bureau of Prisons at FCC Coleman, only about 371 people are likely Florida residents.” The report adds that most of those 371 people aren’t likely to be actual residents of House District 52.

Secretary of State Denny Hoskins announced Wednesday that roughly 100,000 signatures gathered so far for the referendum won’t count — and that gathering them before his office approved “constitutes a misdemeanor election offense.”
Later in the day, Attorney General Catherine Hanaway filed a lawsuit arguing that holding a referendum on the congressional map is unconstitutional and asking a federal judge to stop it. 
“Missouri politicians continue to try to confuse, intimidate and, frankly, silence us,” Richard Von Glahn of People Not Politicians, the committee behind the referendum campaign, told reporters Thursday. 
People Not Politicians is already in court challenging Hoskins’ decision to reject its initial referendum petitions because they were filed in September before the governor signed the redistricting bill.  If those petitions aren’t valid, neither are the 100,000 signatures already gathered for the referendum. 
Cole County Circuit Judge Daniel Green set the case for a trial on Nov. 4. 
“This office remains committed to transparency, accuracy and protecting Missouri voters’ trust in the democratic process,” Hoskins said Wednesday. 
At the heart of the debate is Missouri’s congressional map, which has eight districts with six currently represented by Republicans. 
Missouri lawmakers pass gerrymandered congressional map, initiative petition limits

Lawmakers returned to the Capitol last month to gerrymander one of the Democratic seats in a way that would adhere to President Donal Trump’s instructions to create a new GOP district before the 2026 midterms.
The target was the 5th District, based in Kansas City and represented by Democratic U.S. Rep. Emanuel Cleaver since 2005. It is carved up under the new map with portions attached to the 4th and 6th Districts. Heavily Republican areas stretching along the Missouri River to Boone County were added to the remaining Kansas City portions.
Hours after the map won legislative approval, People Not Politicians filed for a referendum to put it on the ballot. Under the Missouri Constitution, if the group gathers 106,000 signatures before Dec. 11, the map will not go into effect until after a statewide vote. 
The referendum poses a real threat to the new map. Of the 27 times a referendum has been placed on the Missouri ballot, voters have rejected actions by the General Assembly all but twice. That includes 1922, when voters rejected a new congressional map drawn by the legislature. 
A referendum was last deployed in Missouri seven years ago, when labor unions collected 300,000 signatures in 90 days to put a question on the statewide ballot repealing a GOP-backed right-to-work law.
A year later, the secretary of state’s office used procedural maneuvers to derail a referendum campaign that sought to overturn newly-passed restrictions on abortion. 
That 2019 referendum never got off the ground because of the secretary of state’s actions. But it sparked a 2022 Missouri Supreme Court ruling that determined the laws the secretary of state used to obstruct the citizen-initiated referendum process were unconstitutional.
“We’ve been here before,” said Chuck Hatfield, an attorney representing People Not Politicians. “The Secretary of State knows better.”
People Not Politicians has raised $2.6 million in six-figure donations since the campaign began last month. According to disclosure reports filed with the state ethics commission, more than $1.2 million of that has gone directly towards signature gathering. 
Most of the group’s money has come from out-of-state nonprofits who are not obligated to disclose their donors. Last week, Kansas City-based Health Forward Foundation donated $750,000. 
Hanaway pointed to People Not Politicians out-of-state donors in announcing her federal lawsuit seeking to block the referendum.  
“Missouri’s redistricting process cannot be dictated by out-of-state special interests,” Hanaway said. “We will not allow dark money groups to silence Missouri voices or hijack the work of the General Assembly.”
Hatfield called the actions of Hanaway and Hoskins “outrageous” and a “full on tantrum about the right of the people to overrule these congressional districts, which is a right the people are guaranteed in the constitution.”
In particular, he called the accusation that gathering signatures could ever be considered a crime “totally ridiculous.”
“This is nothing,” Hatfield said, “but an attempt to intimidate and deny people the right to petition their government.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/091025_rally3-1024x615.jpg,,,2025-10-16 12:04:40.336283

(Kansas Reflector screen capture from campaign video)TOPEKA — Former financial services executive Sandy Spidel Neumann announced Thursday her candidacy for the Democratic Party’s nomination to the U.S. Senate seat held by Republican Roger Marshall.
Spidel Neumann said she opposed Marshall-endorsed tariffs that are harmful to farmers and Medicaid cuts that threaten rural hospitals. She said she was motivated to seek office in the wake of Marshall’s decision to walk out on a combative, contentious crowd during a March town hall he was hosting in Oakley.
“When I saw Marshall walk out, I knew I had to step up,” she said. “I’m running for Senate because leaders can’t be afraid of the tough questions. They should stand with, not run from, the people they serve.”
Marshall, who was elected to the Senate in 2020 and replaced retiring GOP U.S. Sen. Pat Roberts, previously served four years in the U.S. House. A frequent supporter of President Donald Trump, Marshall said in an interview he would seek reelection in 2026.
“When Kansans pressed him on tariffs that crushed our farmers and health care cuts that closed our hospitals, he couldn’t defend himself,” Spidel Neumann said. “So, he took his toys and went home. That’s not leadership. Kansans deserve a senator who shows up, listens and fights for us.”
Spidel Neumann joined three other Democrats with campaigns to seek the Democratic Party’s nomination in the August primary election. The others are Christy Davis of Cottonwood Falls, attorney Anne Parelkar of Overland Park and Michael Soetaert of Wellington.
Spidel Neumann was born near Topeka and grew up in Overland Park. She earned an economics degree at the University of Chicago and a master’s in business at Northwestern University.
She had a 40-year career in business that culminated with 22 years as an executive with Ameriprise Financial Services. She retired in May and has not held public office.
“In business, I’ve seen what happens when leaders fall short. Like when Roger sells out Kansas time and again, and then jets off to his Florida mansion,” Spidel Neumann said. “You don’t need a degree in economics to recognize what he touts as accomplishments — chaotic tariffs, health care cuts and tax breaks for himself and his billionaire buddies. They all hurt the Kansans he left behind.”
She accused Marshall of declining to “stand up to special interests” as Kansas families were forced to choose between gas and groceries while hospitals disappeared, farmers struggled economically and seniors skipped medication to make ends meet.
“Washington won’t fix itself. It’s time for someone who knows how to get things done,” she said. “I’ve always rooted for the red and the blue, but most of all, I root for Kansas.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Sandy-Spidel-Neumann-1024x573.png,,,2025-10-16 12:04:40.336283

Tom Hansen and his wife, Linda, at a Nebraska volleyball match. (Courtesy of Marshall Hansen)LINCOLN — Standing over 6 feet tall, with a love of good-looking cowboy hats and boots, Tom Hansen stood out when he arrived at the Nebraska Legislature in 2007.
But behind the well-dressed rancher was a real cowboy, the third-generation to operate a North Platte-area ranch, the Hansen 77 Ranch, that utilized the oldest brand in the state still registered to the same family.
Hansen’s oldest son, Marshall, said his father would want to be remembered as a regular cowboy, who carried on at the family’s 147-year-old ranch, now run by his youngest son, Eric, and not just his work in the Legislature or helping with the Nebraska Cattlemen and North Platte’s Nebraskaland Days celebration.
“He was part of a legacy of a family ranch in Nebraska,” Marshall Hansen said. “I think it made him very proud that he carried that on and that he could pass it on to my brother.”
Hansen died Saturday after a long battle with multiple health issues. He was 78.
A Republican, he served as a state senator from 2007-15, earning a reputation of being able to work with Democrats and to keep things light amid the sometimes pressure-cooker atmosphere at the Capitol. One of his best friends at the Unicameral was a Democrat, State Sen. Bill Avery of Lincoln, Hansen’s oldest son said.
“He was good at consensus building,” said Pete McClymont, a retired executive vice president of the Cattlemen who lobbied state senators.
“I’ve never heard anyone say a bad word about Tom Hansen. That says a lot about his character,” McClymont added.
Hansen’s service in the Legislature and with the Cattlemen were as much a family tradition as running the ranch.
His grandfather, Henry, served in the Nebraska House of Representatives from 1925 to 1933, and from 1935 to 1937 — the year the state switched to its unique Unicameral Legislature.
Tom Hansen served as the president of the Nebraska Cattlemen, the state’s premiere organization for beef producers, after both his grandfather and father, Wes, had served as president of one of the Cattlemen’s forerunners, the Nebraska Stockgrowers.
In a couple of years, Eric Hansen — now a vice president of the Cattlemen — will ascend to the presidency, becoming the fourth member of his family to head the organization’s board.
The Cattlemen, in a statement issued this week, called Tom Hansen “a legend in the beef cattle industry” who “exemplified what it meant to be a servant leader.”
A graduate of the University of Nebraska-Lincoln’s agriculture school, Hansen married his wife, Linda, in 1967 and returned to the ranch to raise red Angus.
Prior to being elected to the Legislature, he was active on the boards of the Twin Platte Natural Resources District, Nebraskaland Days, the Mid-Nebraska Community Foundation Board and Messiah Lutheran Church.
The Hansen Ranch hosted the Cattle Baron’s Ball in 1995 to raise money for cancer research. Ten years later, Hansen was inducted into the Nebraska Cattlemen’s Hall of Fame.
Western attire is urged for funeral services scheduled at 11 a.m., Saturday, at First Evangelical Lutheran Church in North Platte. Visitation is from noon to 6 p.m. Friday at Adams & Swanson Funeral Home in North Platte, with the family receiving friends from 4-6 p.m.

Bill Lee said Tuesday that the “Memphis Safe Task Force” is focused on violent crime, and that the coalition of 31 agencies has already arrested “850 violent criminals and known gang members.”
But a look at the task force’s operations on Monday shows that most of the people arrested were not charged with a violent crime, and immigrants are being arrested on administrative — not criminal — warrants, according to a document obtained by MLK50: Justice Through Journalism.
The document, provided by the task force to local public officials, details arrests made on one full day of task force operations, Monday, Oct. 13. That day, 1,561 personnel from 31 agencies were working in Memphis.

The document states that 51 arrests were made on Monday. It does not list traffic stops where there was no arrest. It does not specify which agency made each arrest or whether the data is separated from the regular operations of the Memphis Police Department. One “missing child” was also found that day, according to the document. She was found living with her father in California.
The document also indicates that task force members responded to a shooting that left one man dead and another injured. The person was treated for a gunshot wound and taken into custody pending an investigation.
Concern growing among immigrants
Lee dismissed concerns about how the task force is impacting immigrant communities at the press conference on Tuesday.
“If you’re here illegally and you commit a crime, then obviously ICE is going to be involved in that. But the effort, the goal, the purpose, is to go after crime in the city,” he said. “If they’re not a criminal element, then they shouldn’t be afraid.”
Yet, none of the seven people — who came from Senegal, Guatemala and Mexico — that were arrested for being “unlawfully present in the United States” on Monday were described as having criminal charges. “Unlawful presence” is a civil offense, and not a crime.
Another man was described as an “illegal alien” and charged with theft of a motor vehicle, felony evading and possession of drug paraphernalia, but the document did not detail any immigration-related charges for him. Another part of the document said there were nine administrative arrests during that time period, but MLK50 only found seven noted in the anecdotes.

Tuesday, Shelby County Mayor Lee Harris held a news conference in which he described instances of possible racial profiling, saying those anecdotes “have made us uncomfortable.”
“Racial profiling is unconstitutional,” Harris said.
Carlos Ochoa, who spoke at Harris’ news conference on behalf of Vecindarios 901, said volunteers at the community hotline and in their network have spoken to residents reporting changes in immigrant neighborhoods. A few weeks ago, armed federal agents and state agents “swooped into” the park alongside the Marion Hale Community Center, Ochoa said. Normally a hub of activity, the bleachers and park are now empty, Ochoa said.
“We see parents afraid to leave their homes,” Ochoa said. “We see children missing school because safety feels uncertain. We see workers avoiding medical care because survival demands invisibility, families forced from our neighborhoods. We even see US citizens being arrested by ICE in my neighborhood.”
At Harris’ press conference, immigration attorney Colton Bane described how one of his clients was expecting his green card to arrive “any day,” but was pulled over on his way home from work. Now, he’s sitting in detention. Others have described having their driver’s licenses taken away by law enforcement and not returned, even when they are allowed to leave the traffic stop, Bane said.
“The only long-lasting effect I’m seeing from this task force are further fractured relationships between our immigrant community and the local law enforcement who will be here after this operation,” Bane said.
Thousands of citations, 320 warrants served
Of the 44 non-immigration arrests on Monday, only 13 were clearly for violent crimes, according to an MLK50 analysis of the data. Five people arrested were described as gang members, but the document did not explain how that was determined.
Thirty of the 44 people arrested had not been charged with violent offenses. Instead, their charges ranged from failure to appear in court for a misdemeanor to identity theft to trespassing and misdemeanor theft of property. Seven of those non-violent charges were drug-related. One arrest could not be clearly identified as a violent or nonviolent charge.
One arrest anecdote in the document described a 17-year-old in Frayser who was “observed standing in front of a business for several minutes.”
“When approached by law enforcement, subject fled on foot,” the document said. The youth was arrested and charged with disorderly conduct, criminal trespass, evading and obstructing.
Another anecdote told of a young man arrested for “possession of a controlled substance.” Officials recovered marijuana.
A woman was arrested on a warrant for misdemeanor theft of property: Property worth less than $1,000.
Five people were arrested on gun charges, three for possessing a firearm “during the commission of a dangerous felony,” seemingly referring to drug charges.
Tuesday, Memphis Mayor Paul Young, who stood alongside Lee at the governor’s press conference, said a significant amount of the work underway is the execution of warrants. When the operation began, the city had about 10,000 felony warrants, he said.
Out of the 854 arrests made by the task force as of Monday, 320 appeared to be for outstanding warrants, according to the document. The second highest category of arrests was “administrative,” 168, referring to arrests made by Immigration and Customs Enforcement for civil, not criminal, immigration violations.
As of Monday, the task force had also issued 4,160 traffic citations and 59 misdemeanor citations. Details of those interactions and citations were not immediately available.

Jay Collins participates in the extradition from California of Harjinder Singh, accused of causing an accident that killed three people in Florida. (Via Collins' X account)After an undocumented truck driver licensed in California and Washington killed three Floridians in a road accident, state Attorney General James Uthmeier is asking the U.S. Supreme Court to let him sue those states, seeking federal preemption of their “sanctuary” laws.
Uthmeier announced the effort Wednesday night on the Fox News’ “Hannity,” blaming California’s Democratic governor, Gavin Newsom, for enacting laws that Uthmeier believes harm American citizens.
The announcement came a month after Uthmeier subpoenaed the trucking firm employing Harjinder Singh, the Indian national who caused a fatal accident in St. Lucie County over the summer.
“It’s a shame, and that’s why we’re taking Gavin Newsom to the Supreme Court … to hold them accountable for the carnage that their sanctuary illegal immigration policies have caused to states like Florida,” Uthmeier said on the show.
“We can do everything right … but we still suffer when Gavin Newsom and liberals on the West Coast allow these illegals in. They encourage them — enable them — to get these drivers’ licenses, and then they cross the country and ultimately take lives.”
The suit comes amid a nationwide crack down on undocumented immigration, spearheaded by President Donald Trump and buttressed by Gov. Ron DeSantis in Florida through sweeping, state-level immigration laws. Trump signed a slew of executive orders on his first day in office, including a mandate for English proficiency among truck drivers.
Hours before Uthmeier filed his case, the U.S. Department of Transportation announced that the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration will withhold more than $40 million from California following an investigation that found the state failed to comply with the Department’s English language proficiency standards.
Jeremy Redfern, Uthmeier’s communications director, told the Florida Phoenix that DOT’s announcement was a coincidence that “just happened” on the same day.
The accident bore other national ramifications, including prompting Secretary of State Marco Rubio to temporarily freeze visas for foreign-born truck drivers.
What is Uthmeier asking the Supreme Court to do?
Wednesday night, Uthmeier asked the justices for permission to bypass the usual appeals process and file his lawsuit directly with the Supreme Court. In a 30-page complaint, he accused California and Washington of “open defiance” of federal immigration laws, citing their laws banning agencies from asking about immigration status and issuance of a commercial driver’s license to a man who failed an English proficiency test.
Uthmeier seeks:

A declaratory judgement federally preempting the states’ laws preventing agency inquiries into immigration status for commercial license applicants
A declaratory judgement deriding their “failure” to enforce immigration-status standards as a “public nuisance.”
A permanent ban against California and Washington issuing commercial licenses to noncitizens.
An order that California and Washington pay Florida’s legal fees.

The case stemmed from an Aug. 12 crash on a St. Lucie highway caused by Singh, who was illegally in the United States but licensed as commercial driver in both California and Washington. From India, Singh had failed an English proficiency test, but was still licensed to drive for the White Hawk Carriers Inc. trucking firm.
A video from a camera within his truck cab shows the 28-year-old making a U-turn across four lanes of traffic in an 18-wheeler, killing three Haitian immigrants in a vehicle that slammed into his rig. Florida troopers drew Singh’s blood in the aftermath of the crash, brought someone who could speak his language to question him, and then let him go due to a lack of probable cause.
Singh left for California, was arrested by U.S. marshals in the San Francisco Bay Area, and was extradited to the Sunshine State by Lt. Gov. Jay Collins.

By Jamie Kleman | Contributing Journalist Delaware Live | October 2025
Delaware educators are turning a new page this fall with the launch of the state’s Early Literacy Plan, a multi-year initiative designed to boost reading skills for the youngest learners and support teachers with evidence-based instruction. The plan, announced by the Delaware Department of Education (DDOE), aims to ensure every student in grades K-3 can read proficiently by the end of third grade – a milestone that research shows is critical for long-term academic success.
A Focus on the “Science of Reading”
The Early Literacy Plan centers on the science of reading, an approach grounded in decades of research on how children learn to decode, comprehend, and enjoy written language. Delaware joins a growing number of states using this framework to reshape early reading instruction and teacher preparation.
“Strong literacy skills open every door for a child – from math to science to lifelong learning,” said Secretary of Education Mark Holodick in the state’s announcement. “This plan ensures teachers have the tools, training, and time they need to make that happen.”
The initiative includes new professional development for teachers, updated reading curriculum aligned with the science of reading, and resources for families to reinforce learning at home.
Closing Gaps and Supporting Educators
While many Delaware schools already use evidence-based reading programs, the plan provides a consistent statewide structure and addresses disparities in access to high-quality materials. It also creates new pathways for reading specialists and literacy coaches to collaborate across districts.
According to state data, 43% of Delaware third-graders are reading at grade level. The Early Literacy Plan’s goal is to close that gap within five years by aligning teacher training, instructional materials, and assessments.
“Teachers have always known the power of early reading,” said Dover elementary teacher Angela Morris. “What’s exciting about this plan is that it gives us a shared language and consistent support system. We can finally focus less on testing and more on helping kids fall in love with reading.”
Families as Reading Partners
Parents and caregivers are also a key part of the plan’s success. The DDOE has launched a companion website with family toolkits that include storytime activities, phonics games, and strategies to build reading confidence at home. The site emphasizes that just 15 minutes of daily reading can significantly improve fluency and vocabulary by the end of elementary school.
Libraries and community centers across Delaware are expected to host literacy nights and family workshops beginning in early 2026.
Building a Culture of Reading
The Early Literacy Plan reflects Delaware’s broader effort to invest in student success from the earliest years – complementing initiatives like expanded pre-K access and high-impact tutoring.
“This is about giving every child, regardless of zip code, a strong start,” Holodick said. “If we get reading right, we get everything else right.”

(Photo by Rebecca Rivas/The Missouri Independent) The union representing 3,200 Boeing Defense workers on strike in the St. Louis area said it has filed an unfair labor practice complaint with the National Labor Relations Board against the company. 
The complaint follows an Oct. 8 letter sent to workers by Boeing Executive Vice President Steve Parker, where he urged employees to take the company’s final offer.
“No matter how long the strike lasts, the economics won’t change,” Parker wrote in his letter. “The bottom line is firm. Each of the offers we’ve put forward would give you a better deal than anything comparable we’ve seen in our region and industry…”
The International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers District 837 said in a press release Thursday that Parker’s statements “make clear the company’s refusal to bargain in good faith.” 
The union said the company’s repeated rejections of the union proposals “without making any counter offers addressing member concerns” is a violation of federal labor law to negotiate in good faith.
“This strike is about respect and fairness,” said Tom Boelling, IAM District 837 directing business representative, in a Thursday press release. “Our members are standing up for their families, their future, and for fair treatment at the bargaining table. Boeing’s delays are hurting its own production, putting critical defense contracts at risk, and showing that you can’t replace skilled union labor with untrained temps.”
Boeing Defense did not immediately respond to The Independent’s request for comment.
The strike began Aug. 4, just months after Boeing was awarded a government contract to build the Air Force’s next-generation fighter jet, the F-47.
The company landed the contract because of “the ingenuity and skill of IAM Union members who have dedicated their careers to building America’s fighter aircraft,” the press release states.
“These men and women have decades of skill, experience, and dedication,” said Sam Cicinelli, IAM Union Midwest territory general vice president. “Boeing’s CEO is paid tens of millions of dollars, while the workers who build our military jets are being told to settle for less than they deserve. That’s unacceptable — and people on both sides of the aisle in Congress are taking notice.”
Cicinelli said lawmakers from both parties have called on Boeing to negotiate in good faith, because this strike and the company’s refusal to bargain is hurting our national defense. 
Boeing and union representatives met with a federal mediator last month, in an effort to find a path to end the strike. 
But both issued statements that the negotiations failed. The union said Boeing refused to budge, and the company said union reps came to the table with “unrealistic” expectations. 
“As we have said multiple times, we are open to constructive feedback from the union within the overall economics of our offer, which is at the top of the market for Midwest manufacturing,” according to a statement Boeing issued Monday.
The union countered by saying the way to end the strike would be “the sensible pre-ratified offer that was approved by our membership. We are available when the company has an improved offer.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Boeing-strike-2-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-10-16 12:04:40.336283

(Photo by Peter Cade/Getty Images)Ohio lawmakers are wrestling over how to keep kids from seeing what they shouldn’t online.
Courts have already put on hold an age verification system written into the 2023 budget. A hastily written provision tucked into this year’s budget was meant to keep kids from visiting porn websites. But as drafted, several large players contend the restrictions don’t apply to them.
And in an Ohio Senate committee hearing this week, lawmakers heard from supporters of two more age verification proposals. One has the backing of the tech giants who run app stores. The other has the support of child safety advocates, as well as different tech giants whose apps appear in those app stores.
Meanwhile the fight is extending beyond Columbus. In the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, the ACLU of Ohio filed an amicus brief urging the court to reject an appeal aimed at resurrecting the 2023 age verification system. Also, the Digital Childhood Institute, which is backing one of the Ohio bills, has filed a complaint with the Federal Trade Commission against Google. The group alleges Google knows which app store users are kids, but “knowingly markets harmful apps as safe for minors.”
The legislation
Ohio Senators heard from supporters of Senate Bill 167 and Senate Bill 175 in a committee hearing this week, bills that look fairly similar overall. Apps and app stores share an “age signal” to verify a user is old enough to use an app. Both measures mandate the availability of parental controls and task the attorney general with enforcement. Both sides even offer similar arguments, insisting their approach represents “a shared responsibility” or a way to ensure “every player is doing their part.”
But the bills differ on one central question: who bears responsibility for keeping ineligible users out?
Senate Bill 167 puts the onus on app stores.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX“So, it’s really a simple ‘one place’ to do this, where the information already likely exists,” said Jennifer Hanley, Meta’s head of safety policy for North America.
When a person sets up an account with an app store they typically provide information about their age. Because the app store already has that user information, Hanley said, it’s the most logical place to restrict access based on age.
“Teens use up to 40 different apps a week,” she said. “So, without a centralized age verification system within the app store, parents would have to share personal information with each of these 40 different apps that teens might be using.”
Senate Bill 175, on the other hand, requires individual applications to build the moat. Matthew Bye, a managing director for Google, argued it’s the apps who should “provide parental controls and get a parent’s permission to provide access to any mature content.”
“It focuses protections where they’re needed the most, and it’s built on common sense,” he added.
Bye dismissed verifying a user’s age at the app store level as “invasive and unnecessary.”
“Imagine having to show your driver’s license just to download a weather app,” he said.
Both proposals got a pretty frosty welcome from lawmakers.
State Sen. Bill DeMora, D-Columbus, said both proposals amounted to censorship. What about a young woman who wants to track her periods? What about elderly Ohioans who just can’t figure out how to verify their age?
Sen. Bill Blessing, R-Colerain Twp., argued parents already have parental control tools, and he criticized both measures for relying on the attorney general to enforce the law. The first Senate bill, that would have app stores conduct age verification, has a narrow private cause of action; the other Senate bill explicitly has none. Blessing suggested giving a single elected official sole responsibility for policing some of the largest companies in the world might not end well.
“The problem with that is we create this regulatory capture, where all you have to do is control the AG’s office,” Blessing said. “Which means, hey, they don’t have to sue, and there really is no enforcement mechanism for this bill.”
The FTC complaint
While the Digital Childhood Institute was testifying to state senators for the bill to put the onus on app stores, the group was also filing a complaint against Google with the Federal Trade Commission. DCI President Melissa McKay told lawmakers parental controls are porous, app ratings aren’t reliable and kids shouldn’t be allowed to consent to app contracts. In its FTC complaint, the Digital Childhood Institute elaborated on those arguments.
Google offers parents the illusion of control, the group claims, noting children can “unilaterally withdraw” from parental oversight once they’re 13.
“By allowing a child to terminate oversight at a critical stage of development, Google negates its own promises of safety and gives parents a false sense of security, making these assurances deceptive under consumer protection standards,” the complaint states.
DCI explained Google relies on app age ratings from an outside group that are largely “generated through developer self-reporting with minimal oversight.” And the group criticized Google for allowing minors to agree to contracts with app developers.
“No title company or bank would treat a contract signed by a child as valid without parental consent, yet Google does exactly that at scale,” DCI stated.
“In any other industry,” the complaint added, “this would be recognized as legally and ethically indefensible.”
But the remedies DCI has in mind are sweeping. The group insists two “simple, common-sense steps would transform online safety overnight.”
First, obscenity anywhere on the internet should be blocked unless a user has first verified that they are an adult. DCI contends this makes “safety the default” and aligns with a recent U.S. Supreme Court decision upholding a Texas law requiring porn websites verify a user’s age. Second, DCI wants a free “child-friendly browser” to be the default for kids under 18, with parents given the choice to allow a standard browser instead.
The amicus brief
In the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, the ACLU of Ohio took aim at a different age verification system for a taking a similarly broad-brush approach.
“Simply put, this statute violates the First Amendment. Aside from certain, specific categories of speech — most notably obscenity — minors have the same First Amendment rights as adults,” ACLU of Ohio Chief Legal Officer Freda Levenson argued.
ACLU of Ohio Legislative Director Gary Daniels added, “We also continue to monitor similar bills before the General Assembly which similarly, albeit not identically, restrict minors’ access to constitutionally protected speech.”
In an amicus brief, the ACLU acknowledged state officials had noble intentions but insisted the age verification statute is a mess. Determining which users need to provide parental consent would likely wind up requiring companies check every user’s age. And to determine who can provide consent for a specific underage user would require even deeper identity verification.
“The act will block minors and adults from accessing and engaging in speech they have every right to access and engage in online,” the ACLU stated.
While DCI looked to the Texas case to bolster its FTC complaint, the ACLU drew a distinction. The U.S. Supreme Court determined Texas officials were able to regulate access to sexual material because minors don’t have a constitutional right to access it.
“Minors suffer no such limitation when it comes to any other speech, including the plethora of political, religious, artistic, and educational content available on social media,” the ACLU wrote.

(Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — Drawing on his experience as a federal prosecutor, the first Democrat to enter the 2026 race for attorney general said he views the role as a nonpartisan leader that will “call out illegal and unethical behavior” where he sees it.
Nick Coffey, 34, spent seven years as an Oklahoma City-based assistant U.S. attorney prosecuting criminal organizations, drug conspiracies, illegal firearms, immigration cases, fraud and more.
Coffey, of Oklahoma City, said he thinks the election will come down to which candidate has the right experience, rather than the preferred party affiliation, to become the top law enforcement officer in the state. He said most Oklahomans want an attorney general who’s familiar with a courtroom and who’s worked closely with law enforcement.
“I think that I have a lot of faith that they’re going to say that, regardless of party, this is the guy that we can trust and will get the job done,” Coffey said in an interview with Oklahoma Voice.
He described the attorney general’s race as “a career prosecutor versus individuals that have been either in politics and never done a jury trial before or just have been a member of the political elite.” 
Former House Majority Floor Leader Jon Echols and Oklahoma Energy and Environment Secretary Jeff Starling, both Republicans, are the only other candidates who have entered the race, so far.
Attorney General Gentner Drummond, also a Republican, is running for governor. 
This is the first political campaign for Coffey, a fifth-generation Oklahoman and graduate of the University of Oklahoma College of Law. 
He left the U.S. Attorney’s Office last month to launch his campaign and is now working as a trial attorney at the Crowe Dunlevy law firm. It’s his second stint in private practice after starting his career at the Oklahoma City firm McAfee & Taft.
If elected, he said he would prioritize public safety, consumer protection and positive partnerships with tribal nations. Coffey pledged to hold the political elite equally accountable to the law.
“I have no history in or experience in politics,” Coffey said. “I’m just a guy like millions of Oklahomans that went to work every day and tried to do the best that they could do. Now, my job entailed, as a federal prosecutor, holding people accountable. And that’s what I would do as attorney general. I want to bring a sense of independence to the office.”

Alexis Simmons, D-Topeka, says an Oct. 15, 2025, interim committee hearing was a partisan presentation of election reform ideas. She alleges Earl Glynn, who appeared as an expert on election transparency, was biased. Republican legislators came to his defense. (Photo by Tim Carpenter/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Rep. Alexis Simmons waited until conservative Earl Glynn finished a lengthy presentation of proposed reforms to Kansas election law before raising objections with colleagues about the partisan approach of a House and Senate committee assigned to work on campaign-finance transparency.
Simmons, a Topeka Democrat, asserted Glynn epitomized the ideological tilt of the interim committee against Democrat-aligned organizations. She said focusing on testimony by conservatives who ignored Republican-leaning groups was a disservice to the public.
“I find it not factually appropriate to have only focused on the left,” Simmons said. “I think if we’re going to be making changes to the law around campaign transparency and integrity in our elections that we need to have fair, accurate, factual discussions. This is not.”
Glynn, a retired data scientist from Olathe and a member of the Kansas Public Disclosure Commission, recommended Kansas crack down on nonprofit organizations that he suspected of abusing rules on issue advocacy. He condemned Kansas Values Institute, which had a prominent financial role in opposing a proposed amendment to the Kansas Constitution to restrict abortion rights. In 2022, the amendment was overwhelmingly rejected by voters.
Nonprofit tax-exempt organizations should be banned from registering voters in Kansas if they targeted partisan segments of the population, he said.
Glynn also endorsed Wyoming’s decision to drop everyone from that state’s voter registration list who didn’t participate in a federal general election. He said voter rolls in Kansas were stuffed with hundreds of thousands of inactive voters who must be removed. He complained about the state’s inability to make campaign finance data more accessible to him and the lack of clarity about who was financing two new Kansas political parties.
“I have a serious concern, frankly, with the entire presentation,” Simmons said. “This felt like an incredibly partisan presentation given during what should be a constructive and transparent committee hearing with integrity.”
“All the nonprofits I talked about are nonpartisan nonprofits,” Glynn said. “How could I be partisan if I’m talking about nonpartisan nonprofits?”
Simmons continued: “I find that insulting to the intellect of this committee to pretend like this is a fair analysis of the state.”
Kansas organizations involved in previous Kansas election reform debates, including the League of Women Voters of Kansas, Loud Light and American Civil Liberties Union of Kansas, weren’t on the committee’s agenda.
“Challenge me on my facts,” Glynn said.
Rep. Kirk Haskins, also a Topeka Democrat, picked up the line of questioning. He asked Glynn how he factored personal ideological bias in his research.
“I’m a conservative, center-right person,” Glynn said.
“Obviously, the ones that you selected supported the Democratic ideology,” Haskins said. “I’m just curious in your blog or any findings that are related to GOP-leaning nonprofits?”
“I probably don’t currently, but I have in the past,” Glynn replied.
The back-and-forth among Simmons, Haskins and Glynn illustrated intensity of political opinion about demands to reform Kansas’ electoral system.

‘Works both ways’
Sen. Mike Thompson, the Shawnee Republican and chairman of the interim committee, said the exchange initiated by Simmons was out of order.
“Representative, let’s move on. You’re just using this as an opportunity to attack,” Thompson said.
Committee members Rep. Pat Proctor, R-Leavenworth, and Sen. Caryn Tyson, R-Parker, came to Glynn’s defense.
“Thank you, Earl, for being here,” Tyson said. “I’ve known you for years. You are somebody that knows the data, studied the data. You’ve been studying voter data since before it was even an item in Kansas. So, I really appreciate your presentation.”
During a subsequent 10-minute break in the meeting Wednesday, Simmons attempted to speak one-on-one with Glynn to express her disappointment that he had laughed at her criticism.
“It works both ways,” Glynn said.
Tyson stepped into their conversation and accused Simmons of looking for a fight.
“No, I’m looking for respect,” Simmons said. “My point is, please do not come to committee and laugh at members.”
“I didn’t intentionally laugh at you. It was your comments,” Glynn said. “I’m sorry if you were offended, but that wasn’t intended. No disrespect was intended.”
Tyson directed another thought at Simmons: “Oh, my God. I’ve never met somebody so rude.”

Indexing donations
The committee’s agenda featured a presentation by David Keating and Bradley Smith of the Institute for Free Speech, which uses litigation, research and education to promote the deregulation of elections. The organization has opposed campaign finance restrictions, including limits on contributions, primarily on First Amendment grounds.
They told the legislative committee disclosure of low-dollar campaign donors created “cancel culture concerns” for contributors and complicated fundraising. The duo recommended Kansas raise donor disclosure thresholds and tie contribution limits to inflation. They said Kansas ought to require redaction from public view of the street address of campaign donors, which would prevent potential “violence or harassment” of contributors.
“Simplify the system as much as possible,” said Keating, president of the Institute for Free Speech.
Josh Ney, an attorney with KN Law Group in Olathe, also addressed the committee. He has represented Kansas conservatives in disputes about investigation of potential campaign finance violations, as well as assertions that grassroots activists engaged in local politics should register as lobbyists.
He proposed the Legislature address a problem in which political adversaries of his clients relied on civil subpoena power to seek access to their confidential communications with government officials. Use of a subpoena for that purpose should be forbidden on constitutional grounds, he said.
At conclusion of the committee’s meeting, House and Senate members proposed the Legislature review campaign finance limits and possibly link caps to inflation. A majority said the Legislature should consider requiring candidates and political action committees to report small-dollar donations to state regulators even if that information wasn’t distributed publicly.
Tyson, the Republican senator, said the Legislature ought to take action to address false information in political mailers and advertising.
“We need to look at that threshold for slander and libel against legislators or elected officials that are also committing it,” Tyson said.
Rep. Shawn Chauncey, R-Junction City, said scrutiny of political advertising should be a priority because bogus claims damaged voter impressions of the character of candidates and was hurtful to candidates’ families.
Proctor, the House Republican running for secretary of state in 2026, said Kansas also should tame “shadowy nonprofits” that narrowly avoided violation of election regulations and made use of millions of dollars in contributions to influence political outcomes.
Sen. Marci Francisco, D-Lawrence, encouraged the committee to support a law enabling Kansans to register on Election Day. She said the state should take that step if lawmakers made it easier to remove people from registration rolls. Her proposal, however, wasn’t included in the committee’s report.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Alexis-Simmons-hearing-2-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-10-16 11:03:44.560818

College golf takes center stage this weekend at Fallen Oak, the Beau Rivage casino’s hidden treasure in the otherwise sleepy community of Saucier, a few miles from the sandy beaches of Gulfport and Biloxi.
There, Ole Miss, Mississippi State and Southern Miss will combine to host the 14-team Fallen Oak Invitational, which in just three years has become one of the most prestigious fall  college golf tournaments in America. Fourteen teams, including eight from the SEC and three from the Big 10 Conference, will compete.
Rick Cleveland
“This is what we had in mind when we got this thing started,” said Chris Malloy, coach of the No. 4 ranked Ole Miss Rebels. “This is an outstanding field, one of the best you will see in college golf, and they will be challenged by a world class, championship course. Fallen Oak is special.”
Ole Miss, which boasts defending NCAA Champion Michael La Sasso, rates as the tournament favorite with its national ranking and three of the world’s top 45 amateur golfers. La Sasso ranks No. 9, Cameron Tankersley No. 17 and Cohen Trolio No. 45 in the latest world amateur golf rankings.
The Rebels have finished in the top three of all their previous three fall tournaments: a second at the Knoxville Collegiate, a victory at the Honors Course Collegiate at Chattanooga, and a third at the Hamptons Intercollegiate in New York. They played two of the three without La Sasso, who was participating in PGA Tour tournaments.
“Do I think we’re playing our best golf? No, probably not yet,” Malloy said. “But if you told me we’d play two of our first three tournaments without the defending NCAA Champion, have the finishes we had and be ranked like we are, I think anybody would sign up for that. I’m pleased with where we are. I like this squad.”
Mississippi State and Southern Miss also have had good starts to the season. State is coming off a victory in the Cullen Brown Collegiate, hosted by Kentucky. For the first time in school history, Southern Miss won two straight tournaments, the JT Poston Invitational at Waynesville, North Carolina, and the Badger Invitational at Madison, Wisconsin, where the Golden Eagles shot 23-under par for 54 holes and won by 10 shots.
“I think we’re playing some really solid golf,” said State coach Dusty Smith. “Winning at Kentucky was certainly a step in the right direction. We’re looking forward to building on that at Fallen Oak.”
Jake Moffitt, Mississippi State Am champion,  will pla y for USM.
Eddie Brescher’s Southern Miss team might be the best in school history, featuring Mississippi State Amateur champion Jake Moffitt of Ripley who won the State Am in record-breaking fashion at Grand Bear, just a few miles from Fallen Oak. Moffitt, a 19-year-old freshman, has averaged a team-best 69.67 strokes per round for his first 12 rounds of college golf.
The Golden Eagles are coming off a disappointing final round performance in the Little Rock Buick GMC Classic earlier this week, dropping from second to sixth place in the 16-team field with the team’s first over-par round of the season.
“We weren’t happy with how we finished,” Brescher said. “But I know we have a good team. We’ll just hit the reset button and try to get on another win streak.”
All three of the Mississippi coaches believe their collective success is a reflection on junior golf in the state. All three feature players who came up through various Mississippi junior programs, including the Rebels’ Trolio of West Point, who made the U.S. Amateur semifinals as a 17-year-old high school player at Oak Hill Academy, and his younger brother Colin. 
“I think the success these teams have had is a reflection on Mississippi golf as a whole,” said State’s Smith, whose team includes junior Drew Wilson of Potts Camp and freshman Jackson Cook, another product of the remarkable Oak Hill Academy program that plays out of Old Waverly in West Point.
All three Mississippi coaches also take pride in hosting the Fallen Oak event, which has some unique features, including Jumbotrons behind the ninth and 18th greens that will be showing college football teams during Saturday’s first round. The tournament also includes a Friday pro-am-styled event during which the college golfers will be paired with sponsors and hosts of the tournament.
Besides the three Mississippi teams, the field includes Alabama, Arkansas, Chattanooga, Georgia, Illinois, Iowa, Louisiana State  University, South Carolina, Tennessee, University of Nevada, Las Vegas and Wisconsin. Said USM’s Brescher, “It’s about as close as you’re going to get to a post-season quality field during the fall.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/09150838/Malloy-congratulantes-La-Sasso.-.jpg,,,2025-10-16 10:04:17.682684

Alaska's outbreak of pertussis, also known as whooping cough, has subsided after peaking in the fall of 2024. (Image by Dan Higgins/provided by U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention)Alaska’s outbreak of pertussis, commonly known as whooping cough, has now subsided, but it created some significant impacts for residents, state data shows.
The outbreak ran from April 2024 to 2025. During that 12-month period, there were 679 confirmed or probable cases reported in the state, said a newly released bulletin from the Alaska Division of Health’s epidemiology section.
Pertussis is caused by a bacterial infection and is highly contagious.
Among them were 74 infants younger than 1 who got the disease, most were not up to date on their vaccinations, the bulletin said.
Twenty-nine patients were hospitalized, most of them infants under 1 year old, the bulletin said.
One unvaccinated baby died during the outbreak, the bulletin said.
Vaccination provided significant protection to Alaska children, earlier research showed.
In the summer and fall of 2024, when the outbreak was at its peak, unvaccinated Alaska children were more than 13 times as likely to contract the disease than those who had received all their pertussis vaccinations, the bulletin said.
The peak of the outbreak was in September 2024, when there were 155 cases reported statewide. That peak coincided with a big uptick in vaccine orders in late summer of 2024, and a record number of vaccines were given to Alaskans in September, Dr. Elizabeth Ohlsen, a staff physician with the epidemiology section, said by email.
“Overall, we are glad to see that the vast majority of Alaskans choose to protect themselves and their children against pertussis” by adhering to the recommended immunization schedule, Ohlsen said.
The pertussis vaccine is combined with vaccines for diphtheria and tetanus. The recommended schedule includes vaccination of expectant mothers during their third trimester of pregnancy – the only available protection against the disease for the youngest infants. For children, the recommended schedule is for four doses by 18 months of age, followed by a booster when children are between 4 and 6. Boosters are also recommended every 10 years for teens and adults.
Ohlsen emphasized the need for vaccination during pregnancy.
“This boosts maternal immunity in a way that gets passed on to the infant. This is so important because infants <6 months old are the most likely to get seriously ill if they get pertussis,” she said by email.
By geography, about a third of the reported cases were in Anchorage and 20% were in the Matanuska-Susitna Borough. The rest were scattered around the state.
While Anchorage had the highest number of cases, 228, it had the lowest rate among the state’s regions: 78 per 100,000 people. The Southwest region, with 82 cases, had the highest regional rate, at 198 per 100,000 people, the bulletin said.

The University of Delaware Fightin’ Blue Hens (3-3, 1-2 CUSA) turned the ball over twice in the first half leading to 14 Jacksonville State points in the Gamecocks’ 38-25 win Wednesday night.
 
NEWARK — The Fightin’ Blue Hens quarterback Nick Minicucci stood at his own 43 yard line in the shotgun formation. Three receivers lined up to his right as the junior received the snap needing to gain four yards on fourth down. 
Minicucci looked toward the trio of receivers and connected with Jake Thaw on a curl route near the line to gain. Thaw turned to his left as a pair of Gamecock defenders descended upon him. Thaw powered through the tackle and stretched his arms out to guarantee the conversion, but instead of moving the chains Thaw’s effort resulted in a bigger Blue Hen deficit.
As Thaw pulled the ball back to his chest, freshman linebacker Mac Sanders ripped the ball loose. The ball dribbled down the field until safety Caleb Nix recovered it and ran 46 yards to the endzone. Nix’s score gave Jacksonville State a two possession lead it never relinquished, beating the University of Delaware Fightin’ Blue Hens, 38-25, Wednesday night in Jacksonville, Alabama. 
Thaw’s fumble was the second of three for the Blue Hens in the first half that resulted in the Gamecocks’ first two scores.
The first fumble occurred on the first play of UD’s second drive of the game on a pass from Minicucci to tight end Elijah Sessoms. Sessoms caught the junior’s pass and took a couple steps before colliding with safety Travis Franklin Jr. Franklin’s tackle forced the ball loose. 
Walker O’Steen recovered the fumble and ran it back to Delaware’s 11 yard line. The Gamecocks offense scored a touchdown on their ensuing drive via a six yard run from Cam Cook earning an early advantage. 
The Blue Hens second fumble resulted in Nix’s fumble recovery and the third was a minor blunder in the backfield by Minicucci that he fell on avoiding a third turnover.
The miscues were the main catalyst for Jacksonville State’s scoring in the half, because of the stellar job UD’s defense did at slowing CUSA’s top ranked rushing offense. 
The Gamecocks entered the game averaging over 250 rushing yards per game led by the nation’s leading rusher, Cam Cook. Cook entered the game with 832 rushing yards and seven rushing touchdowns averaging over 130 ground yards a game. 
The Blue Hens limited Cook’s impact to just 35 rushing yards in the first half and forced the Gamecocks to throw the ball 16 times — just one off from their 17 total attempts a week ago.
Jacksonville State quarterback Caden Creel executed well completing 11 of those throws in just his second start of the season. Creel’s biggest play of the first half was a 23-yard touchdown pass to his leading receiver Brock Rechsteiner that gave Jacksonville State a 21-0 lead halfway through the second quarter.
The Blue Hens offense struggled to generate any rhythm or flow following the turnovers. Their only score of the first half came before the two minute timeout on a one yard run from Viron Ellison Jr. It was the first of three touchdowns for the sophomore running back and it cut the Gamecocks’ lead to 15 going into half time.
The majority of the offense was a product of Minicucci’s right arm connecting with 11 different receivers throughout the night for 422 yards and a touchdown. UD tried to push the ball downfield throughout the night, consistently throwing deep passes to receivers matched up one on one downfield. The approach generated ten passing plays of 15 or more yards, but those big plays weren’t enough to sustain a comeback attempt. 
UD outscored Jacksonville State by 2 points in the second half, but it couldn’t overcome the turnovers and season high 10 penalties. 
Cook matched Ellison’s production with two more touchdown runs in the second half and finished as the game’s leading rusher with 117 rushing yards on 18 carries. Minicucci completed 32 of his 50 pass attempts for a 64 percent completion percentage. Kyre Duplessis caught six of those passes and finished with 90 yards leading all pass catchers. UD’s running game contributed a total of 34 yards.   
The Blue Hens will have a week to regroup before welcoming Middle Tennessee into Delaware Stadium Wednesday, October 22. The Blue Raiders are 0-2 in conference play this season and sit three spots below UD in the CUSA standings in 11th place.",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Gemini_Generated_Image_tae3kttae3kttae3.png,,,2025-10-16 10:04:17.682684

(Photo by Anna Kaminsk/Kansas Reflector)OLATHE — Two women said they regretted their abortion procedures as they testified Wednesday during the second leg of a trial challenging state laws that impose requirements on abortion providers and patients.
However, the women’s abortions took place before the restrictions at the center of the case were in effect. And one woman did not receive any abortions in the state of Kansas.
The case in Johnson County District Court has been decades in the making, beginning in 1997 when Kansas lawmakers initially passed the Woman’s Right to Know Act. It contained a series of requirements relating to informed consent and steps abortion providers must take before performing an abortion. Republican legislators have built upon the act in the years since.
Melissa Cole, a retiree who lives in Tulsa but grew up in Overland Park, spoke about her three abortions. She obtained the first at 15 years old in 1974 in Missouri. The others took place in Arkansas and Texas. Donna Pond, a retired bookkeeper originally from Winfield, detailed her abortion, which took place in 1986 in Wichita when she was 16 years old.
“You can’t go back once you’ve made that decision,” Cole said. “You can’t go back.”
The trial resumed Tuesday after a multi-week break. The first part, in late September, began with two OB-GYNs whose businesses brought the suit against Kansas officials. The Center for Reproductive Rights, an international legal advocacy organization, is representing Traci Lynn Nauser, an Overland Park OB-GYN, and Comprehensive Health of Planned Parenthood Great Plains. They sued Kansas officials in 2023 over the Woman’s Right to Know Act and tacked onto the lawsuit the following year a newer law that was passed as House Bill 2749.
The plaintiffs concluded witness testimony Tuesday with an ethicist and a historian on the stand. Wednesday was the state’s first opportunity to present witnesses.
The state is represented by attorneys from the conservative Christian legal advocacy group Alliance Defending Freedom, along with former Kansas appeals judge and current solicitor general Anthony Powell.
In the decades since Cole underwent her procedures, she said, she has changed her mind about abortion. It was a change fueled by her Christian faith. She said she believes abortion should be illegal in all circumstances, including in cases of rape and incest, and she likened abortion to murder throughout her testimony.
The 66-year-old said she never discussed her abortions before the trial, save for a faith-based abortion recovery group.
“You never forget,” she said.
Monique Chireau Wubbenhorst is an OB-GYN with decades of experience as an academic and doctor, domestically and internationally. She also frequently testifies in abortion-related cases. She said her going rate is $800 an hour, and she has contributed to abortion-related cases in at least eight other states — most recently a deposition in Missouri earlier this month.
Wubbenhorst said she believes the Woman’s Right to Know Act “serves to protect the health of women and children.” Collecting data on a patient’s reasons for abortion, which is a provision of the 2024 legislation, “has public health significance and is helpful in public health activities,” she said.
As she unpacked a litany of studies and research related to abortions, Wubbenhorst and attorneys on both sides drilled into granular issues, including whether a fetus is a human or a collection of cells. Wubbenhorst was specific about her terminology. To her, she said it was important to distinguish between “intentional feticide,” referring to elective abortions, and “termination of pregnancy,” an abortion performed to save the life of a mother.
The 2024 law, which a court blocked before it could take effect, required providers to tell patients that abortions can be reversed, which is not widely accepted as safe, and to ask patients why they sought an abortion, offering a list of around a dozen reasons. The original right to know law mandates abortion providers use state-sanctioned abortion language, implement 30-minute wait periods before receiving an abortion, and print materials in a specific typeface on a particular color of paper.
While the plaintiffs have argued that Kansas’ restrictions threaten patient health and safety, the state’s attorneys attempted to show that the state laws do not cause harm to patients.
The case is scheduled to continue through Friday.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/250926_abortiontrial_p03-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-10-16 10:04:17.682684

While the Trump administration and Montana’s elected officials continue pushing to expand the state’s coal industry, companies on the ground appear to have a waning appetite. 
The federal government recently rejected a bid on a new coal lease offered for 167 million tons of coal from Montana’s Powder River Basin and postponed a sale in Wyoming scheduled for last week. 
Navajo Transitional Energy Company was the only company to submit a bid for the lease in Montana for $186,000 for federal coal near the company’s Spring Creek Mine in Big Horn County. That works out to just a fraction of a penny per ton, and well below what the Bureau of Land Management estimates as the market value. 
The last federal coal lease sale in the region went for $1.10 per ton, according to federal data, for a total of $793 million for 721 million tons, back in 2012. At the same price, a bid for the Spring Creek lease would generate more than $183 million.  
Navajo Transitional Energy operates the Spring Creek Mine in the area, which the federal government approved for expansion earlier this year, allowing access to an additional 39.9 million tons of coal, which could keep the mine operational for up to 16 more years. 
Wyofile previously reported that Navajo Transitional had warned that market value for coal in the Powder River Basin was far below previous valuations, and in documents submitted before the bid said that one reason included low forecasts for selling the coal, as many coal-fired power plants in the region are set to go offline in the next two decades. 
The Bureau of Land Management rejected NTEC’s offer for the Spring Creek lease, saying it did not meet the requirements of the federal Minerals Leasing Act, which requires a fair-market value for any federal lease. 
In an email, a spokesperson for the Department of the Interior said the BLM determines fair market value through “a rigorous process that includes economic modeling, analysis of comparable sales, and current market conditions to ensure taxpayers receive a fair return.”
“The BLM remains committed to supporting responsible coal development as part of a balanced approach to managing public lands and resources,” the department said. 
Funds from federal coal leases are split between the federal government and the state where the coal is mined, but part of the Trump administration’s “Big Beautiful Bill” lowered the federal coal royalty rate from 12.8% to 7%, decreasing how much money Montana is set to earn from each lease. 
The low offer for the Spring Creek lease prompted BLM to postpone another auction on a 441 million ton West Antelope III federal lease in Wyoming. Navajo Transitional also requested the sale in association with its Antelope coal mine, and was reportedly the only party interested in bidding. 
“While we had hoped for stronger participation, the postponed West Antelope III coal lease sale in Wyoming underscores the lasting damage from the Obama-Biden administration’s decades-long war on coal, which aimed to dismantle domestic production and shake investor confidence in the industry,” an Interior spokesperson wrote in an email. “Under President Trump, the Department of the Interior and BLM are restoring trust between government and industry as part of the broader push for American Energy Dominance.”
The West Antelope III sale has yet to be rescheduled. 
 Mining for Montana’s benefit

The low interest in coal leases comes as the Trump administration and Congress, with the support of all four members of Montana’s delegation have moved to greatly expand the potential offerings across the West. 
Last year, the Biden administration had announced that it would be halting much coal leasing in eastern Montana, and had made steps toward stopping coal leasing on federal tracts of land due to concerns about climate change.
But just last week, the U.S. Senate voted to roll back the Biden-era Resource Management Plan (RMP) amendment for the Miles City BLM office, spanning most of eastern Montana, which had prohibited future coal leases in the region. The U.S. House voted in favor of the amendment in September, with both of Montana’s representatives joining the Republican majority. 
“Montana energy is back,” Sen. Steve Daines said in a press release. “Mining is a vital part of Montana, providing nearly a thousand well-paying jobs and contributing nearly $3 billion to our state’s economy. That’s why I introduced a bill along with the rest of our Montana delegation to remove this anti-energy rule and support Montana’s coal miners.”
Daines did not respond to questions about the low interest in the recent coal lease or how increasing potential supply could further impact the market and Montana’s financial coffers. 
Montana’s Republican Gov. Greg Gianforte had also supported reopening eastern Montana for coal leasing, saying it was essential to the state’s economy and revenue. Montana supplies 5% of the nation’s coal and derives 37% of energy generation from coal-fired power plants.  
“Under the Biden Administration, BLM’s proposal would have rendered Montana’s coal resources useless, depriving Montana schools and other institutions of a critical funding source,” Gianforte wrote in a letter to the Trump administration. “Montana’s schools and public institutions need a good partner in BLM, and it is imperative that the agency embrace the opportunity to maximize the development opportunities for coal resources in Montana.”
Gianforte’s office did not respond to questions about the low interest in the recent coal lease or how increasing potential supply could further impact the market for Montana coal and the state’s financial benefit. 
Conservation groups decried the move by Congress to overturn the resource management plan, saying that it came about through a multi-year public process, but was revoked through a single vote. 
“It’s an egregious example of rich politicians thinking they know better than locals and experts. By legislating day-to-day management, Congress is hijacking careful planning and stewardship developed by local communities and experts,” said Alex Blackmer, with Wild Montana. “This reckless move puts not just one plan, but hundreds of land plans nationwide at risk of Congressional interference, unleashing chaos and uncertainty on ranchers, hunters, hikers, anglers, and businesses that depend on our public lands.”
Additional resource management plans from the Biden administration that banned future coal leasing, including in Wyoming’s Powder River Basin, are also being challenged in Congress. 
In Montana, Gianforte has continued to push for expanding energy production in the state, most recently by convening an energy task force to “unleash American-made energy,” following Trump’s executive orders to bolster nationwide domestic fossil fuel energy sources.

A New Mexico agency announced Wednesday that business owners struggling to secure adequate insurance due to recent wildfires can now receive up to $2 million in coverage from the state’s Fair Access to Insurance Requirements Plan. 
The FAIR Plan operates as the insurer of “last resort” in the state, offering coverage only to those unable to secure coverage in the private insurance market due to natural disasters. Until recently, the plan offered only $1 million in commercial coverage. 
Across the state, homeowner and other property insurance premiums have sharply increased, and insurers have refused to renew or even canceled policies in some areas, particularly the burn scars of the recent South Fork, Salt and Hermits Peak-Calf Canyon fires.
As a result, the Office of the Superintendent of Insurance earlier this summer approved increases of residential insurance coverage in the plan from $350,000 to $750,000.

“Now, we are taking another positive step forward by increasing FAIR Plan coverages for commercial properties by $1 million,” New Mexico Insurance Superintendent Alice Kane said in a news release.
Currently, 7,200 residents use the FAIR plan statewide, and so do 280 businesses, according to the news release. 
“I look forward to the benefits this will provide to business owners who have been impacted by wildfires, especially as many commercial property owners continue to face non-renewals and cancellations,” Kane said. 
Lawmakers sought even bigger coverage increases during the legislative session earlier this year through a bill that would have increased commercial limits to $5 million and required changes to the industry board that approves coverage increases. The bill died after the FAIR Plan board agreed to the increases taking place now, according to sponsor Harlan Vincent (R-Ruidoso Downs).
During the session, an OSI actuary that the 10 biggest insurers in the state have increased premiums on average 50% to 60% since 2022, though the actuary did not specify how much of that increase fell on homeowners or business owners. 
Along with the coverage increase, the OSI asked residents in high-wildfire-risk areas to mitigate risk around their properties.

(Photo courtesy of Prairie Island Indian Community)The effort by Minnesota’s Indigenous communities to achieve energy sovereignty is gathering pace. 
In the shadow of Xcel Energy’s Prairie Island nuclear power plant, the Prairie Island Indian Community now generates much of its electricity from onsite solar installations. 
Near the headwaters of the Mississippi, the White Earth Nation oversees one of the country’s only tribal utility commissions, giving it real leverage over local, non-Native utilities. 
The Mille Lacs Band of Ojibwe is arguably the most important customer of — and a key decision-making authority for — Minnesota’s third biggest rural electric cooperative.
The tribes seeking energy sovereignty face a stiff challenge, however, in the Trump administration’s campaign to roll back clean energy progress, as well as the White House’s apparent disregard for Indigenous communities. 
Still, the work goes on: Bob Blake, a member of the Red Lake Band of Chippewa and owner of a Minneapolis energy development company, helped secure a pre-Trump federal grant to set up a “tribal virtual utility” on the Red Lake Reservation in far northern Minnesota. He retained a blue-chip “tax and assurance firm” to lay the legal groundwork for a new electric provider in a strictly regulated state where utility territories are set more or less in stone. The utility would purchase cheap, renewable power and deliver it to customers without spending huge sums on its own power plants.
The long-term goal is something resembling Yakama Power, a tribal utility that steadily absorbed small electric co-ops over the past two decades and now serves thousands of people across rural Washington State. There’s no reason the Minnesota utility couldn’t serve multiple tribal nations across the state and perhaps beyond, Blake said in an interview. 
“What I eventually see is tribal nations coming together, forming their own electrical associations and then selling power on the grid like the big guys,” he said.
Eventually. The virtual utility idea is on hold due in part to the Trump administration’s cut of $7 billion in funding for the Biden-era Solar For All program, which subsidizes renewable energy deployment in low-income and historically marginalized communities. As litigation drags on, Blake said up to $80 million in funding that could have gone to Red Lake is in limbo. 
“We have a lot of time to plan now,” he said. “These opportunities will present themselves again and we will be that much more ready to move forward when they do.”

Rural utilities come around
Minnesota tribes aren’t waiting on Blake’s ambitious vision to reshape the state’s energy landscape. 
In 2022, as Enbridge routed its controversial Line 3 oil pipeline near its reservation, the White Earth Nation stood up a tribal utility commission with the ability to set rates, permit infrastructure and issue legally binding orders to the electric, gas and telecommunications utilities serving its 1,100 square-mile territory. It’s among the few commissions like it nationwide.
“The community came out and said, ‘We want to be in control if that happens again, that anyone who wants to build infrastructure through our reservation needs to get a permit for it,’” Nate Matthews, the commission’s executive director, said on the panel at the recent Minnesota Solar Energy Industries Association’s annual conference. He sat alongside Matt Dannenberg, head of tribal affairs for the Alliance for Tribal Clean Energy.
The tribal utility commission also gives White Earth more pull with the four retail electric utilities serving its members in northwestern Minnesota. Rates can vary wildly across relatively short distances on the reservation, Matthews said, leaving some members wondering why they pay twice as much for electricity as their neighbors. The commission recently wrapped up work on a net metering policy requiring the utilities to compensate members fairly for electricity produced by solar arrays and other small, customer-sited power sources.
Also under the commission’s jurisdiction are larger power projects that will give White Earth some measure of energy independence. 
The tribe is nearing construction of a $2.8 million solar array that Matthews said could supply two-thirds of the power consumed by its Shooting Star Casino in Bagley, Minnesota. Though it promises to eat into regional transmission co-op Minnkota Power’s sales, Matthews said the utility indicated they won’t push back on the project.
White Earth began construction this year on a smaller but more complicated “resilience hub” at an elementary school and community center in the village of Pine Point. That project — developed by locally owned 8th Fire Solar and 10Power out of California — expands a small existing solar array and adds enough batteries to power critical loads at the facilities for up to 12 hours. It’s engineered as a self-contained microgrid that can disconnect from the public grid during outages.
Resilience is a common goal in tribal communities, said Gwe Gasco, director of sales and marketing for 8th Fire Solar. 8th Fire’s core business is producing and installing solar thermal panels that — unlike more common solar photovoltaic panels — convert the sun’s energy directly into heat. 
Solar thermal systems can’t entirely replace gas, propane or electric building heat, but they can significantly reduce winter heating loads and cut users’ energy bills, Gasco said. One or two panels is enough for most residential and small commercial sites. Though 8th Fire can handle larger projects like an eight-panel installation at a planned Flandreau Santee Sioux Tribe resilience hub in South Dakota, Gasco said much of its business comes from people looking to wrest some control over their energy bills back from utilities. 
“People are getting fed up with what’s going on…they’re realizing they can do a lot of this stuff ourselves,” he said. 
Like Minnkota in Bagley, Matthews said the regional transmission utility for Pine Point, Great River Energy, is on board with that project. So is Itasca-Mantrap Cooperative Electric Association, which operates the lower-voltage distribution network serving individual customers in the area.
“The new leadership and younger folks at Great River Energy…instead of closing the drawbridge, they’ve been really excited to work with us on this,” he said. 
Steve Johnson, Itasca-Mantrap president and CEO, said in an email that the scale of the Pine Point project — which he called “an inspiring, community-driven effort” — required careful study before getting the go-ahead to connect to the grid. But he suggested the utility and the tribe are aligned on energy strategy in their remote corner of Minnesota.
“We understand the deep challenges facing rural communities, from rising energy costs to increasingly frequent and severe storms, and we share the goal of building a stronger, more resilient, and equitable energy future,” he said.
Matthews said the utility commission is considering a utility franchise fee that could fund future projects like Pine Point and Shooting Star, plus service line extensions, hookup fees and other costs normally borne by customers. 
Dannenberg, a member of Wisconsin’s Bad River Band of Lake Superior Chippewa, said that the White Earth Tribal Utility Commission’s work puts it on the leading edge of the Indigenous energy sovereignty movement in the United States. He characterized it as a small step “to right the historical injustices” of a power system that has treated tribes as an afterthought.
“This is recent history where tribes are asserting their sovereignty in the energy space…saying, we’re fed up with blackouts, brownouts and not getting the energy services we deserve,” he said.
Big enough to matter 
With its self-generation and resilience projects, White Earth Nation is following a path blazed by Minnesota Indigenous communities like the Mille Lacs Band and Prairie Island Indian Community.
In 2022, the Mille Lacs Band commissioned a 3-megawatt solar array in Hinckley. The system ties into the East Central Energy grid but offsets a substantial amount of electric demand from the tribe, which runs Grand Casino Mille Lacs and Grand Casino Hinckley.
The tribe’s initial vision “turned out to be beyond the scope of what was possible from an engineering standpoint. We said, ‘Let’s put away the legal stuff and diagrams and tell us what you want,” said Justin Jahnz, ECE president and CEO. 
That turned out to be pretty simple: a sizable solar system that reduced the tribe’s carbon footprint and gave it some energy independence. As the partnership deepened, ECE invested in grid resilience efforts that would directly benefit the tribe, further boosting its energy independence. Mille Lacs has long been part of ECE’s member resource council, Jahnz said, in recognition of their importance as a major customer.
The Prairie Island Indian Community and Dakota Electric Association — the state’s second largest electric distribution cooperative — have a similarly close working relationship, Dakota Electric CEO Ryan Hentges said in an email. 
Hentges said that since 2000 or so, the cooperative has worked with the community on major projects like a full backup generation system for the entire Treasure Island Resort and Casino campus; new infrastructure to improve local power quality; and — most meaningfully for the community’s energy sovereignty and climate goals — the development of a 5.4-megawatt solar array and a separate geothermal heating and cooling system at the casino.
The solar and geothermal systems are part of the first tranche of projects in the Prairie Island Indian Community’s net zero initiative, Andrea Zimmerman, the tribe’s energy program manager, said in an interview. So is a community-wide energy upgrade initiative underway now that will significantly improve the efficiency of its aging housing stock.
A second tranche will bolster weatherization, upgrade commercial buildings across the community and potentially roll out an electric vehicle fleet, Zimmerman said.
The budget President Trump signed in July could make those next projects harder to underwrite, however. Alongside the widely-panned health care cuts Washington Democrats are fighting to undo, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act drastically shortened the window for owners and developers of wind and solar energy projects to qualify for generous federal tax credits that under Biden-era legislation would have remained in effect into the mid-2030s.
The cuts are forcing Prairie Island Indian Community to change their approach and consider other funding strategies, Zimmerman said.
Dannenberg said the Trump administration’s cuts to Solar for All affected some of the projects supported by the Alliance for Tribal Clean Energy, too. For now, his group — which provides technical assistance and project finance for tribal energy projects — is simply trying to do as much as it can before the tax credits expire next year.
“The name of the game now is how many Solar For All projects can we salvage and get across the finish line,” he said.
But the Trump administration’s heel turn from Biden-era energy policy so far hasn’t knocked Minnesota off its clean energy goals. The state aims for a carbon-free power grid by 2040 and a net-zero economy by 2050. 
It sees tribes as vital to those efforts. In 2023, the Legislature established the Tribal Advisory Council on Energy, the first state-funded body giving tribes an official voice on state energy policy. Prairie Island Tribal Council Member Michael Childs Jr. is a TACE co-chair.
Blake, who pushed the Legislature to create TACE, said in January that tribes’ political sovereignty makes them critical partners in transforming Minnesota’s energy economy.
“Native people are the only people with their own government in this government,” he said. “In regard to the energy transition, if we aren’t giving Tribes the opportunity and chance to collaborate, they will never reach their potential.”",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/solar-2-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-16 11:03:44.560818

For many young Californians, preschool is a place to run around, sing songs and develop early social skills. But for those enrolled in one San Diego program, preschool could also mean speaking to a mental health therapist, processing trauma and learning emotional regulation.
As CalMatters’ Adriana Heldiz explains in a visual essay, Mi Escuelita is a preschool dedicated to students who have experienced family trauma, including domestic violence. Last year, 28 parents of 84 students enrolled in Mi Escuelita reported having been involved in multiple domestic violence relationships.
The school offers students on-site mental health services, such as one-on-one sessions with clinicians, as well as group therapy where students learn about feelings and how to regulate them. Therapists interact with students through play, and keep an eye out for clues of deeper emotional issues bubbling up.

Angelina Puffelis, clinical supervisor at Mi Escuelita: “Usually there is a theme and some of the things that are common are protection, safety, empowerment or the superhero; bad and evil. So as a therapist, I look for that. This is a continuum theme and if there’s changes in the home environment, that theme plays out in play therapy.”

Though the cost of operating Mi Escuelita is $1.3 million a year, students attend Mi Escuelita for free and classes are offered year-round. Founded in 2006, Mi Escuelita is regarded as a leader among therapeutic preschools, offering insight to the benefits of a trauma-informed learning environment. A recent UC San Diego report found that 82% of Mi Escuelita students scored above average on the Kindergarten Readiness Test — meaning those students have “no major learning difficulties.”

Inaccurate directories haunt patients

After being diagnosed with a hernia that occurs through an opening in the diaphragm — a potentially fatal condition that requires surgery — Mary Kuhn began searching for an in-network specialist who could treat her. But discrepancies arising from her health insurance’s “ghost network” underscores how Kuhn, and many patients like her, experience delays in care that could endanger their lives, writes CalMatters’ Kristen Hwang.
So-called ghost networks refer to inaccurate or outdated lists published by insurance companies that include health providers who aren’t actually in-network. For Kuhn, her physician referred her to a Walnut Creek cardiothoracic surgeon listed in Blue Shield of California’s online directory of providers. But a month before her surgery was to take place, the insurer sent her a denial letter in December 2024, refusing to pay for the surgeon’s services, stating the doctor was not in her health plan.

Kuhn: “I thought that’s a mistake. Of course he’s in-network, I see him there.”

Though California passed a law in 2015 to make it easier for patients to find in-network care, patients still struggle with inaccurate directories. Assemblymember Cecilia Aguiar-Curry argues that the law is underenforced, and that health plans have “no incentive” to fix the problem. Though the Davis Democrat introduced a bill to require directories to be 95% accurate by 2029, she later withdrew it, and says she plans to revive the measure next year.

Former physician seeks to unseat Republican

Former Democratic state Sen. Richard Pan is running to unseat U.S. Rep. Kevin Kiley, a Republican who finds himself newly vulnerable should voters pass Proposition 50 in November, writes CalMatters’ Maya C. Miller.
Pan said he is running for congress because he wants to make the government “work for people” again. The Sacramento physician successfully pushed for a 2015 state law requiring stronger immunization protections for children, and faced immense pushback from anti-vaccine activists and Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the current U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary.

Pan, in an interview with CalMatters: “We see a federal government that seems to be intentionally attacking health care, whether it’s taking away people’s health insurance, undermining public health to allow disease to spread, cutting research for things like cancer treatments.”

Since 2023, Kiley has represented California’s 3rd Congressional District. Kiley is an outspoken critic of Gov. Gavin Newsom and opposes Prop. 50. If the district changes under the measure, Pan would have previously represented about 70% of voters who live in that new district, according to his campaign.

And lastly: A hole in the theory

On Monday California Secretary of State Shirley Weber addressed the growing conspiracy theory that a small hole on the ballot return envelopes for November’s special election was designed to reveal a person’s vote on Prop. 50 — the only measure on the ballot. 
Weber said the hole is for “sight-impaired voters to orient themselves” when they sign the envelope. If voters have privacy concerns, they can place their ballots inside the envelope in a way that does not make their markings visible, or vote in person. Similar theories spread during Newsom’s recall election in 2021.






California Voices
CalMatters columnist Dan Walters: Despite Newsom pledging to lead efforts to develop millions of new housing units, and signing multiple bills to speed up construction, housing production in California did not substantially increase during his governorship.
Acts of protest from detained immigrants — such as the hunger strikes in California’s El Centro Immigration Detention Facility — have never stopped, and will likely continue under President Donald Trump’s second administration, writes Jessica Ordaz, associate professor of ethnic studies at the University of Colorado Boulder.

Mi Escuelita now has a long record of helping kids and families move forward.","Elizabeth Gibot’s son James was normally a quiet and well-behaved toddler. But she noticed he began to cry more and appeared anxious whenever she wasn’t around. He also stopped using the sign language she taught him as a baby. She knew something was wrong, so she reached out to their pediatrician, but the doctor couldn’t provide any help or answers.
“He regressed from everything that I had taught him,” she said. “I guess it was very hard for other people to notice because nobody knows your child more than you.”
At the time, Gibot had just left her partner, who she said was physically, verbally, emotionally and financially abusive. She tried to shield James when things got confrontational, but living in a small house made it unavoidable at times.
Gibot began searching for resources online. She stumbled upon Mi Escuelita, a preschool in San Diego dedicated to students who have experienced family trauma, such as domestic violence. After some thought, she enrolled James. 
“Just that alone was a huge weight off my shoulders, knowing that he’s going to be here and with professionals that are going to help him, in ways that I could never. I mean, at least not in that moment in time,” she said. 



Elizabeth Gibot and her son James Gibot received mental health services offered to Mi Escuelita students and their families.
Mi Escuelita, founded in 2006, offers students on-site mental health services and a safe space where children can learn and heal. It’s considered a leader among therapeutic preschools, and it offers insight to the emerging concept of a trauma-informed learning environment for students and their families.
Run by the nonprofit SBCS, formerly known as South Bay Community Services, the school has long provided services to families in need, including those experiencing domestic violence. Mi Escuelita grew out of those programs.  
“It’s to really focus on the little guys,” said Stacey Musso, director of the behavioral health and wellness department at SBCS.  
In addition to making sure students are ready for kindergarten, Mi Escuelita offers one-on-one and group therapy. It has on-site therapists accessible to students during school hours. Angelina Puffelis, clinical supervisor at Mi Escuelita, says the access provides her team an opportunity to work with students and address issues as they bubble up.

Last: Behavioral Specialist Sebastian Lavenant works with a student during class at Mi Escuelita in San Diego on April 23, 2025. The preschool has eight teachers, two on-site therapists and a behavioral therapist on staff. While therapists mainly focus on the mental health of a student, behavioral therapists center on examining the actions and conduct of a student to see what may be triggering them or getting in the way of them interacting with others.
Students wash their hands after a painting activity at Mi Escuelita in San Diego on April 23, 2025. Many of the students at the preschool are students of color and come from low-income families. Mi Escuelita offers mental health services to both students and their families since those relationships play a role in a child’s development.
According to a recent report, 28 parents of students enrolled at Mi Escuelita last year reported having been involved in multiple domestic violence relationships. Seventeen of them had to move or were homeless as a result of domestic violence. 
Evidence shows the program works.
A recent UC San Diego report found 82% of students at Mi Escuelita scored above average on the Kindergarten Readiness Test, which evaluates a student’s preparation for kindergarten. An  above-average score indicates a student should need “very little special attention and with no major learning difficulties.”
Students attend Mi Escuelita at no cost, and classes are offered year-round. In return, families agree to work with school officials to address mental health issues head on.
“We ask that our families understand our environment. It is so unique,” said Mi Escuelita preschool director Lisa Klemp. “We really believe in that connection. We want to support not just our children, but our family as a whole.”
Students take part in a safari hunt at Mi Escuelita on April 23, 2025. All children who attend Mi Escuelita have experienced family-related trauma in their short lives.
Lessons from nap time
As a handful of students savored the last bites of their sandwiches, carrots and apple sauce during a recent lunch, others prepared for their next activity. They threw away trash, grabbed blankets and lay on mats set throughout the classroom. Some students grabbed stuffed animals or picked out books to keep them comfortable. Teachers dimmed the lights and played a Youtube video of kittens purring as lullabies played softly. 


While most students quickly fell asleep, some struggled to relax. One girl refused to sleep and cried when told she couldn’t run around the classroom. Teachers tried to help by offering to read her books or by blowing small bubbles, but she wasn’t having it. Another girl lay very still with her eyes wide open looking straight at the ceiling. She barely blinked and stayed this way for most of nap time before finally dozing off.
“We do see that resting their bodies, the calming, can be challenging for some of our kids,” Klemp said. “I believe that they’ve been in spaces or environments that may have caused them to be hyper alert. And so knowing that you’re in a safe space, that you can calm and relax your body is really crucial for some of them.”
Teacher Ismairy Caldera reads to a student to help them fall asleep during nap time at Mi Escuelita in San Diego on May 5, 2025. Nap time can be particularly challenging for children who have experienced trauma, as many of them remain on high alert and struggle to rest.

According to the National Survey of Children’s Health, 63% of U.S. adults reported experiencing at least one so-called adverse childhood experience before age 18, such as abuse, witnessing violence or family separation. Trauma can show up in different ways. Some may become explosive in their behavior while others may be timid or seclude themselves. Nap time, in particular, can be a challenge for younger children.
“In general, as a kid, at night can be a scary place. And then if you’re hearing screaming, if you’re hearing someone slamming a door, if you’re hearing someone, you know, police showing up in your home, it just really emphasizes that scary time,” Klemp said. 
Trauma in children can go untreated or be dismissed as normal behavior but its impacts can have a lasting effect that can lead to substance abuse, eating disorders, diabetes and heart disease, according to the National Child Traumatic Stress Network. Early trauma can also increase the potential of being involved in the juvenile justice system and low academic performance.

Since it can be difficult for children to express their emotions, Puffelis uses play therapy as a way to help her understand what a child might be experiencing. “It’s like being in a tour,” she said. “And for me, the child will be the tour guide. I will listen, I will follow, but if I have a question, I will probe and get information.”



First: Puppets hang along a wall at Mi Escuelita on May 5, 2025. Last: Puppet Wally sits with students during the school’s graduation ceremony on June 11, 2025. Puppets are used to act out scenarios that help students learn about different emotions and how they can interact with others.
At Mi Escuelita, every student participates in individual therapy sessions with clinicians. Therapy with a child can look different than a session with an adult. Rather than sitting and talking about feelings, therapists at Mi Escuelita play with the students and patiently look for clues or signs of deeper emotions. 
“Usually there is a theme and some of the things that are common are protection, safety, empowerment or the superhero; bad and evil,”  said Puffelis. “So as a therapist, I look for that. This is a continuum theme and if there’s changes in the home environment, that theme plays out in play therapy.”


In between those one-on-one sessions, therapists lead small group sessions where they teach aspects of a program called Incredible Years that helps students learn about feelings and how they can regulate them. These sessions can involve activities such as reading books, discussing different types of feelings or using puppets to act out a scenario that may help unlock emotions. 
Wally, a puppet with curly black hair, is part of the program. He has a special place in the school’s annual graduation ceremonies. Every year, a member of the school staff holds the puppet so it can “walk” with the kids.

Generations of domestic violence
Gibot has experienced domestic violence throughout her life. Growing up, she saw her parents and other family members deal with the same issues. 
At Mi Escuelita, Gibot benefitted from some of the mental health services offered to families of students. She received therapy and attended parent engagement meetings where she learned tips on how to support James, such as using physical touch to regulate his body and using more words of affirmation to build his self-esteem. 
Within six months, Gibot began to notice improvements in his behavior. She said she wishes more schools were set up like Mi Escuelita to spare families red tape and having to navigate through a variety of specialists at different locations. 
“Ideally, the norm should be like Mi Escuelita, especially since there’s so many kids who could benefit from it,” she said.
Teacher Viviana Vasquez works with students during class at Mi Escuelita in San Diego on April 23, 2025. All staff at Mi Escuelita are required to complete a 40-hour training offered by SBCS to help equip them with the knowledge and skills needed to support survivors of domestic violence, such as learning how it can affect children.
What happens after Mi Escuelita?
When students leave Mi Escuelita, they enter school districts that may offer some mental health services or intervention, but usually not as hands-on as they are used to. If a teacher or staff member believes a student may be dealing with mental health related issues, they can recommend that the student see a school counselor or social worker. From there, school officials can refer the family of the student to outside health providers offered by community organizations or local county health services.


Hilaria Bauer, chief early learning services officer at the Bay Area nonprofit early learning organization Kidango, said other educators are beginning to embrace concepts from Mi Escuelita’s approach, especially after the COVID-19 pandemic.
“As we came back to classrooms and to more regular types of activities, you begin to see how that isolation, that trauma affected our families and the children,” she said.
But building the unique learning environment SBCS created at Mi Escuelita may be challenging to replicate. 
“It’s such a wonderful idea and it’s such a powerful idea. I’m assuming it’s also a very expensive idea,” said Bauer. 





Students participate in a graduation ceremony at Mi Escuelita in San Diego on June 11, 2025. 
The cost of operating Mi Escuelita is $1.3 million each year; it’s funded by a mix of local, state and federal sources, as well as private donors, according to SBCS. 
On top of funding, Bauer says finding the right staffing is another hurdle to take into consideration. For instance, it can be difficult to find teachers who have the required license to provide therapy in addition to having classroom experience.  
Still, Bauer says policymakers can benefit in the long run from implementing certain concepts offered at Mi Escuelita. Research seems to back her assessment. Another UC San Diego study, which tracked the performance of students over several years, showed those who attended Mi Escuelita tended to score at the same level or sometimes higher in math, reading and writing compared to other students in the Chula Vista Elementary School District.
“We can spend less later on intervention programs and alternative facilities,” Bauer said. “There will be less truancy, less big behaviors or expulsions or alternative programs, and all of those ‘fix’ initiatives if we really focus on the time in the life of a child that really makes a change.”
Students perform a song during a graduation ceremony at Mi Escuelita in San Diego on June 11, 2025. 
James started kindergarten in August and celebrated his birthday in September. He’s doing well, Gibot said.
As he prepared for kindergarten, Gibot said she worried about what might happen. Klemp assured her that she and James would continue to receive support from SBCS. That made her feel more confident. 
“He’s learned a lot and gained skills that I wish I was able to teach him. But you know, we both learned,” she said.
James was one of the students who graduated from Mi Escuelita in May. Gibot, sitting with the rest of the attendees at the ceremony, watched as her son performed songs with his fellow classmates, cheered for his friends and received a small diploma.
“It was just really emotional for me. I’m like ‘Wow. He’s not scared. He’s not feeling all these different emotions,’” she said. “He just did it all by himself. And just seeing that independence grow, it’s just beautiful.”

Gavin Newsom signed a law requiring lawmakers to disclose when they’ve gotten a new job. Will it uncover corruption?","In summary
After a CalMatters report, Gov. Gavin Newsom signed a law requiring lawmakers to disclose when they’ve gotten a new job. Will it uncover corruption?


California’s elected and appointed officials will now have to tell the public when they’ve accepted a job offer from a new employer that might seek favors from them while they’re still in a position of power.
Gov. Gavin Newsom earlier this month signed Assembly Bill 1286 by Democratic Assemblymember Tasha Boerner of Solana Beach. The measure requires California’s elected officials and state appointees to note on mandatory conflict of interest forms whether they’ve gotten a new job before their term in office ends.
Boerner introduced the measure in response to a CalMatters story last year that highlighted how lawmakers were not required to tell the public if they were negotiating or had accepted a job with an organization trying to get something from the Legislature. 
“People’s distrust of the government is growing,” Boerner said in a statement after the bill was presented to Newsom. “As public servants, one of the most important parts of our job is transparency. It is the one-way ticket to building confidence between government officials and their communities.”
Shery Yang, a spokesperson for the California Fair Political Practices Commission, which enforces California’s ethics laws, said Chairperson Adam Silver proposed the bill idea to Boerner’s office after reading CalMatters’ story. 
Under the new law, officials must now provide the commission with the date they accept a job offer, the position they’re going to take and a description of what their employer does, as well as their employer’s name and address. Boerner’s bill passed the Legislature without any lawmaker voting against it. 
The CalMatters report came as around a quarter of the Legislature was leaving office. Some lawmakers were searching for their next job while still casting votes, potentially on matters that could benefit their future employers. 
Of the 180 lawmakers who left office since 2012, the story noted, around 40 registered as lobbyists, worked as political consultants or took executive-level jobs with companies or organizations actively lobbying at the Capitol.

It’s illegal and considered bribery for a government official to cast votes or do other official favors in exchange for a promise of future employment. It’s also illegal for officials to use state resources to search for or secure a new job.
Lawmakers also are supposed to recuse themselves from any official actions that have “direct and significant” financial impact on an entity with whom they are negotiating employment or who has made them an employment offer,” according to a legislative ethics committee handout.
But state ethics guidelines still allow lawmakers to vote on bills that could benefit a prospective employer, allowing them to discuss and vote on bills that would benefit a “significant segment” of an industry rather than their specific would-be employer.
In practice, that means a lawmaker with a job pending at a major tech company can continue to vote on legislation that impacts all tech companies.
Government ethics experts told CalMatters last year that adding disclosure requirements for job-hunting lawmakers would add needed transparency and help keep lawmakers and lobbyists honest.
FPPC Chairperson Silver called the measure “an important step forward for transparency and accountability in the political process.”
“This reform is about something bigger than disclosure forms — it is about trust,” he said in a statement. “It guarantees that Californians know their government is working for them, not for private interests. And more practically, it ensures that the FPPC has the information necessary to timely and effectively identify and prosecute violations of the state’s ban on influencing prospective employment.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/091225_End-Of-Session_FG_27.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-10-16 08:56:50.382962

Jessica Ordaz
Jessica Ordaz is an associate professor of ethnic studies at the University of Colorado Boulder. She is the author of “The Shadow of El Centro: A History of Migrant Incarceration and Solidarity.”


I keep thinking about José René Flores, a Los Angeles resident incarcerated at a Southern California migrant detention facility in the 1980s. The El Centro Immigration Detention Facility, where immigration agents sent Flores, has a long and deep history of brutality. 
But Flores’ story is not just one of violence and violation. It is also a story of protest and solidarity — reflective of a larger lineage of resistance from inside detention, including the people the Trump administration is currently working to silence and disappear. They’ve risked their “rightless” lives with the hope that the world might learn about the inhumane conditions behind detention walls, and that they might be free. 
Flores migrated to the United States from El Salvador in 1980, after being attacked by members of his homeland’s National Guard, a paramilitary organization known for committing atrocities during the Salvadoran Civil War. As a teenager, he was targeted for his involvement in a factory trade union and for participating in the revolutionary organization Frente de Acción Popular Unificada.
“There was terrible repression in El Salvador,” Flores told me when I interviewed him several years ago. “I was criminalized for having long hair and black glasses. Just looking different and being young meant you were a criminal, marijuanero, guerillero and a drug addict.” 
When Flores arrived in Los Angeles, he was apprehended by Immigration and Naturalization Service officials, who transported him to El Centro, because he chose to apply for political asylum. The detention center, located in California’s Imperial Valley, was built to incarcerate unauthorized Mexican men and those convicted of deportable crimes in 1945. By the time Flores got there, it had evolved from a small camp into a large-scale facility with a deep history of labor exploitation, physical abuse and surveillance. 
INS officials forced Flores and his fellow detained migrants to work as low-paid and sometimes unpaid laborers, limited their access to low-nutrient food and medical care, and oversaw a climate of physical and psychological intimidation. 
Flores and a few other Salvadoran migrants decided to fight back. All of us felt the same, said Flores: “Offended. Mistreated. We wanted to tell each other not to be sad. That we were all in this together.”

In 1981, they began a 15-day hunger strike. Their refusal to eat and the use of their bodies to protest called out the violence of the state, making the public aware of the punitive nature of detention.
Due to the protest and the efforts of the immigrant aid group Concilio Manzo, the INS released Flores from the facility that same year. 
Soon after, in 1985, a much larger hunger strike at El Centro made international news. Fifteen migrants from around the world organized an eight-day hunger strike. Between 175 and 300 incarcerated men participated, demanding that their grievances be heard. 
While official INS accounts asserted that the detention center functioned simply as an administrative holding site where people waited for their deportation hearings, the stories the strikers shared with lawyers and the media framed the detention center as a site of punishment. 
The protestors also publicized an important factor missing from the INS narrative: why many Central Americans had migrated to the U.S. in the first place. A number of the protestors came because they had been persecuted in their home countries for fighting back against repressive Latin American regimes funded by U.S. tax dollars.
The 1985 strike resulted in further repression from INS officers. But it also helped shift the narrative around detention in the public eye, even as the U.S. continued to incarcerate immigrants and asylum seekers at sites such as the Krome Service Processing Center in Florida, the Port Isabel Detention Center in Texas, and Guantanamo Bay in Cuba under both Democratic and Republican administrations. 
Acts of protest from people behind detention walls have never stopped. In the coming decades, migrants have demanded that lawyers and immigrant rights organizations hear and document their stories, filed class action lawsuits, and staged acts of defiance, like refusing to eat or work to challenge the cruelty of the state. 
Dissent continues under “Trump’s Reign of Terror.” At the end of September, for instance, 19 incarcerated migrants commenced a hunger strike inside Louisiana’s Angola prison, Camp J, calling for basic standards of care, such as prescription medication, toilet paper and clean water. 
Such acts of resistance and refusal from the inside show that, despite carceral efforts to control, isolate, and strip migrants of their humanity, people will continue to find ways to fight back.

But one thing about the protest in Downtown Las Vegas will be the same: Demonstrators will again be kept off the streets themselves and confined to sidewalks, in part because of the high cost of permits.
Jacob Valentine, a staff attorney with the ACLU of Nevada, worried that high permitting costs are being put in place “to try to limit first amendment activity.”
“I think what the city needs to remember is that this is people’s First Amendment rights and their right to protest,” he said. “If they want to be involved and make sure those protests go a certain way they need to be more accommodating to people.”
Indivisible is organizing the “No Kings” rally, one of several taking place in Southern Nevada, Saturday at 11 a.m.  in front of the Federal Courthouse, the same location the rally took place in June.
In the last few months, Trump has sent National Guard to numerous U.S. cities, told military leaders that cities will be used as training grounds to combat “the invasion from within” and ordered the Department of Justice to prosecute political enemies. All these actions have pushed the country “so much past the line of fascism,” Osborne said.
“I think this is a defining moment in this country, the city and this world to ask which side of history are you going to be on?” she said.
Though they want to take to the streets to engage in their constitutional rights to protests, Osborne is aware that while the Vegas heat has cooled, political and cultural temperatures are especially high. 
To ensure a safe event, Osborne said Indivisible has had numerous conversations with Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department and City of Las Vegas officials to ensure everything goes smoothly.
As they sought to get a permit and inquired about the costs to shut down the streets, which could limit some interactions with law enforcement and allow participants easier movement among and within the crowd, Osborne said they were told it would cost $20,000.
“It would have been great if we could have closed down the street,” she said. “The planning for that and the type of money that that takes is just not something a small grassroots group” can afford
When asked about the amount by Nevada Current, LVMPD said it wasn’t sure where the figure came from, and officials didn’t “recall giving number cost for staffing” to organizers, said Sergeant Jakob Shallenberger, a spokesman for LVMPD.
To obtain a basic permit without shutting down the street costs $265 according to Jace Radke, a spokesman for the City of Las Vegas. But that still restricts organizers to stay on the sidewalks. 
“If a street is being closed there will need to be a barricade plan ($50 city fee) and the organizers will have to pay the cost of the barricades through a barricade company,” Radke said. “The Metro Police Special Events team reviews all special event permit applications, and they determine if there are additional security needs.” 
Radke said the $20,000 figure didn’t come from the city. LVMPD said while it does coordinate with the city “I don’t know how the city calculates the cost of a permit or staffing needs,” Shallenberger said. 
Meanwhile, when it comes to being protest-friendly, Las Vegas is “better than some cities, but there is more work to be done,” said Valentine with the ACLU. 
“The city and law enforcement could always be doing a better job to accommodate First Amendment protestors,” he said.
At the last protest there were nearly 100 arrests, though the overwhelming majority were dropped. The ACLU of Nevada at the time said a majority of those arrested were for things like sitting on the sidewalk. 
LVMPD Sheriff Kevin McMahill told 8 News Now in a recent interview that most of the charges dropped were “partly our fault because there are so many people getting arrested in a chaotic situation.” He said the LVMPD is looking to resubmit evidence against those arrested seeking further legal action. 
“It’s telling that there were 90 citations at a protest and … less than five are going through and being tried,” Valentine said. “All the rest have been dismissed. I think it’s telling that there might be a need for the city to accommodate protests of this size.” 
In addition to legal observers, Indivisible recruits volunteer “safety marshals” to help ensure people stay on sidewalks and there are clear pathways for people to walk. The group also relies on “de-escalators that have been trained in very specific techniques of how to bring the temperature down,” Osborne said. 
“I think tensions are higher, certainly, and we’re doing everything we can to make sure that we create a safe event,” Osborne said. “We don’t want the police, you know, arresting people for exercising their First Amendment rights.”
In addition to the morning rally at the courthouse, there are eight “No Kings” events scheduled throughout the state:

10 a.m. in Henderson;
4:30 p.m. in front of New York New York on the Strip;
10 a.m. in Mesquite;
10 a.m. in Pahrump;
10 a.m. in Hawthorne;
8:30 a.m. in Carson City;
11 a.m. in Reno;
12 p.m. in Elko.

“What we need is 3.5% of the population to engage in mass noncooperation and civil disobedience. Those are the kind of things that topple dictators,” Osborne said, citing a figure from historians and political scientists who study civil resistance movements. “And we certainly got a dictator wannabe to be sitting in the White House.”",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/DSC06785-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-16 08:56:50.382962
,CommonWealth Beacon,2025-10-16 12:11:22+00:00,CommonWealth Beacon,‘Contactless’ fares quickly grow popular among T riders,Chris Lisinski,,,,,https://commonwealthbeacon.org/transportation/contactless-fares-quickly-grow-popular-among-t-riders/,"MBTA riders long wanted the agency to catch up with its peers and provide a way to pay fares that didn’t involve CharlieCards or vending machines. After the first year, data show many commuters are embracing the new option.","IF YOU POLLED a full rush-hour train or bus across the MBTA system, odds are that at least one in four riders aboard would not have touched a CharlieCard in the past several months. 
It’s been a bit more than a year since the T rolled out the ability to tap a credit card or mobile wallet to get onto the core subway and bus systems, and the new system has quickly become popular with passengers. 
Through the first 12 months of the offering, the share of fares paid using the “contactless” system grew from less than 10 percent to more than 25 percent. That’s close to the same share as “stored value” taps, or when a rider puts a set dollar amount on a CharlieCard or CharlieTicket but does not buy a weekly or monthly pass. The remaining roughly 50 percent of trips involve those time-based passes or other options, such as T employees. 
 So in other words, by late spring, just about as many riders were turning to Apple Pay, Google Wallet and credit cards as were loading up their trusty old CharlieCards with a set dollar amount. 
MBTA leaders and watchdogs alike are pleased with the uptake so far, describing it as a sign of success for an initiative meant to modernize the system and cater to an increasingly digital public. 
“The approach that [MBTA General Manager] Phil Eng and his team are taking is much more reality-based and designed to meet people where they are, not where the T would like them to be,” said Brian Kane, executive director of the MBTA Advisory Board, which represents cities and towns who help fund the transit system. “The ability to use your phone or use a credit card is obviously ubiquitous in today’s society.” 
In August 2024, the first month with the new payment options live to all passengers, about 904,000 of the roughly 10.9 million taps on the MBTA came from so-called contactless sources such as mobile wallets.  Nearly 4.4 million taps that month involved what the T calls “stored value,” or a CharlieCard or CharlieTicket loaded with a set dollar amount rather than a weekly or monthly pass. 
Those two offerings have been on opposite trends since then. By July 2025, the most recent month with data available, about 3.17 million trips involved contactless taps, just a shade below the 3.26 million trips using stored value taps. 
T leaders think the added ease of payment has been one factor among several contributing to stronger fare collections. While the MBTA — like most other transit agencies around the country — continues to struggle with depleted ridership in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, it hauled in $38 million more from fares in fiscal year 2025 than budget-writers forecast. 
Eng, the T’s top boss, said he personally witnessed tourists board buses and trains without paying because they could not find a fare vending machine and did not have cash on hand. 
“We do believe that this is definitely helping new riders [and] visitors pay into our system, whereas before, perhaps they might not have been paying,” Eng told CommonWealth Beacon. “We also know that contactless has become such an easy way of payment, whether you’re riding the T, going to a store, going to get a cup of coffee. People are using that.” 
“It’s just more the norm, not having to stop at a [fare vending] machine if you choose not to,” he added. 
While the newest method has grown quickly, a plurality of riders continue to rely on other methods such as weekly and monthly passes. 
That’s likely a financial decision for many riders: contactless taps are convenient, but they also charge à la carte for each ride. Someone who knows they will travel enough in a certain span of time can pay less overall by purchasing an unlimited pass. 
Some other networks, including NYC Transit, have more advanced contactless systems in place that track each user and automatically cap what they pay once they hit the breakeven point for a given period. 
Eng said “all of those [options] are on the table,” but he declined to commit to any timeline for implementing fare-capping at the MBTA. His team is weighing several variables, including whether the change would shift some monthly passholders — who contribute a sizable chunk of fare revenue — to less-impactful single taps. 
“If we offer a product that we think many people would really enjoy, I want to make sure that I can keep that product, and it’s not just a pilot for six months, it is something that we’re ready to do, we’re ready to keep,” he said. 
After extensive delays and a ballooning budget hit previous fare overhaul attempts, the T launched the contactless payment system on subways, buses and trolleys in August 2024. The option expanded to ferries last summer. 
The T recently ramped up its efforts to prevent fare evasion with new civilian teams monitoring the systems. Riders face warnings and then fines for failing to pay. 
Officials are also testing several other tweaks to the fare-collection system this fall, including new fare vending machines in Orange Line stations, online accounts for users, and the option to acquire a digital CharlieCard. 
Eng compared the new ways to pay to the extensive repair campaign the T mounted to eliminate slow zones. Both, he said, tackled issues that had persisted for years with little progress visible to the public. 
“The contactless [project] is just one of many where we’re demonstrating that we’re a different T, that we are looking to really make wise investments and make sure that when we do deliver something, it’s useful and what the public has been asking for,” he said. 
Kane, who has been critical of past MBTA attempts to overhaul its fare system, said the relative success of contactless payments should encourage agency leaders to focus on “interoperability.” 
“The less customized, the better,” he said. “Using off-the-shelf technology allows people to use what they’re used to and it just makes it more seamless. People don’t care who the provider of their trips is. They just want to get where they’re going. The more we can do to make it easy and seamless, the better.”",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/taptopay-scaled.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-10-16 08:56:50.382962

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)Utah’s Republican Party is writing a plot twist into the last act of the state’s redistricting case.  
As a deadline approaches to firm up boundaries for 2026, the Utah GOP launched a push Tuesday to block a map proposed by the Legislature and repeal a 2018 redistricting law.
The map from lawmakers is the least competitive for Democrats out of four options they considered after a judge struck down boundaries they drew in 2021, saying they came about unconstitutionally. 
Lawmakers’ proposed map was also endorsed by the Utah GOP just two weeks ago. But on Tuesday, Chairman Rob Axson filed a petition with Utah’s elections office for a referendum asking voters to reject the plan. Per state code, a group has 30 days to gather signatures from 8% of Utah voters — about 140,000 — including 8% of the voters in at least 15 of the state’s 29 Senate districts.

The map in question is one of three options on the table before a judge who has less than a month to make a final selection. The lieutenant governor, who is Utah’s top election official, set a deadline of Nov. 10. 
The move could drag the process into legally murky territory. If a referendum gets enough signatures, Lt. Gov. Deidre Henderson is required to put a stay on the law set to be referred to voters.
In an interview Tuesday, Henderson said voters and candidates deserve a degree of certainty, and this adds more uncertainty to “an already tricky situation.”
Asked what her biggest fear is, Henderson replied: “That we won’t have maps when we need them, or that we’ll have to change in the middle of a process. We’re walking down some roads that have not been tread before. That is concerning from an election administration standpoint.”
Axson did not comment in response to requests from Utah News Dispatch on Tuesday.

The two other maps are being pitched by voting rights groups who sued the state over the 2021 maps: the League of Women Voters of Utah, Mormon Women for Ethical Government, the Campaign Legal Center and some Salt Lake County voters. 
“It’s frustrating, it’s disappointing, and I just don’t understand,” said Elizabeth Rasmussen, executive director of Better Boundaries, the group behind the 2018 initiative creating an independent redistricting commission. “It’s honestly like one of the last things in their toolbox for them to really get rid of this law that they don’t like, and so we’re still going to be operating on all levels, through any means necessary.”
The Utah GOP is also seeking the repeal of Proposition 4, a 2018 voter-approved ballot initiative setting up an independent redistricting commission. Axson filed an application for an indirect initiative that would require roughly 70,000 signatures – or 4% of active registered voters – in at least 26 of Utah’s 29 state Senate districts, and by Nov. 15, before it can go to the Legislature for approval. 
A judge reinstated Proposition 4 this year, ruling lawmakers overstepped their constitutional authority when they turned the commission into an advisory body that lawmakers could ignore. That ruling also voided the state’s congressional boundaries last drawn in 2021, deeming them the result of an unconstitutional process.

Lawmakers have taken steps to require insurers to keep more accurate directories of doctors and specialists, but state rules still aren’t complete, and penalties are rare.


Mary Kuhn went to the emergency room at John Muir Medical Center because it felt like she was having a heart attack. Her chest and jaw hurt. Her tongue was numb. Instead of confirming a heart attack, testing later ordered by a cardiologist revealed a shocking diagnosis. 
Kuhn had a massive hiatal hernia that required surgery. Her entire stomach had pushed into her chest cavity through an opening in the diaphragm, a muscle that divides the torso, and was wrapped around itself. In the crowded space, her esophagus was bent and twisted. If the entwined organs kept rotating further, they could cut off their own blood supply. 
That could be fatal.  
On the hunt for a specialist, Kuhn ran into a problem that plagues many California patients: Doctors listed in her health insurer’s directory didn’t actually accept her insurance. She had encountered a “ghost network.” 
Ghost networks are a longstanding problem in California that advocates and lawmakers have tried to fix for more than a decade. Patients searching for primary care, physical or mental health therapy or specialty care discover that the lists of in-network providers published by insurance companies are frequently inaccurate or outdated — by some estimates a third or more of these listings may be inaccurate. Phone numbers and addresses may be wrong. Most frustrating is when listed providers no longer contract with a patient’s insurance company.
“We’ve been hearing for years from consumers, stories about how hard it is to find a provider,” said Katie Van Deynze, a lobbyist with Health Access California, a consumer advocacy group that has worked to improve provider directories. 
But insurers and providers oppose efforts to further regulate directories and blame each other for inaccuracies.
Kuhn’s primary care physician referred her to a cardiothoracic surgeon in Walnut Creek. That surgeon appeared in Blue Shield of California’s online directory of providers. Kuhn met with him in November and scheduled the surgery for January, she said.
Before that could happen, in December 2024, Blue Shield sent Kuhn a denial letter refusing to pay for the surgeon’s services, stating the doctor was “not in your health plan,” according to correspondence shared with CalMatters.
“I thought that’s a mistake. Of course he’s in-network, I see him there,” Kuhn said.
In a statement, Blue Shield spokesperson Mark Seelig said the company could not comment on an individual patient’s case, but defended its provider directory.

“Blue Shield rigorously validates its provider directory according to state and federal regulations. Providers must update and attest to their information every 90 days, and Blue Shield publishes changes within 48 hours and conducts regular audits,” Seelig said.
Patients need to select online the correct plan, provider group and location for the most accurate directory results, Seelig said.
This Oct. 10, nearly a year after Kuhn first encountered this issue, the physician was still listed as an in-network provider. A representative from the physician’s office confirmed to CalMatters that he is not part of the Blue Shield network.
Lawmakers struggle to fix errors
Lawmakers took steps 10 years ago to help patients more easily find in-network medical care, but the resulting rules are incomplete and underenforced. Bureaucracy and fierce industry opposition have blocked significant reform.
Anecdotally, patients struggle with inaccurate directory results every day, even when trying to find a primary care doctor, Health Access lobbyist Van Deynze said. As a result people delay care; conditions get worse; some even give up. 
“This is a really big barrier,” Van Deynze said.
During a legislative hearing earlier this year, Assembly Majority Leader Cecilia Aguiar-Curry told fellow lawmakers that health insurer directories have “significant error rates” despite existing law that requires them to publish accurate information.
The state has failed to enforce that 2015 law, she said, issuing “small penalties” to profitable insurers.
“There’s virtually no incentive for health plans to fix this problem,” Aguiar-Curry said.
The Department of Managed Health Care, which regulates most California health insurers, has issued eight penalties totaling $152,500 under the 2015 law. The largest penalty was $75,000, and the smallest was $5,000, according to data from the department.
In a statement, spokesperson Rachel Arrezola defended the regulatory agency’s oversight of plan directories.
“The Department uses its full authority to actively monitor health plan compliance with the provider directory standards in the law, and takes enforcement action, including administrative penalties, when plans violate the law,” Arrezola said.
Attempts to add more stringent enforcement requirements, however, keep stalling in the Legislature.
Three days before the end of the legislative session this year, Aguiar-Curry withdrew a bill that would have required directories to be 95% accurate by July 2029. That bill also would have authorized state insurance regulators to levy heftier fines on insurers that did not meet the accuracy benchmark. 
Gibson Martucci, a spokesperson for Aguiar-Curry, said the Department of Managed Health Care gave the lawmaker “late feedback” on the legislation that required Aguiar-Curry to convert it into a two-year bill. Part of the reason, Martucci said in a statement, was that the department is creating regulations authorized by the 2015 law that will be finalized soon.
Aguiar-Curry intends to revive the legislation in January once the department’ s regulations are finished, Martucci said.

“After more than a decade of consumer frustration, only binding timelines, real enforcement, and structural changes will deliver the improvements consumers need to access care,” Martucci said. 
Arrezola said the regulatory agency did not ask Aguiar-Curry to pull the bill. The department refused an interview request, pointing to the pending regulations. Those regulations aim to standardize the information that insurers need to publish in directories, including types of contact information, whether a provider is accepting new patients, and the date in which the directory was last updated.
“Adding a new, and duplicative auditing and verification process, to the provider directory, while pending rulemaking is occurring would conflict with work underway,” Arrezola said in a statement.
Zoe Bulls, a former intern with the Consumer Protection Policy Center at the University of San Diego who has closely watched the rulemaking process, said Aguiar-Curry’s bill went further than the department’s proposed regulations. 
“There’s obviously gaps in the efficacy of those standards, because we still don’t have highly accurate provider directories,” Bulls said.
Kuhn also said the pending regulations seemed weak.
Delays and denials lead to worse outcomes
The first time Kuhn met with the cardiothoracic surgeon, her condition was already perilous. 
He told her if she ever felt the need to vomit but was physically unable to do so, she needed to go to the emergency room right away. That would be a sign that her stomach was so twisted it required emergency surgery.
Kuhn told him she had already experienced that symptom twice.
He looked at Kuhn and said “You’re very lucky,” she recounted.
Still, it would be six months before Kuhn was able to get the operation following Blue Shield’s denial.
State law requires health insurers to cover out-of-network providers as if they were in-network if there are no other available providers. It also requires insurers to honor their directory that lists in-network providers. State and federal law also allow patients to appeal decisions made by insurers.
In the denial letter reviewed by CalMatters, Blue Shield stated that two in-network providers were qualified to perform the operation.

Neither could do what the specialist said was necessary, according to Kuhn and medical records reviewed by CalMatters. A thoracic surgeon who told Kuhn his expertise was in lung surgery said he couldn’t perform the operation. The other provider, a general surgeon, explained he could only perform part of the operation. He told Kuhn he would enter her abdomen and pull the stomach down, but wouldn’t address her twisted esophagus or fully fix the herniated diaphragm. So Kuhn appealed Blue Shield’s decision.
An appeal letter sent from the cardiothoracic surgeon’s office supporting Kuhn stated that “surgery was urgently needed due to her hernia being so large.” 
For months, as the appeals process played out, Kuhn’s health deteriorated. She experienced headaches, nausea and fatigue. Her heart raced at random times. She could hardly eat any food. Breathing and swallowing were difficult. Blue Shield said in a letter to Kuhn that her condition did not qualify for an expedited grievance review.
Blue Shield would deny her appeal twice.
Before all of this, Kuhn loved to walk and swim. She spent hours in the garden, carrying bags of mulch and working with her hands. As her health declined, her active life vanished. A group at Kuhn’s church in Lafayette prayed weekly that she would be able to get her operation.
By the time Kuhn went into surgery in June, her left lung had partially collapsed and a portion of the hernia had attached to her aorta.
“Think of what that general surgeon would have done to reach up and pull the stomach down. If he had, he would have ruptured my aorta,” Kuhn said.
Patients struggle nationwide with directory errors
It’s hard to know how many patients run into issues with ghost networks, but Google searches are often more accurate than provider directories, according to a nationwide assessment from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, which looked at states’ efforts to improve directories. 
The most recent study on provider directories in California looked at data for all managed care plans over two years, 2018 and 2019. That study found that accuracy generally improved year over year, but many errors still persisted. 
For the state’s primary care providers in 2019, commercial plans had inaccurate information 24% of the time. Inaccuracies were generally worse among specialties, with 32% of endocrinology listings having wrong information.
On average about 50 people submit complaints about provider directories to the Department of Managed Health Care each year, according to data from the department. Patient advocates, however, say that’s an undercount because most people don’t know they can file complaints with the state or give up altogether. 
Industry groups say they support the goal of having accurate directories. In a letter to lawmakers from the California Association of Health Plans and the Association of California Life and Health Insurance Companies, the groups wrote that they want providers to share in the responsibility for maintaining accurate records. 
Plans spend more than $2 billion annually to maintain directories, they argue, and insurers can’t reliably update information if doctors and other providers don’t tell them when they’ve moved practices or dropped insurance. They also want state regulators to share in the role of ensuring directories are accurate. They oppose Aguiar-Curry’s legislation.
“It’s a matter of ensuring that providers and health plans are held to the same standards,” said Mary Ellen Grant, a spokesperson for the California Association of Health Plans. 
Kuhn’s insurer, Blue Shield, did not take a position on the bill but said the company was “committed to a comprehensive solution that increases accountability and ensures members can easily find in-network care.”
For their part, groups representing doctors, dentists and other providers also oppose the legislation, arguing that insurers are the ones responsible for maintaining the directories.
Major opponents have given more than $5.2 million to California legislators since 2015, according to the CalMatters Digital Democracy database.
The disagreement leaves patients like Kuhn in the lurch.
“From the patient’s perspective everything is so darn confusing,” Kuhn said. “The provider directory is a critical tool but if it is not maintained it is useless and increases the stress and difficulty of getting health care.” 
Reviewers frequently overturn insurance decisions
Kuhn sought an independent medical review at the advice of the U.S. Department of Labor, which regulates her plan. The reviewers agreed with her and overturned Blue Shield’s denials.
The reviewers wrote that Blue Shield should approve the cardiothoracic surgeon Kuhn wanted to perform the surgery because there were no other in-network providers who could do the operation.
The decision letter, reviewed by CalMatters, states that Kuhn had a “very complex” and “severe” condition that required a highly trained thoracic surgeon to correct. “This procedure should not be performed by a general surgeon” as Blue Shield suggested, reviewers wrote.

Kuhn should also only be responsible for regular in-network cost sharing, the decision states.
That letter allowed Kuhn to schedule her surgery, a relief after so many months. She had grown so weak that she couldn’t change the sheets on the bed without feeling faint. One time she even passed out.
A week before the surgery, Kuhn received a letter saying again that the cardiothoracic surgeon was not part of the Blue Shield of California network and that she could be responsible for paying his whole fee out-of-pocket. It was $258,000.
In a panic, she called the surgeon’s office and spoke to a patient advocate who assured her that she wouldn’t have to pay that amount. She was protected from “balance billing” by the No Surprises Act, which prohibits providers from charging patients for out-of-network services in certain situations.
Kuhn said she believes the warning letter was a scare tactic to get her to cancel the surgery.
“They delayed, they denied and then they tried to scare me,” she said.
By that time she felt like her body was giving out, and she went through with the surgery.
Today, Kuhn feels better than she has in years. Her asthma has improved. She can eat a full meal. She can go on a walk without becoming short of breath. Her heart no longer races. There’s no pain. Her church prayer group was elated.  
“I knew my life depended on not giving up,” Kuhn said. “If I had listened to their threats, I would have died.”

(Getty)A Birmingham charter school that opened with a mission toward LGBTQ+ youth will stay open another five years after the Alabama Public Charter School Commission approved its renewal application on Wednesday.
Magic City Acceptance Academy (MCAA), located in Homewood, opened in 2021 as the state’s only LGBTQ+ friendly charter school. MCAA currently serves over 300 students. The school was attacked by Republican gubernatorial candidate Tim James during the 2022 campaign for the Republican gubernatorial nomination, which led the school to increase security amid fears from students. 
The approval followed a debate among the commissioners over shortening the renewal to three years and comments from school officials that appeared to suggest they had downplayed the school’s outreach to LGBTQ+ children. 
The debate over renewal centered around SB 129. The law, passed in 2024, prohibits state agencies, local boards of education and higher learning institutions from sponsoring programs that are based on diversity, equity and inclusion or “divisive concepts.”
Patton Furman, principal and superintendent of MCAA, said Wednesday the school has been in compliance with the law.
“We have had to do things like repaint in certain areas, right? And I’ll just say the thing that, we’re all thinking, and that is that we have had rainbows in our building because we are referring to all people. And at some point our mission did include a segment that said we are affirming to LGBTQ people,” Furman said to the commissioners. “We are still affirming to all people, but we have taken that out. We are affirming to all people. We are affirming to our black students, we are affirming to our Hispanic students, we are affirming to our LGBTQ students, which are in every school in the state. So we have taken measures to not to not be divisive, and to embrace all of the students that we have in front of us.”
MCAA has also changed its logo, as well as maps inside the school, which identify the Gulf of Mexico as the Gulf of America, the name President Donald Trump has attempted to use. 
“Those are the things that we have been tasked to do to keep us from being quote, unquote divisive. So we are following the law to the letter, and we treat our students, every single one of them, regardless of what door they fit into in this world, we are embracing them all,” Furman said.
Commissioner Sharon Porterfield moved to approve MCAA for the three-year renewal, and a vote was in progress, until Commissioner Charles Knight pushed back saying he believed there should be a five-year renewal period for the school.
“They’ve got the financial support, they’ve got a good program, they’ve got the leadership. And again, we all agree that we’re trying to create environments where students are educated, and obviously they’re doing a good job of that,” Knight said, 
Commissioner Dorothy Hudson also agreed that the school should have the full five-year renewal.
“We’re not a local school board. When schools bring forth to us a legitimate proposal, and short of any major negatives or findings against their performance, why wouldn’t we present them with the option of five years to give them a chance to breathe and work forward to their growth and accomplishments?” Hudson asked.
With the renewal granted, Furman said MCAA will expand the school to add band and theater classrooms, administration and counseling offices, a green space in front of the school and added mental health services for students.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Classroom-e1675202619930-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-10-16 08:56:50.382962
,California,2025-10-16 12:01:00+00:00,CalMatters,Newsom did what he pledged to do to  jump-start housing production. Still no progress,Dan Walters,,,,,https://calmatters.org/commentary/2025/10/newsom-housing-production-progress-california/,Gov. Gavin Newsom took the steps he vowed to take to stimulate housing production. But housing start numbers have barely budged in eight years.,"Eight years ago, as he began his campaign for governor, Gavin Newsom described fixing the state’s chronic housing shortage as a moral imperative.
“This is a question of who we are,” Newsom wrote in 2017. “Housing is a fundamental human need — let’s not forget the human face behind the dire statistics.
“Housing instability can cause genuine mental and physical adversity,” he added, “and lead to insufferable decisions: no one should have to choose between paying rent or buying groceries. Knowing that too many Californians face this kind of anxiety breaks my heart.”
Newsom pledged that as governor he would lead the effort to develop 3.5 million new housing units by 2025, “because our solutions must be as bold as the problem is big.
“I realize building 3.5 million new housing units is an audacious goal,” Newsom continued, “but it’s achievable. There is no silver bullet to solve this crisis. We need to attack the problem on multiple fronts by generating more funding for affordable housing, implementing regulatory reform and creating new financial incentives for local jurisdictions that produce housing while penalizing those that fall short.”
The 3.5 million-unit goal was never anywhere near realistic. It would have required increasing construction from about 100,000 units a year when he made the pledge to more than 400,000, doubling peak production in this century.
That said, Newsom has over the almost seven years of his governorship, pretty much, done what he said he’d do to increase housing. He has signed multiple bills meant to speed up housing permits by eliminating state and local legal impediments, capped by two major measures this year.
Newsom signed Assembly Bill 130, which makes it more difficult to use the California Environmental Quality Act as a tool to block housing projects, and Senate Bill 79, which overrides local government land use authority to authorize multi-family, multi-story housing projects near transit stops.
Meanwhile Newsom’s Department of Housing and Community Development has set statewide goals of 180,000 new units a year and 2.5 million units over eight years. It also imposed ambitious quotas on local governments to designate land for residential development and cracked down on communities that impede multi-family projects for low- and moderate-income families.
The latter effort responds to the most acute aspect of California’s shortage — housing the nearly 35% of Californians who are living in poverty or near-poverty, mostly due to housing costs that are among the nation’s highest.
With the enactment of AB 130 and SB 79, the looming conclusion of Newsom’s governorship and the likelihood that he will run for president, it’s time to appraise results.
Has the production of housing in California substantially increased? Unfortunately, no.
At the time Newsom made his pledge, about 100,000 units were being built each year, with the net increase substantially lower due to losses by fire or destruction. Eight years later, it’s virtually unchanged, no matter which authority one consults.
The Census Bureau reports that between 2019, when Newsom took office, and 2024 new housing permits in California ranged from a high of 120,780 units in 2022 to a low of 101,546 last year. Newsom’s own budget agrees with the Census Bureau’s data for the same period and projects future construction through 2028 at 100,000 to 104,000 units a year.
Clearly, even though systemic barriers to housing construction have been eased, many developers have been unable to see housing in California as a good investment. The COVID-19 pandemic, which had massive economic impacts, and increases in interest rates to battle inflation also have had an effect.
Housing is far more complicated than Newsom depicted it when he made his promises. He gets a ‘B’ for effort — and an ‘F’ for results.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/101124-Temecula-Housing-KC-CM-03.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-10-16 08:56:50.382962

(Photo by Richard Bednarski/Nevada Current) The film tax credit legislation promising to be the featured attraction in an upcoming special session of the Nevada Legislature is a Democratic bill.
Both sponsors of the bill, which failed in the waning hours of the regular legislative session earlier this year, are Democrats. One of them chairs the Nevada State Democratic Party. 
So it was not a little incongruous Wednesday when a baker’s dozen of progressive organizations that often ally with Democrats on issues and causes called on Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo to save the state from the Democrats’ noxious movie studio bill.
“Nevada is staring down serious financial uncertainty,” the groups wrote in a letter to Lombardo. “Every dollar we lock into a corporate handout is a dollar we can’t put toward our rainy-day readiness, public education, healthcare, wildfire mitigation, housing, and the basic services Nevadans rely on when times get tight.”
That’s all true, by the way.
So why didn’t the groups also address their letter to Democratic legislative leaders?
“It is on Gov. Lombardo to outline what is included in a special session,” said Amber Falgout with Battle Born Progress, noting the letter specifically referred to an analysis prepared for the Governor’s Office of Economic Development (GOED) showing the film studio bill is a raw deal for the state.
That’s all true, too. 
As the analysis for GOED indicates, the film tax credit proposal is not only fiscal folly but an economic development non-starter that promises not more economic diversification but merely more of the same. (In fact, if Lombardo wants to do something far more useful for Nevada working families and Nevada’s economy in a special session, instead of reviving movie studio subsidies he should push the child care tax credit plan he only half-heartedly proposed earlier this year.)
And as Falgout notes, the state constitution says when a governor calls a special session he gets to specifically declare what subjects legislators can address.
But if Lombardo called a special session to create more Nevada-funded public welfare for rich Californians, and the bill didn’t pass, that would make Lombardo look weaker and more bumbling than any governor in modern memory. Even Jim Gibbons. Yes, the special session agenda is technically up to Lombardo and Lombardo alone. But as a practical matter, it’s nigh on inconceivable that Lombardo would put film tax credits at the heart of a special session unless he’s confident it has enough Democratic support to pass. 
It had enough to pass the bill out of the Assembly in May, when 15 Assembly Democrats, including Assembly Speaker Steve Yeager, voted with seven Republicans in favor of the tax credits. (11 Democrats and 9 Republicans were opposed.)
The bill then made it to the floor of the Senate, but only as the session was winding down and after Democratic Senate Majority Leader Nicolle Cannizzaro ordered up a special rule suspension to yank it out of a committee and plop it in front of the full Senate. During a late-session legislative pile-up, the clock literally ran out on the bill, which never did get a Senate floor vote.
But the largest public subsidy to the private sector in Nevada history came frighteningly close to becoming law. 
Yeager and Cannizzaro will still be in charge of the Assembly and Senate respectively next month when Lombardo is expected to call a special session.
Battle Born Progress, AFSCME, the Nevada State Education Association, the Progressive Leadership Alliance of Nevada,  and the nine other organizations that urged Lombardo to give film tax credits the boot Wednesday should likewise publicly urge Yeager and Cannizzaro to step away from the movie studio handout. It’s only fair.
And speaking of fairness, it is also only fair to note that each of the organizations signing the letter to Lombardo have opposed policies favored by Democratic legislative leaders more than once over the years, particularly with respect to corporate giveaways like the one today’s Democratic leadership appears poised to approve.
The progressive groups didn’t call out Democratic legislative leadership Wednesday. But there’s still time to energize their considerable influence and publicly shame, er, remind Yeager and Cannizzaro that corporate white guys in ties are not the only powerful Nevada Democratic constituency, and not the most important one.
But wait. It’s more than just a handout. It’s a tax break.
If enacted, the film tax credit would be a nauseating public subsidy to out-of-state corporations that don’t need public subsidies from a state that can’t afford to subsidize them.
So people have understandably focused on that.
But quietly tucked just beneath the bill’s abominable essence, lurking like a tiny little criminal, as it were, the bill would also grant tax breaks to some of Nevada’s largest and most powerful corporations, including the resort and mining industries’ biggest players.
To reiterate, here is how the film tax credits would work.

Let’s say the state issues Sony Pictures tax credits with a face value of $50 million.
Tax credits sell for less than face value (this is why corporations buy them). A discount of about 10% isn’t unusual. 
Some corporation in Nevada with a tax bill, let’s say MGM Resorts International, buys Sony’s $50 million in tax credits for $45 million in actual money. 
Instead of paying the state $50 million in gaming taxes that it owes, MGM gives the state the otherwise utterly worthless paper it bought from Sony that has the words “tax credits” on it.
Sony gets $45 million from MGM.
MGM gets a $5 million tax break.
And the state, which otherwise would have received $50 million in tax revenue from MGM, gets nothing.

Because of the way Nevada’s ditzy tax system is built, along with gaming and mining, insurance and banking are the other Nevada industries most likely to obtain state tax breaks by purchasing tax credits from California film corporations. 
The bill the Assembly passed earlier this year authorized $1.5 billion worth of tax credits over 15 years, and the lion’s share of that benefit would go to film corporations. But gaming, mining, et al., would also reap a not inconsiderable financial gain at the public’s expense.
Elected Nevada Democrats at all levels of government tend to be some of the most big-business-friendly Democrats in the nation.
So if the movie studio welfare bill is enacted during a special session, Democrats on the ballot next year should be more than happy to explain why, especially in these times, they voted to approve not only the biggest corporate handout in state history, but also tax breaks for large corporations in the process.
It’s their bill, after all.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/SteveYeager-NicoleCannizzaro-FabianDonate-1-scaled-e1760584111666-1024x686.jpg,,,2025-10-16 10:04:17.682684
,California,2025-10-16 12:00:00+00:00,CalMatters,This preschool serves kids with traumatic backgrounds. Here’s what researchers learned from them,Adriana Heldiz and Adam Ashton,,,,,https://calmatters.org/education/2025/10/mi-escuelita-preschool-programs/,Children with traumatic experiences who attend Mi Escuelita preschool in San Diego graduate ready for kindergarten and continue to do well in school for years.,"In summary
Children with traumatic experiences who attend Mi Escuelita preschool in San Diego graduate ready for kindergarten and continue to do well in school for years.


Almost 20 years ago a San Diego nonprofit created a preschool to focus on the “little guys” — children who experience domestic violence and other serious traumatic events before kindergarten. 
Today, Mi Escuelita is still going strong and it’s something of a model in showing other schools how to address childhood trauma.
Mi Escuelita provides services for kids in a single location that for most other families would require intricate coordination among multiple health care providers, educators and social programs. 
The children learn in a classroom that is always staffed with at least one therapist, they participate in one-on-one therapy, and join group therapy sessions. Their parents take part in special classes, too, where they learn ways to support their children.
Researchers from UC San Diego have paid close attention to Mi Escuelta and followed how its graduates fared after leaving the preschool. The university also works with the school to evaluate outcomes from each cohort of students. Here are four takeaways from those reports.
The kids leave ready for kindergarten
Students who graduate from Mi Escuelia outperform or do at least well as their peers in kindergarten, according to a UC San Diego analysis of their scores in reading and math tests.
It looked at kindergarten students in the Chula Vista Elementary School District from 2007 to 2013 and found a higher percentage of Mi Escuelita met math, reading and writing standards than the district’s general population.
That’s not a given because research shows that children exposed to domestic violence have lower verbal ability than their peers, which can set them back in school. 
And they do well for years
The length of UC San Diego’s study allowed its team to follow Mi Escuelita graduates through fifth grade. The results suggested that their preschool experience helped the kids throughout their childhoods. 
Their average scores on several standardized tests exceeded those of the general population at Chula Vista Elementary School District, especially in math.
“Taken together, the Mi Escuelita program demonstrates clear benefits to children who may otherwise fall quickly and unsparingly behind with regard to school readiness,” the UC San Diego researchers wrote. 
Better relationships at home
Some families turn to Mi Escuelita in moments of distress, such as after experiencing domestic violence. The preschool provides counseling for parents and students alike, which may contribute to behavioral improvements at home.
Over the past five years, 64% of the families in the program reported sensing fewer conflicts and 83% of them noticed an increase in closeness. 
“Families reported that children’s communication, behavior, and listening skills improved both at home and at school,” a UC San Diego team wrote in an evaluation of student and parent surveys that spanned 2020 to 2024. 
It takes a village
Running Mi Escuelita costs about $1.3 million a year, a sum that nonprofit South Bay Community Services raises through a mix of donations and government funding. That cost — along with the challenge of hiring trained educators and therapists — makes the program difficult to replicate. 
But, other schools and government agencies are watching Mi Escuelita to see what kind of services they can carry over to other venues. 
“We can spend less later on intervention programs and alternative facilities,” said Hilaria Bauer, chief early learning services officer at Kidango, a Bay Area nonprofit childcare provider. “There will be less truancy, less big behaviors or expulsions or alternative programs, and all of those ‘fix’ initiatives if we really focus on the time in the life of a child that really makes a change.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/061125_Mi-Escuelita_AH_CM_19.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-10-16 08:56:50.382962

Californians can find resources through their doctors, preschools and First Five. Here's how to get started.","In summary
Know a young child who experienced serious trauma? Californians can find resources through their doctors, preschools and First Five. Here’s how to get started.


Sometimes, parents just know their child needs special attention.
That’s especially true for parents of children who’ve experienced serious traumatic events, such as domestic violence.
California for the past several years has created a range of programs and tools to help those families find the help they need. 
They’re rooted in studies on what’s known as Adverse Childhood Experiences, or ACES, a term that captures the kind of trauma that can lead to debilitating consequences for a young person’s health and education. 
“If we could heal children, we would have healthier adults,” said First Five California Executive Director Jackie Thu-Huong Wong, whose organization supports early learning services throughout the state.
CalMatters today published a special report on Mi Escuelita, a preschool in San Diego that for almost 20 years has built a healing environment for young children exposed to trauma. 
We also spoke with Wong to learn about what California families should know when they begin looking for assistance after trauma. 
Here are some of her recommendations:
How do I know if my child needs extra attention?
If you start to notice a change from their normal behavior — a child who is normally well-behaved starts to act out or becomes more reserved and quiet — it could be a sign of a deeper issue. Also keep an eye to changes to their eating or sleeping habits. 
“Any change in normal behavior is a good time to wonder,” said Wong. 
If you know your child is experiencing toxic stress, but you haven’t noticed changes in their behavior, you can still begin looking for support. Untreated trauma within children can lead to low academic performance and a variety of health problems such as substance abuse, developing eating disorders, heart disease and diabetes.
Who should I reach out to for help?
Once you start to notice a change, you might naturally head to Google to see if you can find any resources. While that can be helpful, it can also lead you down rabbit holes that can cause confusion or more stress during an already difficult time. 
For Californians, the First 5 California website is a good place to start. It offers resources, tips and information on providers in your area as well as information about how toxic stress can affect a child.
“This is different from everyday stress, like missing a test or not knowing exactly how to tie a shoe,” Wong said. “We’re talking about a deeper, more long-term.”
What about a doctor?
You can also get in touch with a pediatrician who can provide a screening to see if a child or adult has been exposed to traumatic childhood events such as abuse, violence or neglect.
Once the assessment is complete, the pediatrician will provide a treatment plan, education and resources that parents can access to support their child.
What type of support should my child receive at school?
Mental health services can vary depending on your child’s school. Some schools may offer counseling and intervention programs.
If you believe your child might need mental health support, get in touch with a school counselor or administrator who can provide more information on the services they offer. 
It could result in a detailed plan from the school describing accommodations for the child. In California schools, that’s known as an individualized education program, or IEP.
CalMatters’ recent reporting highlights the on-site mental health services offered at Mi Escuelita in San Diego. It is not, however, the only therapeutic preschool in the state. Below is a list of some of the other options.

The district covers southeastern Chambers County and most of eastern Lee County in east Alabama. It was held by Rep. Debbie Wood, R-Valley, until she resigned this summer to move near the Florida panhandle, where her husband works. 
Voters will choose between Garrett Dixon, Micah Messer and Kristin Nelson. The candidate that gets at least 50% of votes will face Democratic nominee Hazel Floyd on Feb. 3. If no candidate gets 50% of votes, a runoff primary election will be on Nov. 18.

Messages seeking comment from Dixon were left Wednesday.
Nelson, 41, is advocating for a flat state income tax rate, which can only be done through a constitutional amendment. The 2-5% rate is set by a 1933 constitutional amendment.
Nelson said in a phone interview Wednesday afternoon that she also wants every public and private school in the state to have a school resource officer on duty. 
“Over 85% of our children in the state are publicly educated, so we need to make sure that it is the very best that it can be, and equip our teachers to do exactly what they know how to do, and not stifle them with all kinds of parameters and check boxes,” Nelson said. “At the same time, I believe that it is a parent’s right and their choice to be able to educate their children in the way that they feel led.”
Nelson said voters should choose her because she has committed to the area her whole life.
Messer, who ran for the seat against Wood in 2022, said in an interview Wednesday that he is advocating for tax reform, reduced crime and election auditing.
Wood sponsored a bill in 2025 that would have required a random audit of all state elections. It passed the House in March, but was never considered by the Senate. According to the Movement Advance Project, seven states do not have a law requiring an election audit.
There is no evidence of widespread voter fraud or voter fraud reaching levels to overturn an election. According to the Heritage Foundation, a conservative leaning think tank that tracks election fraud, there have been 39 cases of election deceit in Alabama in the past 25 years. By comparison, over 2.2 million Alabamians voted in last year’s presidential election.
“I have a lot of different varying experiences that will fit very well with District 38 and allow me to be a great voice and great representative for the entire district,” Messer said.
In a statement on Dixon’s campaign website, the cotton and peanut farmer said he understood the issues that rural Alabamians face.
“Garrett Dixon is ready to stand up and be a voice for the district he’s always called home,” the statement said.
The primary election will not matter for Floyd’s candidacy, but she said in an interview Wednesday that she hopes voters choose a Republican candidate based on their policies and morals.
“Just because this person has more signs, this person has bigger signs, that doesn’t mean they’re going to be better at the job,” Floyd said. “That just means they have more financial backing. Then you need to start questioning, ‘where are they getting this backing from?’”
Floyd is campaigning on boosting business development beyond Valley city limits, strengthening public education funding and supporting farmers. She said Wednesday that, through talking with the community, other issues are important to her too, like advocating for better pay for teachers and affordable housing for the elderly.
“I still want to help bring businesses in and things like that, but you’ve got to handle those issues that are in front of you, that you can handle, immediately,” Floyd said.
According to campaign finance records, Dixon has raised more than $55,000 and spent almost $41,000. About one-third of Dixon’s donations came from Political Action Committees (PACs). He had almost $7,000 on-hand before the special election cycle began.
Nelson has raised over $22,000 and spent almost $21,000 since the beginning of the special election in August. She had about $11,000 on-hand before the special election cycle began. All of her cash donations came from individuals and businesses.
Messer has raised about $16,000 and spent almost $22,000. He had almost $9,000 on-hand before the special election cycle began. According to campaign finance records, the EAGL PAC donated $1,000, the sole PAC donation to Messer’s campaign.

While plowing a wheat field in rural Washington state in the 1990s, William Wallace spotted a gray plane overhead that he believed was releasing chemicals to make him sick. The rancher began to suspect that all white vapor trails from aircraft might be dangerous.
He shared his concern with reporters, acknowledging it sounded a little like “The X Files,” a science fiction television show.
Academics cite Wallace’s story as one of the catalysts behind a fringe concept that has spread among adherents to the Make America Healthy Again, or MAHA, movement and is gaining traction at the highest levels of the federal government. Its treatment as a serious issue underscores that under President Donald Trump, unscientific ideas have unusual power to take hold and shape public health policy.
The concept posits that airplane vapor trails, or contrails, are really “chemtrails” containing toxic substances that poison people and the terrain. Another version alleges planes or devices are being deployed by the federal government, private companies, or researchers to trigger big weather changes, such as hurricanes, or to alter the Earth’s climate, emitting hazardous chemicals in the process.
Several GOP lawmakers and leaders in the Trump administration remain convinced the concepts are legitimate, though scientists have sought to discredit such claims.
Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is planning to investigate climate and weather control, and is expected to create a task force that will recommend possible federal action, according to a former agency official, an internal agency memo obtained by KFF Health News, and a consultant who helped with the memo.
The plans, along with comments by top GOP lawmakers, show how rumors and conspiracy theories can gain an air of legitimacy due to social media and a political climate infused with falsehoods, some political scientists and researchers say.
“When we have low access to information or low trust in our sources of information, a lot of times we turn to our peer groups, the groups we are members of and we define ourselves by,” said Timothy Tangherlini, a folklorist and professor of information at the University of California-Berkeley. He added that the government’s investigation of conspiracy theories “gives the impression of having some authoritative element.”
HHS is expected to appoint a special government employee to investigate climate and weather control, according to Gray Delany, former head of the agency’s MAHA agenda, who said he drafted the memo. The agency has interviewed applicants to lead a “chemtrails” task force, said Jim Lee, a blogger focused on weather and climate who Delany said helped edit the memo, which Lee confirmed.
“HHS does not comment on future or potential policy decisions and task forces,” agency spokesperson Emily Hilliard said in an email.
The memo alleges that “aerosolized heavy metals such as Aluminum, Barium, and Strontium, as well as other materials such as sulfuric acid precursors, are sprayed into the atmosphere under the auspices of combatting global warming,” through a process of stratospheric aerosol injection, or SAI.
“There are serious concerns SAI spraying is leading to increased heavy metal content in the atmosphere,” the memo states.
The memo claims, without providing evidence, that the substances cause elevated heavy-metal content in the atmosphere, soil, and waterways, and that aluminum is a toxic product used in SAI linked to dementia, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, asthma-like illnesses, and other chronic illnesses. The July 14 memo was addressed to White House health adviser Calley Means, who didn’t respond to a voicemail left by a reporter seeking comment.
High-level federal government officials are presenting false claims as facts without evidence and referring to events that not only haven’t occurred but, in many cases, are physically impossible, said Daniel Swain, a climate scientist at the University of California.
“That is a pretty shocking memo,” he said. “It doesn’t get more tinfoil hat. They really believe toxins are being sprayed.”
Kennedy has previously promoted debunked chemtrail theories. In May, he was asked on “Dr. Phil Primetime” about chemicals being sprayed into the stratosphere to change the Earth’s climate.
“It’s done, we think, by DARPA,” Kennedy said, referring to a Department of Defense agency that develops emerging technology for the military’s use. “And a lot of it now is coming out of the jet fuel. Those materials are put in jet fuel. I’m going to do everything in my power to stop it. We’re bringing on somebody who’s going to think only about that.”
DARPA officials didn’t return a message seeking comment.
Federal messaging
Deploying chemtrails to poison people is just one of many baseless conspiracy theories that have found traction among Trump administration health policy officials led by Kennedy, a longtime anti-vaccine activist before entering politics. He continues to promote a supposed link between vaccines and autism, as well as make statements connecting fluoride in drinking water to arthritis, bone fractures, thyroid disease, and cancer. The World Health Organization says fluoride is safe when used as recommended.
Delany, who was ousted in August from HHS, said Kennedy has expressed strong interest in chemtrails.
“This is an issue that really matters to MAHA,” said Delany, referring to the informal movement associated with Kennedy that is composed of people who are skeptical of evidence-based medicine.
The memo also alleges that “suspicious weather events have been occurring and have increased awareness of the issue to the public, some of which have been acknowledged to have been caused by geoengineering activities, such as the flooding in Dubai in 2024.” Geoengineering refers to intentional large-scale efforts to change the climate to counteract global warming.
“It is unconscionable that anyone should be allowed to spray known neurotoxins and environmental toxins over our nation’s citizens, their land, food and water supplies,” Delany’s memo states.
Scientists, meteorologists, and other branches of the federal government say these assertions are largely incorrect. Some points in the memo are accurate, including concerns that commercial aircraft contribute to acid rain.
But critics say the memo builds on kernels of truth before veering into unscientific fringe theories. Efforts to control the weather are being made, largely by states and local governments seeking to combat droughts, but the results are modest and highly localized. It isn’t possible to manipulate large-scale weather events, scientists say.
Severe flooding in the United Arab Emirates in 2024 couldn’t have been caused by weather manipulation because no technology could create that kind of rainfall event, Maarten Ambaum, a meteorologist at the University of Reading who studies Gulf region rainfall patterns, said in a statement on the floods. Similar debunked claims emerged this year after central Texas experienced devastating floods.
The Government Accountability Office concluded in a 2024 report that questions remain as to the effectiveness of weather modification.
Research into changing the climate has been conducted, including work by one private company that engaged in field tests. Still, federal agencies say no ongoing or large-scale projects are underway. Study of the concept remains in the research phase. The Environmental Protection Agency says there are no large-scale or government efforts to affect the Earth’s climate.
“Solar geoengineering is not occurring via direct delivery by commercial aircraft and is not associated with aviation contrails,” the agency says on its website.
Widespread misinformation
Misperceptions about weather, climate control, and airplane contrails extend beyond the Trump administration, scientists said.
In September, a congressional House committee hearing titled “Playing God With the Weather — A Disastrous Forecast” involved two hours of debate on the once-fringe idea. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.), who chaired the hearing, has introduced legislation to ban weather and climate control, with a fine of up to $100,000 and up to five years in prison.
Some Democrats objected to the nature of the discussion. Rep. Melanie Stansbury (D-N.M.) accused Greene of using “the platform of Congress to proffer anti-science theories, to platform climate denialism.”
Frequently citing chemtrails, GOP lawmakers have introduced legislation in about two dozen states to ban weather modification or geoengineering. Florida passed a bill to establish an online portal so residents can report alleged violations.
“The Free State of Florida means freedom from governments or private actors unilaterally applying chemicals or geoengineering to people or public spaces,” GOP Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said in a press statement this spring.
Meanwhile, the chemtrail conspiracy has permeated popular culture. The title track on singer Lana Del Ray’s seventh studio album is entitled “Chemtrails Over the Country Club.” Bill Maher dove into the chemtrail myth on his podcast “Club Random,” saying, “This is nuts. It’s just nuts.” And “Chemtrails,” a psychological thriller, wrapped filming in July.
Social media has given wing to the chemtrails concept and other fringe ideas involving public health. They include an outlandish belief that Anthony Fauci, who advised both Trump and President Joe Biden on the government response to the covid-19 pandemic, created the AIDS epidemic. There is no evidence of such a link, public health leaders say.
Researchers say another false belief by those on the far right holds that people who received covid vaccines could shed the virus, causing infertility in the unvaccinated. There is no evidence of such a connection, scientists and researchers say.
More severe weather events due to global warming may be driving some of the baseless theories, scientists say. And risks occur when such ideas take hold among the general population or policymakers, some public health leaders say. Climate researchers, including Swain, say they’ve received death threats.
Lee, the blogger, said he disagrees with some of the more far-fetched beliefs and is aware of the harm they can cause.
“There are people wanting to shoot down planes because they think they are chemtrails,” said Lee, adding that some believers are afraid to venture outside when plane vapor trails are visible overhead.
There is also no evidence that plane contrails cause health problems or are related to intentional efforts to control the climate, according to the EPA and other scientists.
The memo and focus at HHS on climate and weather control are alarming because they perpetuate conspiracies, said David Keith, a professor of geophysical sciences at the University of Chicago.
“It’s unmoored to reality,” he said. “I expected there were documents like this, but seeing it in print is nevertheless shocking. Our government is being driven by nonsensical dreck from dark corners of social media.”

(Photos by Andrew Harnik/Getty and Fran Baltzer, Danielle Richards, and Reena Rose Sibayan for New Jersey Monitor)Four of New Jersey’s largest cities want a federal judge to throw out the U.S. Department of Justice’s lawsuit challenging their sanctuary policies for undocumented immigrants, arguing the Trump administration wants to relitigate cases that have already been resolved by federal judges. 
In three separate legal briefs filed this week, attorneys for Hoboken, Jersey City, Newark, and Paterson said the federal government’s May complaint against them mirrors lawsuits that the Department of Justice and two counties lost years ago over the state’s Immigrant Trust Directive. That 2018 order — which restricts state and local police from aiding in civil immigration enforcement in most cases — was upheld by the 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals in 2021.
The Trump administration has argued that ruling was wrongly decided, and that illegal immigration has become such a bigger problem since then that the decision warrants reconsideration. Attorneys for the four cities argue the 3rd Circuit decision binds the judge who is overseeing the current dispute and that the Constitution protects the cities from interference from the federal government in this matter.
“Cities have the sovereign authority to decide whether and to what extent their officials will voluntarily cooperate with federal immigration enforcement efforts,” Gurbir Grewal, an attorney for Newark and Hoboken, wrote in that city’s brief.
Grewal is a former state attorney general who was the architect of the state Immigrant Trust Directive.
The dispute is one of many initiated by President Donald Trump’s administration during the first year of his second term, one aimed at boosting his effort to detain and deport millions of undocumented immigrants. The lawsuit targets not just the four New Jersey cities but also some of their elected leaders.
The administration claims the local policies violate the Constitution’s supremacy clause, which prevents state law from overruling federal law. Trump has said he’d withhold federal funds from states and localities that don’t end their sanctuary policies.
The filings from the four cities, which are motions to dismiss the Trump administration lawsuit, largely rest on the same argument: courts have already rejected the federal government’s push to force local police to help enforce civil immigration law. The cities point to the 10th Amendment’s anticommandeering doctrine, which bars the federal government from ordering states or municipalities to carry out federal functions. 
Paterson’s sanctuary policy “does not obstruct federal law; it merely declines to expend municipal resources on federal civil-immigration enforcement,” that city’s attorneys wrote.
Newark’s and Jersey City’s sanctuary orders date to 2017, the first year of Trump’s initial term as president. Hoboken’s was issued in January 2018, and Paterson’s came in the form of a police policy that became effective in June 2019. 
The cities argue that because its police officers would be bound by the state Immigrant Trust Directive if they didn’t have similar policies on the local level, the Trump administration can’t identify any harm it has suffered from the local orders.
Attorneys for Jersey City said if it rescinded its sanctuary city executive order, that action would “result in absolutely no change in how the Jersey City Police Department voluntarily cooperates with federal law enforcement, since the Directive still governs.”
Lawyers for the cities also note that their sanctuary policies explicitly say local police are not restricted from cooperating with federal agents to apprehend immigration accused of crimes.
U.S. District Judge Evelyn Padin could decide on the matter as early as next month.

Increased reliance on the property tax makes the tax system more complex and less fair.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Jack Hoffman: Vermont should not fund schools with property taxes.","This commentary is by Jack Hoffman, a senior policy analyst with the Public Assets Institute. Before joining Public Assets, he covered politics and state government in Vermont for 20 years. He was formerly a longtime resident of Marshfield.  


Recently, residents of the town of Windham wrote about how their neighbors on fixed incomes saw a nearly four-fold increase in their property tax bills after a town-wide reappraisal this year.  
Concerned that big hikes would force folks out of their homes, the authors wondered why these low-income Vermonters — who according to Vermont statute should pay no more than 4.5% of the income for property taxes — were now facing bills as high as 16% of their incomes. 
It’s a good question. 
The answer lies buried in the technicalities of our property tax system, specifically the one-year lag in how the Vermont Tax Department calculates property tax credits that the authors referred to in their commentary. The income-based tax credit you get this year is based on last year’s property taxes. So, if your property taxes increase dramatically as they did in Windham, the credit will not be sufficient to protect you from a big jump in your bill. 
Unfortunately, the lag is just one part of the problem that makes the property tax system so unfair and incomprehensible. Act 73 — the new education transformation bill enacted by the Legislature this year — will eliminate Vermonters’ option to pay their school taxes based on income, so more Vermonters will find themselves in situations like those in Windham.  
Act 73 creates a new homestead exemption. Vermonters with up to $115,000 in household income will pay based on a percentage of their home’s value (up to $425,000). As income goes up, that percentage goes up. Those with household income of $115,000 or more pay the full property tax bill on their home. 
Because the bills are tied to property value, the next reappraisal would very likely result in another big tax spike.  
The problem is the property tax. It is based on the value of a primary home, which is not a good indicator of a Vermonter’s ability to pay. Property values often rise faster than income — and besides, we pay our taxes out of our income, not by selling off a portion of our home. For most Vermonters, the value of their home is greater than their net worth because they have mortgages and other debt.   
There is an alternative system that is much simpler and that better reflects the way Vermonters live. An income-based education tax would eliminate the spikes in education taxes caused by reappraisals and align education tax bills with Vermonters’ ability to pay. 
That’s why most Vermonters support paying school taxes based on income, according to polling done over the past three decades. The Public Assets Institute has analyzed how an income-based system would work and has published several reports that explain it in understandable terms. 
But with Act 73, the Legislature and the governor are moving in the opposite direction by basing school taxes less on income and more on a home’s property value. 
Increased reliance on the property tax makes the tax system more complex and less fair, which in turn makes Vermonters more vulnerable to changing property values as upper-income people continue to bid up Vermont property for a second home, for a short-term rental property or for a primary residence.

Business owners expressed their concerns about the impact of the mass shooting on Oct. 4 on downtown businesses and asked additional questions of the city about the changes to the open carry regulations concerning alcohol. (Ralph Chapoco/Alabama Reflector)Business owners in downtown Montgomery said Wednesday that they are still seeing fallout from a mass shooting that killed two people and left 12 others injured.
In a public forum hosted by Main Street Montgomery, a nonprofit organization that aims to revitalize the city’s downtown area, told city and police officials the fear resulting from the shooting is leading to fewer customers.
“The regular customers of the businesses downtown have not been swayed,” said Will O’Connor, a part owner of Rick E’s, a sports bar located in the downtown area. “I think they believe in the downtown, they believe in the businesses they support. I don’t think there is a pervasive sense of fear, but I have heard from some groups who were planning to visit downtown, in the aftermath of the shooting, that they were concerned about safety.”

The event was partly a rally aimed at motivating proprietors to maintain their faith in the downtown area and a way for business owners to ask questions to the city’s tourism and economic development staff, as well as the local police, about loitering and alcohol regulations in place since the shooting.
The Oct. 4 shooting, which took place during celebrations after a football game, killed Jeremiah Morris, 17, and Shalanda Williams, 43. Seven of the victims were under the age of 20. Montgomery police have charged two people in connection with the shooting.
James Graboys, Montgomery’s chief of police, told the business owners at the forum that the perpetrators will eventually be held accountable.
“We are never going to stop until we get them,” he said to the crowd during the event. “We have already gotten two of them, and we are going to get more.” He then said that the department has taken into custody additional people who are “on the periphery, we just haven’t gone to the press on them.”
Several business owners said they had seen foot traffic decline following the shooting.
“Fridays and Saturdays, especially during this time of year, can really get busy,” said Megan Gibson, manager of the coffee shop Prevail located along Dexter Avenue in downtown Montgomery. “People walk around, they are hanging out, the parking spots are full. This weekend was one of the first weekends in a long time when I walked out, it is 5 p.m. and there are so many parking spots.”
She said that Prevail only had four people at one point during the weekend.
Since the shooting, city officials have suspended an ordinance that allowed visitors in the downtown’s entertainment district to carry open alcohol containers. .
“It definitely has affected us,” Gibson said. “Yes, I serve coffee, but I serve beer and wine as well, and people can take their beer and wine and walk down to the next place. Now, they can’t do that.”
The city will also more strictly enforce regulations meant to prohibit people from loitering, Graboys said. O’ Connor said the city has to balance loitering enforcement against the benefits of allowing patrons to walk about the downtown area to frequent restaurants and bars.
“I was just curious about the definition of that was and how we intended to address loitering or control loitering,” O’Connor said. “At the same time that loitering is getting reflected as a cause for concern, we also want a busy, walkable, vibrant downtown.”
Graboys said that the loitering ordinance will be targeted at illegal activity.
“Loitering is hanging out to do bad things,” Graboys said during the event. “Maybe they are carrying weapons, smoking dope, doing things they should not do downtown.”
As for the open carry ordinance, Graboys said that it remains suspended until further notice.
“If people have a cooler, that is going to get dumped out,” he said.
LaConya Murray, chair of Main Street Montgomery, said they wanted to ensure downtown business owners’ concerns were heard.
“There was some miscommunication about the entertainment district and that it was closed and what that meant,” she said. “We want to make sure that residents of Montgomery know that downtown Montgomery is open, Main Street businesses are open for business. We also wanted to put a pulse on the community.”",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_7509-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-16 07:56:50.778223

Up for consideration on Wednesday were two packages of bills, one limiting the number of licenses for marijuana retailers and provisioning centers, and another aiming to address the sale of unregulated intoxicating hemp products, though Moss noted there would be additional meetings on the bills in the future.
Sen. Sam Singh (D-East Lansing) explained that the first package, Senate Bills 597 and 598, would cap licensing for marijuana retailers and licensing for wholesalers to one license per 10,000 residents in a municipality beginning Jan. 1, 2026, similar to how the state regulates liquor sales.
Communities with fewer than 10,000 residents would always have at least one license, Singh said. 
Additionally, the bills allow current license holders to renew their licenses or transfer them to another individual. 
The second set, Senate Bills 599–602, would create a regulatory framework for consumable hemp products in Michigan, Sen. Dayna Polehanki (D-Livonia) explained, noting that intoxicating products made from hemp, including Delta-8 and other synthesized cannabinoids are being sold in Michigan gas stations, convenience stores, and online without oversight or testing.

Both proposals received support from the Cannabis Regulatory Agency – which regulates Michigan’s adult-use cannabis industry – as well as several members of the state’s cannabis industry. 
Derek Sova, a policy and legislative specialist for the agency, said one of the challenges the agency is presently facing is that of marijuana versus hemp, when the conversation should be on whether a substance is intoxicating or non-intoxicating. 
Conventionally the understanding is that hemp is a crop or a textile, Sova explained, with both Michigan and the federal government’s definition of hemp and marijuana allowing for the unregulated sale of products with large amounts of THC – the component in marijuana that is primarily responsible for its intoxicating effect. SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
“Because of the way the definition is, they are considered hemp, and because of that, they are not age-gated. There’s not a requirement for testing, like there is in Michigan with marijuana products. There are not restrictions on labeling,” Sova said. 
Alongside setting up a regulatory framework for non-intoxicating consumable hemp products, like CBD-infused gummies, and intoxicating hemp products, Sova noted the bill package would deregulate the sale of nonconsumable hemp, which is used to make textiles and building materials. 
“Right now, under the current law, you have to get a license to make that,  license to sell that. In our opinion, that doesn’t seem like it’s something that needs to be regulated,” Sova said.

Robin Schneider, executive director of the Michigan Cannabis Industry Association offered her support for capping licensing of marijuana provisioners and retailers, noting that unlimited licenses for marijuana cultivation has led to an oversupply, causing a drop in wholesale prices and bringing harm to businesses all the way down the supply chain. 
Additionally, the proliferation of retail spaces has led to public nuisance concerns, traffic issues and complaints from communities, Schneider said. 
“Our members are asking this committee to assist our industry in creating market stability and thoughtful and collaborative industry planning moving forward, so that at the very least they can make business decisions based on projections that include predictability,” Schneider said. 
The association also supported regulating intoxicating hemp products, noting that these products are being shipped into Michigan from out of state, and are not produced by Michigan hemp farmers. 
“Not only have our hemp farmers been left out and harmed in many ways, but current law does not even allow them to manufacture CBD-only consumable hemp products in Michigan,” Schneider said.

Kyleigh Cumming, the lab director for Kairos Labs, a cannabis testing lab, told committee members that the 2018 farm bill which defined hemp created a loophole that allowed for the conversion of CBD into compounds similar to THC.
“These conversion processes create many dangerous and unknown byproducts along the way, while also allowing products created to be marked as hemp-derived and sold in Michigan as unregulated, intoxicating vapes,” Cumming said. 
In a study of 15 vape products purchased in multiple Southeast Michigan communities, Cumming said the products had no lab testing results or traceability, and when acquiring the products, nobody asked for an ID to check for age. When the products were tested, the lab found 15 contaminants, and all 15 samples detected THC levels above the .3% level set by the federal government. 
While offering support for additional regulations on hemp products, Kimberly James, the director of cannabis affairs for the City of Detroit called for more teeth in the bill to allow local governments to take action when intoxicating hemp products are being sold at unlicensed locations. 
“The [Cannabis Regulatory Agency] currently does not enforce violations of the [Michigan Regulation and Taxation of Marihuana Act] against non-licensees, and I wouldn’t expect that it could enforce violations of this act against anyone who’s not a licensed consumable hemp processor,” James said. “Local governments need to have the authority to stop this practice immediately when products are in a regular store and explicitly state they contain THC.”
Polehanki promised to work with James to ensure these changes were made, saying the legislation is “no good unless these products can be taken off the market.”
Blain Becktold, the founder of iHemp Michigan, which represents hemp farmers, manufactures and businesses statewide, said the group’s members supported denying or restricting the sale of products that could cause harm when purchased or consumed, but took issue with its definition of hemp as cannabis with less than 0.3% THC, pointing to a federal push to increase that threshold to 1%. 
“That’s not to make more intoxicating products. That’s really for the safety of the growers and the farmers. If they invest that time, money and effort into the crop, and it goes hot over .3, then they’ve lost all that. At 1% we really wouldn’t have that problem,” Becktold said. 
Cassin Coleman of Cannabis Consumer Advocacy also raised concerns on the proposed regulations, noting that the limits on THC on nonintoxicating hemp products would limit access to certain products used by individuals for medical purposes.
“As is often the case, products that patients are using consistently, that are CBD products, they do contain THC,” Coleman said, noting that these products contain THC because they are “full spectrum” meaning they contain the full range of compounds that occur in the cannabis plant. 
By trying to remove or limit the amount of THC in these products, other important cannabinoids, plant proteins and antioxidants would be removed, Coleman said, warning that could make these products less effective.

The USDA recently announced the termination of the Household Food Security Report, a one-of-a-kind national survey on the impact of hunger on low-income Americans. Cancelling the report is a step backward in the fight to end hunger.   
For over 30 years, hunger relief organizations like The Food Group have relied on this data to understand the needs of food-insecure households and strategize how to best serve our communities. Without it, more hungry Americans will fall through the cracks, and hunger relief organizations will face more barriers responding to the need.   
It’s easy to ignore the problems we can’t see. Two years ago, a Minnesota state senator argued against universal school meals because he had never met a hungry person in Minnesota. The senator assumed that if he hadn’t seen the need with his own eyes, it wasn’t real.  
In my 15 years doing hunger-relief work, I’ve learned that food insecurity is hard to spot in Minnesota and often doesn’t look like you expect. Many people hide their struggles to access enough food due to the stigma. Others have a job, housing, and appear financially stable, but don’t make enough to afford the costly trifecta of housing, health care and food. I’ve also seen firsthand that hunger isn’t stagnant and things can change quickly.   
Each year, The Food Group hosts a leadership program for people who have experienced hunger firsthand. Their stories illustrate that food insecurity looks different for everyone.   
Some have lost jobs due to medical issues. Burned through savings. Qualified for SNAP and disability. Some are single moms, working 40 hours while raising kids. But many still need to rely on food shelves to get by, given the rapid food inflation in recent years. 
Hunger is real whether we choose to see it or not. It’s there whether it looks like we expect or completely different. Food security research is critical because it objectively captures the full spectrum of food insecurity.  
Each year, The Food Group releases an annual report on food shelf visit trends in Minnesota. In 2024, we tracked a record-breaking 9 million food shelf visits. We use this data to gain a clearer picture of statewide needs and plan how to meet  those needs and support frontline food shelf partners.   
If we didn’t collect and report on this data, it would not mean that food shelf visits were not rising. It would not mean that Minnesotans were less hungry or need less support. It would only mean that The Food Group — and those who rely on our research — wouldn’t be as equipped to step into the gap.   
Imagine public health authorities canceling tests of a communicable disease and then pretending the lack of data meant there was no spread of the disease. 
In their statement announcing the termination of the report, the USDA wrote that the “these redundant, costly, politicized and extraneous studies do nothing more than fear monger.” 
Collecting data on food insecurity is not fearmongering; it’s recording the real but often overlooked experiences of hungry people across our state. 
The high rate of food insecurity in the US is hard to face. It means something is wrong. But we must confront that uncomfortable reality if we truly want to end hunger in the United States.   
Food security research has never been more important. So far, food shelf visits in 2025 have remained on par with the numbers we reported for 2024. Minnesotans are struggling with inflation and high costs for food and other essentials. At the same time, low-income Minnesotans are bracing for changes to SNAP that will create more barriers to accessing food support.   
More than ever, we need good national data to analyze the impact of federal policy changes and build a strong, strategic response to hunger. The Household Food Security Report is an irreplaceable tool in hunger-relief work.

Lance Shockley, 48, was convicted by a jury for the 2005 murder of Missouri Highway Patrol Sgt. Carl Dewayne Graham Jr. A judge sentenced him to death in 2009.
That day in June, Summer and several other family members were invited inside the prison for a restoration visit, where families were given unusual access to the facility. 
They ate lunch and played pickleball. Later, the family clasped hands and prayed in a circle.
“It was just a really, really neat day,” said Summer, 27.

Deep down, though, she felt uneasy the entire time. Less than 30 minutes into her drive home, her dad called. Officials had set his execution for Oct. 14.
The experiences of children with parents on death row are often forgotten when it comes to capital punishment. There are few services for them, as they are not generally seen as victims. No organization tracks information on this particular group. Of the past 10 people who have faced execution in Missouri, at least six had children. 
Survivors who shared their stories described depression and grief they say could have been avoided, along with complicated feelings about the meaning of justice.
“When we talk about the collateral consequences of using the death penalty, they should be included in that count,” said Robin Maher, executive director of the Death Penalty Information Center. 
The impact Maher describes isn’t theoretical. Summer Shockley said she has lived it.
Summer said it was difficult as a child when kids heard about the killing and asked her about it. She credits her mom, who had split with Lance Shockley years before, for encouraging her and her younger sister to see him. They regularly went to Potosi.
“He just always told us how much he loved us and cared about us and how thankful he was that we could visit him and talk to him,” she said. 
They bonded over their faith in God. Over the past seven years, that faith has grown even stronger as Shockley became a leader in a prison ministry program. His awakening has transformed both sides of her family, she said, allowing them to be brought to Jesus and overcome generational challenges like alcohol and divorce. 
Now married and the head softball coach at Missouri University of Science and Technology, Summer has had time to think about the likely outcome of their relationship, especially as her father’s appeals waned. 
Confronted with the actual date, Summer said she’d been “living in grief prior to something tragic happening.” She made space to sit and let her emotions out. 
For months, she held onto hope that the execution would be called off. Her father maintained his innocence til the end, and even requested DNA testing on items found at the crime scene. Because this is the first execution under Missouri Gov. Mike Kehoe, anti-death penalty advocates also hoped the governor’s Catholic faith would influence his clemency decision. On Monday, Kehoe’s office announced he would not grant clemency.
Summer and her sister attended the execution at Eastern Reception, Diagnostic and Correctional Center in Bonne Terre — where the state’s executions take place — despite their dad’s initial reluctance.

In the months after Marcellus “Khaliifah” Williams Sr. was executed in 2024, the younger Williams said he sank into a deep depression. 
The elder Williams was convicted in the 1998 murder of journalist Felicia Gayle in her University City home. He was sentenced to death in 2001.
The younger Williams said he often replayed the moment his father’s arm fell onto the gurney inside the chamber at Eastern Reception. The man who had once been his guide — the voice that talked him through matters of the heart and brain — was gone.
The execution was complicated by uncertainty. Officials with the prosecutor’s office who sent Williams Sr. to death row later tried to stop the execution because of questions about his guilt and a lack of DNA on the murder weapon. The victim’s family opposed the death penalty. The state moved forward, anyway. 
Williams Jr. said afterward, grief followed him everywhere. He often came across places in St. Louis that evoked memories of his dad, like the basketball courts at Walnut Park. He was negative and sometimes mean, he said. He didn’t seek professional help because of the cost, although he suspects he needed therapy even before the execution. 
The After Violence Project, which addresses the impact of mass incarceration and the death penalty on families, trains therapists through its Access to Treatment Initiative. Susannah Sheffer, the initiative’s director, said family members often experience “disenfranchised grief,” a kind of mourning that isn’t recognized or publicly supported.
The Rev. Jeff Hood, a spiritual adviser for men on death row, said children who are left behind face complicated emotions. Many families experience a disconnect until an execution date is set, prompting a rush to form a relationship.
Then, the parent dies.
In May, Williams Jr. was at a park with his 4-year-old son and found himself out of breath lifting the child onto a slide. After that, he began working out again. He knew he had to “shift out of it” for his son.

On New Year’s Day 2022, Khorry Ramey learned she was pregnant. Her father, Kevin Johnson, also called, warning that his life could soon end. She said she didn’t know how to process it.
That August, her aunt called to tell her an execution date had been set for Nov. 29.
“It was a reality check for me,” Ramey said. “Honestly, it was like, ‘This stuff still happens?’”
Johnson was sentenced to death in 2007 for the 2005 killing of Kirkwood Police Sgt. William McEntee.
Ramey had already known loss from a young age. Her father was arrested when she was 2, and her mother was murdered when she was 4.
She was only 19, but she wanted to attend the execution. State law required witnesses to be 21.
“I was like, if he was in a hospital bed, I’d be there by his side,” she said. “So it’s no different for me. It’s moreso like comforting my dad [in] his time of [need].
“And this is almost a closure for me as well.”
Johnson got to see his grandson several times, and even got to hold him once. Ramey’s last visit was the day of his execution. She had never seen him cry before then.
“He was just telling me how much he failed me as a father. The last memory I have of him is not what I want it to be.”
She tried therapy, but it wasn’t for her. Few understand what she’s been through, she said.
Although she learned at a young age what it was like to lose a parent, her dad’s death was harder. She grew up visiting him often, playing Connect 4 and Scrabble in the visitation room at Potosi. He got her report cards from school. They talked about everything.
When she’s in a dark place, Ramey said she focuses on her son. 
She is also steadfast in her belief that the death penalty is not “the Christian way to go about things.” Since her father’s execution, she’s attended other execution watches.

(Photo by Noelle Maxwell for Indiana Capital Chronicle)Since Jan. 20, organizations such as No Kings and 50501 have mobilized, holding regular protests against the second Trump administration. 
But big cities like Indianapolis and Fort Wayne aren’t the only communities where Hoosiers are exercising their First Amendment rights. People are gathering in Columbus, Batesville, Oldenburg, Franklin, Decatur and other small cities, towns and counties. 
This Saturday will once again bring a cascade of events around the state for the latest coordinated event. About 40 No Kings protests are planned for Indiana, from Albion to Vincennes. 
“I feel like a lot of people” who lean left, “and live somewhere like this, they may feel alone,” said Columbus resident Raven Stanton.
Stanton has organized several protests across Indiana and co-founded Rise Up Columbus. While she’s now considered a seasoned organizer, she didn’t get started until January. 
“I got online, found a couple Discord servers and connected with a handful of people locally,” she said. From there her involvement grew. 










I’m just not going to be silent. That was the problem in World War II — people stood by and did nothing.


– Sister Noella Poinsette


The current political situation motivated her actions, “the things that they’re attempting to do — the systematic removal of marginalized groups’ rights,” she elaborated, “their attempt at silencing journalists and other people and attempting to eradicate the First Amendment — that’s just the tip of the iceberg in terms of everything they’ve been able to accomplish in seven to eight months’ time.”
Hollie Payton, co-founder of Decatur County-based RISE for Justice echoed similar sentiments. 
“I felt with all the negativity going on, just to lend that ear, that piece of hope to people,” is important, she said, as is letting people know that while everyone is different, “we all deserve equal rights.”
Attorney and Indiana House District 55 Democratic candidate Victoria Martz has attended as many protests as possible. She got involved this spring after contacting another organizer in Decatur County, asking if she could speak at their protest. 
“I really wanted to talk to the people about what’s going on,” she said. “Everybody was having a difficult time coping with the fast-paced attacks on our constitutional rights, on our social service programs.”
She wanted to remind protestors that “it’s not the end – we’re in this together still and if we keep working together collectively, we can eventually, in time, change things. I still have faith in that.”
The Oldenburg Sisters of Saint Francis have participated in local and national protests, including the June 28 Sisters Speak Out protest in Washington D.C. Sister Noella Poinsette also attended a protest at Camp Atterbury.
Poinsette explained the Sisters’ involvement — “Saint Francis was all about the poor, just like Jesus. In the gospel — well, the gospel and the Old Testament, even — God says to care for the orphan, the widow and the stranger. Jesus was all about including everyone.” 

Indiana 50501 – which disbanded in August  – was organizing protests in Indianapolis. It stood for 50 protests, 50 states, 1 movement and has similar chapters nationwide. When contacted for comment, former leader Scott Johnson stated, “there were some people in the group that had some issue with me personally.” 
Johnson viewed his work as “servant-style leadership” and stepped down voluntarily. “I honestly don’t know who’s in charge or what they’re doing,” he said regarding the current status of Indiana 50501. The Indiana 50501 website homepage states “the original Indiana 50501 has disbanded,” listing groups continuing the original organization’s work.

The Sisters value justice and individual dignity. Participating in protests is how they speak out for those who can’t. 
“Maybe workers have a hard time speaking out for just wages because they need to be at work,” she said, “The immigrants right now in this climate are afraid to leave their homes sometimes. We’re just speaking up like the prophets in the Old Testament, trying to bring people back to an awareness of God.”
Rural protests don’t draw the same numbers as those at the Statehouse. For instance, a No Kings rally in May drew more than 3,000 to the state’s capital. Some of the other protests draw dozens to more than a hundred.
Martz described people who drive past protests in small communities as mostly positive, “they’re honking their horns, doing like a cheering fist or waving, things that show they’re happy to see this going on.”
But there are some people “who drive by and they’re throwing up the middle finger or yelling ‘Trump won.’ Nobody said he didn’t win. We’re just saying we don’t like authoritarianism.”
While helping organize a protest in Batesville, Martz was responsible for coordinating with local law enforcement. That communication paid off because at this protest, there was an incident. Martz and her group were walking from downtown Batesville to another area to listen to a speaker. While walking, a truck with two large Trump flags kept driving ahead of the group. The driver was yelling at protestors.
The group approached an intersection and the truck pulled up to the stop sign. The group had previously informed the police chief they wouldn’t obstruct traffic. Organizers reminded protestors to let traffic pass. The truck wouldn’t move, even as other cars approached and waited. 
“We were not going to cross the street,” Martz said, “because I was afraid of what could happen if we crossed in front of this truck that already made it clear he wasn’t liking what we’re there to stand for.”
The truck began slowly rolling through the intersection, the driver still yelling at the group. Two protestors approached, Martz said, yelling back, while she reminded others to remain on the sidewalk. 
“As I’m doing that,” she recounts, “a white truck pulls up — facing the opposite direction. It flips on its lights and it’s the police chief. He rolled down his window,” telling the truck’s driver he was blocking traffic.  
“He made the truck move,” Martz said, “and de-escalated the situation alongside me.” 
The group was able to cross and listen to their speaker. The moment stood out, said Martz, because it showed everybody, “your community, while it might not be a straight Democratic community, a good community can have people of all political identities and backgrounds who stand behind each other.”

In Greensburg, Payton encountered locals and people from nearby communities at protests. One woman, who had never attended a protest before, went on to attend multiple. 
“That just solidified the purpose of our movement,” Payton said, “letting people know that what we feel is going on in this country, state, is wrong and we can voice our opinion in a non-violent manner and build community.”
Stanton observed she’s seen “more flak, negative flak, online than I ever have in-person,” at protests she’s organized.
For the Sisters of Saint Francis, reactions have been positive. 
“People are really glad that we, as women, religious sisters, are out there voicing their values and concerns. Naturally, there have been some who are opposed to it,” Poinsette said
Beyond protesting, the Sisters of Saint Francis have displayed banners on their front lawn since 2019, including a Black Lives Matter banner. Another time the banner welcomed refugees and immigrants.
Despite some negative encounters, Martz believes protesting is powerful, “even if we’re not changing minds of people who are very set on what they believe,” it ensures people who are upset with what’s going on feel less alone.
“Just because we live in an area represented by Republicans doesn’t mean everybody out here is a Republican,” Martz added, noting rural Indiana isn’t a monolith.
She estimated approximately 40% of District 55 and Batesville vote independent, rather than a straight Democrat or Republican ticket.

General Election turnout figures from 2024 show many voters in the following rural and suburban Indiana counties are not voting straight-ticket.

Besides raising awareness many groups hold collection drives at protests to give back. Stanton collects food and hygiene products at her protests to “give something tangible” to the community.” Martz and her fellow organizers have tried to include food drives at every protest to ensure “we’re giving back to the community,” especially as programs like SNAP are cut.
“Nothing will be any different if we don’t take action,” Poinsette said when asked what she felt has been achieved via protesting. 
Paraphrasing activist and Holocaust survivor Elie Wiesel, she added, “silence only benefits the oppressor. If I am silent, I’m saying it’s okay that ICE is acting the way they’re acting and it’s not okay. I don’t want all this. I don’t want health care ending. What the Republicans are doing, in cutting money for Medicaid, is going to be the end of a good number of rural hospitals. All the money through that bill [H.R. 119] that they’ve given to the ultra-rich and programs they’re taking away from ordinary people; all of that is wrong. It’s against the gospel, it’s against what God wants for each of us.
“I’m not going to just be quiet and let that happen,” Poinsette said. “I’m only one person but it’s not going to happen. I’m not going to act like I’m okay with it. Whether anything happens because of this — I’m just not going to be silent. That was the problem in World War II — people stood by and did nothing.”

Before (left) and after (right) photos of the mudslide and cleanup on State Route 20 following an Aug. 11 mudslide. (Washington State Department of Transportation)State transportation officials say they are making the limited dollars for highway and bridge preservation stretch as far as they can — but it’s not far enough.
There’s too little money to keep up with repaving roads, repairing aging spans and responding to emergency fixes.
“We are in the early stages of critical failure due to lack of funding,” Troy Suing, director of capital program development and management for Washington State Department of Transportation, told a state panel Tuesday.
“We are doing everything we can to squeeze out as much service life as we can,” he told members of the Washington State Transportation Commission. “We are underfunded. We are forced to be reactive when we look at our assets right now.”
It’s going to take billions of dollars to handle the maintenance and preservation backlog, and “significant additional investment” to get ahead, Suing said in a sobering presentation echoing past messages of agency leaders.
Two years ago, Roger Millar, then department secretary, warned the state transportation system was “on a glidepath to failure” due to continued underfunding of preservation of highways and bridges. Former Gov. Jay Inslee voiced similar concerns, saying lawmakers dumped too much money into new projects in recent years and too little into preserving existing roads.
Earlier this year, the Legislature approved a two-year $15.5 billion budget with $900 million for preservation for the next two years, well shy of the $1.6 billion transportation officials estimated is required to keep pace with regular wear and tear.
Suing, the transportation department official, cataloged some of the challenges.
He said 40% of the state’s lane miles, about 7,900, were due or overdue for paving in 2024. Of those, 670 miles got paved.
This year, the agency decided to spend most of its paving budget in the first half of the biennium, creating a gap when the 2026 construction season arrives. It is preparing to carry out $170 million of additional paving next year, but the work hinges on getting additional funding in the preservation program.
Bridges are another story. Of Washington’s 3,427 spans, 10% are more than 80 years old. 
Suing emphasized that “if they’re open, they’re safe” to drive on. That doesn’t mean they don’t need attention. For example, of the roughly 100 steel bridges due for painting, fewer than 10 got done in 2024.
When an emergency occurs that potentially requires closure, the effects ripple through communities.
A semitruck crash in August caused millions of dollars in damage to the White River Bridge connecting eastern King and Pierce counties. As repairs began, the span was entirely closed for weeks, then reopened to alternating traffic. It is expected to fully reopen in the coming weeks.
On the other hand, the Carbon River Bridge won’t reopen anytime soon. In April, the state permanently closed the 103-year-old structure on State Route 165 due to severe, unexpected deterioration of its steel supports. It provided access to Mount Rainier National Park’s Mowich Lake Entrance, Carbon River Ranger Station and other outdoor recreation areas.
“When we don’t preserve the system, it affects everybody,” Suing said. “This is a long-term commitment. There is no short-term fix when it comes to bridges.”
Last month, Washington State Department of Transportation Secretary Julie Meredith sketched the agency’s multi-billion-dollar need in her formal submission for the 2026 supplemental budget. She didn’t ask her boss, Gov. Bob Ferguson, for more money to address unfunded and underfunded “critical needs.” 
In a Sept. 15 letter, she explained that her budget request reflects “a constrained approach” that sought funds only for such things as fuel rate changes and utility and insurance cost increases that occurred since adoption of the biennial spending plan in April.
But she included two documents showing that nearly $1.5 billion more per year is needed for preservation, operations and maintenance, and safety programs collectively. And billions more on top of that are required to keep Washington State Ferries afloat and to remove or replace culverts that pose barriers for migrating salmon.
“Critical needs remain unfunded,” she wrote. In the area of preservation alone, she warned that decades of underfunding “put the health of our existing [transportation] system in jeopardy” and led to “more frequent and severe failures and diverting resources to emergency fixes.“",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/highway-20-august-2024-mudslide-1024x558.jpg,,,2025-10-16 07:56:50.778223

This story by Phil Dodd was first published in The Bridge on Oct. 14, 2025
In hopes of securing a state flood grant to help rebuild the one road into Montpelier’s Country Club Road — an estimated $7.2 million project — the city is rushing to recruit developers to buy some or all of the property. To that end, city council has once again hired consultant White + Burke to help.
It remains uncertain whether the city will be able to recruit a developer in time — even if, as suggested by White + Burke, it offers to sell the property for $1. Nor is it clear whether the state will have any grant money left to fund a tentatively planned second round of grants this winter.
Planning Director Mike Miller. said that originally, the city planned to file the application by the grant’s Sept. 30 first round deadline, but paused after the state said it wanted “shovel-ready” projects. With the ultimate goal of bringing housing to the site, the city council formed a subcommittee to find a developer before the unconfirmed second round of grant funding.
Under the grant terms, a developer should focus on building lower income housing, likely rentals or shared-equity homes. To meet federal requirements, a total of 70% of the state’s flood grants have to benefit low- and moderate-income households, which have 80% or less of the county’s area median income. In Washington County, that amounts to $70,240 or less.
The state has $64.7 million to award in grants, but requests in the first round of funding are about double that amount. This has raised the question of whether there will be any money left for a second round.
“We are very confident that there will be a second round [of funding],” Miller noted in an Oct. 3 email. “We have had more than one state official confirm that they expect a second round.”
But Housing and Community Development Deputy Commissioner Nate Formalarie told The Bridge that since the first round was “oversubscribed,” the state will have to analyze the first round of applications before reaching any conclusions.
“We have decided to push back determination on if there will be a round two,” he said. “We will make a determination on round two and announce that decision and application timelines in early 2026.”
In the meantime, the city is pushing ahead. In order to recruit a developer and apply for the grant, it has signed another contract with consultants White + Burke. Montpelier has already paid White + Burke about $500,000 for prior planning on the same project, and the firm has also consulted on Montpelier’s downtown TIF district, now disbanded, and a public parking garage project, since failed.
The motion to sign the new one-year contract narrowly passed at the city council’s Oct. 8 meeting, with Mayor Jack McCullough voting in favor: Cary Brown, Sal Alfano and Ben Doyle also voted in favor; Pelin Kohn abstained; Jim Sheridan had left the meeting prior to the vote; Adrienne Gil voted against it. The vote came after an extended executive session about the contract that contributed to the meeting going until almost midnight.
Steve Whitaker, a city critic who believes Montpelier needs to do more of its own planning, said the contract had not been made public before the vote and that the work had not been put out to bid to anyone other than White + Burke. 
The now-public contract — titled “Exclusive Right to Market Agreement” — states that White + Burke have “exclusive right, power and authority to act as Owner’s real estate agent for the listing, marketing, sale or exchange of the Property.”
The city will pay White + Burke for listing and selling the property in two ways, first in an amount “not to exceed $50,000 without prior Owner authorization.” And second, if within 10 years of a closing Country Club Road is developed such that its taxable value reaches $5 million or more, White + Burke gets 3% of that value, not to exceed $300,000. A cover memo from White + Burke notes the contract does not include detailed project planning, including how to negotiate a purchase and sale agreement and prepare a financing strategy.
Earlier this fall, White + Burke principal David White warned city councilors that Country Club Road is “not an easy project” and it was possible that no developer would come forward.  But he also said, “this can work,” and cited significant increases in the grand list his firm helped achieve in downtown St. Albans.
Even before the contract was signed, White + Burke employee Stephanie Clarke had been working with the council’s Country Club Road subcommittee at a rate of $250 per hour. The current timeline, which Clarke called “ambitious,” has the subcommittee developing a Request for Qualifications by Oct. 16. 
Later, in December, the city would issue a final Request for Proposal (RFP), which would lead to choosing one developer or a team of developers. Miller has recommended the RFP focus on the “lower ten acres” of the total 30 acres of developable land.
Clarke suggested that to attract developers, the city should “strongly consider” offering to sell the property for $1 and possibly waive city permit fees and sewer and water hook-up fees.
The city purchased the land for $3 million for recreation and housing purposes about three years ago after voters approved the idea by a 54% to 46% margin. As the project has dragged on, some councilors and residents have called for selling the property, but for now the council is trying to facilitate housing development.
Earlier this year, the councilors settled on the infrastructure work they hope will be funded by grants and allow development to take place. The infrastructure plan was based on work by Vanasse Hangen Brustlin, Inc., which the city hired under a $110,000 design contract.
The $7.2 million infrastructure project includes installing new water and sewer pipes from the nearby roundabout to the top of Country Club Road, raising a section of U.S. Route 2 as much as three feet to allow a better connection with the road, relocating the road to align with the right-of-way, and reducing the grade of the road to 12%, still steeper than the current city standard for new roads.
The city is applying this month for a $3 million “Catalyst” grant from the Northern Border Regional Commission to pay for a portion of the work. If that grant is successful, the city will apply for $4.2 million in the tentatively planned second round of the state flood grant funding. If not, it will apply for the full $7.2 million from the state in the second round, if there is one, according to officials.

(Ron Cogswell | used by permission of the photographer)University of Wisconsin campuses could be limited in their ability to raise tuition under two Republican bills that received a hearing in the Senate Universities and Technical Colleges committee. One would leverage tuition freezes on campuses as a penalty for free speech violations, while the other would aim to help with affordability for students and families by capping tuition increases.
With the conclusion of the budget process over the summer and a $250 million investment in the UW system, Democratic and Republican lawmakers have recently turned their attention to potential policy changes that could be made to the higher education system in Wisconsin. Democratic lawmakers announced their own proposals for helping with higher education costs last week.
Implementing financial penalties on UW, technical colleges for free speech violations
Rep. Amanda Nedweski (R-Pleasant Prairie) said her bill would enshrine the principle of current University of Wisconsin system policy in law to clarify and protect the First Amendment rights of students, staff and visitors. 
Current UW system policy includes its commitment to freedom of speech and expression along with some accountability measures including conduct and due process mechanisms to address violations. 
A similar bill passed the Assembly in 2023, but failed to receive a vote in the Senate. Earlier versions of the policy were introduced after a controversial survey of UW campuses that found that a majority of students who responded said they were afraid to express views on certain issues in class. The survey had an average response rate of 12.5% across all UW System campuses. 
The latest iteration of the bill was introduced just six days after the assassination of right-wing activist Charlie Kirk, who has become a recurring point of discussion and debate. Lawmakers passed a resolution this week to honor his life.
Nedweski noted that another survey by the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression (FIRE) that found that 35% of students say using violence to stop someone from speaking on campus is acceptable at least in rare cases. The survey included responses from 423 people. 
“It’s clearly even more chilling in light of the recent political assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk on a college campus. When we accept the false premise that speech is equivalent to violence, we allow violence to replace speech as a means of debate… We’ve seen many of our college campuses devolve into marketplaces of fear of certain viewpoints,” Nedweski said. “While Charlie Kirk’s assassination on the college campus is the most extreme example of this, it is not the first time conservatives on campus have been threatened or intimidated for their views.” 
Nedweski said the bill would help restore trust.
“The breakdown in public trust is real. It will only get worse unless our colleges and universities get serious about restoring intellectual diversity on campus, I believe,” Nedweski said. 
SB 498 would bar UW institutions from restricting speech from a speaker if their conduct “is not unlawful and does not materially and substantially disrupt the functioning of the UW institution or technical college.” It would also restrict enforcement of time, place and manner restrictions on expressive activities in public forum spaces, designating any place a “free speech zone,” charging security fees as a part of a permit application and sanctioning people for discriminatory harassment unless the speech “targets its victim on the basis of a protected class under law, and is so severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive that it effectively bars a student from receiving equal access to educational opportunities or benefits.” 
If an institution is found to violate the provisions by a state or federal court, then it would receive a notice and a person whose expressive rights were violated would be able to bring action against the UW Board of Regents or a technical college board. A plaintiff could be awarded damages of at least $500 for the initial violation plus $50 for each day after the complaint was filed and the violation continues up to $100,000. A plaintiff could also be awarded court costs and reasonable attorney fees. 
Students, employees and campus organizations would have a due process guarantee under the bill. If the due process provisions are violated more than once in a five-year period, a campus would be required to freeze tuition for all students for the following two academic years.
Nedweski said she hadn’t spoken with the UW system about the legislation this session, but she is open to conversations. 
“I’ve expressed it from the start of the session for the UW to come and work with us on this to get to a place where they can be a thumbs up, but I haven’t heard from anyone,” Nedweski said. “They will express some concerns about certain language in the bill and definitions, and I’d like to say today that, of course, the door is still open.”
UW Interim Vice President of University Relations Chris Patton that the system’s concerns with the bills center on the penalties. 
Patton said the penalty of freezing state funding would put the system’s financial health at risk — and potentially compromise the system’s ability to carry out its mission of being a “marketplace of ideas.” 
“Freedom of expression and free speech is not just a constitutional principle. It’s at the very core of what makes our universities thrive,” Patton said. “The First Amendment guarantees this right, and our institutions take seriously our responsibility to uphold it for all students, faculty, staff, visitors and stakeholders at the Universities of Wisconsin. We already have really robust policies and procedures in place.”
Sen. Rachael Cabral-Guevara (R-Appleton), a coauthor on the bill, urged lawmakers to “please understand” that the bill is “not to punish any of our institutions,” but is to “ensure that they’re following what’s already in the Bill of Rights.”
Sen. Chis Larson (D-Milwaukee), the top Democrat on the committee, expressed concern about the aims of the legislation, whether free speech was a top concern that was widespread on campuses and whether the bill could bolster harmful language. 
“I appreciate you guys coming up here to embrace DEI for Republican viewpoints, which this seems to be what this bill is all about — making sure that Republican viewpoints are more represented and encouraged and being inclusive to that,” Larson said. 
“You can call it DEI for conservatism, but there’s nothing in the bill that addresses anything specific to conservatives, liberals, Republicans, Democrats,” Nedweski replied. “It’s free speech protections for everyone.”
Larson noted that he represents the UW-Milwaukee campus and often speaks with students about their concerns and free speech is typically low on the list. He said he hears concerns about affordability and safety more frequently. 
“Other concerns include safety, especially for students who are LGBTQ, students who are of a different race than Caucasian, of their safety on campus, of being targeted with hate crimes,” Larson said. 
Larson also brought up a recent Politico article, which exposed racist messages sent into a group chat of Young Republicans, to ask whether lawmakers thought their bill could encourage that type of speech. 
Larson said he wasn’t concerned with self-censorship that discouraged people from “saying these racist, homophobic, xenophobic, glorification of rape things out in the public, because that is something that in a free and open society should have consequences associated with it.”
“We do not have the exemption for hate speech in our laws and in the First Amendment. It does not exempt hate speech,” Larson said. “It seems to me that this [bill] would pave the way to be able to say, yes, that would be something that is not only allowed on campus, but encouraged.” 
Nedweski said she was not concerned that the bill would “further unhinge people.” 
“We’re all concerned about the political temperature that has risen so high in this country,” Nedweski said. “I don’t have concerns this bill is going to push anybody overboard. The intent is to protect people whether I agree with what their ideas… are or not. I have no association with the group that you’re talking about. I don’t agree with the things that they said. It’s unfortunate that that happened.”
Capping tuition increases
Under SB 399, the UW Board of Regents would be prohibited from increasing undergraduate tuition by more than the consumer price index increase in a given year. 
The bill, coauthored by Sen. Andre Jacque (R-New Franken) and Rep. Dave Murphy (R-Hortonville), was introduced this year after the UW system adopted its third consecutive tuition increase in July. The increases were a maximum of 5% for each campus and were implemented after the recent state budget did not reach the requests the system said would be needed to avoid a hike. 
“With the continued rising prices in almost every area of the economy, some increase in resident tuition is to be expected but we must set common sense guardrails so that any price increases are reasonable, ensuring the UW system remains a cost-effective option for Wisconsin families,” Jacque said. 
Jacque said the recent hike “might be the impetus for the timing this session” but he has seen it as a “reasonable policy” for a while, noting that versions of the bill have been proposed in previous years.
Murphy said he thought the legislation would make it so that lawmakers don’t “have to always be looking” at tuition.
“It’s just up and down and up and down and up and down,” Murphy said. The bill, he added, would help provide a semblance of predictability down the line. “If you have a youngster in the K-12 system and you’re looking at what college is going to cost in the future, you could probably have a good idea of where it is going to go.”
Larson said he found it “noble” what the Republican lawmakers were trying to accomplish with the bill, but asked about why there wasn’t any state contribution included in the bill.
He noted that the portion of state funding that makes up the UW system’s budget has been decreasing over many years. 
“It’s like the cost of groceries,” Larson said, comparing it to “shrinkflation,” a form of inflation where the price of a product stays the same but the size or quantity of a product is reduced. “We’re gonna freeze the cost of a loaf of bread, and then year after year, you’re going to get one slice less, one slice less, one slice less. It will still be the same cost, but you’re getting less. I worry… if you freeze it, we’re going to be getting the equivalent of one slice less every single year in terms of what the deliverable is from the University.” 
Murphy noted that the legislation would just cap increases, not freeze tuition.

(Photo by Fernando Lopez/Capital & Main)NEW ORLEANS – When a Dollar General stocker named David Williams saw two of his co-workers struggling to subdue a would-be shoplifter who was carrying a knife in 2019, the then-33-year-old kept his mouth shut. Later, when a co-worker asked him why he did nothing, Williams told him the truth.
“I said, ‘No offense, but I only get paid one time, and that is to be a stocker,’” said Williams, who today makes $11.50 an hour filling shelves with diapers, ramen and discount shampoo at a New Orleans store. Some months, he said, he can’t make rent. ”So, sorry, I’m not about to put my life on the line,” he told his colleague.
What Williams needed, he thought, was a better job. He wasn’t looking to unionize his workplace — a tall order in the right-to-work South. He just needed things to change.
In 2022, Williams joined an organization that seemed, to him, like his best shot: Step Up Louisiana. Like several successful campaigns before it, Step Up organizes workers to improve their jobs, but stops short of calling for a union under the National Labor Relations Board. The approach, sometimes referred to as “premajority unionism,” is a natural fit for places like the South, with histories of public hostility to unions. Today, suggest experts, it may also be workers’ best bet for building power amid the hostility of the Trump administration.

The United States is home to 20,700 Dollar Generals, 8,000 Family Dollars and 9,000 Dollar Trees.
“Anywhere there’s a dollar store, from here to California to New York, the working conditions are the same, unfortunately,” said Kenya Slaughter, a lead organizer with Step Up. Founded in 2017, the group — which has no official ties to any union — organizes grassroots members around economic justice issues in Louisiana and Tennessee.
“We’re not against unions,” she said, but starting off with a demand for one, she explained, doesn’t make sense given the dollar store model.
“We’re all fighting for the same thing,” said Williams. “You know you’re sick and tired of how you’re being treated.”
Williams, like most workers in the dollar store campaign, complains of short-staffing; researchers say Dollar General employs an average of eight employees per store. Other complaints include constant turnover; low wages; crumbling and filthy stores; and security so poor that several workers have been slain on the job.
Dollar General did not answer questions about wages or its treatment of workers, but said in a statement, “Ultimately, we strive to create a work environment where employees have opportunities to grow their careers, serve their local communities and feel valued and heard.”

The traditional remedy for workers like Williams has been to organize a union, including filing for an NLRB election, a process standardized in the 90-year-old National Labor Relations Act. But the act was not written with the 15.6 million U.S. retail workers in mind.
“The NLRB works best for single-site companies with one clear owner,” said Kate Bronfenbrenner, director of labor education research and a senior lecturer at Cornell University.
While most dollar stores have a single corporate owner, their workers are spread in tiny clusters across the country. Under U.S. labor law, each dollar store would have to unionize individually, or face the additional challenge of an election across multiple stores. Today, only 4% of retail workers in the U.S. are unionized. That is even lower than the private sector average of just under 6%.
Even before the second Trump administration, Bronfenbrenner said, the National Labor Relations Board had evolved over decades into an agency with little enforcement power.
“Before we basically dismantled the regulatory state, which is what’s happening now, the NLRB could force an election, but they can’t force a contract because there’s no penalty for employers who refuse to bargain other than a piece of paper saying, ‘Go bargain.’” she said.
Employers have long dragged out negotiations with impunity, with first contracts taking an average of 459 days to negotiate. Indeed, workers at Starbucks and Amazon won NLRB union elections in 2021 and 2022, respectively. They have yet to get a contract — and the improvements to their jobs one would bring.
The NLRB’s limitations are no secret to unions — even those successful in organizing under it. “If your campaign is relying on the National Labor Relations Act, you will not win because the employer knows how to defeat it,” said Kurt Petersen, co-president of Unite Here Local 11. His 32,000 member union has grown by strategically pressuring employers into agreeing to remain neutral during organizing drives and to recognize unions under card check. (Disclosure: Unite Here is a financial supporter of Capital & Main.)
The National Labor Relations Board has become even more challenging for workers since Donald Trump reassumed office, said Bronfenbrenner. “It’s totally dysfunctional,” she said of the agency. It has effectively been paused since January, when Trump fired Biden appointee Gwynne Wilcox from the board. The move left it without the quorum required to issue decisions. In the months since, at least one anti-union law firm has begun instructing clients to consider resuming illegal captive-audience meetings, and the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the NLRB’s authority is unconstitutional, further eroding the agency’s legal status.
Indeed, after a surge in NLRB elections under President Joe Biden, the rate of workers unionizing appears to have plummeted since Trump reassumed office, according to National Labor Relations Board data analyzed by Kevin Reuning, a political scientist at Miami University of Ohio. In the first nine months of 2024, 80,434 workers formed new unions, according Reuning’s site, Unionelections.org. During the same period a year later, only 47,085 workers had done so.

For Mckenzie Midgette, a four-year Dollar General veteran who now works full-time organizing dollar store workers in Tennessee, the situation is clear. The NLRB is not going to save dollar store workers. Instead, she said, “We need to learn how to [organize] ourselves.”
In New Orleans, Step Up’s organizing yielded raises in local stores after about 18 months. After launching their campaign in mid-2020, workers held rallies, marched on Dollar General’s annual shareholder meeting and took their plight to the media. In 2023, Dollar Tree (which at the time owned Family Dollar) announced national wage increases of up to 25%, raising wages by $2 an hour; Step Up says Louisiana Dollar Generals followed suit. The following year, Dollar General approved a proposal that Williams made at a shareholder meeting that called for a company-wide safety audit.
But there are limits to how much workers can achieve without a union, cautioned Bronfenbrenner. Without a contract guaranteeing basic work conditions and a voice for workers, every improvement can be taken away without notice.
“The goal of this whole thing is to change workers’ lives, and that’s done by having a union contract in the workplace.” said Local 11’s Petersen.
Moving forward, experts say workers are going to have to work outside of NLRB elections to improve their jobs. “That absolutely has to happen,” said Bronfenbrenner. And in some places, it already is.
In the Carolinas, Alabama and Georgia, another worker group called the Union of Southern Service Workers (backed by the Service Employees International Union) has been organizing retail workers (including dollar store workers), workers at low-paying restaurants like Waffle House, and home health care aides. After demanding $25 an hour and safer working conditions, and staging walkouts, they saw success at Waffle House. Last June, the company announced a pay increase from $2.13 an hour to $5.25 an hour by 2026. (Disclosure: SEIU is a financial supporter of Capital & Main.)
In New York City, app-based delivery workers, typically classified as independent contractors and therefore without the right to organize an NLRB union, have also had success without calling for a union. In 2023, two years of intense organizing by Los Deliveristas Unidos yielded a new city law mandating a $21.44 (as of 2025) minimum wage for app-based restaurant delivery workers. This year, the law was expanded to include grocery app delivery workers.
These nontraditional campaigns are only likely to become more appealing given the Trump administration’s current posture, said Jennifer Abruzzo, general counsel for the National Labor Relations Board during the Biden administration.
“Workers are taking matters into their own hands,” she said. “The board isn’t functioning, and workers are educated about their rights and recognize their power. You’re going to see unions and workers, even without unions, perhaps not filing charges with the NLRB, but taking up the issue themselves by ticketing or protesting or striking.”

(Getty Images)Indiana education officials on Wednesday unveiled major updates to the state’s proposed school accountability system — including new reading and “back on track” indicators — as they work to finalize rules that will replace the state’s former A-F grading model by the end of the year.
The presentation to the State Board of Education marked the second draft of the overhaul first released in June. Under a state law passed earlier this year, the Indiana Department of Education must deliver a final plan by Dec. 31 that aligns school ratings with the state’s “Graduates Prepared to Succeed,” or Indiana GPS, framework.
“This is critically important public policy for education in Indiana,” said Ron Sandlin, IDOE’s chief innovation officer. “What we’ve built is a model that values both academic mastery and the knowledge, skills and experiences that make up a student’s full story — not just a test score.”
The latest proposal keeps the state’s A-F letter grade scale but revises how those grades are calculated. 
Schools would earn points based on each student’s academic achievement and additional indicators such as attendance, literacy progress, work-based learning and credential attainment.
Sandlin said the revision “creates more consistency” in how points are awarded and simplifies the system so that “the average Hoosier can look at it and feel comfortable.”
Measuring every student
A central change to the proposal is what Sandlin and Indiana Secretary of Education Katie Jenner described as an “n of one” model in which school quality is evaluated based on the outcomes of each individual student rather than aggregated percentages.
“Every single student matters,” Sandlin told the board. “Their success as an individual should inform school success — not the averages of large groups where individual stories get lost.”
Jenner added that Indiana is “forging ahead” by measuring both academic mastery and real-world skills. 
“Please call us on it,” she said. “Academic mastery, assessment and accountability matter in Indiana — regardless of what the federal government does or does not do — but there are other things that matter as well.”
Jenner also pushed back against critics who argue the approach softens academic expectations.

“There is a movement around the country lowering cut scores,” the education secretary said. “Indiana is standing firm. We have a tough assessment. We just believe there’s more to a child than if they pass or fail a test.”
Cindy Long, executive director of the Indiana Association of School Principals, said her group supports the latest changes, especially the grade 12 shift toward diploma seals. She also praised revisions that allows schools to earn credit in other ways even if they don’t meet attendance goals.
Board member Byron Ernest called the asset-based approach “awesome,” saying it will finally let data “tell a story” about each learner. 
Board member Erika Dilosa additionally stressed that the new framework “isn’t punitive” but “creates opportunities for students that may have been overlooked in the past because they didn’t quite fit.”
Addressing concerns — and pushing for progress
Still, board member Kathleen Mote worried how the term “approaching proficiency” might be interpreted, and said the terminology might signal the opposite to parents and the public.
“We are using the same labels for these things, but now they have very different definitions, and there is dissonance there that we have to figure out how to resolve,” she noted.
Indiana unveils first draft of overhauled school accountability system to replace A-F grades

Sandlin responded that the department will review the terminology to ensure it clearly communicates student progress but made clear that schools “will not earn maximum points” for students who “are not proficient.”
“We want to encourage progress,” Sandlin told Mote. “If you’re ‘approaching proficient,’ but you’re making enough progress to eventually reach proficiency, it does earn you maximum points. We’ve inherently built in … an incentive for schools to help (students) reach that next step, and to receive the credit as (a student) makes the necessary progress to get there.”
Sandlin emphasized that the model “does not take the gas pedal off,” even as students improve, “because we know there’s more (they) can do.”
Board member Scott Bess addressed other concerns that the new accountability model might be softening academic standards by placing less emphasis on high-stakes test scores.
He acknowledged that some national experts have argued that Indiana may be lowering expectations — and said some of the state’s education partners “will be chippy on this one” — but made it clear the state intends to “stand firm” on its approach.
“There is a body of thought out there that says, ‘Nope. It’s are you proficient, or are you not? And that’s it.’ And if you deviate from that, then you’re somehow lowering standards, or you’re excusing people and passing them through,” Bess said.
“This model … is making sure that each student is achieving something,” he added. “The field clearly believes that this is a step in the right direction.”
‘Put(ing) our money where our mouths are’
The first draft of the proposed accountability rule, unveiled in June, tied school ratings to the Indiana GPS system, emphasizing literacy and math in early grades, work-based learning and credentials in high school, and a mix of academic mastery and skill development indicators across grade levels. 
Officials said that draft sought to capture a fuller picture of student performance beyond test scores but left some details undefined, especially around how certain skills and benchmarks would be measured.

In response to months of feedback, the second draft adds several new and clarified indicators designed to better reflect student growth and school effort, Sandlin said.
A new “Accelerated Literacy” measure gives schools credit when students flagged as “at risk” on the second-grade IREAD exam later pass it in third grade — a change meant to reward successful reading interventions. 
A companion “Adolescent Reading” indicator extends that recognition to upper elementary grades, too, allowing schools to earn points when students who failed the IREAD later demonstrate proficiency in grades 4 through 6.
At the high school level, a “Back on Track” indicator acknowledges schools that help ninth-graders who fall behind on credits catch up by the end of 10th grade. Another draft adjustment provides flexibility for biology testing, letting schools earn points for students who complete the end-of-course biology assessment in any grade — fixing a technical issue that previously credited only those who took it in grade 10.
For grade 12, new Indiana Diploma seals — which reflect whether students meet college, employment or service “recipes for success” — would further serve as the universal outcome for graduation, Sandlin noted. 
That benchmark would replace the SAT as the central measure of high school performance and instead align the new accountability model with the state’s new graduation and diploma requirements.










Every single student matters. Their success as an individual should inform school success — not the averages of large groups where individual stories get lost.


– Ron Sandlin, IDOE’s chief innovation officer


“We’ve said that there are multiple pathways to success,” Sandlin said. “This shift puts our money where our mouths are. And it says, if you earn an honor seal, or if you earn an honors plus seal, you are on track for success.”
The rule also formalizes a transition period through the class of 2028 so current students earning Core 40 diplomas are not penalized before the new diploma and seals take effect.
Next steps towards adoption
Indiana’s school accountability grades have been in flux for years.
The state’s A-F rating system has been effectively suspended since 2018 due to transitions in state testing and COVID-related disruptions.
During the pause, schools instead received performance report cards posted online. The cards offered data on test scores, graduation rates, attendance, and postsecondary readiness, but stopped short of assigning a single letter grade.

The shift to an updated model is part of a broader effort mandated by House Enrolled Act 1498, signed into law earlier this year. The legislation, authored by Rep. Bob Behning, R-Indianapolis, requires the state education board to adopt a new school accountability model by the end of December, with implementation beginning in the 2026–27 school year. 
Education officials said the overhaul aims to merge elements of the previous accountability model with a simpler, more transparent grading system that parents can understand — and that focuses less on “penalizing” schools.
“We want a model that encourages schools to focus on improvement for each individual student — our n size is 1,” Sandlin said. “Because every single student’s story deserves to count.”
The second 30-day public comment period opened immediately after Wednesday’s meeting and will run through Nov. 17, when a public hearing is scheduled at the Indiana State Library. 
IDOE staff said the department  expects to bring a final accountability rule to the board in December for adoption.
“We’ve tried to build a model that is inclusive of more elements that we believe matter. And we very, very humbly, in Indiana, want to hear constructive feedback from partners,” Jenner said. “It would be easy for us to immediately build a pass-fail system. … We just believe we have to look at the full child picture. We have to think about education differently. The status quo is not getting us anywhere.”
Jenner said another round of public comments will be “so important” as the board gets closer to final adoption.
“We’ll probably have a few tweaks here and there before we land it,” she said, “and that’s exactly why this process matters.”

Programs in Idaho that support foster children have unique challenges across the regions, but lately, nearly all of them are reporting the same problem — children seem to be entering the state’s care with increasingly complex cases. 
Some of those cases involve much more severe abuse and neglect than in past years, according to interviews with multiple advocates for foster youth. 
“During the course of all of our 30 years up here in the First Judicial District, there were maybe a handful of aggravated (abuse and neglect) cases,” said District 1 Court Appointed Special Advocates Director of Development Kristin Linville Ludwig. “This year, we have had four in the First Judicial District alone. So that’s bad, and nobody wants that to happen.” 
Advocates point to several factors contributing to this. One factor includes an early 2024 Idaho court decision that appeared to prompt a steep decline in child removals and entry into foster care by law enforcement.

From 2015 to 2023, the average number of foster care entries initiated by law enforcement was around 948 per year, according to data from Health and Welfare. In fiscal year 2024, there were 633 entries by police. In fiscal year 2025, which ended June 30, the number was 263.
Other factors include isolation from the COVID-19 pandemic, and federal and state policies that emphasize more on prevention and reunification with biological parents, several foster child advocates said.
Children in foster care are represented by a trained volunteer Court Appointed Special Advocate, or CASA, and each judicial district in Idaho has a program to train and support these volunteers. The Idaho Capital Sun spoke to leaders from all but one district CASA program; the East Idaho District 7 office could not be reached by publication time.  
Linville Ludwig oversees the program in North Idaho, which has seen a decline in the number of children entering the system but she said her volunteers have noticed an increase in complexity of cases.

As of Sept. 23, there were 1,172 foster children in Idaho, down slightly from 1,400 children at the end of June last year.
Jean Fisher — administrator of the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare Division of Youth Safety and Permanency and former longtime Ada County prosecutor who specialized in crimes against children — said she’s also seen a rise in complexity. 
“Whether that is both mental health, behavioral health, and the type of abuse and physical abuse that they have endured, I think all of it is much higher than it used to be,” Fisher said. 
 Advocates: Pandemic one of the factors in the severity of child protection cases  

The reasons for the increasing severity are hard to track, but multiple CASA leaders told the Sun that the COVID-19 pandemic and isolation seemed to have a lasting effect. 
“Coming out of COVID, we started to see some really frightening things more regularly than we had been,” District 6 CASA Executive Director Lesli Schei said. 
Schei’s district covers Bannock, Bear Lake, Caribou, Franklin, Oneida and Power counties. 
She said with children not going to school and spending more time in their home, there weren’t as many other adults able to report suspected cases. If a child is being abused in the home, it tends to worsen over time, she said. 
“It was a very stressful time to work in child protection,” Schei said. “And I think that trend somewhat has continued.” 
Fisher also said the pandemic hampered child protection efforts. 
“For kids who have been experiencing severe abuse or neglect, not only is it just longer years of being in that, but it’s longer years of being in it and isolated,” Fisher said.
The isolation can lead to behavior being normalized for children, Fisher said, which can delay disclosure by the child. 
Zenita Delva, executive director of District 2 CASA, which covers Clearwater, Latah, Lewis, Idaho and Nez Perce counties, said the number of foster children dropped significantly during the pandemic and hasn’t returned to prior levels. 
Delva said the north central CASA program was serving 54 children in September. It had typically served around 150 to 200 children at a time a few years ago, she said. 
“COVID obviously did a little bit of that, but it should’ve picked up afterwards, but it hasn’t,” she said. “It’s just continually decreased and decreased.” 
Maggie Thompson, director of programs for the Fourth District CASA program in Ada County, said number of foster children in the region are also declining. The program, which also serves Boise, Elmore and Valley counties, was actively serving 288 children in September. Last year, the program served a total of 461, down from 516 the year before and 550 two years before. 
Linville Ludwig, of the North Idaho CASA group, is also seeing cases going down. The program has about 76 active cases, she said, and the group has averaged about 240 cases a year. Prior to the pandemic in 2020, the group used to serve about 450 cases a year, she said. 
 An Idaho court decision may have limited law enforcement’s role in child removals  

In 2017, a Health and Welfare social worker and Ada County Sheriff’s Office detective visited a trailer after an anonymous report from a neighbor regarding loud crashing sounds and a child with an “unexplained black eye.” 
The detective and social worker determined the inside was “filthy,” reporting water puddled on floor, clutter strewn throughout, and feces and urine filled and were crusted onto the toilet, according to court documents. 
The detective told the parents during the visit that she thought the children were in imminent danger and took them into state custody. A judge soon decided to keep the children in foster homes for a few weeks to ensure the trailer remained cleaned. 
The parents challenged the removal in federal court.

In early January 2024, U.S. District Court of Idaho Judge David Nye ruled that the detective violated the parents’ constitutional rights by removing the children without a warrant. In the case, called Ingram v. Mouser, Nye ruled that the dirty house did not indicate the children would have been in imminent danger in the time it would have taken to receive a warrant for their removal. 
After the decision, there was a steep decline in child removals and entry into foster care from law enforcement. 
Fisher, of Health and Welfare, said the courts have tried to create a system to provide warrants over the phone that would help expedite removals if needed, but not every law enforcement office is using this method. 
“We literally have law enforcement agencies across the state that are refusing to do this work now, and they are claiming that it’s about liability, even though the courts have provided the mechanism for this to happen,” Fisher said. “And I feel like they kind of take a hands off approach to this. I do think that we are missing a number of children out there.” 
Only a judge or police officer may decide to remove a child from their parents’ custody. Social workers with the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare may do assessments and make recommendations to prosecutors, but they do not have authority to remove children.

Delva, of the second district CASA, said she’s seen a significant decrease in child removals by law enforcement in Nez Perce County. In a September interview, Delva said the county saw a police officer remove a child recently, but that it was “the first removal in years.” 
“Very seldom does that happen,” she said. 
The Nez Perce County Prosecutor’s Office does not track the number of child removals by law enforcement, a staff member told the Sun. 
“We’re just seeing some really crazy things that are happening, definitely not in children’s best interest,” Delva said. “There’s no way we only have 50 kids that are abused in this district, there just isn’t.” 
 Some advocates concerned prevention-first policies are keeping some kids in situations too long

Not every district saw a decline in foster children, but most CASA leaders said volunteers are seeing a higher severity of the cases that do come in. 
“I’ve been an executive director for 18 years, and I probably in the past two years have seen the worst cases that I’ve ever seen come across, and pretty significant abuse,” said District 5 CASA Executive Director Tahna Barton. 
Her district covers Twin Falls, Blaine, Camas, Cassia, Gooding, Jerome, Lincoln, and Minidoka counties. 
She said many of these children have been experiencing significant abuse or neglect for a long time before being removed and placed in foster care.
“I don’t know why we’re not catching them sooner,” she said, “or if we’re trying to work a prevention plan with them, most of the cases that do come in are prevention plans that have failed.” 
In recent years, state and federal child welfare authorities have shifted toward policies meant to prevent removal of children from their homes by providing families with services to keep the environment safe and healthy for their kids. 
In his first term, President Donald Trump signed the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, which included the Family First Prevention Services Act. The act included federal funding focused on prevention services. 
This year, the Idaho Legislature approved a budget for Health and Welfare that highly emphasized prevention. Former agency director Alex Adams announced a primary focus on improving the state’s foster care system when he took over in June 2024. Adams and his Deputy Director of Child, Youth & Family Services, Monty Prow, have both highlighted shifting to prevention. 
In foster care, Idaho Department Health and Welfare budget proposal focuses on prevention

Prow in a previous interview with the Sun likened the focus to building a fence around a large cliff rather than paying for the ambulance at the bottom. 
“Would you rather invest in fences or ambulances?” Prow said at the time. “It’s very clear. Research is clear that investing in avoiding the fall from the cliff is far better for everybody. Not just the youth, not just the family, but the community.”
The agency’s approved budget this year included 36 new staff positions focused on prevention services, including visiting homes regularly to assess safety and providing or connecting families with services, such as for mental health, anger management, or substance use treatment, the Sun reported. 
In fiscal year 2025, 89.3% of removals from families were primarily due to neglect, according to data provided by Health and Welfare. In fiscal year 2025, neglect accounted for 59.7% of removals. 
Many of the CASA directors told the Sun they aren’t privy to prevention cases, as they only are involved once a child is removed and enters the court system, so they can’t know how many are successful. 
Fisher, of Health and Welfare, said that many of the prevention cases are successful, but she can see why the advocates may get frustrated when they see a case that’s come in after a long time. 
“People then look at it and say, ‘well, you’ve had this case for a whole year, and look at all the problems.’ But it’s not because we haven’t tried to keep this family out,” Fisher said. “We’ve worked with them, we’ve done everything that we can, and now we know that we know they need the services and bring them into the court and that kind of more expansive oversight that we try to avoid if we can.” 
Elisha Horrocks, who oversees the District 3 CASA program in southwest Idaho, said she’s unaware of successful prevention plans in her area, but that “the failed prevention plans we do see are usually the worst abuse.” 
Thompson, whose CASA program in and around the Treasure Valley, said that in some of the severe cases she’s seen, it has been when prevention didn’t work. She doesn’t think the focus is all negative, however. 
She and other CASA directors agreed that prevention cases for families who are in need of services, such as help buying groceries or other basics, are better than removing children from their parents in many situations. 
“There is a very fine line between poverty and neglect,” Thompson said. “And as a private citizen and a human being, I don’t believe that parents should be punished for living in poverty. … It’s so easy to Monday morning quarterback the Department of Health and Welfare because we get to see what happens when reasonable efforts aren’t possible to keep a family together.”
 Idaho Health and Welfare has a plan to keep children safe in prevention or removal cases 

Each person interviewed by the Sun said the increasing severity of abuse may stem from a complicated combination of factors — including some prevention policies, the pandemic, as well as economic hardships and increasingly poor mental health nationwide.
However, when it comes to a factor Health and Welfare can control, Fisher said she wants to focus any prevention effort on the safety of the children. 
She is spearheading a return to use of a tool that she believes will help children in these cases expeditiously get to the best outcome for their situation. 
Earlier this month, she initiated training using what are called “poor prognosis indicators,” which are national standards to determine if a child would be better served by reunification or termination and permanency in the form of adoption by another family. 
“They’re national indicators that would really be able to help our social workers critically think through cases where they, based on what those indicators are, might understand the case a little bit better from an earlier perspective that this case clearly has some reunification efforts that are very strong,” Fisher said.
If the indicators suggest a “poor prognosis” for the child, then case workers would try to move more quickly toward placement in foster care and eventual adoption so children aren’t “languishing in foster care,” Fisher said.
In advance of rolling out this method, the agency analyzed its cases from 2023 and 2024 with the indicators and found they often accurately predicted termination of parental rights. 
“It was astounding how accurate the indicators were,” she said. 
Training began regionally at the beginning of October and is expected to finish by the end of December, she said. 
“If we can reunify children with families, that is a goal, and that’s great, but that’s not our job.” Fisher said. “Our job is the safety of children.” 
Barton, of the District 5 CASA program, noted that prevention-first policies and the Ingram v. Mouser decision occurred around the same time, and said it was “a perfect storm” for child welfare cases that raised alarms for her and other advocates. 
Barton and every leader of Idaho CASA programs who talked to the Sun expressed a strong desire for improved outcomes in foster care, but also a belief that change was possible. 
“It’s been my experience that the system is broke,” Barton said. “But within that system, there are a lot of people that care, and a lot of people that are doing the best they can with what they’ve been given … They’re really passionate and care about our children. And I think that easily gets lost in the finger pointing and the blaming.”

The tiny school at the foot of the Bighorn Mountains posted the highest WY-TOPP scores across science, math and English language arts — for the second year running. How do they do it?
The post Meet the married couple steering Ten Sleep School to top academic marks appeared first on WyoFile .","TEN SLEEP—On a rainy Thursday in September, English teacher Jessica Jackson stood in a second-floor classroom talking with a handful of high school students about gothic literature. The topic was timely, given the season and weather. 
Jackson’s students were writing an original horror story for an ongoing project. The class discussed the nuances between horror and thriller genres, the works of Edgar Allan Poe and elements of gothic fiction like supernatural forces. Conversation ranged from historical context to Hitchcock films to the antiheroes of comic books.
Students were engaged but casual. They did not give the impression of educational automatons being drilled for the sole purpose of scoring high on standardized tests. 
And yet, testing excellence is one thing they do. Ten Sleep K-12 School topped the state in the latest Wyoming Test of Proficiency and Progress scores, earning the highest proficiency in all three content areas tested — for the second year running, and by notable margins. 
Ten Sleep’s proficiency scores of 77% in English language arts, 81% in math and 84% in science were well above statewide averages of 56%, 51% and 51%, respectively.
So, what’s the secret to their success? 
There isn’t one silver bullet, school officials say. But to understand the dynamic factors, head to the administrative offices. Annie Griffin occupies the desk of Washakie County District 2 superintendent, while her husband, Robert Griffin, is the school’s principal.

Having a married couple helm a school’s administration isn’t ideal in every situation, and it could even lead to disaster. But the Griffins share a cohesive vision and decades of experience, from classroom teaching to implementing education policy. 
In Ten Sleep, their goal is to provide truly individualized education — something arguably more achievable in this tiny school, which serves just 108 pupils in kindergarten through 12th grade. A class size of around 10 per grade makes it an environment where staff can assess every kid and tailor to his or her needs, the Griffins say. 
But success also entails reframing the whole idea of teaching, so that it’s less about what the teacher taught and more about what the students learned. Once educators make that fundamental switch, Annie Griffin said, teaching to mastery becomes more attainable. Not that it’s easy. 
The difference is in “not giving up until that student masters it,” she said. 
The Griffins have also worked to nurture Ten Sleep’s long-running academic pride. They want students and staff to embrace and celebrate academic excellence just as much as school communities do when a sports team wins a state championship. 
After all, Robert Griffin said, “this might be the best form of a state championship to win.” 
Data dive
The current picture of academic testing scores in America isn’t exactly bright. 
The latest results of the National Assessment for Educational Progress, known as The Nation’s Report Card, showed discouraging declines in math, reading and science scores and alarming increases in students who lack basic skills. 
Even in Wyoming, where students consistently outperform their peers in other states, scores are still recovering from a pandemic-era slump. Wyoming student performance in the 2024-25 WY-TOPP test areas increased by 1-3% over the previous year. But statewide proficiency remains around 50%-55% — far behind Ten Sleep scores.  
The Griffins came to Ten Sleep in 2022 from Ranchester, where Annie Griffin had been principal of Tongue River Elementary School. Tongue River was named a National Blue Ribbon School in 2021, a designation of excellence.

It was a tricky time to start — plans for a new Ten Sleep school building were at 65% completion, they said, and much of the secondary school staff had recently exited.  
That presented challenges and opportunities. On one hand, it was a bit of a blank canvas, allowing them leeway without the resistance to change that can exist when things have been done a certain way for a long time. 
“We were fortunate enough to walk into kind of a clean slate, and establish our culture from the moment that we got here, both with students and with staff,” Robert Griffin said. 
“It was a lot of listening, to start,” Annie Griffin added. 
Ten Sleep already had a solid foundation of academic success, Robert Griffin said. The district consistently scored high compared to peers, particularly in ACT testing. 
The Griffins didn’t settle for the status quo, however. The first thing Robert Griffin did as principal was dive into numbers. 
“I went into the data for each student,” he said. “So for every single student, I had an understanding where their proficiencies were. So that kind of pinpoints where you need some medicine, if you will, academically.”
That allowed the Griffins to identify areas for instruction improvement — in this case, focusing on reading and writing, particularly in the lower levels. They began working with staff to execute those changes using evidence-based approaches. 
Thirsty to learn 
Teachers’ openness and adaptability were crucial, Robert Griffin said. 
“Their willingness and desire to perform at a higher standard, I would highlight it as the key feature,” he said. “They wanted to be better. That scenario led us to having a tremendous opportunity to grow students academically.”
For teachers, making sure every student has mastery of a concept takes time and patience. It can be slow and tedious. Going back to fill gaps in foundations is hard work. But it makes a world of difference, Annie Griffin said. 
While not all Wyoming districts enjoy the benefits associated with small class sizes, Superintendent of Public Instruction Megan Degenfelder said Washakie County School District 2 illustrates how a commitment to improvement yields results.

“I am proud of their work and hope that other districts will seek to learn more about how they continue to perform at the highest level in the state,” Degenfelder said.
The Griffins lead by example, said the school’s business manager Rachel Casteel. They are approachable, fair, supportive and work to create a positive environment.
“They care about all of the children, and they care about every single one of the employees that they have here,” Casteel said. 
Those attributes trickle down, she said, and contribute to the kind of organizational pride that motivates both teachers and students to do their best.  
Different paths to education
The Griffins are both products of Wyoming schools. They grew up in Glenrock, where they knew one another but were in different grades. They started dating shortly after high school graduation, and got married at the ages of 18 and 19. 
Annie knew her destiny in about third grade. “I knew from the beginning that I was going to be a teacher,” she said. 
Robert, meanwhile, never entertained the idea of teaching. While she went to college to be a teacher, he served in the military and then pursued a career as a physical therapist. Around that time, he started coaching kids’ sports. He loved it. 
“And then that kind of opened my eyes to the possibility of a profession where you have that experience of working with kids and growing kids,” he said.

They were classroom teachers for many years, learning from mentors and experiences. Teaching for more than a decade in Colorado schools with less per-pupil funding, for example, taught them how to stretch resources.
“But we also knew what Wyoming had to offer, and so we brought our children back,” Robert Griffin said. They relocated to Sheridan County School District 1 when their twin daughters were 3 years old. They stayed for 13 years, Robert working as a classroom teacher and Annie as principal. 
When they saw openings for both principal and superintendent in Ten Sleep, they said, it seemed like a good next step. 
Celebrating 
Construction is still ongoing at the school site, but teachers and classes have moved into the new building, which features updated classrooms and a central assembly space. 
Inside the school that rainy September day, kids and teachers donned pajamas as part of homecoming festivities. 
Ten Sleep School is into celebrating, the Griffins said. They celebrate student growth in performance, academic achievement, sports, project-based learning and career and technical programs. They celebrate when teachers make a difference in a kid’s lives. 
Celebrations, Annie Griffin said, allow them to say, “look what you can do when you just do your best, and look what we can do together.”

Wyoming incarcerates children at rates higher than most states in the nation. New lawmakers reject their predecessors’ efforts to understand why.
The post Fear of government overreach again stymies effort to lower Wyoming’s high juvenile incarceration rates appeared first on WyoFile .","For the third time, freshman lawmakers in the Wyoming House on Monday killed a bill that would have helped the state better evaluate child welfare and juvenile justice programs.
The Department of Family Services and longer-serving legislators want the agency to synthesize data from the multiple systems that serve the state’s families and children. Doing so would allow the agency to better support struggling families before they end up requiring court-ordered interventions, department officials say, but it requires a change to confidentiality statutes.
New House members, however, have stopped the measure over concerns about government overreach into people’s privacy.  
The statute change would also let the agency examine how kids move through the criminal justice system — a question today that largely remains a black box for both outside researchers and government officials. 
Wyoming incarcerates children at rates higher than most states in the nation — in 2021, it was the worst state on that metric.
That year, the Legislature’s Joint Judiciary Committee began examining the juvenile justice system, with lawmakers at the time noting it was costing taxpayers a lot of money to confine the state’s youth. That high cost is paired with poor outcomes for children, who, research has found, do not benefit from incarceration.  
But lawmakers seeking to improve the system quickly ran into a wall.
Depending on where in the state they live, juveniles can see their cases adjudicated in circuit, municipal and district courts. Those different tracks, plus privacy statutes for minors, have made it impossible to follow cases and see how often children make it out of the system or end up incarcerated.
“It became very apparent to this committee and to all of us that work in this space that there’s really no way to know or understand how a juvenile progresses or where those opportunities for intervention may be,” DFS Director Korin Schmidt said Monday.
“It’s impossible for us to even talk about the ‘why,’” behind the high youth incarceration rates, Schmidt told lawmakers on the Joint Judiciary Committee, “because of the disconnects between the systems.”
For now, getting to the bottom of that “why?” will likely remain out of reach.

The House side of the committee voted 6-3 not to advance Schmidt’s bill on Monday. Though the four senators present all backed the measure, legislation must receive majority support from both the House and Senate sides of the committee to earn an endorsement ahead of the session.
“It came down in my opinion to a philosophical vote,” Sen. Larry Hicks, a longtime Republican senator from Baggs who votes deeply conservative, told WyoFile on Tuesday. 
“I’ve been on both sides of that issue, so I understand where everybody is coming from,” Hicks said. “Historically, I was on the side that erred much more on people’s right to privacy than on government sharing data.” His stance changed with time spent in the legislature learning the criminal justice system, he said. 
Schmidt was making her case to a new, and very different, judiciary committee than the one that worked on juvenile justice reform over several years. That committee in 2024 gave the department’s data bill its stamp of approval. 
But when the Legislature largely turned over in the 2024 election cycle, the House side of that committee began this year staffed by freshman lawmakers, many of whom align with the conservative Wyoming Freedom Caucus. Those lawmakers rejected the DFS bill twice during the last session. The House Judiciary Committee rejected the measure at the session’s beginning. Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Jared Olsen, a Cheyenne Republican, revived the bill and the senate passed it, but then the House Labor, Health and Social Services Committee again voted it down. 
Schmidt and Rep. Lloyd Larsen, a longtime Republican representative from Lander who has advocated for the bill, told WyoFile that after three rejections by House committees, there is little appetite left for another run at it this coming session. 
Instead, Larsen said, the new lawmakers may need to build their own understanding of the state’s juvenile justice systems in order to advance solutions. “For some of these new members this conversation gets stalled out by their lack of historic or institutional knowledge,” he said, “so we have to get back and repeat that work before we can get some of this stuff moved forward.” 
One lawmaker who opposed the bill, Rep. Jayme Lien of Casper, seemed to suggest that repetitive step while explaining to the panel why she would vote against Monday’s bill. 
“My recommendation would be that the Legislature take some time to really put together a good dive into the juvenile justice system and all of its programs together to be able to make one clear, concise bill that fixes a plethora of problems,” she told her colleagues. 
Lien did not respond to a voicemail from WyoFile left Wednesday evening. Two other Republican representatives who voted “no,” Rep. Laurie Bratten of Sheridan and Rep. Joe Webb of Lyman, also did not respond to voicemails from WyoFile seeking comment on their votes. 
“I think there are a lot of things that need to be looked at in this bill to secure data, to secure things that can help our youth and can help families,” Webb said before the vote. “That’s the reason that I will be a no on this is I think we need to look at those things before we impose a bill such as this one.”
Rep. Tom Kelly, also of Sheridan, told WyoFile the bill clashed with his concerns for the privacy of families and minors in the face of possible government intervention. Kelly was endorsed by the Wyoming Freedom Caucus but describes himself as a libertarian-leaning lawmaker. 
“No matter how many times I’ve heard this bill explained,” Kelly said, “all I hear is ‘I’m here from the government and I’m here to help,’ and for someone from my line of thinking, that sends chills up our spines.” 
He did not trust DFS to use the data to evaluate its own programs for effectiveness, he said, or to protect the data and people’s confidentiality from leaks or hacks. 
“As someone who has studied political science for decades,” Kelly said, if DFS were to examine the effectiveness of its intervention, “I can already tell you the report will be ‘we’re doing a great job, we just need more money.’”
It boiled down to a check on power, he said. “She [Schmidt] wants the department to have more power and I don’t,” he said. “I understand she doesn’t want to wield it maliciously, she has good intentions. But my default mode is to not give government more power.”
Schmidt told the committee much of the data in question is on systems maintained by the tech giant Salesforce, which helps provide the latest protective systems. It is also maintained under security standards set by the Wyoming Department of Enterprise Technology Services, the statewide IT agency. 
DFS officials were likely to seek outside help in evaluating data from the juvenile justice system, because it’s largely outside the department’s capabilities, she said in an interview with WyoFile.
And it’s not just the department that wants to analyze what’s working and what’s not for Wyoming youth. Independent academics and journalists who have raised questions about DFS and the state’s handling of juvenile justice also want to see the data restrictions loosened, so there’s more information with which to evaluate and critique the system.
Wyomingites can’t track whether prosecutors and judges in one county are incarcerating kids more than in another, nor determine how that works out for the youth involved. Wyoming law, meanwhile, leaves wide discretion to prosecutors to decide how to charge children accused of crimes in juvenile or adult courts, which can lead to very different outcomes. 
“This is actually for the protection of kids,” Kayla Burd, a professor at the University of Wyoming, told WyoFile in an interview. She’s studied how children in the Wyoming justice system can receive disparate outcomes based on the community they’re in, or based on their race. 
“If we can’t track [youth] outcomes we don’t know what is or what is not working for our communities,” Burd said. “Or maybe we don’t notice patterns of certain [officials] using their discretion in different ways than folks in other counties. I think that is a real problem.” 
Burd later added that state officials focused on the cost of government should want to know if dollars are being spent most effectively. 
“We have high rates of spending on out-of-home placements, and much less funding going towards community-based options, but without better data, we can’t demonstrate how kids are faring, or whether we are devoting dollars to the ‘right’ sources,” she wrote in an email.

As the 2026 election approaches, it's time to start asking hard questions about who embodies our hopes for Wyoming's future, writes Khale Lenhart.
The post Wyoming must elect trustworthy candidates ready to lead appeared first on WyoFile .","Running for office is a big undertaking. Beyond the logistical challenges of running a campaign, it requires candidates to be vulnerable in a way that most of us will never experience. Candidates must be willing to stand before their fellow citizens, express their ideas and values and submit to the decision of their fellow voters. Results are public. There is no hiding when you stand for public office. 

Opinion

This is not a decision that should be taken lightly. It requires an investment of time and effort, and usually a fair bit of money. A serious candidate will often spend years preparing and ensuring that the decision to run is the right one. I have found that the best candidates often enter the race reluctantly. It is exciting to run, but those who know what they are in for often feel their excitement mix with dread for the burden they are taking on. 
For the past several years, I have considered whether running for office would be right for me. I care deeply about Wyoming and her future. I look at our state and see the need for new leaders to step forward. There comes a time when you must answer the call.
When I seriously began thinking about public service, one of the first things I did was take stock of our state’s challenges, my own strengths and interests and where I might be most useful. I spent a good deal of time discussing my ideas with friends, colleagues and those I considered like-minded. A common thread emerged: I should seriously consider running for governor. 
So, I seriously considered it. I spoke with current and former officeholders, political professionals and community leaders. I received far more encouragement and support than I expected, and it soon became clear that this idea was not just a pipe dream. While not a front-runner, I found myself in the position of a dark horse that other potential candidates had to take seriously. One of the most important questions you must ask yourself when making these decisions is whether there is a legitimate path to victory. As I went through this process, I saw a path. It was a narrow path, but a path nonetheless. 
However, just because there is a path does not necessarily mean it is the right one. Beyond just the willingness and the opportunity, there are other important things to consider. Am I willing to take on the responsibility that comes with running this race? Am I willing to subject my family to that experience? If I win, what do I want to accomplish? Am I prepared? Is this the right season of life to try this? These and a million other questions all must be answered.
Ultimately, as I made my decision, two questions rose to the top. First, would I be willing to ask those around me to take up the burden that comes with my running for office and second, would running make it more or less likely that Wyoming would have effective leadership? Based on the answers to these questions, I determined that now was not the time for me to throw my name in the ring. 
But just because I am not running for governor in 2026 does not mean I will not be involved in the process. I have asked the same questions of others considering the race, and because I believe our state’s leadership is important, I will be doing all I can to support the candidate I believe is best equipped to lead our state. I hope others will do the same.  With that said, this column is not where I intend to make my political endorsements. My voice is my own, and other than this note here, I will not be commenting directly on the race in my regular columns. 
All my fellow citizens should participate in this process. We all should be asking the questions I was asking of myself when I considered a run. What do I have to offer? What is my vision for the future? How can I contribute? If we all take these questions seriously, I am confident we will make the right choices. But make no mistake, elections have consequences. The decisions we make about our leaders today will shape our future. The next year will see many conversations about our state’s direction. Let us choose the leaders who deserve our trust.

Solitary confinement, the practice of putting someone in isolation in a small cell, is not a topic you expect to hear discussed at church on Sunday.
But on Oct. 12, at the Madison Christian Community, was a stop of the 18-city, nationwide Journey to Justice Bus Tour, that included two panel discussions focused on the topic, one with four state legislators, including two candidates for governor.
Visiting the Journey to Justice bus, standing in a bathroom-sized solitary jail cell replica and hearing the real-life stories of those who had spent part of their lives confined in such spaces, visitors gained a visceral appreciation of the United Nations declaration that punishing people with more than 15 consecutive days in solitary is a form of  torture.

In the Hollywood presentation, the practice is reserved for hardened criminals, a safeguard against violence that’s necessary to keep good order and discipline.
But the reality is that small procedural violations, medical conditions, mental health crises sometimes even pregnancy are reasons people inside our prisons end up isolated for multiple days at a time.
Those who have experienced solitary confinement, otherwise known as restrictive housing or segregation, say it is traumatizing and even years after they’ve been released from prison, they are still reliving dark memories.
The Solitary and Conditions of Confinement Legislation panel at the church included four Democratic state legislators, including gubernatorial hopefuls  Sen. Kelda Roys and Rep. Francesca Hong, both of Madison. Roys, an attorney, has served on the Judiciary Public Safety Committee and worked on the Innocence Project when she was a law student at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.
Milwaukee area Reps. Darrin Madison and Ryan Clancy also participated. Madison is a former organizer for Youth Justice Milwaukee and a member of the Correction Committee. Clancy sits on the Corrections Committee and has served on the Judiciary and Law Enforcement Committee.

Jen Ann Bauer, who spent five and a half years in prison and is currently serving the remainder of her sentence on community supervision said she was put in solitary confinement at least four times, with the longest lasting 90 days.
“When people hear you’re in solitary confinement, they think discipline, and it is so much more to the detriment of human beings,” she said. “It is isolating. It is defeating. It is control and it is torture. We are often placed in solitary confinement for protection or safety measures, minor and major rule violations, or simply for struggling with trauma and mental health. And let’s be honest, most incarcerated people are already trauma survivors. So I ask, how is isolating a wounded person somehow equal to safety? Solitary doesn’t lock a body in a cell. It locks a person inside their own mind. Time stops and pain does not.”
In solitary, Bauer said, she paced the floor just to remind herself that she still existed.

“Women survive through connection, through relationships, and so when you take away human contact, you take away the very thing that keeps us alive,” she said. “No one is built to handle 23 hours a day in a cell. That’s not discipline, that’s psychological torture.”
She added  that in solitary there is no interaction with outside family members, weakening relationships with children.
Observing  people who spent time in solitary,  she said, she saw that they changed for the worse.
“People with dreams come out of solitary unable to make eye contact, unable to trust and unable to believe in themselves or the world around them,” she said. “Solitary doesn’t confine a body. It suffocates the heart. It doesn’t correct behavior. It destroys identity. Solitary confinement causes psychological and emotional distress, more harm, more trauma. Solitary confinement is not a tool. It is a wound, and it is a wound the system continues to inflict on people and then blame them for bleeding.”

Ventae Parrow agreed with Bauer that solitary confinement  had no redeeming  impact on him in prison other than causing him to reflect on what he wanted for his life. He questioned who had the authority to determine whether one should be in solitary, and noted that many who experienced it came out angrier.
“And now you got angry humans coming out back to the community with the vengeance in their heart and their mind versus rehabilitation,” he said.
Tom Denk, an advocate with several WISDOM affiliates and a member of the Mental Health Action Partnership, moderated the panel. Denk, who had also spent time in solitary confinement, noted there is a high rate of mental illness among incarcerated residents, 45%, and the experience of being isolated exacerbates their conditions.
“The use of solitary confinement or restrictive housing is a correctional practice with significant ethical implications,” said Denk. “Prolonged isolation has been associated with severe psychological distress, including anxiety, depression and increased risk of self-harm. It also worsens existing mental health conditions and contributes to higher rates of recidivism.”
But Denk said solitary is often chosen as a method to address psychosis instead of treatment.
Talib Akbar, vice president of the non-profit advocacy group WISDOM, the organizer of the event, said any rule violation in prison could result in being sent to solitary. He said even being a couple of feet outside a cell door could result in being sent to solitary.

The Wisconsin Examiner recently heard from a former resident of Oshkosh Correctional Institution who said he was put in segregation after calling the nearby fire department to report concerns over the prison’s fire safety protocols. He claims that when the fire department called the prison’s facility manager, the manager became upset that the resident didn’t follow the chain of command, and the resident was placed in segregation.  
The panel also addressed the types of medical treatments residents receive in solitary.
Megan Hoffman Kolb whose father, Dean Hoffmann, died in solitary confinement at Waupun Correctional Institution in 2023,  said her father, who suffered from mental illness for 30 years, didn’t consistently get the right medication for the first 80 days in Waupun and never received a psych intake exam, which he was supposed to have received.
She said when her father recorded a credible threat from his cellmate, the prison’s response was to place him in solitary.

“In solitary, he was locked alone in a concrete cell, 24 hours a day, no books, no paper, no phone calls home, no medication,” she said. “The lights were left on constantly. Silence was deafening, broken only by the sounds of people crying out down the hallway. He told staff he was suicidal, hearing voices and couldn’t sleep. A correctional officer responded, ‘What do you want me to do about it?’”
She added, “Solitary confinement is not just isolation. It’s sensory deprivation. It’s a slow unraveling of a person’s mind in a small space. Days blur together, hope disappears for someone already struggling with mental illness, unbearable, and it’s not just emotional, it’s biological. Prolonged solitary confinement literally changes the brain.”
After nine days in solitary, Kolb said, her father took his own life by hanging himself from the cell door. She had viewed the video of his body being removed.
She said the cost of solitary is the trauma the family has experienced, along with the lawsuits, investigation and broken communities, and at the end of the day, taxpayers are being asked to pay for all of it.
“We are pouring millions into a system that tortures instead of treats,” she said, “and families like mine are left paying the ultimate price.”
Regarding the cost of operating solitary, Akbar noted that prisons have to assign more correctional officers (COs) for supervision there because they are considered more dangerous areas, which also raises the cost.
Rep. Clancy said he is against solitary and the ultimate goal should be to ban it outright, but a more attainable goal is proposed legislation that would restrict solitary to 10 days and require 15 hours a week of programming while in solitary to ensure there are visits by people.

“When you talk to people at the DOC and they say, ‘Well, we looked at your legislation, it is onerous. There’s no way we’re going to be able to do that.’ We’re like,‘Great, then don’t put people in solitary.’”
He added, “Please understand that the goal here is to end solitary, but it’s also to bring to people’s minds the real harm from it.”
Rep. Madison said he grew up with a friend who went to prison and was put in solitary, and when his friend got out he still struggled with isolation. One time, the friend wasn’t able to contact Madison and then attempted suicide but didn’t die.
“I was reminded that it is our correctional system that creates the conditions where folks, even when they are released into the community, feel locked up,” he said.
“We simply incarcerate too many people,” said Roys.  She added the goal should be to ensure public safety, not incarcerate people who don’t pose a threat. 
“If we actually want public safety, then we need to change the way we are thinking about that time when people are incarcerated, and it really should be that time that they are building their skills so that they are going to see that they can thrive, and that is why we need to be fostering relationships,” she said.
She also said there needs to be reform of the Truth-in-Sentencing law that is leading to longer prison stays without parole, resulting in more people in prison, and also reforming community supervision to change  a “gotcha” attitude — finding technical violations of those on extended supervision that would send them back to prison, instead of  focusing on helping people succeed in the community.
“If our parole officers, probation officers (POs) viewed their role as facilitating success, and they judged themselves not by how many people would get reincarcerated, but by how many people succeed and never have to be reincarcerated, that’s transformational, and you don’t necessarily need statutes to do that. You absolutely do need a strong will and strong leadership from the top director who says what we are doing.”
Hong said more could be done through executive orders and the governor’s clemency power to grant pardons. She also said she would like to invest more to hire social and mental health workers.
“The more helpers that we have in an institution, the fewer enforcers we need in that same institution,” Clancy said. 
“We have to stop saying that our jails and prisons are understaffed,” he added. “They are not understaffed. They are overpopulated.”
Clancy also said the DOC should pay mental health staff as much, or more, as it does  guards, to help hire and retain staff.
Women in solitary
During a panel discussion on women in solitary, Julie Bliefnick said that after she was assaulted inside  a prison while eating lunch, she was placed in solitary for six days, and during that time she had her monthly period, but male guards didn’t allow her to shower or have clean clothes. She had a similar experience in a county jail.

“That’s some of the most dehumanizing experiences of my whole life,” she said.
In another jail, Bliefnich witnessed a friend who was eight months pregnant put in a cell and stripped naked to look for drugs as the friend screamed.
“You can even move from that environment for decades, and you can still dream about it,” she said.  “You can still think about it like til this day, like I can hear jingling keys, and I’ll still get like, you know, like a fear of like a guard coming to, you know, harass me about something or another, and it’s a terrifying thing because I’m not there anymore. You know, your brain tricks you into thinking that you are. You carry it with you no matter how long you’ve been removed from it.”
Jessica Jacobs, who has not been incarcerated for eight years, still said she is traumatized by her time in solitary.
“Various times I’ve been incarcerated, being stuck in a room like that kind of did something different to me that maybe other people might not understand,” said Jacobs, “but so I had post traumatic stress disorder already, and then the amount of treatment that I had to suffer and go through while I was incarcerated has made it worse. And so I find myself today, sometimes where I get overwhelmed or stimulated, I know my nervous system is out of whack, where I feel like I have to close myself up into my room, and that’s kind of weird, you know, and I feel like I have to lock myself up, and I just don’t even try to figure out what it is. I know that it’s connected to that.”
Jacobs said she remembers being locked up with a 17-year-old girl who had been sex-trafficked by her father, and the girl was missing her babies and was distraught and wanted mental health services, but Jacobs cautioned against it, knowing that seeking those services often meant being sent to solitary or being restricted to a chair.
“And the next thing I know, they hauled her off and stuffed her in solitary confinement by herself,” said Jacobs. “And then came the big banging and the cries began.”
Yolanda Perkins said her mother was in prison for 17 years and spent time in solitary, and that time changed her mother permanently.
“My mother hasn’t been incarcerated in about 20 years, but she won’t go into a room by herself,” said Perkins, adding, “It affects how she grandparents her grandchildren. It affects her communication with them. It affects her communication with society. And so she still struggles.”
Bliefnick spoke about her work with the Ostara Initiative, working with doulas to end the practice of putting pregnant and postpartum women in solitary for protective custody.
“Punishing women who are in that condition is actually a common practice,” she said, “and I mean, can you think of anything worse than putting a woman who just had a baby and had it ripped away from [her getting] 24 hours in solitary confinement like that? That’s like a horrible practice to begin with. It’s like they treat them like cattle, and then to put them in solitary confinement for their protection is like the cruelest thing that you could possibly imagine.”

Judge Richard L. Young, of Indiana’s Southern District Court, noted that courts can only grant such dismissals when a complaint’s claims aren’t plausible. He found that the lawsuit’s First, Fourteenth and Twenty-Sixth Amendment allegations cleared that bar.
“The court fails to see how — absent any indication of fraud unique to student IDs — general fraud concerns can likewise justify the elimination of a form of photo ID that has been accepted for 20 years and otherwise complies with the voter ID law’s neutral requirements,” the denial reads.
Indiana’s 2005 photo ID law requires that government-issued documents include the prospective voter’s name, photo and a valid expiration date to be considered “proof of identification.”
Public college and university ID cards with those details were valid at the polls — until July 1, when Senate Enrolled Act 10 took effect. The term “proof of identification,” according to the new law, “does not include a document issued by an educational institution.”
Voting rights groups Count Us IN and Women4Change Indiana, along with student Josh Montagne, filed suit in May, about two weeks after the law’s passage. They claim the law imposes an undue burden on Indiana students’ right to vote and discriminates on the basis of age.
Indiana elections chief defends voting ban on ‘unsecured’ student IDs after legal challenge

The state has argued that concerns about voter fraud, as well as the variety of student IDs, justify the ban.
In his denial, Young observed that students may struggle more than others to get an alternate form of ID. They are less likely than other Indiana residents to have a driver’s license, he wrote — or have the time, transportation and documentation needed to get a state ID card.
He described the law as imposing “a somewhat heavier” on students’ and young voters’ right to vote, which “requires stronger scrutiny of the state’s asserted interests.”
The state’s interests — fraud fighting and consistency — were found to be not “particularly strong.”
During the legislative process, officials repeatedly argued that a student ID doesn’t prove someone is an Indiana resident.
But, Young noted, Indiana’s voter ID law was designed to verify that someone at the polls is the person they claim to be, not to check residency. It also allows photo IDs issued by the federal government, which don’t include state residency information.
The state has also argued that the ban solves inconsistencies between student IDs issued by public universities, which are eligible, and private universities, which are ineligible.
Before the ban, any form of ID that met the criteria was allowed, but now, public college or university IDs are “categorically excluded” even if they do meet the requirements. Young added that exceptions for types of ID that don’t meet the criteria — Indiana Code has a lengthy list of federal documents without expiration dates — still qualify for the polls.

(Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)Mayor Lee Harris has declared a state of emergency in Shelby County, citing a strain on local resources caused by the surge in federal and state law enforcement deployed to Memphis by Gov. Bill Lee and President Donald Trump. 
The declaration, issued last week and announced publicly Tuesday, cites pressures on the county’s already-overcrowded detention center as a result of an estimated 200% increase in daily arrests made by members of the Memphis Safe Task Force. This state-federal partnership has brought hundreds of outside law enforcement personnel, including the Tennessee National Guard, to the city.
Shelby County includes all of Memphis, as well as a few smaller cities. 
The local state of emergency will continue “until the end of Memphis Safe Task Force operations or until detention facility populations are reduced to capacity level or below,” the declaration read. Lee this week said the operation could “last forever.”
Tennessee governor predicts lengthy Memphis crime fight

The emergency declaration, Harris said this week, frees up spending rules to respond to an increase in arrests, detentions and other costs incurred by law enforcement activity.
County leaders are also contemplating separate legal action to protect residents against “some of the unconstitutional actions we have seen and heard about” during traffic stops and arrests by task force members, including reports of racial profiling, Harris said.
Shelby County is at least the second American county to invoke an emergency declaration in response to Trump’s deployment of law enforcement to blue cities in a stated effort to combat crime and crack down on immigrants without legal status.  The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors earlier this week enacted a state of emergency to aid families impacted by immigration enforcement.
In issuing the emergency declaration, Harris cited state law typically only invoked for severe weather, natural disasters and pandemics to spend money and enter contracts without going through the regular  appropriations process, reassign staff and request state emergency funding.
The emergency order also broadly directs all county departments to “take whatever steps necessary to protect life, property, public infrastructure, and to provide such emergency assistance deemed necessary.”
Memphis task force using TN ‘buffer law,’ preventing up-close recording of police activity

Hundreds of state and federal law enforcement officers – among them officers with the Department of Homeland Security, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the FBI and Tennessee Highway Patrol – were dispatched to Memphis in recent weeks after Trump issued a Sept. 15 order establishing the task force to “restore law and order” to one of the nation’s biggest majority Black cities. 
As of Wednesday, the task force had made 917 arrests, according to the U.S. Department of Justice. Where all of the arrested individuals are taken remains unclear; 173 were detained on “ICE Administrative warrants” and local attorneys speaking alongside the mayor this week described clients sent to ICE detention facilities out of state. 
But other task force arrestees are being taken to the Shelby County Detention Center, a department official confirmed. 
Shelby County jail officials have long faced criticism for persistent overcrowding and inhumane conditions inside the city’s central detention center, conditions that preceded the recent surge in the task force arrests.
Currently the Shelby County Detention Center holds 2,932 individuals, according to the sheriff’s department spokesperson. The center has a 2800-bed capacity.
Harris contemplates legal action against task force
Shelby County officials are “weighing some sort of legal action in order to put a stop to some of the unconstitutional actions we have seen and heard about,” Harris said, citing anecdotal reports that had come to his office of racial profiling in traffic stops. 
He also aimed sharp criticism at the president and the governor for the actions taking place in Memphis.
“There’s nothing more unconstitutional than the comments made by Donald Trump and others that they’re going to send military forces, the National Guard or whoever else they need to American communities,” Harris said. 
“We have seen our governor be in some of those rooms and instead of rejecting that kind of talk and reminding those in the room that some of their talk imagines actions that are unconstitutional, our governor sat silent and said nothing.”

​​The rate of firearm deaths rose in nearly every category: adult suicide, child suicide and homicides of both adult and child victims. 
The latest numbers put Tennessee seventh in the nation for the rate of gun deaths.
A record number of Tennessee children — 96 — were killed by guns in 2023, the most recent data available shows. In the past ten years, firearm fatalities from all causes increased by 41% in Tennessee.
State Sen. Heidi Campbell, a Nashville Democrat, blamed Republican policy decisions on the rising gun deaths at a news conference held to highlight the gun fatality data.
Report: firearms remain leading cause of child deaths in Tennessee

“There’s no mystery here,” Campbell said. “Republican lawmakers have made it easier for criminals to get guns, and it’s harder for kids to grow up safely. The result is predictable. It’s more shootings. It’s more fatal suicides. And it’s more dead children.”
Republicans rejected Democrats’ efforts to enact red flag laws, strengthen background checks and enact safe gun storage laws, Campbell noted. 
Tennessee Senate Democrats created their own database to track gun deaths in Tennessee following their unsuccessful efforts to enact gun restrictions after the 2023 mass shooting at The Covenant School in Nashville claimed the lives of three children and three adults. 
The database, “Tennessee Under the Gun,” shows that over the past ten years, firearm fatalities involving children increased overall by 128%. Firearm suicides among children rose 115% and firearm homicides for children rose 114%.
Tennessee House Majority Leader William Lamberth, a Portland, Tenn. Republican, blamed “leftist policies that favor criminals” for crime rates in Tennessee.
“Tennessee Republicans have proven that it’s possible to strengthen both freedom and public safety,” Lamberth said.” Unfortunately, in the few urban areas governed by the same Democrats who commissioned this so-called ‘study,’ crime has spiraled out of control due to leftist policies that favor criminals.” 
Lamberth pointed to the arrival of hundreds of federal and state law enforcement in Memphis in recent weeks, including the Tennessee National Guard, as evidence of Republicans’ commitment to combating crime. The Memphis Safe Task Force is a state-federal partnership initiated by President Donald Trump and Gov. Bill Lee. 
“The success of the Memphis Safe Task Force has shown us in just two weeks that it’s not difficult to crack down on crime; you only need leaders willing to do so,” Lamberth said.“Republicans will continue to defend the constitutional freedoms that make our nation strong, and we will use every state and federal resource available to stop the crime wave plaguing our state’s blue cities.”

(Photo: Galen Bacharier/NC Newsline)This is one of multiple stories published by NC Newsline around the first anniversary of Hurricane Helene, documenting communities recovering in western North Carolina. Read the previous stories here and here.
SWANNANOA — For two Saturdays a month, residents of Swannanoa have the chance to shop for fresh produce.
The farmer’s market kicked off earlier this year, a new effort from a local nonprofit that cropped up after Hurricane Helene’s floods devastated the community.
Ingles off Highway 70, the town’s only nearby grocery store, is closed indefinitely due to storm damage. For those with cars, the easiest option is a drive up the road to Black Mountain. For those without, it requires a lengthy bus trip.
The bi-monthly market is the latest effort from advocates to fill the gaps, along with Bounty & Soul, a nearby nonprofit long focused on food insecurity. But try as they might, there’s no replicating a full grocery storefront.
“It’s not putting a dent in the system, really,” said Sierra Cranford, the creative director of Swannanoa Resilience Hub and manager of the market. “It’s just what we can do right now.”

The incorporated community, a 15-minute drive east of Asheville, was one of the areas hit hardest by Helene. The Swannanoa River’s surging currents washed away storefronts and homes alike. Debris and damaged homes still dot the riverbank cutting through town.
Lacking access to groceries looms large, particularly for those who live in low-income housing and don’t have cars. But it’s far from the only pressing concern in Swannanoa.
Housing in the community has been upended. Countless affordable homes and rentals were destroyed, and most of the remaining properties are more expensive than residents can afford. And a key FEMA buyout program’s slow rollout has left homeowners impatiently waiting, one year later; the state has more than 300 such applications pending before FEMA.
“We have community members … stuck in a situation where they’re paying a mortgage on a house they can’t live in, and paying rent somewhere to live,” said Tonia Allen, executive director for the Swannanoa Resilience Hub. “That’s untenable. These folks are having to access financial assistance repeatedly, because they can’t cover both.”

Swannanoa lacks “large tracts of buildable land,” Allen said, and the priority remains rebuilding owned homes. But rentals are key, she said, in a town that serves in part as “workforce housing for Asheville.” Tenants, displaced into higher-cost apartments, are forced to find aid to pay for them. And some landlords who owned affordable properties locally don’t have the capital to rebuild themselves, she said.
“A lot of people, maybe they inherited this rental,” Allen said. “And they’re living pretty close to the edge.”
Rebuilding downtown Swannanoa: Blunt Pretzels’ efforts to feed locals & a new grocery store
One storefront in Swannanoa’s Beacon Village has become a refuge for the hungry — Blunt Pretzels.
The German soft pretzel spot began handing out free meals after the storm, in tandem with World Central Kitchen. At its peak last October, they were feeding about 2,000 a day. The store established its own nonprofit, Blunt Kitchen.

Over the months, as more locals regained power, water and work, the rush at mealtimes slowed down. Now, in the coming weeks, Blunt Kitchen will instead start creating pre-made meals — ”high-end TV dinners,” volunteer chef Christopher Smith calls them — with the intent to keep feeding those in need without such a logistical burden.
Smith has high hopes for the future, too. He wants the community to know Blunt as the go-to spot in times of need and disaster. They’re setting up a high-powered food truck that’s “ready to feed people on no notice” — equipped with an independent water source and its own power source.
“Next time the s— hits the fan, people will know, okay, Blunt Kitchen,” Smith said. “They’ve got water, they’ve got food. I can connect with my people.”
And Smith wants to teach people how to better ride out the next storm: how to cook with alternative food sources, how to keep things sanitary when water’s not available.
“Do little clinics to set people up for next time,” he said.
Soon, there will be another spot in Beacon Village for produce and food. Two doors down from Blunt Pretzels, an empty storefront is undergoing total renovation. When it’s complete, it’ll be a small grocery store: Rite Buy Grocery, owned by local couple Diana & Justin Rhodes.

“With our major grocery chain closed, it just became really obvious to me that we need more options in the Valley,” Diana Rhodes told Black Mountain News in August.
The store is planning a soft open by the end of the year.

(Photo: John Partipilo)Lake County is among 34 communities in Tennessee selected to receive state funding from the latest $9.6 million round of ThreeStar grants released this month, according to the state’s Department of Economic and Community Development.
For Lake County residents, that means a $750,000 infusion into repairs and renovations for the county’s two community centers in Ridgely and Tiptonville, Lake County Mayor Danny Cook told Tennessee Lookout. The Tiptonville Farmer’s Market will also receive some investment.
The newly revamped ThreeStar program supports local workforce training, health and economic development initiatives, according to the department.
Once counties have been ThreeStar certified (94 of the state’s counties have certification), they are eligible for state programs and grant funding toward their community goals. Distressed counties are eligible for up to $1 million in grant funding, and other communities can apply for up to $250,000.
West Tennessee counties received roughly a third of the award money from this round of ThreeStar grants.
Lake County is among Tennessee’s “distressed” counties —  a designation signifying that a combination of the county’s unemployment rate, poverty rate and per capita market income ranks among the worst 10% in the United States. In the 2026 fiscal year, Lake County had the highest poverty in the state at 32.3%, according to state metrics.
The roughly 166-square-mile county sits at Tennessee’s northwest corner, separated from Missouri by the Mississippi River with Kentucky to its north. The county’s population stood at just under 7,000 people, according to estimates from the U.S. Census 2023 American Community Survey. 
Agriculture is a mainstay of the Lake County economy, as is tourism. The county welcomes more than 600,000 visitors each year to visit natural sites, including Reelfoot Lake State Park and Lake Isom National Wildlife Refuge, according to the Tennessee Department of Economic and Community Development. 
Cook describes the community centers as true “civic areas,” open to community members to rent for things like birthday parties, family get-togethers and other gatherings. The Tiptonville Farmer’s Market is based in an old converted building and hosts well-attended markets every other week, Cook said. 
The funding for repairs and renovation will “make our towns look a little bit better for people coming in, as well,” Cook said. “We want to have attractive and comfortable surroundings for them.”
The roughly $3 million going to projects in West Tennessee counties focuses on bolstering development in community, infrastructure, broadband, industry, tourism and recreation.
Three projects received the highest award amount, $1 million:

Grundy County, for education and workforce development
Hancock County, for downtown development
Tennessee College of Applied Technology (TCAT) Oneida, for education and workforce development.

 Applications for the next round will be accepted through December 30.

June 20, 2025. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — The Nebraska Department of Education is honoring seven “Blue Ribbon Schools” in 2025 after federal education officials ended the national honor roll for high-performing schools.
The U.S. Department of Education had historically honored some of the nation’s schools that performed well on state assessments or nationally normed tests through the National Blue Ribbon Schools program. Terrell H. Bell, President Ronald Reagan’s first education secretary, created the program in 1982.
State officials said the seven Nebraska honorees had already applied and would have met Blue Ribbon standards based on last year’s benchmarks. Four Nebraska schools earned the praise in 2024, and four more earned the title in 2023. About 350 schools were nationally recognized each of those years.
The 2025 Nebraska honorees are:

McDonald Elementary School in North Platte Public Schools (North Platte).
Hillrise Elementary School in Elkhorn Public Schools (Elkhorn).
Ezra Millard Elementary School in Millard Public Schools (Omaha).
Park Elementary School in Kearney Public Schools (Kearney).
St. Isidore Elementary School in the Omaha Archdiocese (Omaha).
Mount Michael Benedictine School in the Omaha Archdiocese (Omaha).
Mary Our Queen Catholic School in the Omaha Archdiocese (Omaha).

“These schools are amazing examples of hard work, focus and the desire for excellence,” Nebraska Education Commissioner Brian Maher said in a statement. “They represent communities from across our state and provide a powerful model for effective and innovative practices for educators throughout Nebraska.”

Federal officials told state education leaders in August that the decision to end the program came in the “spirit of returning education to the states.”
“Awards conceived by those closest to the communities and families served by local schools will do more to encourage meaningful reforms than a one-size-fits-all standard established by a distant bureaucracy in Washington, D.C.,” a federal spokesperson said in August.
The National Blue Ribbon Schools Program honored public and nonpublic schools for exemplary high learning standards or for strides in closing achievement gaps among student subgroups.
Up to 420 schools could be nominated each year under the former national program by top education officials in all states, D.C., Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, U.S. Department of Defense Education Activity and the Bureau of Indian Education. Private schools are nominated by the Council for American Private Education.
Nominated schools submitted a comprehensive application detailing school culture, programs, assessments, instructional practices, professional development, leadership, family and community involvement, according to the Education Department.

 Election 2025
Coloradans are voting on two statewide ballot measures and a variety of local issues in the off-year election. Click here for more of Newsline’s coverage.

Ballots began going out by mail Oct. 10 to all active registered voters in Colorado. The state’s coordinated 2025 election features two statewide ballot measures, Proposition LL and Proposition MM. Depending on where they live, voters will also be asked to weigh in on such items as local ballot issues, city council races and school board races.
Election Day is Nov. 4. Eligible Coloradans can register to vote or update their registration at GoVoteColorado.com. Any eligible voter who registers to vote by Oct. 27 will receive a ballot in the mail. After Oct. 27, eligible voters can still register and vote in person at a polling location until 7 p.m. on Election Day.

Voters who receive a mail ballot can return it through the mail, deposit it in a secure ballot drop box, or drop it off at an in-person polling location. County clerks in Colorado’s 64 counties oversee elections in their jurisdictions, and information about ballot drop box and in-person service locations is available at local county clerks’ websites.
Here’s a look at board elections in Colorado’s five largest school districts by student enrollment.
 Denver Public Schools
Four of seven seats on the board governing Colorado’s largest school district are up for election in 2025: seats representing District 2, District 3 and District 4, and one at-large seat representing the entire city.
As it did two years ago, the DPS race is drawing big spending from Better Leaders, Stronger Schools, an independent expenditure committee, or super PAC, which can spend unlimited sums of money to influence elections but is barred from coordinating directly with candidates. The group’s top donor, Denver Families Action, was founded in 2020 and has roots in the pro-charter “school reform” movement, though its leaders say they have broadened their focus to issues of declining enrollment and school safety, while pivoting away from past reform priorities like standardized testing.
All three DPS board candidates endorsed by the group in 2023 won their elections, and it has reported spending over $560,000 on campaign advertising in 2025 as it looks for a repeat victory. Last month, Better Leaders, Stronger Schools also received a $40,000 contribution from billionaire Republican megadonor Phil Anschutz, according to campaign finance disclosures.
The group has endorsed a slate of candidates consisting of Alex Magaña for the at-large seat, Mariana del Hierro for District 2, Caron Blanke for District 3 and Timiya Jackson for District 4.
Meanwhile, the union representing DPS teachers, the Denver Classroom Teachers Association, has contributed a total of at least $34,188 to the campaigns of four union-endorsed candidates. The group slams its deep-pocketed opponents for “trying to buy influence in our local school board elections.”
The DCTA-endorsed slate consists of Amy Klein Molk for the at-large seat, Xóchitl “Sochi” Gaytán for District 2, DJ Torres for District 3 and Monica Hunter for District 4.
Three other candidates seeking a DPS board seat are not endorsed by either group: incumbent Scott Esserman, who was elected to an at-large seat in 2021, is running to represent District 3; incumbent Michelle Quattlebaum is running for reelection in District 4; and Jeremy Harris is running in District 4.
 Jefferson County
Three of five seats on the Jeffco Public Schools Board of Education — representing District 1, District 2 and District 5 — are up for election in 2025.
Jeffco Public Schools, the state’s second-largest district at over 75,000 enrolled students, includes Evergreen High School, the site of a school shooting last month that left the 16-year-old gunman dead and two other students seriously injured.
Educator Denine Echevarria and IT professional Michael Yocum are running to represent District 1, while attorney Peter Gibbins faces Samuel Myrant in the race for District 2. Both seats are being vacated by current board members. In District 5, incumbent board president Mary Parker is running for reelection against two challengers, mediator Tina Moeinian and Army veteran Gloria Teresa Rascon.
Candidates backed by teachers unions have consistently held a majority on the Jeffco school board since a high-profile recall election that ousted three conservative board members in 2015. The Jefferson County Education Association has endorsed Gibbins and Moeinian in this year’s election.
On Oct. 13, the union rescinded its prior endorsement of Yocum, citing the revelation of a sealed court record that it said was not “disclosed to JCEA during the recommendation process.” The announcement followed a report by the Rocky Mountain Voice, a conservative website owned by former GOP governor candidate Heidi Ganahl, that Yocum in a recording had “acknowledged a deferred adjudication involving a sealed juvenile sexual offense.”
“This does not downplay the actions of political extremists, who are trying to use a complicated and traumatic event from over a decade ago to achieve their own political outcomes,” the JCEA said in a statement. “These harmful political tactics do nothing to support our students, teachers, or public schools.”
 Douglas County
Four of the seven seats on the Douglas County School District board are up for election in 2025: District B, District D, District E and District G.
School board politics in the suburban battleground county south of Denver have been fractious in recent years. After capturing a narrow 4-3 board majority in 2021, conservatives undertook a series of controversial moves, including the ousting of longtime superintendent Corey Wise and revisions to its equity policy, prompting protests from teachers and students. Wise ultimately received an $832,000 settlement from the district, and the district separately paid a $103,000 settlement for violating open meetings laws.
In 2023, three candidates endorsed by the Douglas County Democratic Party swept the school board races. Then-chair Mike Peterson, head of the board’s conservative majority, resigned from his seat the same month.
None of the three remaining conservatives elected four years ago are seeking reelection to their seats in 2025. Like all school board elections, the Douglas County races are officially nonpartisan — but once again, two slates of ideologically aligned candidates are competing in head-to-head contests for each of the board’s four open seats.
The Common Sense DCSD committee aims to preserve the board’s conservative majority, and among the top issues listed on its website is a promise to “fight to preserve girls-only teams, restrooms, and locker rooms,” along with commitments to “parental rights” and “curriculum transparency.” The Douglas County GOP has endorsed the slate. Its candidates are Matt Smith in District B, Keaton Gambill in District D, Dede Kramer in District E and Steve Vail in District G.
The Community’s Voice, Community’s Choice slate, endorsed by county Democrats, emphasizes its candidates’ education experience and promises to make the district “accountable to the people, not politics.” Its candidates are Kyrzia Parker in District B, Tony Ryan in District D, Deborah Kramer in District E and Kelly Densler in District G.
 Cherry Creek School District
Seats representing District D and District E are up for election in the Cherry Creek School District, which serves more than 53,000 students spread across the southeast Denver metro area.
Terry Bates, a financial executive, faces Amanda Thayer, a district volunteer and member of its accountability committee, in the District D race. Bates is running to replace his wife, Kelly Bates, who is term-limited after representing District D for the past eight years.
In District E, Mike Hamrick, an Air Force veteran and retired sales representative, faces Tatyana Sturm, a realtor.
Bates and Hamrick are endorsed by the Cherry Creek Education Association, a teachers union. A newly formed super PAC, Common Sense Excellence, has reported spending $107,000 to oppose the candidacies of Thayer and Sturm. The group received funding from Parents and Teachers United and the Colorado Fund for Children and Public Education, a nonprofit that shares an address with the Colorado Education Association.
 Aurora Public Schools
In the Aurora Public Schools district, which serves over 38,000 students in Adams and Arapahoe counties, all board members are elected at large. Four of the board’s seven seats are up for election in 2025. Voters in the district will cast up to four votes in the field of seven at-large candidates, and the top four vote-getters will be elected.
Two incumbent APS board members, Tramaine Duncan and current board president Anne Keke, are running for reelection. The other candidates are Tapsuru “Ousman” Ba, a nonprofit program coordinator; Gayla Charrier, a small business owner; Hendrix Percival Lewis, a software engineer; Kristin Mallory, a federal contracting officer; and Nino Pepper, a realtor.
The super PAC Students Deserve Better, which received funding from the Colorado Education Association, has reported spending $13,980 on behalf of a slate that includes Charrier, Duncan, Keke and Mallory. Ba has benefited from $16,426 in independent expenditures from a PAC funded by the Colorado League of Charter Schools.

(Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)If you have a mortgage or drive a car, then you are required to purchase insurance. Insurance is a mandated product everyone is familiar with, and we all understand how it works – or so we think.
Insurers write policies that cover our assets and liabilities, and policyholders pay regular premiums for that coverage. The policyholder hopes to avoid the calamity that accompanies accidents and storms but rests easy knowing the insurer will cover their losses if disaster strikes. This is the basic promise of insurance.
The collapse of this core promise is at the heart of Louisiana’s insurance crisis. Insurers are denying nearly half of all claims in Louisiana, according to company data Weiss Ratings analyzed from 2023 and 2024. Meanwhile, premium rates continue to soar, which threatens the purpose of insurance itself: protecting policyholders.
People think insurance companies make most of their money by writing policies, but that’s not the case. They generate most of their profits through investments. You pay regular premiums, and insurers hold those premiums until you file a claim, giving them access to large sums of cash – called the float – that they can invest.
Warren Buffett owns and operates several insurance companies under the Berkshire Hathaway umbrella, including GEICO. According to Buffett, insurers “invest this float for their own benefit.” And the benefit is great. 
According to AM Best, property and casualty insurers turned a record $89 billion in investment profits in 2024. For comparison, 2024 was the best underwriting year since 2006 for property and casualty insurers. They posted a $25.4 billion underwriting profit, still a fraction of the profit generated through investments. In Louisiana, Weiss Ratings reports that insurers have made $55 in investment profits for every dollar they have lost since 2004, which includes hurricanes Katrina, Laura and Ida. 
Investments can be so lucrative for insurers that they aggressively seek opportunities to increase their float. They do this in two ways. Higher rates mean more revenue, and paying out less in claims helps insurers retain that revenue.
Insurers often use natural disasters to justify raising rates, as Louisiana residents can attest. In 1992, Allstate commissioned the consulting firm McKinsey & Co. to rework its claims handling process. It proposed paying out less in claims by denying, delaying and lowballing policyholders to boost profits, a strategy insurers have religiously implemented ever since. 
In fact, the insurance industry has lobbied state legislatures to pass “tort reforms” that effectively write McKinsey’s strategy of minimizing claims into law.
In Louisiana, insurers closed 44.6% of claims without payment in 2024, up from 26% in 2004, according to Weiss Ratings research. Seven insurers operating in Louisiana closed more than 50% of their claims without payment, including Allstate. This closely follows the national trend where insurers closed 41% of claims without payment in 2024, a 16% increase since 2004.
Louisiana’s insurance crisis demands accountability from insurers. They’re paying out a shrinking share of claims while raking in record profits from sky-high premiums and massive investment returns. It’s time for real reform that puts policyholders first, guaranteeing fair rates, transparency and robust protections for the people, not just company profits.",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Baton-Rouge-flood-2016-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-16 06:56:32.274479

The two grants are part of $15 million that the North Dakota Department of Commerce is awarding to 23 tourism projects across the state. The department announced the Destination Development Grants on Wednesday. 
The largest grant was awarded to North Dakota Country Fest to improve accommodations, including permanent cabins, and build a permanent stage for the music festival near New Salem. The 2026 event is planned for July 8-11.

Commerce awarded $3 million to restore the historic Urbain Cote Round Barn near Dunseith and use the surrounding farmstead to create a dairy museum. The agritourism site will include dairy demonstrations, a petting zoo, culinary experiences and sales of fresh dairy and other products. 
The project also includes a 40-unit RV park, birding platforms and farm-themed play areas.
Other grants included $1.2 million for Jurassic Junction near Hettinger to turn a bowling alley into a dinosaur-themed destination and $1 million for the Bear Creek Events and Cultural Center near Fargo area that will expand a winery into a year-round venue. The winery will add lodging, an outdoor stage, pickleball courts, trails, a greenhouse, a wood-fired pizza oven, a marketplace, and a seasonal cider and beer garden.
The department said it received 106 grant applications from 45 communities.

(Photo by Mary Steurer/North Dakota Monitor)North Dakota Insurance Commissioner Jon Godfread is sounding the alarm on the significant increase to health insurance facing tens of thousands of North Dakotans if the federal government doesn’t renew tax credits by the end of the year. 
Unless the federal government takes action, premiums may rise between $378 and $3,735 in 2026, depending on a person’s income level, according to Kaiser Family Foundation data cited by the Insurance and Securities Department. 
“In some cases it could be double, triple or even quadruple what you paid last year,” said Godfread, a Republican. 
He expects the sharply increasing premiums to affect approximately 30,000 North Dakotans. As many as 10,000 may choose to go uninsured instead, based on third-party analyses Godfread has reviewed. 
Godfread isn’t the only one concerned about the looming tax credit expiration. The prospect of more people becoming uninsured in a few months has the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network among those calling for immediate action. 
“These tax credits are incredibly important for individuals that are undergoing cancer treatments or are in need of basic health care, health insurance coverage,” said David Benson, senior campaigns manager for the organization. 
A closer look at what’s driving the rising rate of uninsured children

Losing affordable health insurance also affects those who are seeking preventive screenings to detect cancer earlier, Benson said. 
The state government can’t do much to help. The enhanced tax credits are a federal program. Godfread said eligibility for the credits was expanded during the COVID-19 pandemic and made it possible for a lot of people to gain access to health insurance. 
“During that expansion we saw a number of farmers, ranchers, small business owners be able to qualify for a subsidy and then also able to access health insurance, which we think is a very good thing,” Godfread said. 
Part of the problem is timing. The enhanced tax credits expire at the end of the year. But open enrollment, the two-month period where people have the opportunity to purchase a health insurance plan, begins in two weeks on Nov. 1. 
Godfread worries the higher cost of insurance plans may drive consumers away from the marketplace even if the subsidy is later renewed by Congress before the end of the year. 
“I’ll take any extension at any time over no extension,” Godfread said. “But I think what it could do is cause some confusion. If individuals go in and shop and they see this large increase, they may not come back and shop again if Congress acts and extends these subsidies.”
He’s no longer optimistic Congress will take action before Nov. 1, though Godfread is holding out hope the tax credits will be renewed before they expire on Dec. 31. 
If policy makers want to end the tax credits, which he said were meant to be temporary during the pandemic, they have to create a “glide path” to minimize the impact on consumers and then have a real discussion about how to make health care more affordable, the insurance commissioner said. 
“Insurance is merely an indicator of what services that you’re covering,” Godfread said. “So you can’t really have a meaningful discussion on ‘how do we bring down the cost of health insurance?’ without having a meaningful discussion on ‘how do you bring down the cost of health care services?’ So that would be an absolutely critical component.”
But the first step in Godfread’s mind is renewing the enhanced tax credits so consumers don’t face significantly higher costs and potentially have to go uninsured in 2026. Then Congress can begin looking for a long-term solution. 
“The challenge is the system is what it is right now and there’s incentive to maintain the status quo and it’s the consumer who is being left out in the cold,” Godfread said. “I’m hopeful that this will spur that conversation.”
The federal government is in the midst of an ongoing shutdown in part because Senate Democrats have thus far refused to vote for a stopgap spending bill to fund the government without renewing the enhanced tax credits for health insurance plans at the same time. 
Rep. Fedorchak says Democrats to blame for potential shutdown, addresses ag issues in virtual forum

Rep. Julie Fedorchak, R-N.D., has said the two issues are unconnected and should be discussed separately. 
“This issue does need to be addressed, and it will be addressed,” Fedorchak said in an interview Wednesday with NewsNation. “But I think it’s also very important to recognize that premiums have been skyrocketing, even with these premium tax credits and the enhanced premium tax credits.”
Sen. Kevin Cramer, R-N.D., has said Democrats’ stand has shut down the federal government in order to “score political points.”
“These major health care policy changes Senate Democrats are demanding should be negotiated through the legislative process, not a short-term continuing resolution,” Cramer said in a statement on Sept. 30, the last day the government was open. “Their wish list of demands is not serious and is an act of extortion.”
Benson said these tax credits have led to record enrollments in marketplace insurance plans and have been instrumental in helping thousands of North Dakotans obtain “affordable, comprehensive coverage to be able to prevent, detect and treat cancer.”
“We are urging Congress to act quickly in finding a solution to extend these tax credits,” Benson said. 
Health care costs in North Dakota, already among the highest in the nation, continue to rise. That’s a big reason why the “base rate” of insurance plans in the state is going up next year, with or without federal action. 
The cost of individual health plans will increase by an average of 23.09% for Medica Health Plan, 8.3% for Blue Cross Blue Shield of North Dakota and 5.12% for Sanford Health Plan as a result of recent base rate increases Godfread’s office has approved for 2026. Small group market health plans will also rise by an average of 8.29% for UnitedHealthcare Insurance Co., 6.3% for Blue Cross Blue Shield of North Dakota, 3.91% for Sanford Health Plan and 7.89% for Medica Insurance Company.
“The cost of receiving health care in the state is continuing to rise,” Godfread said. “We have to do something to get our health care costs under control. North Dakota is a very high cost state to receive health care.”

The board held a two-day evidentiary hearing after denying the company the permit in April. The permit falls under Title V of the Clean Air Act and allows Drax’s facility Amite BioEnergy, to become a “major source” of Hazardous Air Pollutants, or HAPs.
The board voted unanimously in favor of granting the permit said Kim Turner, a state assistant attorney general who served as hearing officer. Evidence from the hearing “sufficiently addressed” concerns the board previously had over Drax’s compliance history, Turner said.
MDEQ has found the facility in violation multiple times since Drax opened the Amite County plant in 2016. Last year, the agency fined Drax $250,000 for releasing over 50% more than its permitted limit of HAPs while it was a “minor source.” In 2020, MDEQ fined Drax $2.5 million for underestimating its release of Volatile Organic Compounds since 2016.
For years since learning that the company had underestimated its emissions, nearby Gloster residents alleged that air pollutants, dust and noise from the facility were causing an array of health issues. Several who testified to MDEQ and people who spoke to Mississippi Today reported issues such as headaches, dizziness, nausea and difficulty breathing. Nonprofit Greater Greener Gloster represented those residents as an intervenor in the hearing and asked the permit board to affirm its April decision.

Drax applied for the permit in order to better reflect its production capacity. Since violating the current permit, Amite BioEnergy has had to decrease its pellet output. The company maintained a commitment to staying in compliance going forward, advertising the facility’s ability to automatically shut off when emissions exceeded legal limits.
It argued that the new regulation would be more stringent than any other the company has at its 17 locations in North America.
“ What we’re asking you to do is confirm that if a company works with MDEQ to develop a technically sound, environmentally protective permit  which is feasible and enforceable, then that company can do business in Mississippi,” said Abram Orlansky, an attorney for Drax. 
The United Kingdom-based company turns locally sourced wood into pellets that it then ships to other countries for their clean energy goals, although many scientists believe the practice is actually more harmful than other energy sources in terms of net carbon emissions. Drax and other wood pellet companies have faced a wave of both local and international scrutiny for repeated air emissions violations across multiple Southern states.
The distinction of a major source means that the wood pellet facility no longer has a limit on how many tons of HAPs it can release into the air, but it also means the facility has to follow stricter limits over the rate at which it can release the pollutants.

Extended exposure of large amounts of HAPs can increase the chances of health effects such as cancer, damage to the immune system, neurological, reproductive, developmental and respiratory issues among other symptoms, according to the Environmental Protection Agency.
Much of the hearing’s debate centered on the facility’s “control efficiency,” or how much of its HAPs it could destroy before releasing. While the permit MDEQ presented outlined a 96% destruction rate, witness testimony argued the facility could achieve a 99% rate, which would yield a quarter of the potentially harmful emissions.
“These devices, as installed, could be operated a lot better,” said Ranajit Sahu, an engineering consultant. 
Yet, MDEQ Air Division Chief Jaricus Whitlock said no place he has seen requires such a high rate.
In contrast with April’s hearing, attendees on Tuesday and Wednesday included a dozen or so people with blue “Drax” stickers supporting the company’s permit application. Matt White, the company’s executive vice president, said the local community supported Drax because of its job creation and tax contributions. While Drax staff testified that most of the facility’s employees live within an 11-mile radius of the plant, they could not say how many live in Gloster.

,California,2025-10-16 10:00:00+00:00,CalMatters,Newsom unveils $11 state insulin for Californians: ‘We took matters into our own hands’,Kristen Hwang,,,,,https://calmatters.org/health/2025/10/insulin-california-announcement/,Lawmakers have focused on the high cost of diabetes drugs. The announcement will make state-branded insulin available two years later than the governor originally promised.,"In summary
Lawmakers have focused on the high cost of diabetes drugs. The announcement will make state-branded insulin available two years later than the governor originally promised. 


Starting next year, Californians with diabetes will be able to purchase state-branded insulin at steeply reduced prices, Gov. Gavin Newsom announced today. 
Long-acting insulin pens will be available at pharmacies for $11 per pen — or $55 for a five-pack — beginning Jan. 1. The pens are interchangeable with glargine, the generic alternative for Lantus, a once-a-day injection that regulates blood sugar. An equivalent amount of Lantus sells to pharmacies for more than $92, according to data compiled by the governor’s office, but consumers may pay a different price based on their insurance. 
“California didn’t wait for the pharmaceutical industry to do the right thing — we took matters into our own hands,” Newsom said in a statement released at 3 a.m. Pacific time. “No Californian should ever have to ration insulin or go into debt to stay alive.”
Roughly 3.5 million Californians have diabetes, according to the American Diabetes Association.
Lawmakers at the state and federal level have focused in recent years on the high cost of insulin, a life-saving drug used by diabetics. Price caps set by the Biden administration in 2023 as well as public pressure have driven down the cost nationally, according to health economists. 
The sale of insulin is part of the state’s CalRx initiative aimed at lowering prescription drug prices for Californians. Today’s announcement comes three years after Newsom announced the state would tackle the cost of insulin.  The first vials of insulin will be for sale two years after the governor’s promised delivery date of 2024.
Newsom originally pledged that the state would spend $50 million to contract with Civica Rx, a nonprofit drug manufacturer headquartered in Utah. The state earmarked another $50 million to build a manufacturing plant in California, but has given no updates on that project.
In a statement, Elizabeth Landsberg, director of the state health care access department that oversees CalRx, said the program was “committed to transparent pricing, eliminating hidden costs, and ensuring equitable medication access for uninsured, underinsured, and vulnerable residents.”
Less than a week ago, Newsom signed legislation capping out-of-pocket insurance costs for insulin at $35. 
This is a breaking story and will be updated.

(Photo courtesy of Kevin Maples)Kentuckians organizing “No Kings” rallies say the derogatory labels Republicans in D.C. are attaching to the protesters ahead of Saturday’s gatherings are a sign the anti-Trump movement is gaining momentum.
They also call the claims absurd and untrue.
“I think Mike Johnson and others are using fear to try to divide people who have common interests. And they have no respect for facts,” said Dr. Nancy Henly, a pediatrician and protest organizer in Morehead.
In Northern Kentucky, organizer Ann Dickerson said Trump allies are “threatened by more and more pushback from the general population. And the more people we get out to these events, it can’t just be —  and they know this —  it can’t just be all radical, left-wing, blah, blah, blah. Everyday people, former Trump supporters, are coming out and joining us because they’re starting to feel the pain of what’s been happening. And they’re starting to see the injustice.”

U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson last week dubbed a “No Kings” event set for Washington, D.C., a “hate America rally” and claimed Democrats in Congress don’t want to end the government shutdown until after the protest because “they can’t face their rabid base.” Johnson also said the protesters support Hamas.
One of President Donald Trump’s Cabinet members, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said on Fox that participants across the country are “part of antifa, paid protesters. It begs the question (of) who’s funding it.”
The Lantern interviewed organizers in five Kentucky towns, all of whom said they are unpaid volunteers; several laughed at the idea of being paid.
In Boyle County, Indivisible Danville has no bank account and no designated leader, said Kevin Maples, a spokesperson for the group, which has been holding regular protests, including at the offices of Republicans U.S. Rep. James Comer and Sen. Mitch McConnell.
“If funds are needed we get out our wallets and purses and throw cash in.” Maples said local Indivisible chapters are independent and can apply to the national organization for grants. “We have not done that. We’re not raising money. We’re not asking for money. When money is needed it’s literally mamaws opening up their purses and getting out cash.”
Dozens of groups are partnering with protest organizers nationwide. A Wednesday release from nokings.org says 2,500 protests are planned across the country. Almost 30 are scheduled in Kentucky, a Republican stronghold that President Donald Trump always has carried overwhelmingly.
Organizers acknowledged that inflamed rhetoric aimed at the protesters increases concerns about safety. Some said they’re taking steps in response, including posting more safety marshals, while also discounting the risks in their own towns.
“We’re not afraid because we know our neighbors,” said Maples. “There’s no reason to believe this will be anything other than a peaceful protest. Nonviolence is what Indivisible is about. … We will be joyfully and loudly inviting our neighbors to join us.”
Here are what some Kentucky organizers say about who they are, why they are publicly opposing the Trump administration and the claims by Trump allies that they are anti-American and friendly to terrorists.
Morehead: ‘Don’t give up your rights because you’re afraid’
Dr. Nancy Henly is a pediatrician in Morehead.
“It’s important to me that this be a world that’s good for children. I’m also a grandmother. It’s important to do what I can to keep the world a safe and healthy place,” says Dr. Nancy Henly, a pediatrician who has lived and practiced in Morehead for 40 years.
She grew up and went to medical school in Minnesota where her parents were activists; her father, wounded on Okinawa in World War II, protested the Vietnam War.
They taught her that “sometimes you have to stand up in the street and say that what’s going on is wrong.”
“We’re Americans who want to protect our country from authoritarianism. We want to return to democracy. We’re the real patriots. We’re not scary people.”
Saturday’s protest will be the sixth since April by Morehead’s Indivisible chapter. “We’re not real organized,” Henley says.
“We’re trying to educate people about what’s  happening. Because it’s happening to us. We are all affected by cuts in health care, threats to free speech, due process.”
About 75% of her pediatric practice is covered by Medicaid, which President Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act will cut. Medicaid dollars also are critical to the hospital in Morehead, she said.
She labeled as a “complete fallacy” Republican Rep. Hal Rogers’ claim that Democrats shut down the government to provide free health care to what he called “illegal aliens.”
Henly said the inflamed Republican rhetoric is “a little bit scary. I feel like I’m very safe here.”
At an earlier rally she said a man stood at the opposite end of the park with a sign and “some kind of automatic weapon strapped across his chest.”
In an admittedly intimidating atmosphere, she’s been relying on Timothy Snyder’s book “On Tyranny: Twenty Lessons for the Twentieth Century.”
“One of the lessons: Don’t obey in advance. Don’t give up your rights because you’re afraid. I try to keep that in mind.”
Madisonville: Longtime Republican ‘took an oath to support and defend the Constitution’
Hopkins County native Michael Howard’s history as a registered Republican stretches back decades. As a teenager he thought Democratic President Jimmy Carter mishandled the Iran hostage crisis. He enlisted in the Army at 17 and supported the robust national defense espoused by Republican President Ronald Reagan.

After being a Republican election observer in St. Louis, he was asked to be, and ultimately served, as a delegate to the Missouri Republican State Convention in 2008. 
But he told the Lantern that he doesn’t have much in common with his party anymore. 
 “I’ve never been a party voter. I vote for people, and I try to vote for people of good character, because whether they’re Democrats or Republicans, they’re going to try to do the right thing.” 
“I haven’t changed any. It’s just the world has sort of changed around me, particularly the Republican Party.” 
He remembers feeling baffled that Republicans were supporting Donald Trump in the 2016 presidential primary, despite what he saw as problems with Trump’s character and “incredibly awful” personality. 
Howard — formerly a biology professor and hospital vice president who now leads a nonprofit health coalition in Western Kentucky — has maintained his Republican registration to have a voice in Republican primaries and “keep the worst of the worst” from the general elections in a state that allows only registered party voters to vote in party primaries. 
He’s taken part in local “pro-democracy” rallies led by former Madisonville city council member Mark Lee, in response to Trump’s second term in office.

He’s one of multiple organizers for the “No Kings” protest in Madisonville on Saturday, pointing to the Jan. 6, 2021 riot in the U.S. Capitol as a part of “continuous assaults” on the Constitution.
“I took an oath to support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic. I took that seriously and still do,” Howard said. “He’s just blatantly and obviously going down a fascist, authoritarian pathway, and he’s making no bones about it. That is not American to me.” 
Howard said he’s convinced there is still a “very large group of center-right” people who are “hunkered down and keeping out of the way.”
“It’’s a tough sell, particularly in a small town like this,” Howard said. “Nobody wants to risk the social and economic ramifications of speaking out. They don’t want to lose potential customers or clients, and they don’t want to offend the person in the pew next to them on Sunday, which is understandable.” 
“We’ve got a lot of good people doing nothing, and the time has long passed for people — decent people of good will — to stand up and be heard,” he said. 
Central City: ‘I have no idea if anybody will show up. It doesn’t matter’
After retiring as an organist for her Baptist church in Muhlenberg County’s Central City, Karen Willis has been unable to get out as much as she once did because of chronic back issues. The 83-year-old still finds a way to keep in touch: the mail. 
“I’ve just taken to writing. I’ve always liked writing anyhow,” Willis told the Lantern by phone. “I send out note cards all the time to friends and acquaintances, for any reason or no reason.”

Her mother, who lived to be 96, saved cards she received and also wrote them. Willis sends upwards of a dozen cards a day, sometimes as far as England and Scotland, to her friends. 
“People appreciate them, and they’ll let you know somehow.” 
Last month, as MSNBC host Rachel Maddow talked about “No Kings” protests, she was inspired to write again. 
One of the recipients was Rhonda Wood, a retired math teacher at Muhlenberg County High School. The card from Willis was a declaration of what she was going to do on Oct. 18 — that she “MUST do something” — regardless of her physical limitations. 
“Oct. 18 will be a national ‘No KING’ event and it’s time we did something LOCAL,” Willis wrote in cursive. “I can stand on Broad Street and carry a sign — and I WILL.” 
For Wood, that was the spark that inspired her and others to start organizing the first “No Kings” protest in Central City, planned for the downtown square along Broad Street where statues of John Prine and The Everly Brothers stand as monuments to the region’s rich musical heritage.
“Knowing the condition and her pain she’s been in with her back, I said, ‘No, I’m going with you. I’m going to be there if you’re coming,’” Wood said. “She’s an encourager. She’s one who does that. She stays in touch with people that she knows are upset with the status quo.”
Wood said news of layoffs at the U.S. Department of Education amid the federal government shutdown hit her hard because of her decades as a public school educator; she especially worries about the future of special education. 
She said the organizers in Central City all have their individual reasons for taking part in the upcoming protest.

“I have an investment in Muhlenberg County, and I have a love for this county and the children. That’s why I can get so upset with what Trump’s done at the Department of Education,” Wood said.
Wood said even though she serves on a local committee for the county Democratic party, the protest is designed to be nonpartisan and to “draw people together and lift people up.” 
“Donald Trump may not see this personally, we want to be a drop in that bucket that he’s going to know is the crowd in the United States that’s come out in protest against his policies and what he’s doing to the American people,” Wood said. 
For Willis, the protest is just the latest in a long record of community involvement. She’s been a professional organist and pianist for churches and an actor, playwright and theater educator. The Kentucky Theatre Association named an award in her honor.
She said she has to answer to her conscience when she puts her head down at night, and her conscience urged her to join the protest. 
“Start where you are. Wherever you are, that’s your realm of influence. That’s your first step,” Willis said. “I have no idea what the reaction will be. I have no idea if anybody will show up. It doesn’t matter.” 
“Whether I’m in small, little Central City or if I live in New York City, I would be doing the same things,” she said.
 Northern Kentucky: ‘They’re grasping at straws’
Ann Dickerson helped found the Indivisible group in Northern Kentucky in 2017.
Ann Dickerson was convalescing from pancreatic cancer surgery during the runup to the 2016 election, leaving her lots of time to study the candidates. The first time she drove herself anywhere was to vote for Hillary Clinton.
“When the results were announced, I went to bed, I cried for three days, and then I got up, got up and said, ‘okay, I gotta do something now.’ That was my foray into politics.” 
After the Trump victory, a group of former congressional staffers put out a guidebook for Democrats advising how to adapt conservative Tea Party tactics to organize local protests and pressure elected officials. 
Not long after, Dickerson took the advice and helped found Indivisible Northern Kentucky, which will be rallying Saturday along the Florence Mall Road in Boone County.
“So everything that has happened since then originated with the Tea Party. Now nobody went around screaming that, oh, the Tea Party is getting paid. But now all of a sudden, because it doesn’t fit your agenda, because it’s happening by people who are capitalizing on the method that you used, now all of a sudden they’re getting paid to do it. Please.” 
She also scoffs at Republican claims that anti-Trump protesters are anti-American or aligned with terrorists.
“They’re grasping at straws. The fact of the matter is, we are everyday average American citizens who are fed up with what we’re seeing and what we’re feeling.”
She said the cost of living, especially the continued rise in grocery prices, is causing even some former Trump supporters to change camps — even in “deep red Kentucky.”
“We’re not losing anyone. We’re gaining people every single time we’re out on the streets.” 
On Saturday, there will be extra marshals who can communicate via walkie talkie with her at all times. After organizing protests across Northern Kentucky, she says the group has good relations with local police.
“I take the safety of every single person that shows up at one of these events very personally. It’s my number one issue in anything that we do.” 
Danville: ‘We want to preserve what our ancestors built together’
Kevin Maples
Kevin Maples calls it “preposterous and absurd” that “people in the highest levels of government are trying to paint as un-American people who are standing up for the rights of Americans, and I believe they know it’s absurd.”
Maples, who grew up in Lincoln County and worked in other states before settling in Danville almost 19 years ago, is part of Indivisible Danville, founded in 2017 by “predominantly women in their 50s and up.”
Their goal, he says, is to “shine a spotlight on the rising authoritarian bent of the Trump administration” and also to push Congress — especially Danville’s representative Republican James Comer — to step up.
“Congress has relinquished its power to Trump,” Maples said, enabling the president to misuse his emergency powers to enact questionable policies.
Turnout Saturday is expected to exceed “No Kings” protests in June, Maples said, because “people are upset.” They see their health care at risk because of Republican policies as tariffs “destroy” Kentucky’s soybean farmers, he said. 
After getting no response from Comer to requests for a town hall, Maples said, the group organized one in August. Hundreds of people showed up to question a cardboard cutout of the congressman.
Maples said he’s seen anti-Trump momentum build in 2025. “We believe deep down we are really in the majority. We want to preserve the democracy our ancestors built slowly and painfully. We’re not doing something radical. We’re trying to preserve something good. 
“We’re not lunatics. We’re retired teachers, retired social workers, librarians, small business owners. We have deep roots in Kentucky and our community. We want to preserve what our ancestors built together.”
Saturday will be a big day in Danville, he said. After the morning “No Kings” rally downtown, the community will celebrate its second Pride Festival which will be held at Pioneer Playhouse.

The House Judiciary Committee moved a package of legislation Wednesday that includes proposals to enhance penalties and investigative resources for animal cruelty cases as well as tightening rules for elective procedures. 
Listen to the audio recap:

House Bill 1716 would prohibit declawing cats unless medically necessary. It also would require veterinarians to document the condition warranting the procedure by filing paperwork — including animal identification information and supporting lab work — with local animal control authorities. Republicans voted against this measure due to concerns it could “criminalize the veterinary medicine practices act,” according to Rep. Rob Kauffman (R-Franklin).
Declawing bans already are on the books in a handful of other states including New York as well as some municipalities in the commonwealth including Pittsburgh and Allentown. 
The other five bills passed out of committee with bipartisan support and an opposing vote from state Rep. Stephanie Borowicz (R-Union/Clinton). 
One would criminalize ear cropping — a procedure where dogs’ ears are basically trimmed so they don’t flop over — unless performed by a licensed veterinarian (the American Veterinary Association opposes ear cropping unless it’s medically necessary, such as to prevent infection). 
Another measure would establish mandatory reporting of aggravated animal cruelty to law enforcement by advocacy organizations like the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SPCA) as well as veterinarians, assistants and veterinary techs.

State law defines aggravated animal cruelty as torturing, killing or seriously harming an animal through intentional neglect or cruelty. 
“We really have a duty, I believe, to protect the most vulnerable. And, in my view, that’s always our children and our animals,” said prime sponsor Rep. Christina Sappey (D-Chester). 
House Bill 1932 would overhaul the commonwealth’s approach to sexual abuse of animals. Currently a misdemeanor, the offense would be elevated to a third-degree felony the first time and second degree for subsequent violations. The bill also calls for a five-year ban on perpetrators owning, living, working or volunteering with animals. 
Republican Rep. Kate Klunk is co-sponsoring the legislation after what she described as “a school bus of horrors arrived” in Adams County adjacent to her district in York County last year.
Ultimately, authorities rescued more than 30 animals — including birds, three German shepherds, a bull and a horse — and filed more than 200 counts of animal cruelty and neglect charges against Shawn Hirschbine and Deanna Huff. The Georgia couple had a history of animal cruelty spanning multiple states prior to their bus breaking down in Oxford Township — which led to officials discovering the bus, its “deplorable” conditions, severely neglected animals and video footage of Hirschbine having intercourse with them. 
Huff is now incarcerated in Adams County for between six and 23 months, a sentence reduced in exchange for testifying against Hirschbine – eventually. He has to get through a criminal trial in West Virginia over showing obscene content to a child before the Pennsylvania case can proceed, according to the Hanover Evening Sun.
Several animals have since been euthanized or died of malnutrition. Others have recovered and been adopted, per the Evening Sun.
“It really, truly shocks the public conscious and has really exposed some of our gaps in our criminal statutes,” Klunk said Wednesday. 
House Bill 1930 would enhance penalties for repeat offenders charged with aggravated cruelty to animals. Currently, the crime is a third-degree felony punishable by as many as seven years in prison. This legislation would elevate second and subsequent offenses to second-degree felonies, making the maximum sentence 10 years.
“There are times when horrific crimes call for penalties that fit,” said Rep. Melissa Shusterman (D-Chester), a cosponsor of the measure that she called “a necessary and rational deterrent.”
The sixth bill sets out a process for the state attorney general’s office to join district attorneys, at their discretion, in investigating felony animal cruelty cases.

(Delilah Brumer/Colorado Newsline)Liberty is a core American value that is especially dear to Coloradans.
The state was established at a time when the nation’s founding principles underwent renewed appreciation and dramatic expansion, and it remains the kind of place where the governor is discussed as the most libertarian chief executive of any state.
That’s partly why the monarchy pretensions of the Trump administration are so repugnant to Coloradans, in addition to their shock at lawless immigration enforcement, acts of partisan cruelty and other federal outrages the state has endured this year.
One way residents have expressed antipathy toward the authoritarians in Washington is by showing up in large crowds to numerous local demonstrations, including a “Fighting Oligarchy” rally that U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont said was the largest he had ever led and the No Kings “nationwide day of defiance” in June. During the second raft of No Kings demonstrations planned across the country on Saturday, including 50 throughout Colorado, organizers expect more than 12,000 residents to make their voices heard in downtown Denver.
The people’s contempt for crowns squares neatly with Colorado history.

Colorado voters approved the state constitution on July 1, 1876, three days before the nation celebrated its 100th year and the ideals extolled in the Declaration of Independence. The constitution was “first crafted in an era when the concept — if not the precise definition — of liberty and equality were ubiquitous in American culture and life,” noted Tom Romero, associate professor at the Sturm College of Law at the University of Denver.


Here is selected coverage of major Denver-area demonstrations and rallies against Trump administration policies since January.

Feb 5: Day of action
Feb 17: Presidents Day
March 21: Fighting Oligarchy
April 5: Hands Off! 
April 19: Hands Off!
May 1: Day without immigrants
June 9: ICE Out
June 10: ICE Out
June 14: No Kings 
July 17: Good Trouble Lives On
Aug. 2: Rage Against the Regime 



The centennial wasn’t the only reason the nation’s basic tenets were top of mind. The Civil War, during which a huge swath of Americans won liberty for the first time (in law, at least), was still a fresh national trauma. Colorado was the first state admitted to the union after adoption of the post-war “second founding” amendments — the 13th, 14th and 15th, prohibiting slavery, enacting birthright citizenship, establishing equal protection, mandating due process, and guaranteeing voting rights regardless of race.
The country was more anti-king than ever.
The state constitution was tuned to a diverse population in the Colorado territory, which included many Spanish-speaking residents. The original document called for laws to be printed in Spanish and German, and, 44 years before the 19th Amendment, it said the right to vote could be extended to women.
“The Colorado Constitution was drafted by a multiethnic collection of framers who felt the conflicting pressures surrounding the human rights demands of a diverse citizenry,” Romero said.
The constitution, reflecting 1870s reverence for the American spirit, at the outset enumerates a number of rights, many of which reiterate provisions of the national Bill of Rights, such as the right to free speech and “peaceably to assemble” — like in protest against a corrupt government.
But other rights Coloradans declared for themselves are absent from the U.S. Constitution. Colorado is one of 27 states that has a free elections clause in its constitution. “All elections shall be free and open,” it says, “and no power, civil or military, shall at any time interfere to prevent the free exercise of the right of suffrage.”
This Colorado right will be implicated if the Trump administration follows through on right-wing proposals that could result next year in military patrols of polling places and other forms of voter intimidation.
The administration has already committed innumerable constitutional offenses against Colorado residents. The most grievous involve its extreme program of immigration enforcement. An estimated 12 residents, denied basic due process rights, reportedly were sent to the notorious CECOT prison in El Salvador. Immigration and Customs Enforcement has kept immigrant-rights activist Jeanette Vizguerra, who is not accused of a crime, locked up for more than six months. While ICE arrests have dramatically increased in the state, most detainees have no criminal record or pending criminal charge, according to a Denver Post analysis.
Trump’s disdain for laws is exemplified in Colorado by his demand that Tina Peters be set free, solely because she’s a supporter. Peters was convicted of four felonies by a jury for her role in a scheme to breach the security of her own election office when she was Mesa County clerk, but the local U.S. attorney’s office, in brazen disregard of the justice system’s supposed impartiality, jumped right in to help spring her from prison.
Trump has repeatedly abused presidential power to collectively retaliate against Coloradans, only because Democrats occupy the state’s top offices. After the federal government shut down this month, the administration canceled more than half a billion dollars worth of clean energy grants to the state. The White House budget director was explicit about the intention of the cuts, saying they targeted “Green New Scam funding to fuel the Left’s climate agenda.”
All this shameful behavior comes at a time when Trump is sending military troops into American cities as part of a baseless “law and order” mission, and there’s no reason to think Colorado will be spared a similar invasion.
This is what kings do.
The preamble of the state constitution mostly mirrors the U.S. Constitution’s opening words, including its commitment to “secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity.” The Colorado framers in 1876 were thinking of later generations, which they hoped could enjoy the freedom, justice and welfare for which the constitution provided a basis.
The No Kings participants will be demonstrating to preserve those blessings for the present, but the welfare of future generations depends on their success.

(Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)Washington, D.C. metropolitan region leaders on Wednesday voted unanimously to exclude the I-495 Southside Express Lanes construction project from its long-range strategic plan, which had been proposed as a way to ease traffic congestion between Maryland and Virginia. 
The pitch to extend 11 miles of express lanes — stretching from the Springfield interchange in Fairfax County, across the Woodrow Wilson Memorial Bridge, to the MD 210 interchange in Prince George’s County, Maryland — could return in the future, because the board directed the Virginia Department of Transportation (VDOT) to improve it and report back next year on the status and outcomes of its work with all relevant jurisdictions.
Regional leaders on the National Capital Region Transportation Planning Board, an independent body of the Metropolitan Washington Council of Governments, were required to vote on adding the project to the board’s long-term strategic plan, Visualize 2050, which would be required for the project to receive federal funding. 
On Dec. 17, the Metropolitan Washington Council of Governments will take a final vote on the plan to submit to the Federal Highway and Transit Administrations under the U.S. Department of Transportation.
“The project is not dead,” said board Chair Walter Alcorn, who replaced former chair U.S. Rep. James Walkinshaw, D-Fairfax, after he was elected to Congress in September.
Alcorn said the board could add the project at a later time, but first, Virginia, Maryland and D.C. have to agree on the specific aspects of the expressway extension that advocates and opponents say will create significant impacts.
“The problem with this project is there’s not an agreement and consensus by the different jurisdictions through which the project would go,” Alcorn said. “There still needs to be more work to be done, but we’ll see. In my opinion, there does need to be some sort of project that would improve traffic now and in the future on the Beltway, and provide those transit options that we need all over the region.”

In a statement, VDOT said the board’s decision will allow the agency to continue its work with its development of the project, and to resubmit it in 2026 for inclusion in the region’s long-range transportation plan.
“These transportation improvements will provide near-term benefits and improve the lives of the hundreds of thousands of travelers who rely on the I-495 Southside corridor each day, as well as the surrounding residents and communities,” VDOT stated.
Since 2022, Virginia has been conducting a study on adding the express lanes, which public speakers at Wednesday’s meeting referenced. About 13 people spoke at the meeting, many in opposition to the project, with some noting that the state’s study lacked cost estimates for decommissioning private toll lanes in hopes of building a Metrorail line. Others said the express lanes would lead to an increase in vehicles and air pollution levels.
“Only by clearly weaving out the preferred alternative can the region ensure that there’s collaboration among jurisdictions to explore alternatives,” said Bill Pugh, transportation and climate director for the Coalition for Smarter Growth, emphasizing the need for sustainable transportation alternatives and what he called the negative environmental and social impacts of the project.
The project’s supporters say the express lanes would reduce travel times and provide more reliable arrival estimates for drivers. The express lanes would minimize vehicle idling and ultimately decrease pollution, those in favor of the project suggested. 
“It’s been said that what we need now is a 21st-century multimodal solution, and this project delivers exactly that solution,” said Richard Parsons, a representative of the Suburban Maryland Transportation Alliance. “It outperforms all other options in terms of expanding person throughput and reducing congestion delays, while preserving the right of way for future rail.”
Although Jason Stanford, a representative from the Northern Virginia Transportation Alliance, supports the project that provides “the greatest congestion relief,” he added that deferring the project would be a “wise decision” because “the stakes are too high to do nothing.”
Board members, including Virginia Sen. Jennifer Boysko, D-Fairfax, voted unanimously to keep the project out of the long-term plan. She added that if the item had come down to an up-or-down vote, it would have failed due to concerns about the project’s environmental and community impacts.
“We feel this is a very important issue,” Boysko said. “We need to build consensus with the entire region.”
Other members, including Prince George’s County Councilmember Eric Olson, said they were pleased the board voted to exclude the project from the plan.
“I think we, as a region, came together and understood that this was not the right thing for the region and certainly not now,” Olson said. “There are a lot of unanswered questions, a lot of things that need to be looked at as far as the Woodrow Wilson Bridge corridor. We do need better transportation. We do need to look at alternatives — like transit, like transportation demand management — but it was not even close to being ready to be put into a regional plan to advance.”

(Photos courtesy of Adams and Taylor campaigns) Familiar rivals face off again in House District 82, where Del. Kim Taylor, R-Petersburg, hopes to fend off Democratic challenger Kimberly Pope Adams in a high-stakes rematch. 
The “Kim versus Kim” contest was the closest House race in 2023, when Adams lost to Taylor by just 53 votes. With all 100 House of Delegates seats on the ballot this year, the district is once again among the most competitive and could help determine which party controls the chamber.
The Petersburg-anchored district stretches into suburbs and rural areas of Dinwiddie, Prince George and Surry counties. Both candidates are lifelong residents who raised their families in the region and tout their financial expertise as an asset they can bring to Richmond. 
Campaign finance reports show a stark contrast in fundraising between the two candidates. As of the latest filings, Taylor has raised about $634,734, while Pope Adams has brought in roughly $1 million, giving her a significant financial edge.
Their opposing party loyalties, however, could have major implications for House control and for three constitutional amendments moving through the General Assembly. 
Having already cleared once, the amendments must pass again next year before appearing on statewide ballots for voter approval or rejection. Two — guaranteeing same-sex marriage rights and restoring voting rights for ex-felons — advanced with bipartisan support earlier this year, while a third proposal to enshrine reproductive rights int the Virginia Constitution passed narrowly under Democratic control. Every Republican, including Taylor, voted against it. 
 Kimberly Pope Adams

Adams said her party can count on her to help shepherd the amendments across the finish line next year. 
She also wants to bring her financial background to the legislature if elected. Her experience as an accountant and auditor, she said, would make her an asset to the House Appropriations Committee. 
“It’s not just about counting the money. It’s about finding efficiency. It’s about finding process improvements. It’s about finding cost savings,” Adams said. 
She said the state budget is a top concern amid federal funding cuts, federal workforce layoffs and upcoming changes to hospital funding and Medicaid that the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates could cause millions of Americans to lose health care. 
At the start of this year’s legislative session, Virginia lawmakers debated how to invest a budget surplus that Gov. Glenn Youngkin later withheld as a “cushion” for actions taken by President Donald Trump’s administration. He has since further touted the state’s rainy day fund, but has downplayed Virginia’s potential need to offset looming Medicaid losses. 
“These cuts are coming,” Adams said, adding that she wants the state to be ready. 
While reproductive rights loomed large over her 2023 race against Taylor, the issue remains central this year. In 2023, many Republicans supported a Youngkin-backed 15-week abortion limit. The proposal included exceptions for rape and incest but not for severe fetal anomaly exceptions —- many of which are not detected or confirmed until after 15 weeks. 
Though she lost that election, Adams shared her personal experience of having a miscarriage at 12 weeks. In her case, her body completed the miscarriage naturally, but she noted that some failed pregnancies require abortion medication or a dilation and curettage procedure to prevent infection and sepsis. 
The range of reproductive healthcare needs, she said, continues to drive her desire to serve in the legislature. On the constitutional amendments overall, Adams said it’s vital that Virginians have a chance to weigh in at the ballot box next year and critiqued her opponent for not supporting giving constituents the chance on the reproductive rights one. 
 Kim Taylor

As the co-owner of three auto repair shops with her husband, Taylor has brought her perspective as a small business owner to the legislature. 
Taylor has frequently appeared alongside Youngkin to promote the “Partnership For Petersburg,” an initiative he has spearheaded for several years to boost the local economy. 
In a 2023 statement to The Mercury, Taylor called the effort“ a great coalition” and said that her team had been in regular contact with voters in Petersburg. 
“They are optimistic about the future of Petersburg,” she wrote. “Like me, they are proud and want the best for their families, businesses and town.”
Taylor did not respond to interview requests for this article, so further details could not be discussed. However, The Mercury reviewed her past statements and campaign material to outline her priorities if re-elected. 
As a delegate, she has supported efforts to cut taxes and reduce government regulation. She has also aligned with her party in pushing to give parents more authority and input in public education decisions, such as curriculum content and access to gendered bathrooms. 
Recognizing the district’s rural makeup, Taylor has also supported expanding broadband access — a frequently bipartisan goal that can strengthen economic growth and telehealth services. 
With reproductive health again emerging as a key issue, Taylor has sought to strike a nuanced stance.
Earlier this year, she introduced a bill to codify protections for medical treatments addressing nonviable pregnancies. Because there is no national definition of viability, such determinations are usually made by physicians on a case-by-case basis. 
Under Taylor’s bill, a “nonviable pregnancy” was defined as one that “cannot result in a live-born infant, including an ectopic pregnancy or failed intrauterine pregnancy.”
Like Adams, Taylor has shared publicly that she experienced a miscarriage.
Her bill was effectively  blocked by Democrats, who control the chamber and did not schedule it for a committee vote. Planned Parenthood Advocates of Virginia Executive Director Jamie Lockart criticized the proposal at the time as a “political stunt” rather than a genuine effort to improve access to health care. 
Lockart argued that existing Virginia law already provides clear protections for most abortion and miscarriage care, along with guidance for later-stage procedures. 
“We hear so often from the other side that this is a health care crisis, and that women are dying because there is an unclear standard of care,” Taylor told The Mercury at the time.
“Miscarriages and ectopic pregnancies are nonviable pregnancies, and therefore cannot be confused with elective abortion procedures,” she said. “This would have put any doubt about the law to rest.” 
Taylor’s bill also gave her a chance to go on the record about an issue that has become a vulnerability for Republicans in recent years. Since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned federal abortion protections, Virginian Republicans have proposed a range of restrictions — from life-at-conception and near-total bans to the 15-week limit.
An early October poll by Christopher Newport University found that economic issues, inflation and threats to democracy were top concerns for Virginia voters, along with healthcare — a category that includes reproductive rights. Respondents gave Democrats the edge on handling major issues, according to the survey, which reported a 95% confidence level. 
With early voting under way and Election Day approaching, additional polling in the coming weeks could further clarify how those priorities may shape the outcome.

(Photo by Sarah Vogelsong/Virginia Mercury)Carl Tobias, a professor and expert in constitutional law, called the “Compact for Academic Excellence in Higher Education” that President Donald Trump’s administration wants the University of Virginia to sign to get federal funds exactly what it is.
“It’s a pact with the devil,” Tobias told me. “It is madness to enter that agreement.” 
Legislators in the Virginia Senate called it “political extortion,” which also seems an apt description of the compact. It offers the school federal funding in exchange for the university’s leaders “pledging to maintain neutrality on societal and political events, limit foreign entanglements such as capping the number of international students in the Student Visa Exchange Program, and meet strict equality and objective criteria in selecting students and staff,” the Virginia Mercury’s education reporter Nathaniel Cline wrote last week.
Va. Senate Dems call Trump admin’s UVA funding proposal ‘political extortion’

Leaders at UVA, one of nine U.S. universities Trump targeted, said they are carefully reviewing the compact but have so far resisted ceding control of school operations to a convicted felon whose pathological lying has proven that no contract he proposes is worth the paper it is written on.  UVA Rector Rachel Sheridan and Interim President Paul Mahoney told the federal government that they plan to keep running Virginia’s flagship university by applying rules of free and open debate that is reasoned and aimed at truth. This is what Thomas Jefferson envisioned when he established the school in 1817.
That charge should be enough for Trump if he truly wants academic excellence in higher education. He doesn’t. He wants to dictate how one of the finest universities in the country should behave. Trump and his underlings want UVA to reflect the political, social and religious agenda of the extreme right wing of the Republican party reflected in Project 2025, a plan to put an ultra-conservative stamp on America.
Tobias acknowledged that withholding federal funds lieu of an agreement with the compact puts UVA in a vulnerable position. Hundreds of millions of federal research dollars are on the line. At the same time, Democrats in charge of the state legislature have threatened to withhold hundreds of millions of dollars to UVA if it signs the compact.
To make any deal as important as the one outlined in the 10-page compact, both sides must trust each other, Tobias said. 
Based on Trump’s behavior defying the Constitution, ignoring federal court orders, and continuously lying during his first nine months in office, UVA “can make no agreement they can trust,” he told me.
Outside of a prohibition on violence and aggressive confrontations which has always existed at UVA, the compact leaves open to interpretation vague rubrics of behavior whose violation exists almost entirely in the eye of the beholder.
For instance, this sentence: “Civility includes protections against institutional punishment or individual harassment for one’s views.” It begs the question of what qualifies as “institutional punishment,” which  could cause the government to claw back research funds if UVA signs the compact.
This is especially true in the compact’s presumption of discrimination against conservative students. As part of it reads: “Signatories commit themselves to revising governance structures as necessary to create such an environment, including but not limited to transforming or abolishing institutional units that purposefully punish, belittle, and even spark violence against conservative ideas.”
At the University of Virginia, the suggestion of a campuswide conspiracy against conservatives is preposterous. UVA’s alumni include thousands of conservatives, many of whom have risen through the ranks of industry, business, and government.
Federal Appeals Court Judge J. Harvie Wilkinson III, a revered 1972 UVA Law School graduate, serves as an excellent, but by no means isolated, example. Republican President Ronald Reagan appointed Wilkinson to the federal bench in 1984 after he served in the Reagan administration Justice Department as a deputy attorney general.
I worked around Wilkinson, a polite, friendly man, when he served as editorial page editor of the Norfolk Virginian-Pilot from 1978-1982. He offered an unapologetic and uncensored voice for conservatism.
But Trump’s compact does not just envision free speech for conservatives. It demands institutional endorsement by falsely implying that UVA practices ideological discrimination and by imposing what it calls “institutional neutrality” that “requires policies that all university employees, in their capacity as university representatives, will abstain from actions or speech relating to societal and political events except in cases in which external events have a direct impact upon the university.”
On its face, this reduces academic experts in dozens of fields to little more than private voices whose opinions matter no more than a guy blogging crackpot conspiracy theories from his mother’s basement.
That is anathema to the marketplace of ideas that Thomas Jefferson trusted in. He believed in Americans’ ability to separate ideological wheat from chaff. 
In 2022, when some UVA students asked the school’s administration to rescind a speaking  invitation to Vice President Mike Pence because of his public statements against gay rights, school officials said no. The speech went on with a peaceful demonstration on UVA’s famous Lawn outside the auditorium. I know because I attended both the demonstration and the speech.
The Trump compact seems like an attempt to quash campus demonstrations, like those on Virginia campuses that supported the tens of thousands of Palestinians killed  by Israel in retaliation  for  a surprise attack and hostage-taking by the militant group Hamas two years ago.
UVA President Jim Ryan resigns amid federal ultimatum

Ironically, the Trump administration recently forced out UVA President Jim Ryan, who took action to tame those demonstrations, which had disrupted the campus. But Ryan still had to go, because in the Trump administration’s eyes, Ryan still believed in the American principle of opportunity and inclusion for all who live here.
The proposed compact is one more example of how Donald Trump wants to impose his personal political will and philosophy on a country where democracy dies without free speech.
Agreeing to disagree while still seeking truth should always be the American way. For centuries, it has been the UVA way.

Kuriti’s husband, a pulmonologist, drives from Louisville to small hospitals an hour south and north, in Indiana, to help small teams treat critically ill patients.
Rural communities have long struggled to recruit and retain doctors. Many rural hospitals are struggling financially, and have had to eliminate services or even shut down. The shortage of providers is critical in rural communities that tend to have higher rates of chronic illness and early death compared with their urban counterparts.
Many immigrant physicians help fill those gaps thanks in part to the H-1B visa, which allows skilled foreign workers to come work in the U.S. Both Kuriti and her husband came to the U.S. via the H-1B visa.
But last month, President Donald Trump announced a new $100,000 fee for H-1B visas. The announcement quickly drew criticism from leading medical organizations, which say immigrant physicians make up a significant portion of the health care workforce. They’re concerned the move will hinder the flow of immigrant doctors to the U.S. and exacerbate the nation’s doctor shortage, which is expected to worsen in the coming decades.

Earlier this month, labor unions and other groups filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California against the administration over the payment. They argue that the move is unlawful and that the president doesn’t have the authority to circumvent Congress to collect such revenue. The plaintiffs — represented by the South Asian American Justice Collaborative, the Justice Action Center and others — include the AFL-CIO Committee of Interns and Residents and Global Nurse Force.
Last month, the American Medical Association and more than 50 other organizations sent a letter to the Department of Homeland Security urging the administration to exempt international medical school graduates from the fee.
According to projections by the Association of American Medical Colleges, the U.S. could see a shortage of up to 86,000 doctors by the year 2036, the groups emphasized in the letter.
National interest
The president’s order says the secretary of homeland security can, at her discretion, waive the $100,000 requirement for prospective H-1B workers in specific industries if it’s in the “national interest and does not pose a threat to the security or welfare” of the nation.
The AMA’s joint letter urges the secretary “to clarify that all physicians, including medical residents, fellows, researchers, and those working in nonclinical settings” are “critical to our national interest” and therefore exempt.
The Department of Homeland Security referred a Stateline request for comment to the White House, which hadn’t responded as of Thursday.
1.4M lawfully present immigrants could lose subsidized health coverage

Dr. Tom Price, who served as secretary of health and human services during Trump’s first term, said in an interview that medical workers should be exempt from the $100,000.
“A significant fee for any further H-1B visas in the area of the health care workforce will be detrimental … especially in low-served areas or rural areas,” said Price, a former Republican member of Congress.
In 2024, nearly a quarter of licensed physicians in the U.S. were foreign-trained and roughly 46% of foreign-trained physicians practiced in rural areas, according to data from the Federation of State Medical Boards cited by the AMA. And between 2001 and last year, almost 23,000 H-1B physicians worked in communities considered underserved.
Trump and other critics of H-1B visas say that some employers, especially tech companies, have abused the program by using it to replace native-born workers with foreigners who will work for less, rather than using it to fill jobs they can’t find Americans to do. But tech companies would have an easier time paying the fee than many hospitals.
Elizabeth Ricci, a Tallahassee, Florida-based immigration lawyer and national expert in immigration law, said at least one hospital in the South has asked her whether it must pay the fee itself or whether it can pass it on to the prospective physician. Before the new $100,000 fee, employers had to pay between $2,000 and $5,000 for each potential H-1B employee.
“It’s probably going to require litigation to get that guidance,” Ricci said. “And in the meantime, people aren’t filing because they are concerned that they’re going to be responsible for $100,000,” Ricci added.
The University of Washington said it has paused H-1B visa petitions.
“The uncertainty around visas creates a significant disruption for talented individuals who hope to train and work at UW Medicine,” Dr. Tim Dellit, CEO of UW Medicine and dean of the UW School of Medicine, wrote in email to Stateline. “It represents a loss for the research and education communities, as well as for the vital clinical care we provide on behalf of our patients and the broader community.”
Iowa, West Virginia and North Dakota — conservative-leaning, largely rural states — had the largest share of physician applicants under the H-1B visa relative to total physicians, according to a study published in July in the Journal of General Internal Medicine.
‘The need is there’
When Dr. Sridevi Alla arrived in Mississippi two decades ago, she was part of a small team of hospitalists at a rural clinic in Kosciusko, in the central part of the state. She now practices in Jackson, and on any given day, she could be treating patients having a stroke, complications from untreated diabetes, or someone with dangerously high blood pressure.

“In a state which already has a physician shortage, I think that’s definitely going to affect primary care,” Alla said, referring to the payment.
Alla said she considers herself a Mississippian, and that she’s always felt welcomed and valued by hospital leadership and patients.
“We never felt [like] foreigners in the medical community,” she said. “Maybe from an immigration standpoint we are, but not around being a part of health care.”
She noted Mississippi’s high rates of diabetes, heart disease, infant mortality and poverty.
“This is where I was trained. I sincerely feel like the need is there,” she said. “Even though maybe there are opportunities out [there], I never sincerely looked outside because I felt this is the home after home.”
Four-year limit proposal
Many physicians come to the U.S. under the temporary J-1 visa, which allows medical graduates to come for training and graduate medical education. They are then required to return to their home countries for at least two years. But they can apply for a waiver to stay if they work in rural or underserved communities, which allows them to transfer to an H-1B visa.
In addition to the new $100,000 fee, the administration has proposed a four-year limit on how long J-1 visa holders can stay in the U.S.
Medicaid cuts may disproportionately affect Black, Latino doctors and their patients

AMA President Dr. Bobby Mukkamala, a Flint, Michigan, otolaryngologist, said both his parents immigrated to the U.S. from India to complete their medical residencies.
“In that same hospital where they did their training back in 1970, here in 2025, we still have 30 to 35 international medical graduates that come in,” he said.
Now, hospitals have to “figure out where we’re going to get $100,000 per doctor.”
“We need to not just have the physicians talking about this, but to add to that the understanding of our own lawmakers,” he said.
Dr. Mette Strand, an internal medicine physician at Livingston HealthCare, a 25-bed critical access hospital serving rural Montana, emigrated from Norway. Many of those who mentored her, including specialist colleagues, are immigrants, too.
“Cutting IMGs [international medical graduates], we would be in further need of doctors in an already underserved state,” she said. “I would have a hard time seeing how we would run our hospitals and our clinics.”

Authors of a new analysis point to the bridge’s 2023 failure as an example of the growing state costs of deferred maintenance projects. (Photo by Christopher Shea/Rhode Island Current)The growing backlog of bridges and public buildings in need of repair or replacement poses an increasing threat to state finances, but tracking of maintenance liabilities varies wildly across the states.
That reality is examined in a new analysis published Thursday by the Volcker Alliance, a nonprofit that supports public sector workers, along with The Pew Charitable Trusts and the Hubert H. Humphrey School of Public Affairs at the University of Minnesota.
The analysis implores states to urgently adopt better methods to identify, quantify and fund their deferred infrastructure maintenance. 
“The cliff is here,” said William Glasgall, one of the researchers and a public finance adviser at the Volcker Alliance. “The bridges aren’t getting any newer, the water treatment plants aren’t getting any newer.”
Responsibility for public infrastructure has been increasingly falling on state and local governments. 
With an estimated $1 trillion in aging public infrastructure needs, states will continue to confront steeper bills as the federal government pulls back support of major projects, Glassgall said. Since January, President Donald Trump’s administration has stripped states and cities of billions of dollars that Congress approved for education, infrastructure and energy projects. Last month, for example, the White House announced it would hold $18 billion for subway and rail tunnel projects already underway in New York City.
Half the states don’t have enough money to cover all their bills, report finds

“The political reality is that this administration and this Congress are telling the states, you’ve got to live much more by your own wits,” he said. 
While states routinely report their debts for construction projects or pension obligations, deferred maintenance is more scattered: The new analysis found 20 states make no mention of deferred maintenance in their capital budgets at all. And definitions vary over what constitutes deferred maintenance — upkeep to maintain infrastructure in good working order that was planned but has been postponed. 
Putting off maintenance too long can pose real economic and safety issues, Glasgall noted. 
Rhode Island’s Washington Bridge connecting Providence and East Providence is a prime example. In 2023, state officials closed the bridge’s four westbound lanes after at least two anchor rods meant to keep the structure from shaking were broken, jeopardizing the span. The failure created a political scandal in the state and will cost an estimated $428 million to replace over several years.
Still, some states have taken recent steps to tackle their maintenance backlogs. 
In August, Massachusetts Democratic Gov. Maura Healey signed legislation delivering over $1 billion in infrastructure funds to cities and towns, including $200 million for culverts, small bridges and other long-deferred maintenance work.  
She has proposed dedicating $2.5 billion over 10 years to capital projects on higher education campuses across the state, saying many college buildings opened in the 1970s and were “aging and increasingly unable to meet modern demands.” Lawmakers are considering the legislation. 
In 2023, Oklahoma lawmakers passed the Legacy Capital Financing Act to provide funding for capital projects, including deferred maintenance. The next year, lawmakers approved an annual $75 million fund to address deferred maintenance of higher education, tourism and other state facilities. 
Education and transportation are major drivers of state deferred maintenance needs nationally, said one of the researchers, Camila Fonseca-Sarmiento, director of fiscal research at the University of Minnesota’s Institute for Urban & Regional Infrastructure Finance.
The new analysis provides a look at all 50 states’ approaches to deferred maintenance and a deep dive into the policies in 10 states — from Alaska to Tennessee — for assessing and funding deferred maintenance. The study says those states can serve as models for others that have yet to address the growing challenge. 
“They are putting more attention into deferred maintenance,” Fonseca-Sarmiento said, “and they’re trying to recognize it as a problem.”

(Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)A bipartisan group of lawmakers has introduced a resolution to encourage Ohioans to safely store their guns so children stop dying, as actual firearm regulation legislation sits stagnant in the Republican-dominated legislature.
Year after year, tragedy strikes in cases where unsecured guns turn into accidental shootings.
Just in the last few months, an Akron 10-year-old was accidentally shot in the face while with a friend. A Cleveland 14-year-old was accidentally shot and killed after a gun went off in a car. An Elyria 15-year-old was also accidentally shot. A 1-year-old had to undergo surgery after a teen accidentally shot him.
These are just some of the 2025 cases, but we’ve covered dozens throughout the years — ranging from babies to toddlers to teens to adults.
Another problem facing Ohio is when cars are broken into to steal guns.
State Rep. Darnell Brewer, D-Cleveland, is trying to target the problem.
“We can encourage people to one, honor the Second Amendment; and two, safely store their guns,” Brewer said.


He and state Rep. Kelly Deeter, R-Norwalk, have put forward Ohio House Resolution 148. It encourages Ohioans to store and secure their weapons and pushes cities and organizations to have safety campaigns.


Cincinnati already has a few, including a program where gun owners can store their firearms at the police department for up to six months for free.
“When the grandkids are coming over… when someone in the home is having a mental health crisis — there are all kinds of reasons where people feel having a gun inside their home is not safe at that time,” Cincinnati Vice Mayor Jan-Michele Kearney said.
The City of Columbus has been trying to curb this problem for years.
The Ohio Supreme Court is hearing a challenge to a Columbus ordinance requiring owners to lock up their guns.
State Rep. Josh Williams encourages safe storage to prevent deaths, but said there can’t be a requirement.
“I understand that these situations occur, but that doesn’t mean that you can violate the constitutional rights of every other law-abiding citizen,” Williams said.
Brewer was asked about the likelihood that this resolution could pass after Ohio Republican lawmakers have repeatedly passed laws to remove gun restrictions and refused to pass laws that put any restrictions on gun ownership.
“Hopefully we tell the story,” Brewer said, detailing incidents of a toddler being shot in Columbus, and the 2023 case of a pregnant Huron County woman who was killed with her baby also not surviving, after her two-year-old shot her.
“We’re trying to move the Republicans to change their heart and their minds.”
Columbus City Attorney Zach Klein said they need real change.
“I applaud the bipartisan effort to engage in this important public safety conversation. We know that safe storage saves lives. It’s why Columbus Public Health has led efforts to educate parents and distribute free gun locks, and it’s why the City of Columbus passed our safe storage ordinance,” Klein said in a statement.
He then targeted the lawmakers.
“Ohioans want and support reasonable gun laws that protect families and children, but we know that real change cannot happen unless lawmakers find the political will to pass laws that will save lives. This resolution is a step in the right direction and should be applauded. We pledge to work with any legislators who are serious about doing what we can to protect the lives of Ohio’s children through commonsense measures like safe storage,” he added.
Klein and activists like Moms Demand Action want gun lock-up requirements, universal background checks, and red flag laws — all of which Brewer agrees with.
“This is hopefully a step in the right direction, a small step,” Brewer said.
The City of Cleveland explained some of its campaigns, like CPD’s Community Relations Unit, which teaches gun safety classes to kids at schools.
That team has also worked with organizations to promote safe storage, along with distributing gun locks. Cincinnati libraries and schools do something similar.
“The City has also helped promote awareness through other avenues – like lighting up Tower City orange for National Gun Violence Awareness Day and coordinating pledge signing events for youth, which we will do again tomorrow,” spokesperson Tyler Sinclair said.
“More than 1,000 kids signed the pledge at 20 rec centers across Cleveland last year. We appreciate the thoughts behind the resolution and welcome further tangible action.”
Neither Columbus nor Cleveland addressed the fact that no money would be provided to municipalities or community partners from the state to promote public awareness on safe storage. The City of Cincinnati didn’t respond to comment at all.
“Unfortunately, there would be no financial help,” Brewer said. “I do have a bill, again, to try to give financial help to cities who do violence interventions.”
The lawmaker said because it’s just encouragement, not a mandate, his resolution has a higher likelihood of passing the GOP-controlled legislature.
Leadership
It seems that Gov. Mike DeWine has the same goal as Democrats like Klein, yet he has signed every bill loosening firearm restrictions that have hit his desk — even after a 2019 mass shooting in Dayton.
After the deadly Minneapolis school shooting this summer, we asked DeWine about his plans.
“Look, I’ve tried some different things,” the governor told us in August. “And we’ve not gotten them through.”
We tried to follow up with him on Tuesday on whether there was anything he could do about safe storage, but he said it was all legislative.
“To my knowledge, everything that could be done in regard to safe storage is legislative. Now, look, we talk about it, we can talk about the problem,” he responded.
“We want to make people aware of the problem. We certainly have done that; We’re going to continue to do that.”
Some Democrats and advocates are now pushing for a constitutional amendment to put gun safety regulations into law.

(Photo by Ethan DeWitt/New Hampshire Bulletin)At any given meeting, the New Hampshire Executive Council can face 100 separate state contracts to approve or deny. And those contracts can be accompanied by 10 or 20 pages of materials.
It’s a staggering amount of paperwork that can amount to 1.3 million printed pages per year. And this month, Gov. Kelly Ayotte is attempting to change that decades-old system and eliminate the printed packets, which her office says costs about $200,000 per year. 
But Republican councilors have countered that attempt with complaints of their own, claiming the Ayotte administration has not provided crucial documents to accompany the contracts it wants the board to approve. 
On Wednesday, the conflict boiled over at an especially tense council meeting. Councilors accused Ayotte’s departments of withholding documents from the contract packets. In protest, Republicans voted to table a wide range of contracts, seeking to disrupt Ayotte administration priorities until agencies agree to provide the information. 
One after the other, the council took up proposed contracts from a number of the state departments. And one after another, Republicans voted to withhold approval at least until its next meeting in two weeks.
Among the held-up items: $3 million in state funds to support the Child Advocacy Centers; $3.3 million in state and federal funds toward the Homeless Management Information System; $1.2 million in federal funds to preserve a bridge in Raymond; $640,000 in state funds for youth substance use reduction; $276,000 in state and federal funds for adult education and literacy programs; $170,000 in juvenile justice educational programs; and $849,000 in state funds to buy Coca-Cola products for state parks and New Hampshire Hospital vending machines. 
The council also tabled a $10,000 request by the Department of Natural and Cultural Resources to reimburse for the temporary fences it set up to manage crowds within Franconia Notch during this year’s foliage season. 
“So the vendor provided the service that was needed, correct?” asked Councilor Karen Liot Hill of Lebanon, the lone Democrat on the council. “It was,” replied Department of Natural and Cultural Resources Commissioner Sarah Stewart. 
“It proved to be useful?” Liot Hill continued. “Yes,” Stewart said. 
“And now they are not going to be paid for the services,” Liot Hill concluded. 
Councilor Dave Wheeler, a Milford Republican, said the holdup in contracts was necessary to make clear to the governor that she should require her departments to provide more information. That includes, for instance, a list of the board of directors of a state contractor, or the secretary of state’s certificate of good standing, documents that he said have been included in the past. 
“Our concern is we need all the information we need to make good decisions,” he said to reporters after the meeting. “… We’re not saying the government overall and the agencies aren’t doing a good job, but we’re here — that’s our constitutional function, to be a check on the executive.” 
Wheeler said he and other councilors have been pressing the governor to provide the information behind the scenes for months. He and others, including Councilor John Stephen, a Manchester Republican, brought up the request publicly at the Oct. 1 meeting. When the materials for Wednesday’s meeting were released without the requested extra documents, Wheeler, Stephen, and Councilor Joseph Kenney, a Wakefield Republican, planned to table the items in protest, he recalled.
Wheeler said he would be happy to vote for the tabled items as soon as possible, potentially via an emergency meeting over the phone, as soon as the departments requesting each item provide the additional information.
“The items we’ve tabled today, I am willing to come in, in between meetings, if you want to call a special meeting to expedite anything that needs to be expedited,” he said to Ayotte at the end of the meeting. 
Adding to some councilors’ frustration was Ayotte’s push to fully digitize the Executive Council’s paperwork process. 
Every two weeks, each of the five executive councilors receives printed copies of all contracts and other items that will come up at the next meeting, delivered to their home by a State Police trooper. Delivering the boxes takes up about 240 total hours of State Police time per year, the governor’s office said in a statement Tuesday. 
In announcing her plan to make the contracts digital, Ayotte said it would save taxpayers money and allow the State Police — who are facing a shortage of 57 officers — to better use its personnel. She also said the move would increase transparency.
Some on the council, like Stephen, have embraced the digitization idea. But Wheeler, a Christmas tree farmer, opposes it, arguing printed copies better suit his lifestyle. 
“I’m loading dump trucks,” he told reporters. “When there’s no dump truck there, I’m reading my agenda. I can’t do that (with) no cell service. I can’t do that.”
Wheeler dismissed a suggestion that the state provide councilors with printers to print out contracts on their own. But asked whether he would accept Ayotte’s digitization plan in exchange for a promise of more documentation, he demurred.
“A good negotiator never gives out his final answer,” he said.
For her part, Ayotte said she would look into providing the requested documents, but added she is committed to her plan of digitization. “We are going to look and see what of those items can we put online, and how do we get that information in a way that’s more transparent for everyone,” she said. 
One of the tabled contracts — to use $708,000 in federal funds to reconstruct a portion of Route 12 in Charlestown — sparked particular controversy. Liot Hill, who represents Charlestown, denounced the decision by Wheeler, Stephen, and Kenney to table those particular funds, noting that the road has been reduced to one lane for months, and that construction must begin soon in order to finish before the winter.
“I understand his concerns. I share the frustrations. But it is not right for my constituents to be used as collateral,” she said.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_0575-1024x563.jpg,,,2025-10-16 05:56:38.462639

(Getty Images.)Ohio state senators are trying to overhaul the program plugging orphaned oil and gas wells. A new measure, Ohio Senate Bill 219, proposes a dedicated fund for the effort, and streamlines notice requirements before work begins.
The bill also makes a handful of industry friendly changes. The bill makes it easier for drillers to get expedited review of projects, limits liability after a well owner sells one of their wells and nixes a requirement for drillers to make road-use agreements with local governments.
The bill’s sponsor, state Sen. Al Landis, R-Dover, explained the industry has changed “vastly” since the last substantial rewrite of oil and gas regulations during the Kasich administration.
“I hope this bill is the first step in updating Ohio’s occasionally outdated laws when it comes to realities of the oil and gas industry,” he said. “Once again, energy is national security. In Ohio, our state plays a pivotal role in supporting it.”
Plugging wells
The Ohio Department of Natural Resources has been managing the state’s orphan well program since the late 1970s. One of the largest sources of funding is the state’s severance taxes — fees imposed on the volume of gas or oil a company extracts.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
State law directs a share of that money toward the orphan well program, but Landis said, in the past, the oil and gas fund has been “fair pickings” for lawmakers looking for cash.
“When the state has a situation or something come up and they feel they need, some extra money, or some money that maybe not really available, they look to this fund,” he said.
Landis used to represent Harrison and Belmont Counties, two places he described as hot spots for drilling in the past. Up until the 1960s, there was little in state law governing who could drill and where. As a result, there are now thousands of abandoned wells throughout Ohio.
To speed up well plugging efforts, the bill eliminates most of the notice requirements when a landowner finds an abandoned well on their property.
Under current law, state officials have to inform prior owners by mail and offer them a chance to remove equipment. Landis’ bill only requires they publish notice in a newspaper or on the ODNR website.
“Right now, we’re plugging at a rate of about 500 per year with ODNR, they’re working very diligently,” Landis said. “And they would certainly like to increase that up to 1,000 wells a year and pick up the pace. Protecting the fund is the first step.”
To protect the orphan well program, Landis’ bill creates a dedicated fund called the Oil and Gas Resolution and Remediation Fund.
The bill earmarks certain filing fees and money from penalties; the fund will keep any interest it generates as well. The measure makes no change to the share of severance taxes dedicated to orphan wells.
State Sen. Kent Smith, D-Euclid, asked if they should consider raising severance taxes to speed up the effort. Landis sidestepped.
Ohio’s Orphan Well Program has plugged more than 1,200 abandoned wells in last five years

“My opinion is volume, volume, volume,” Landis said.
Instead of increasing taxes to grow the orphan well fund, Landis argued the measure would grow it by increasing production.
“We’re solidifying the oil and gas industry in Ohio,” he said, “so that we’re not losing any opportunity to increase production.”
Promoting the industry
At the same time Landis is working to plug old wells, his measure makes a handful of changes that could make it easier to drill new ones.
Most notable, the legislation eliminates ODNR’s ability to turn down requests for expedited review.
Under the bill, a well owner can only submit 10 such requests in a calendar year, but state officials have to get the ball rolling.
The measure also drops existing requirements for horizontal drilling operations to make a good faith effort reach a road maintenance and use agreement with local governments.
The proposal makes those agreements voluntary and caps their duration at three years. Drillers and local officials can renew agreements, though.
Additionally, Landis’ bill would simplify the liabilities and obligations a well owner faces when they sell or transfer a well, potentially making it a bit easier to walk away.
Under current law, the seller maintains full responsibility over the well until the buyer files information about ownership, purchases liability insurance and posts a surety bond or proof of financial responsibility.
The new proposal would allow either party to file information about the new owners and purchase the liability insurance.
The buyer is still required to prove their financial responsibility, but so long as the other boxes are checked, the seller is in the clear.

(Photo by Ashley Murray/States Newsroom)America is in week three of a government shutdown, and the ability of hundreds of thousands of Kansas families to afford health care is on the line.
Debate about whether to fund enhanced health care tax credits, which make health care more affordable, has prompted the current government halt.
This is a health care shutdown, and the stakes are high for the more than 200,000 Kansans who buy their health insurance plans through the federal government’s Health Insurance Marketplace. If Congress fails to fund these health care tax credits, Kansas families will see explosive increases in health care costs.
The health care tax credits make plans in the Marketplace more affordable for low- and middle-income Americans. It allows farmers, contract workers, self-employed individuals and those working for small family businesses that don’t offer insurance to have coverage. Enrollment in the Marketplace doubled from 2021 to 2025 after Congress enhanced the tax credits and made them available to more people.
However, these health care tax credits are set to expire at the end of 2025. Not extending them will cause rates to double, leading to more people becoming uninsured. Data shows average Marketplace premium payments in Kansas will increase by 77% should Congress fail to act.
As tensions rise in D.C. over this issue, it’s important to understand how it impacts Kansans directly. Not funding the health care tax credits is cutting health care for families, making it exponentially harder to afford health insurance and care.
This comes at a time when the majority of Kansans already feel the economy is making life harder for families, particularly those raising young children. Nonpartisan research that the United Methodist Health Ministry Fund recently released found that 84% of Kansans voiced this concern, and 77% said Kansas families with young children are struggling with just everyday costs.
Families are already deeply concerned about health care costs, too, and that’s without this potential spike if Congress doesn’t fund the health care tax credits. The Health Fund’s research showed health care was Kansans’ top concern, with 90% of those worried about the cost of care, followed by 89% highlighting cost of living and 85% identifying the cost of food as a challenge.
As families in Kansas struggle to afford health care and day-to-day living, it’s not a surprise that the latest KFF Health Tracking Poll found that 78% of adults said Congress should extend the health care tax credits. That is more than three times the share of the public — at 22% — who say Congress should let the credits expire.
The rise in costs by not extending the health care tax credits would be steep. A 60-year-old couple making $82,000 would see premiums increase by more than $18,000 annually, according to KFF. And, a family of four (ages 45, 45, 15, and 10) earning $129,800 a year would see premiums increase by $10,294 annually, according to Keep Americans Covered. With everyday budgets stretched, these steep price hikes will hit pocketbooks hard.
Ultimately, the steep increases in prices are expected to cause about 108,000 Kansans to lose health coverage over the next decade.
Kansans don’t want policies that cut health care or programs that make the cost of living more affordable for families. The opposite is true — 69% of Kansans feel government is already doing too little to help families, especially those with young children.
Eliminating these health care tax credits makes it tougher for families to afford everyday life, stay healthy and put food on the table for their kids. It would also take choices away from Kansans by making it tougher to switch jobs or start a new business.
Also, these cuts would have a ripple effect. When more people become uninsured due to unaffordability, that puts Kansas hospitals and providers at greater financial risk as they take on more uncompensated care. We cannot afford that risk, as Kansas already has more financially vulnerable hospitals than any other state.
Increases in the number of uninsured Kansans drives up health care costs for everyone else, as we pay the price for covering the uncompensated care for the uninsured. By failing to extend the health care tax credits, Congress is gambling with the health and economic security of Kansans and the rural health care system.
However, there’s a way to avoid these devastating cuts that would hurt families and hospitals alike: extend the health care tax credits. We can end this health care shutdown and keep health care affordable. It’s what Kansas families want.

When the law only recognizes two sexes, male and female, and defines them as “not changeable and… grounded in fundamental and incontrovertible reality” — what happens to intersex people like me? 
Reality is much messier than the budget’s new definition suggests. 
Nearly 2% of people are born with sex traits that fall outside the male/female sex binary, with as many as 1 in every 1000 born with “ambiguous genitalia.”
Ohio budget would only recognize two sexes, excluding transgender community and intersex people

Historically, strict adherence to a sex binary leaves intersex infants vulnerable to traumatic, irreversible medical attempts to conform the infant to a male or female body. 
For decades throughout the 20th century to the present, when an infant was born with ambiguous genitalia, pediatric surgeons and specialists chose which sex they felt that the infant conformed with — then enforced that sex with cosmetic, sometimes sterilizing genital and gonadal surgeries. 
Many intersex people describe these surgeries as nonconsensual “intersex genital mutilation” (IGM) because they do not have direct health justifications and can often cause increased risk of urinary tract infections, osteoporosis, cancer, and other complications. 
As children age into adults, they may experience loss of fertility, loss of sexual response, and significant trauma and mental health effects, impacting their future health care.
The Center for American Progress found that 3 in 5 intersex adults avoided seeking medical care due to past discrimination, and 9 in 10 intersex adults report poor physical and/or mental health, many from nonconsensual surgeries and their lifelong impacts. 
No federal or state law protects intersex infants against continued medical violence. 
Because the new state budget forces infants to be identified only as either “male” or “female” on birth certificates, there may be increased pressure for parents to accept coercive sex ‘correction’ on their children. 
The state budget, which went into full effect on Sept. 30, 2025, does not make exceptions for intersex individuals. 
Instead, it struggles to clearly and cohesively describe what “sex” means, defining “sex” as “the biological indication of male and female, including sex chromosomes, naturally occurring sex hormones, gonads, and nonambiguous internal and external genitalia present at birth.” 
(As many biologists have noted, the exact language from the state budget, which is modeled on President Trump’s Jan. 25 Executive Order, also incorrectly describes fetal sexual differentiation and classifies every American as female.)

However, those sex traits may conflict within intersex bodies. 
For example, infants with Complete or Partial Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome may present with externally “female” genitalia, internally “male” gonads, XY chromosomes, and an inability to produce testosterone. 
The state budget does not explain how it will classify infants with ambiguous genitalia and sex characteristics. 
The ramifications for intersex people whose existence is not recognized under the law are still uncertain.
This is especially true in Ohio, which is seventh in the nation for the most children’s hospitals within the state. 
Many of these clinics treat a disproportionate amount of intersex infants. 
Shriners Children’s Hospital houses pediatric urologists who explicitly treat “sexual development disorders” and “hypospadias,” both intersex variations.
Nationwide Children’s Hospital has a specialty Turner Syndrome Clinic and “treats” other forms of intersex variations. 
Up to 150 infants per year may be born in the state with ambiguous genitalia, and others may travel from surrounding states to specialty pediatric hospitals, all of whom are at increased risk for coercive procedures due to the state budget provisions.
For intersex teenagers and adults, the binary definition does not bode well either. 
The law has the potential to restrict IDs and social services, including prohibiting funds to mental healthcare providers that “promote or affirm social gender transition.” 
These regulations may disproportionately affect intersex individuals, who are more likely to be perceived as gender nonconforming (whether or not they are also transgender) and to experience mental health conditions. 
The full scope of the harm that the state budget will cause to intersex Ohioans has yet to be determined, but one thing is clear: It will cause harm.

(Photo courtesy of Theo Henry)A federal government shut down with threats of layoffs and cuts specifically targeting so-called “Democratic programs” and states.
Unidentified masked agents disappearing law-abiding immigrants. 
Members of the U.S. National Guard deployed against fellow citizens. 
Rampant corruption, suppression of free speech, weaponization of government against political opponents.
And the biggest rollback in federal support for health coverage ever, which includes congressional Republicans’ refusal to extend insurance subsidies that would keep premiums from increasing as much as 117% for tens of thousands of Mainers next year.  
Those unhappy with the actions of the federal government are expected to turn out en masse this weekend for the second national “No Kings” day of action. 
“What else can we do?” asked Scarborough resident Abigail Henry. “We have to tend to our gardens,” she said, explaining that she feels a responsibility to stand up against injustice in her community.
Last week, Henry co-organized a demonstration targeting the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement processing center in her town.

Organizers estimate that roughly 70 people attended the event, calling for due process for all regardless of immigration status, transparency about the agency’s actions, and support for local law enforcement, so they can “focus on community policing and not be pulled into ICE’s authoritative terrorism happening all around this country,” Henry said.
“These small actions can be cumulative over time and we can make the change we need if we want to hold onto our identity as a nation,” Henry said.
Last spring, residents of Wells organized a series of demonstrations and turned out for public meetings against the police department’s contract with ICE, which has since been paused. And in Portland there’s been mounting pressure on the Cumberland County Board of Commissioners to to stop housing people for federal immigration authorities.
Further protests are coming on Saturday. 
At least 20 No Kings protests are scheduled across Maine as part of more than 2,500 that will take place nationally. Actions, small and large, are planned in communities including Machias, Dexter and Oxford Hills. 
National organizers hope to build on the momentum of the June 14 day of action, which drew more than five million people across all 50 states. 
“Together, millions will send a clear and unmistakable message: we are a nation of equals, and our country will not be ruled by fear or force,” they said in a written statement.
The events are being sponsored by more than 100 organizations, including the American Civil Liberties Union, the League of Women Voters, Physicians for Social Responsibility, Common Cause, and Indivisible.
“This feeling of hopelessness and helplessness, that’s what this authoritarian administration wants so they can get away with their agenda,” Henry said.
She plans to attend the demonstration in Portland, Maine, where over 3,000 people marched in June.
“If you say you are opposed to facism, this is the time to really put those words into action,” Henry said. “Things are happening really quickly, and we are only less than a year into this administration. And if we don’t start turning the tide now, it’s going to get really scary, really fast.”

On Wednesday evening, the first 300 evacuees embarked on a C-17 military transport plane from Bethel to make the one-hour journey to Anchorage and emergency shelter there.
“Just devastated, feeling heartbroken, displaced,” said Jody Agimuk of Kipnuk, standing with his wife Kristin, and their five young children, waiting in line to board in the Alaska Army National Guard hangar.

“I hope we find a place,” he said of arriving in Anchorage. “It’s hard to explain, I hope we won’t have a hard time finding a place.”
He said since the storm hit Sunday, they sheltered at their grandmother’s and one night at the local school, and evacuated on Wednesday. “It’s just hard — leaving families at home, separating with families that we were close to. People we’ve seen, people we knew, people we used to talk to, all the close relatives, it’s heartbreaking seeing people separating.” 
The rest of the village of Kipnuk is scheduled to be evacuated on Thursday, and Kwigillingok by Friday, said Lieutenant Colonel Brendan Holbrook, commander of the 207th Aviation Troop Command with the Alaska Army National Guard. 
He said roughly 500 people had been evacuated to Bethel so far out of those two villages by members of the Alaska Army National Guard and Alaska Air National Guard. The C-17 plane can only transport 300 people, so the rest would shelter in Bethel overnight and more flights would be available out to Anchorage on Thursday morning. 
“I have five aircraft, four UH-60s and CH-47 in support operations, doing evac. And we’ve been running basically 12 to 14-hour operations every day getting these people onto safety,” he said.

In the Alaska Army National Guard Readiness Center in Bethel, evacuees waited, some resting on cots, as officers read lists of names and groups of 30 people at a time boarded the plane. 
Holbrook said evacuation was self-organized by community members, with families with children and elders prioritized. 
“So it was primarily Kipnuk today, if the call comes back, we can do Kwig (Kwigillingok) tomorrow,” he said ”But prioritization was just who was available and ready to go. So we would go to both and whoever got on got on. Kipnuk just happened to be, they had already established a marshaling plan, so as soon as we landed, they were ready with people to just start loading.”
Those who did not get on the Wednesday evening flight were sheltering in Bethel, some in an emergency shelter across the road from the Readiness Center hanger, administered by the Yukon-Kuskokwim Health Corporation with the support from the American Red Cross. Cots, showers and meals were provided there.
Holbrook added that there is a misconception that evacuees must go to Anchorage. He said once in Bethel, regional tribal organizations like the Yukon-Kuskokwim Health Corporation are providing support for people to travel wherever they like. “If you have a place to go, another village, family, somewhere else, Y-K will help you get to where you need to go,” he said.

Space X wants to close it for at least two months a year and maybe more. (via National Park Service)This is such a breakable age. Things we thought would last are, to our surprise, now in danger of shattering.
You think our state parks will always be preserved? Nope, we’re going to try to put golf courses in them. Think the Everglades will be protected forever? Sorry, we’re building a prison camp there. Think our system for buying environmental land will be free of political influence? Too bad, here’s a shady campaign contributor getting $83 million for four acres in Destin.
Last week I heard about another target for breakage, one that I thought would never see a crack: The natural lands serving as a buffer around Cape Canaveral.
Space X, the aerospace company owned by Elon Musk, wants to make big changes at the Cape. It wants to boost the number of rockets it launches and lands there, as well as boosting the size of the rocket involved.
“SpaceX is seeking [federal] approval for up to 44 Starship-Super Heavy launches per year from NASA’s Kennedy Space Center,” Florida Today reported last month. The proposal has drawn opposition from residents and officials from Titusville, Cape Canaveral, and Brevard County, as well as environmental groups worried about the potential harm to nesting sea turtles, manatees, and endangered right whales.
They’re also concerned about increased pollution, rampant water waste, a huge loss of public access, lots more sonic booms and — not to be rude — the tendency of Space X rockets to blow up. There have been four explosions so far this year.
Katie Bauman via Surfrider International
“Yes, we have seen those headlines,” said Katie Bauman of the Surfrider Foundation, one of the most vocal environmental groups challenging the expansion.
Space X called one of those explosions “a sudden energetic event.” That’s not the kind of energy folks on the Space Coast want to see in their backyard.
But it does give a fresh context to this comment about Space X’s impact on the region by Republican U.S. Rep. Mike Haridopolos: “We are booming, literally, right now.”
The water goes pfft!
“Starship-Super Heavy” sounds like the latest iteration of the “We Built This City” rock group that started as Jefferson Airplane, morphed into Jefferson Starship then became plain Starship.
Instead, it’s actually “the world’s most powerful launch vehicle ever developed,” according to the Space X website. It’s designed to take cargo or astronauts into Earth orbit, to the Moon or even Mars, yet be as reusable as Tupperware.
“Starship and Super Heavy are designed to return to the launch site and be caught following their flight, with the ability to rapidly turn around and launch again,” the company says.
For now, its launch operations have been confined to Texas. Although Musk has had successes, repeated explosions — like the one in March that Reuters reported left “fiery debris streaking through the dusk skies near South Florida” — are something Musk dismissed as “a minor setback.”
During an Aug. 22 Space Coast Symposium speech, SpaceX Vice President of Launch Kiko Dontchev told the crowd, “You’re going to get a vetted machine that shows up ready to party.”
Clearly his definition of “party” is different from mine, and from that of a lot of the people who live and work near the Kennedy Space Center.
“Constituents and businesses have expressed concern over the cumulative environmental effects of high frequency launches, including emissions, chemical runoff, and disturbances to protected coastal and marine habitats,” Brevard County Commissioner Katie Delaney wrote in a letter to federal officials.
The Federal Aviation Administration must decide whether to permit this, which requires an environmental impact statement. In a first draft, FAA officials determined the Starship liftoffs — punctuated by up to 152 sonic booms per year — would generate “few” significant environmental impacts at Launch Complex 37.
That’s not how Bill Fisk sees it.
Bill Fisk via Linkedin
Fisk, a Florida native who grew up watching the Apollo launches with his dad and grandfather, is both the president of the Space Coast Audubon Society and vice chair of the Turtle Coast Sierra Club. For my edification, he catalogued the biggest impacts.
Start with the water, which Bauman of Surfrider brought up as well.
Space X expects to use 400,000 gallons of water per launch and 68,000 gallons per landing, all to cool down hot equipment. That plus other uses for the site put the expected total water use for Space X at 50 million gallons per year.
Yet Brevard is already running low on potable water for residents and businesses, Fisk said.
“It’s getting worse as the developers get more leeway, so the water supply keeps going PFFFT!” he said.
After its use, the remaining Space X fresh water would flow into local waterways that are supposed to be brackish, messing up their salt content. That includes the struggling Indian River Lagoon, where there’s a need to bring back sea grass beds as a nursery for fish and a food source for manatees.
“There is a clear and direct negative impact to the physical environment of the area … by adding excessive amounts of fresh water into the pristine local estuary,” the Southeastern Fisheries Association said in a comment letter to the FAA.
Local fishermen are already complaining about falling space debris damaging their equipment, Fisk said. Crumbling local roads can’t handle the increase in fuel truck traffic, he said. Titusville is bringing in an engineer to examine its public buildings to see if they can handle the increased vibrations.
After all, Fisk said, when the early space program was being built, “everything was built fast and it was built cheap.”
The race to space
The waters off Cape Canaveral saw the last sea battle of the Revolutionary War (we won). That marked the last big news there for a couple of centuries.
But then a Mexican cemetery blew up.
In the 1940s, the American military tested missiles by firing them from New Mexico, but one went off course and blew up a Juarez graveyard. Mexican officials complained, so the military looked for a safer launch site.
They found it at in Florida at what was then known as the Banana River Naval Air Station. The place was isolated, the land already belonged to the government, and the location near the equator meant rockets got an extra boost when they took off.  Everyone seemed happy.
Then, in 1957, Sputnik changed everything.
Suddenly, America was running second to the Soviets and the Space Race was on. Cape Canaveral became the focus of a U.S. space program playing catch-up.
Brevard’s population boomed as engineers, scientists, and construction crews poured into the once-sleepy towns.
“The beach mushroomed and became sheathed in schlock,” author Herb Hiller wrote. ”Everything was built quick and short-term. Motels in Cocoa Beach and Titusville flashed neon rockets and dancing girls. Inside, sequined cuties danced and did more. Motel Row became Sin Strip.”
In the runup to the moon landing, the work force at Canaveral peaked at 26,500 in 1968. But then Space Coast residents found out what any coal miner could’ve told them: It’s no fun living in a company town when the company winds down.
A year after the historic Apollo 11 mission, the work force fell to 15,000. Rocket scientists were pumping gas. Families who couldn’t find a buyer left their keys in the front door of their houses as they left town.
Yet, during the boom and bust, one thing remained constant: the natural buffers around the cape, which preserved the Old Florida feel of a place jumping into the 21st century.
In 1963, the feds created the Merritt Island National Wildlife Refuge, 140,000 acres with more endangered and threatened species than any other refuge in the continental U.S.
Then, a decade later, they set up Canaveral National Seashore — 58,000 acres of barrier island, open lagoon, coastal hammock, pine flatwoods, and offshore waters.
But Space X says every time there’s a takeoff or landing, both must shut down for safety. Even the nude beach.
The naked and the clothed
Florida is the state with the most nudist resorts — 29, compared to 14 for second-place California. Harder to find are Florida’s nude beaches. They exist, but most are not official.
One well-known example is in Canaveral National Seashore: the southern end of Playalinda Beach, accessed from Parking Lot 13.
“Not too many places can you get a full view of a rocket launch while giving a full view,” WKMG-TV noted in a story that reported Playalinda had been named the 20th best nude beach in the world.
One person who submitted a comment against the Space X plan identified himself as a member of the American Association for Nude Recreation. He told the feds, “I do not see the need for corporations to take away our public privileges to public and federal lands.”
Plenty of people who ARE wearing clothes use the rest of Playalinda for swimming, surfing, fishing, picnicking, and camping. After all, it’s the longest stretch of undeveloped Atlantic coastline in Florida.
Both the naked and the clothed are freaking out about the part of the Space X plan that calls for closing access to the beach for at least 60 days a year  — maybe more.
Space program veterans call Musk “the Nibbler,” Fisk told me, because “he’ll say he wants 50 launches — no wait, make it 120 — oh no, we need to do 160 launches.” He keeps nibbling a little more each time.
Residents who love Playalinda don’t want to play Musk’s shutdown game. It’s a public beach that the public wants to use, not hand over to the world’s richest man whenever he wants.
“What we want is a fair middle ground — where launch activity can thrive without compromising the health, safety, and quality of life for our residents,” Commissioner Delaney said on her substack.
I haven’t even mentioned the other Space X threat, one that would affect more than just one region of Florida.
The company wants to launch its Starship-Super Heavy rocket from its existing base in Texas to attain a low-Earth orbit. It would soar over most of North and Central Florida in a way that would block at least 10 and as many as 200 commercial airline flights.
The big break
I was curious about what an actual scientist had to say about all this.
Ken Kremer via X
I got in touch with Ken Kremer, a Ph.D. with 17 patents who’s been writing about the space industry for two decades. He runs the website Space Upclose and boasts that he’s witnessed more than 100 launches.
He agreed with everyone else I talked to about how awful it would be for Space X to close off Playalinda Beach for 60 days minimum.
“That’s really terrible to cut that off for two months,” he said.
But he saw a reasonable alternative.
Apollo 11 rocket launch via Florida State Archives
Space X wants to use Launch Complex 39A. That’s where a lot of American space history happened, including the launch of Apollo 11. An explosion there would wipe out all the historic structures.
Ten miles away is Launch Complex 37. Space X wants to use that one too. Why not require the company to use it exclusively? That way, he said, only minimal beach closures would be required.
“There have to be some reasonable compromises,” Kremer said.
Of course, just changing the launch site doesn’t solve the other problems with pollution, excess water usage, and so forth.
Space Coast residents used to be willing to give the space program the benefit of the doubt because they felt they were doing their patriotic duty. But it’s not like that anymore. Space X is not NASA. It’s just a for-profit business, putting more money into Musk’s already bulging pockets.
I think we should tell Space X that the only way it will be allowed to do everything it wants with Cape Canaveral is if every single launch or landing in Florida carries as a passenger someone named Musk.
It could be Elon. It could be his awful father. It could be one of his 14 kids.
Then, all the water that’s left afterward, they have to drink it. And if they complain about it, tell them, “Hey, those are the breaks.”

The first of its kind report, “State Scorecard on Medicare Performance: How Medicare Is Working for Its Beneficiaries” from the Commonwealth Fund, places Kentucky as the third worst state for Medicare performance. Medicare is mostly for people who are at least 65, though some illnesses and disabilities qualify people for coverage before that age. 
Researchers based their rankings on access to care, quality of care, costs and affordability of care and population health in 2023 and 2024. Mississippi and Louisiana were the only states ranked lower than Kentucky on these measures. The best-performing states were Vermont, Utah and Minnesota.

Dr. Joseph Betancourt, the Commonwealth Fund president, said during a Wednesday press call that “Medicare, while a vital safety net for millions of Americans, is not working the same for everyone.” 
“Despite being a national program, the scorecard reveals that where you live often shapes your experience,” Betancourt said. “As a primary care physician, I know how important it is when patients can focus on healing instead of worrying about medical bills. Medicare makes that possible for millions, but we have more work to do to ensure it delivers the care equally and effectively for people in every state.” 
Medicare beneficiaries in southeastern states — including Kentucky — were much more likely than the national average to get prescriptions considered generally “unsafe” for elderly patients, according to David Radley, a senior scientist with the Commonwealth Fund. 
“These are medications that evidence tells us that should be avoided in the elderly when we compare to beneficiaries in other parts of the country,” he said. 
“We also found that the rate of hospitalization from preventable causes, a measure that generally reflects inadequate disease management, is more than double the lowest ranked states compared to the top performing states,” Radley said. The national rate of preventable hospital admissions was 26.4 per 1,000 people in 2023, according to the report. In Kentucky, that was 31.5. 
The Commonwealth Fund’s report found that the rate of preventable hospitalizations is higher in southeastern states, including Kentucky. (Screenshot)
Other takeaways include:

More Kentucky Medicare beneficiaries (66%) than the national average (62%) had three or more chronic conditions in 2023. 
In 2024, nearly 5% of adults in Kentucky older than 65 reported going without needed medical care because of cost. The national average is just under 4%.
More Kentucky adults 65 and older (36%) report feeling lonely than the national average (34%). 
In 2023, the rate per 1,000 Medicare beneficiaries to have a preventable hospitalization was 31.5 in Kentucky and 26.4 nationwide. 

Kristen Kolb, a registered nurse and research associate at the Commonwealth Fund, said those last two points are connected. 
“Research has shown that loneliness is a risk factor for hospital readmissions and is associated with increased health care costs,” she said. “Loneliness or lack of emotional support, is a widespread issue affecting at least 1 in 4 older adults in every state where data was available. Loneliness can have negative health effects and has been linked with poorer health outcomes like increased risk of heart disease and stroke.” 
Betancourt said meaningful social connections and their link to “strong cognitive function” are “critical,” especially for older adults. In 2024 the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that loneliness can increase risk of heart disease, stroke, Type 2 diabetes, dementia and earlier death.

Gretchen Jacobson, the vice president of Medicare, Expanding Coverage and Access at the Commonwealth Fund, said policies at the federal and state levels can help address disparities by setting standards for private plans and incentivizing “providers to apply best practices and reduce wasteful spending and care.” 
“Although Medicare is a national program, health outcomes, access to needed health care, the affordability of care and quality of care all vary widely for the people it covers, and some issues such as loneliness, affect many older adults no matter where they live,” she said. “The combination of state and federal health policy is what enables beneficiaries to get the health care they need, and ultimately affects their health outcomes and experiences with care.”

A shopping plaza being modified to include townhomes or watching your children move away because a home in town is unaffordable?,"With the arrival of Autumn here in Connecticut, many embrace the spooky, Halloween-y spirit. There’s no better place in New England to dance with the macabre than in Salem, Massachusetts, sight of colonial America’s most infamous episode of mass hysteria. 
In 1692 dozens of Salemites were executed for the crime of witchcraft. When one visits the somber memorials and kitschy shops today, it’s easy to indulge in morbid daydreaming. What if witches, the Devil, and all his diabolical servants are real, after all? It can be thrilling to give oneself a good scare.
While it is unclear if supernatural forces remain at work in Salem, the city faces the same mundane challenges of home affordability as anywhere else. Recently, Salem eliminated municipal parking minimums for multifamily housing structures. Instead of requiring builders to set aside a specific number of off-street parking spots for all new construction, the city allows developers to determine the appropriate quantity to provide. Satanic black magic? Nope, just good policy.
Studies have shown time and time again that when cities and towns mandate arbitrary parking minimums for residential and commercial construction, they drive up rents and home-prices, while simultaneously enforcing automobile dependence on residents.
If asked, most Nutmeggers would say that they want to live in a walkable community and that homes are too expensive these days. If you ask them, however, if they support policies that lower housing costs and increase pedestrian accessibility, many recoil in fear.
What’s so scary about housing reform? Many Connecticut residents are terrified of the same kind of common-sense adjustments that Salem’s City Council passed almost unanimously. Connecticut’s HB 5002, the much maligned housing affordability bill debated this summer, included a provision to loosen local parking minimums. While it passed in both houses of the Democratic-led state legislature, Gov. Ned Lamont was pressured to veto the bill after pushback not just from Republicans, but members of his own party.
Why? Many of HB 5002’s opponents were frightened by the bill’s regulatory shifts. I sympathize with these anxieties, but I think the bill’s opponents are worried about the wrong things.
Let’s consider parking minimums. Many who support mandatory off-street parking minimums insist that developers will not build enough parking unless forced, but evidence indicates that this isn’t true. In addition to driving up housing costs, mandatory parking minimums create a paved-over infrastructure that inhibits walkability.
Automobile emissions are a major driver of climate change. When we reduce mandatory parking minimums, we facilitate walkable development. This in turn lowers our carbon footprint.
Opponents of HB 5002 should ask themselves: What is scarier? Climate catastrophe or walking to the grocery store?
Let’s talk about home affordability. Opponents of HB 5002 considered the bill’s provision for by-right multifamily construction in commercial areas to be downright demonic. Local residents, they argue, should be empowered to resist careless developers, who would build structures that increase traffic or mutilate local character. This fear of inappropriate development is understandable, but misplaced.
Excessive public input regarding home permitting leads to fewer homes and higher prices. It may seem democratic to require public approval for housing developments, but public meetings are not necessarily representative of the majority of residents. Ask any town official (off the record) and they will tell you that most public commentary is less a rational analysis of the potential outcomes of a given project, and more an opportunity for cranks to take their social media ramblings to a captive audience.
Opponents of HB 5002 should ask themselves: What is scarier? A shopping plaza being modified to include townhomes without your personal approval, or watching your children move away because a home in town is unaffordable?
Almost all Connecticut Republicans opposed HB 5002. I think this was a poor political strategy, because the party has recently made impressive gains with working-class voters. The GOP should support policies that create an easier path to homeownership for this constituency.
Stranger still was the bill’s Democratic opposition. NIMBYism in blue states has placed the Democratic Party in a precarious electoral position. Liberal strongholds like California, New York and Illinois are hemorrhaging voters to red states, where home construction is able to keep up with demand. If Democrats don’t start building homes in states they control, a presidential candidate in 2032 could win every state that Joe Biden won in 2020, and still lose the electoral college.
Democratic opponents of HB 5002 should ask themselves: what is scarier? A few new apartments in town or a permanently Republican-occupied White House?
‘Tis the season for a good scare, but when Connecticutians reject reasonable changes in the way we plan our communities, we accelerate global warming, increase the cost of housing, and isolate residents from each other. That is one scare I could do without.

(Photo by Yereth Rosen/Alaska Beacon)Passengers at Alaska’s biggest airports may soon see a political advertisement published by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security that blames Democrats for the ongoing federal government shutdown. 
The video, promoted by the White House, features Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and is expected to appear at Transportation Security Administration checkpoints.
Airport officials in other states — including Noem’s home state of South Dakota — have declined to allow the video, citing longstanding policies against airing political content.
In Alaska, the state department of transportation and public facilities owns and operates more than 230 airports statewide, including Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport and Fairbanks International Airport. 
Shannon McCarthy, a spokesperson for the department, said TSA has requested permission to air the ad at both of those airports, but not at others the state operates.
She said those airports “don’t own screens that would be used for this type of content” and that the screens in most parts of the airport are “typically the property of an advertising concessionaire.”
“That said,” McCarthy added, “the Transportation Security Administration does have the ability to display the video within its leased areas at the airport.”
TSA did not respond to an inquiry sent to its listed email address. The phone and email of its listed contact for the region that covers Alaska was disconnected.
Alaska’s Executive Branch Ethics Act prohibits the use of “state funds, facilities, equipment … for partisan political purposes,” but transportation officials said they don’t believe the ethics law applies in this case.
In the 30-second video, Noem acknowledged the federal government shutdown may affect travel, saying “Democrats in Congress refuse to fund the federal government. … We will continue to do all that we can to avoid delays that will impact your travel. And our hope is that Democrats will soon recognize the importance of opening the government.”
Senate Republicans could unilaterally pass budget language funding the government, but doing so would require them to eliminate the filibuster, a rule that requires 60 votes instead of 50 for much of the U.S. Senate’s business.
The Senate has already sidestepped the filibuster with regard to presidential appointments to public office, allowing them to appoint officials without Democratic votes.
Senate Democrats have said they also are willing to offer votes for a shutdown-ending budget deal if Senate Republicans agree to extend subsidies for health care coverage. Thus far, Senate Republicans have declined to do so. 
“TSA operates under a license agreement or what TSA calls an ‘Other Transactions Agreement’ or OTA. … It is silent with respect to displaying videos like the one in question,” McCarthy said.
Only a handful of Alaska’s airports aren’t owned and operated by the state. One notable exception is Juneau International Airport, the state’s third-largest.
There, airport manager Andres Delgado said that he had received an email from a TSA official providing advance notice but hadn’t yet received an official request. 
He said he wanted to check with the city manager and legal counsel before deciding whether to allow the video.
“We’ve been, understandably, trying to avoid taking a stance on it,” he said.",https://alaskabeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/20240218_164207-airport1-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-10-15 23:01:11.653529

Mallory McMorrow (D-Royal Oak), left, and Dr. Abdul El-Sayed, right, speak at a community forum focused on Michigan Arab and Muslim American issues hosted by Emgage Michigan. Oct. 15, 2025 | ScreenshotTwo candidates in the race to claim Michigan’s soon-to-be vacant U.S. Senate seat shared their views on policy and the state’s future in a community forum organized by Emgage, a political advocacy group dedicated to educating and mobilizing Muslim American voters.
Appearing during a virtual webinar on Wednesday evening were Democratic candidates Abdul El-Sayed and state Sen. Mallory McMorrow of Royal Oak. The two candidates seeking to carry the torch of the retiring U.S. Sen. Gary Peters used the opportunity to further engage with the state’s Arab American and Muslim voters, which carry significant political weight in key regions of that state.
U.S. Rep. Haley Stevens (D-Birmingham), who is also seeking the seat and is considered the Democratic establishment’s favorite in the race, did not attend the forum due to a scheduling conflict, her campaign said.
Her absence, however, opened a lane for El-Sayed and McMorrow to shine. Several of the questions dealt with Muslim access to the ballot, what they would do to address the rise of anti-Muslim hate, and musings on free speech in the wake of crackdowns on pro-Palestinian protests.
Here are some of El-Sayed’s and McMorrow’s top responses to questions asked by moderators during the forum. The questions asked by Emgage are in bold and the candidates’ responses follow.
 
Michigan universities have silenced student dissent by branding criticism of Israel as antisemitic. Attorney General Dana Nessel criminally charged university students for expressing their freedom of speech while protesting Israel’s atrocities. Do you believe these charges were appropriate?
El-Sayed: The foundation of our democratic republic is that you have the right to peaceful protest, to freedom of expression. And when that right gets taken away, or when somebody uses the power of the state to oppress somebody for having used that right, something deep and profound is lost. We’ve seen a witch hunt lead from a Democratic attorney general’s office against students for practicing their right to freedom of speech, and I have never faltered when it comes to standing with students against this, frankly, overreach of on the part of a very particular elected official. I’m not afraid to call out my party, rather famously not afraid to call out my party. And I’ve been clear about the fact that, for me, we run on principle, and one of those principles is that any attempt to stifle speech anywhere ends up potentially silencing speech everywhere. It’s the same exact set of policies we’re seeing out of the Trump administration.
McMorrow: The fundamental right to free speech and to protest is exactly that: Fundamental. There is no place where that should be safer than college campuses, places where we send our kids to have difficult conversations and, many times, to be around people who may look different or have different backgrounds from them, maybe for the first time in their entire lives. So I will be a fierce defender of protest, of free speech. I believe that we all bear a responsibility to ensure that that is protected. When it crosses the line into crime, I spoke out when there were a couple of protesters that broke that line and went to the home of Jordan Acker, who’s a University of Michigan regent, defaced his wife’s car and threw jars of urine through the window while his family was home and his daughters were sleeping upstairs. That is where we all need to work together to ensure that free speech is protected.
 
What specific policies would you champion to protect the civil liberties of Arab and Muslim Americans in the face of rising Islamophobia?
El-Sayed: I remember watching as our country ripped itself apart in the post 9/11 era. … I watched as we did things that were in complete opposition to our Constitution, to people who look like us because of our names, because of our faith. First and foremost, we have to stand up to the post 9/11 surveillance state, the network that has wantonly put people who have particular names on no fly lists. I also think about infringements on our freedom of speech. You look at things like Project Ester, you look at bans when it comes to freedom of speech to advocate for the Palestinian cause. And I think in the U.S. Senate, the kind of leadership we need is the kind of leadership that’s both going to take on and dismantle the very illegal system of surveillance and oppression that we’ve seen erected since 9/11 but also its second coming in the form of the assault on basic civil liberties and freedom of speech.
McMorrow: When the Wall Street Journal published an op-ed accusing Dearborn of being a jihadist city, I spoke out, and I spoke out loudly. But it’s not enough just to use your platform. It’s what you do in legislation, as well. We passed and strengthened hate crimes legislation in the state of Michigan, something that I would advocate on the federal level. We live in a moment where social media companies are weaponizing and buying our time and attention, our energy, our names, that it’s all available in public. We need somebody who is willing to stand up to social media companies, to tech companies, to protect our privacy, to protect our data. We passed strong data privacy legislation in the state of Michigan.
 
We’ve already experienced the Muslim-Africa travel ban [in Donald Trump’s first presidential term], and we are seeing the U.S. Department of State targeting the community with visa suspensions. What is your stance on accepting refugees from conflict zones … and how would you address immigration processing under the Trump administration?
El-Sayed: Immigration is good. I should be 100% clear about that. One of the neat tricks that America has had is it’s been able to convince people from all over the world to bring their skills, their resources and their energy and enthusiasm here to build. I know that as a fact because my parents immigrated from another country. I shudder to think about what decision they may have made had they been making that decision in 2025 in Trump’s America, versus in 1978, when my dad immigrated here to go to Wayne State. … [It rests on] the notion that we owe a responsibility to continue to be that kind of country that welcomes people is particularly true when we’re talking about people who come from conflict zones, particularly those who come from conflict zones where our military was involved.
McMorrow: What we are watching is a weaponization of ICE and Immigration Services that actually does nothing to make us safer, and it in fact, makes us less safe. The things that law enforcement agencies need to do their job well is trust within the community. [The federal government’s immigration enforcement] is un-American, and it doesn’t benefit us as Michiganders. Michigan is a state that has attracted people from all around the world who have led us to become one of the most diverse states in the entire country, and that enriches all of our opportunities here in Michigan. I will continue to use my platform as a candidate to pull the wool back on what Kristi Noem and the Trump administration are doing, because it’s not security, it’s security theater.
 
Many Arab and Muslim American voters no longer trust the Democratic Party. How can you rebuild trust and earn their votes without simply echoing their frustrations? 
El-Sayed: I watched, in 2024, as our party sided with a genocidal leader in a country committing a genocide with our tax dollars. And I watched so much of that trust and so much of that work dashed. I don’t know when we stopped being the party of peace, but I’ll tell you this, I remember voting for Barack Obama back in 2008. It was my second presidential election, so excited to vote for him, because he was somebody who’s willing to stand up against a stupid war, the one that we should never have fought. And my question today is, why? How can we not, as a party, recognize that those are our roots, guaranteeing people health care, siding with workers over corporations, making sure that we don’t send our money abroad to drop bombs on other people’s kids, when we could be spending it here on our schools and our health care and our own infrastructure? It’s really not that hard. And I think if we want to win back our community, we have to win back our community on principle, and those are the principles I’m running on.
McMorrow: I’ve even been disappointed by my own party. I wonder what our message is and what we stand for, how are we fighting and how are we standing up for people? I am somebody who came into this work because I believe in the power of community and bringing people together. I also, as the chair of the state Senate Economic and Community Development Committee, believe that the way for us to approach foreign policy is not by leading with the military first, it’s by creating economic opportunity, creating business exchanges, welcoming refugees, welcoming immigrants. … That is something that I have built a track record of. I would love to sit around every table with you, to hear your stories. And we have a lot of work to do to build that trust back. And I’m encouraged to see that we are facing a new generation of leadership across the board, coming into Congress and coming into the Senate, who can hopefully write a new Democratic Party.

,California,2025-10-16 01:31:10+00:00,CalMatters,California hospitals are suing over the state’s efforts to curb their spending,Ana B. Ibarra,,,,,https://calmatters.org/health/2025/10/hospital-spending-cap-lawsuit/,"Hospitals argue that spending caps imposed by an affordability office will result in layoffs, cuts in health care services and reduced access to care for Californians.","In summary
Hospitals argue that spending caps imposed by an affordability office will result in layoffs, cuts in health care services and reduced access to care for Californians.



California hospitals filed a lawsuit against a state health regulator Wednesday, seeking to block rules meant to keep consumer health care costs from growing too quickly. 
The state Office of Health Care Affordability sets limits on health care spending, capping the amount that a hospital’s spending can grow each year. The California Hospital Association argues that the rules are illegal and will result in layoffs and cuts in services, ultimately reducing access to care.
In a complaint filed in San Francisco County Superior Court, the hospital association argues that setting spending limits creates “arbitrary and irresponsible cost targets that single out hospitals.” The suit also contends  that the rules “will severely disrupt … hospitals’ ability to provide comprehensive, high-quality services by starving them of the resources they need to perform their critical roles.” 
A spokesman for the California Health and Human Services Agency, which oversees the affordability office, said the agency does not comment on pending litigation. 
In 2022, state lawmakers created the affordability office with the goal of containing skyrocketing health care costs. More than half of Californians have reported skipping medical care because it costs too much, and 38% report carrying medical debt. In California, health care spending reached $405 billion in 2020 — or $10,299 per person — a 30% increase over five years. 
The office’s appointed board, noting that median household income in California grows an average of 3% annually, set spending targets for hospitals and other providers that aim to match the rise in consumer income. The rules limit spending growth to 3.5% beginning in 2025, and then lower the cap to 3% annually, starting in four years. 
Eight other states have targets similar to California’s rules. In California, hospitals and providers are required to submit spending data to the state to show compliance. Beginning in 2028, the state can enforce spending targets with performance improvement plans and fines. 
The affordability board’s approval of the growth caps was contentious, with one board member saying the target was unrealistic. 
Office’s regulators have since also reduced the limits further for seven hospitals, calling them “high-cost” for consumers. For these facilities, including Stanford Health Care in Palo Alto and Community Hospital of the Monterey Peninsula, regulators set spending growth targets of 1.8% in 2026 and 1.6% in four years. 
“The spending caps set by politically appointed bureaucrats could force cuts that result in many Californians traveling farther for care, facing longer emergency room wait times, experiencing more overcrowding, and losing access to critical services like maternity care, cancer treatment, behavioral health services, and surgical care,” California Hospital Association president and CEO Carmela Coyle said in a statement.
In its suit, the association estimates that the state’s spending target will force 75% of its members to operate at a loss. The policy, the group argues, ignores the rising cost pressures on hospitals, including labor, pharmaceutical prices and a rapidly aging population. In addition, hospitals estimate that a federal spending law will result in billions in losses over the next 10 years, as federal funding and reimbursement for patient care is cut or reduced. 
The statewide target also applies to large doctor groups and health insurers. The California Association of Health Plans, which represents insurers, responded to the hospital association’s lawsuit by saying the state cannot reach its goal of making health care more affordable “unless everyone is part of the solution.” The lawsuit, according to the group, “demonstrates [hospitals’] lack of commitment to the affordability that Californians urgently need.”
Consumer advocates who back the industry spending targets slammed the hospital association’s lawsuit, calling it “outrageous.” 
“For years, health care costs have vastly outpaced inflation and wage growth, with very little to show for it — our higher costs don’t translate to better quality of care, outcomes, equity, or access,” said Amanda McAllister, the executive director of the consumer group Health Access California. That’s why, she said, the state “very thoughtfully” created an affordability office and set rules to control the problem. 
“This lawsuit is a blatant attempt to try to change the rules of the game after the fact because you don’t like the outcome,” she said. Supported by the California Health Care Foundation (CHCF), which works to ensure that people have access to the care they need, when they need it, at a price they can afford.

,Pennsylvania Capital Star,2025-10-16 00:53:28+00:00,Pennsylvania Capital-Star,Shapiro visits Lebanon County to celebrate farm preservation milestone,John Cole,,,,,https://penncapital-star.com/agriculture-pa-farms/shapiro-visits-lebanon-county-to-celebrate-farm-preservation-milestone/,"As a result of the Farmland Preservation Program, Pennsylvania has preserved more than 6,600 farms and 650,000 acres of farmland for agricultural use.","Gov. Josh Shapiro visited Lebanon County Wednesday to tout a farmland preservation milestone.
Shapiro announced at Talview Dairy Farm that Pennsylvania has now preserved 6,600 farms and 650,000 acres of farmland for agricultural use, now making Pennsylvania the state with the most farms preserved in the nation.
“I am proud of the fact that we are the top state in the nation for farmland preservation,” Shapiro said. “And this work is critical. More and more of our family farms can stay farms forever.”
“Listen, preservation is critically important,” he added. “The future of agriculture is absolutely critical.”
This is a result of the Farmland Preservation Program, which was created in 1988 as a partnership between all levels of government and non-profit organizations, with the intention of saving farmland.
Since then, Pennsylvania has invested more than $1.78 billion in partnership with county and local governments to protect these farmlands from sprawl and development. Shapiro’s administration has invested more than $140 million into this program, since he took office.
Brent Copenhaver and his wife Stacey own Talview Dairy Farm, a dairy operation in Lebanon County, and sell most of their milk regionally in Pennsylvania. They are currently milking about 400 cows and farm approximately 400 acres they purchased from Stacey’s parents.
Their farm was preserved in 1994 as a part of this program.
“Preserving farmland ensures agriculture stays part of Pennsylvania’s economy,” Brent Copenhaver said. “As far as local food, local jobs, and just community, in general.”
“When you protect a farm, you’re not only saving open space, you are protecting the values, the work ethic, and the opportunities that farms pass on from generation to generation,” he added.
Lebanon County has preserved about 22,000 acres of farmland since the creation of this program, with another 2,000 acres in the process of preservation.
Pennsylvania Agriculture Secretary Russell Redding and Shapiro lauded that the program has been continued by Democratic and Republican administrations, as proof the effort to preserve farmland is a bipartisan issue.
According to Shapiro’s administration, agriculture contributes $132 billion to the commonwealth’s economy annually and supports nearly 600,000 jobs in the state.
But, Shapiro said, the Trump administration’s trade policies put the commonwealth’s agriculture sector at risk.
Since the beginning of Trump’s second term, Shapiro has been an outspoken critic of President Donald Trump’s tariff policy.
When talking to farmers about their concerns, Shapiro said he often hears that they want more capital and they’re worried about the workforce. He also said they’ve expressed concern about tariffs.
“I think we’re seeing the tariffs really hurt our farmers here in Pennsylvania,” Shapiro said in response to a question from the Capital-Star. “We’ve seen, for example, those who work in, you know, the forestry industry, they’ve lost 35% of their market in just the six months or so since those tariffs have been in place.”
“We’ve seen a number of our dairy farmers be more and more and more concerned about losing market share, particularly with Mexico,” he added. “I think these tariffs are just hurting our farmers, maybe more than any other sector.”
Farmers, Shapiro said, are bearing the brunt of the impact of tariffs.
Republican officials who support Trump’s tariff policies believe it will have a positive impact and protect American agriculture and jobs.
According to Axios, National Economic Council director Kevin Hassett said a “clever and generous” bailout for farmers could be coming as soon as the government shutdown ends, in response to the impact felt by tariffs. There have been reports that the bailout could be at least $10 billion.
During Trump’s first term, about $25 billion from the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) was used to give direct payments to farmers impacted by trade disputes with China.
CCC funds are used to implement specific programs established by Congress as well as to carry out activities under the broad authorities of the CCC Charter Act, according to the USDA.
During a visit to Talview Dairy in April, U.S. Agriculture Sec. Brooke Rollins said the administration is prepared to provide relief to farmers “if there is damaging consequences to these (trade) negotiations.”
Shapiro said that he hasn’t seen what the Trump administration is planning to do with a potential bailout, but used it as an opportunity to double down on his criticism of tariff policy.
“I’m not sure why you’d put tariffs in place, shut down markets, drive up costs, and then say to farmers, and here’s some money, not to farm,” Shapiro said to the Capital-Star. “I think what farmers want to do is they want to farm. They want to produce more of their crops. They want to do more.”
“They don’t want to be inhibited,” he added. “And I think what these tariffs have done is really inhibited our farmers and driven up costs for consumers.”
Copenhaver told the Capital-Star that his farm hasn’t personally felt any kind of impact as a result of the tariffs. 
 
What do farmers want?
Copenhaver said right now, like many farmers, the No. 1 issue or concern on farmers’ minds is the price and profitability of agriculture and farming.
“I think everyone wants to be profitable, of course,” he told the Capital-Star.
He said the industry at times faces economic issues, as well as weather-related dilemmas, noting that agriculture is “always very challenging.”
However, Copenhaver said he’d describe the current state of agriculture in Pennsylvania as “very strong.”
“We can go anywhere from poultry to crop farming to beef to dairy. And I feel very fortunate that I am able to farm in Pennsylvania,” he said.
What can the state and federal government do to positively impact agriculture?
“The best thing that state government can do would be get the budget passed,” Copenhaver said. “I think that would be very important as far as some funding for agriculture. I also think it has ramifications on local school districts.”
Pennsylvania’s budget impasse is now over 100 days.

Patty Murray.
Murray, a Democrat from Washington, hosted the call with three Montanans, state Sen. Cora Neumann; Vicky Byrd, CEO of the Montana Nurses Association; and Rob Gregoire, a retired business owner from Bozeman who relies on ACA tax credits for health care.
Wednesday was the 15th day of a federal government shutdown. Republicans and Democrats are at an impasse in Washington, D.C., and health care subsidies are a key issue in the fight.
Murray said she held the call because families in red states such as Montana are being affected, Republicans in the U.S. Senate are dodging the issue, and Republican lawmakers need to negotiate.
Montana has an all Republican federal delegation, including U.S. Sens. Steve Daines and Tim Sheehy, both of Bozeman.
“This issue is not going to magically disappear,” said Murray, vice chairperson of the Senate Appropriations Committee and a senior member and former chair of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions (HELP) Committee.
The U.S. Senate has failed to pass resolutions for a short term fix, and neither Republicans nor Democrats appear ready to make concessions, States Newsroom’s Washington, D.C., Bureau reports.
Democrats argue health care tax credits set to expire at the end of the year need to be extended, but Republican leaders say Democrats first need to fund a stopgap measure.
Byrd said without the tax credits, families and local economies will suffer. More than 67,000 Montanans use the ACA tax credits to afford insurance, according to KFF, a health policy research organization.
Byrd said farmers, ranchers and small business owners that use the ACA marketplace for insurance bring critical revenue that allows rural hospitals to stay afloat.
Those hospitals pay the nurses and providers who care for people in small communities. Citing KFF, she said more than 80% of marketplace enrollees in rural areas rely on the subsidies.
“The stakes couldn’t be higher,” Byrd said.
She said 7,000 Montanans could lose coverage entirely.
Montanans with the tax credits pay an average monthly premium of $145, compared to $635 without the credit, according to Murray’s office.
Nearly 70% of the hospitals in Montana are rural, among the highest in the nation, and those facilities are crucial, Byrd said.
Neumann, a Bozeman Democrat, said Montana has been a success story for rural access to health care, and she said the 2025 Montana Legislature passed Medicaid expansion with bipartisan support.
“We know in a state as large as ours just how vital it is to be able to access rural health care,” said Neumann, who works in the field.
Around the country, as many as 100 rural hospitals have closed, but she said Montana has not lost one.
Neumann said that’s because Montana has cut its uninsured rate in half, reduced the burden of uncompensated care on hospitals by 50%, and in just one year, brought in $475 million in new personal income because of Medicaid expansion.
“Let’s continue this winning streak,” Neumann said.
She said Montana’s own Republican state auditor James Brown signed onto a letter with other auditors across the country calling on Congress to continue the enhanced tax credits that started during the pandemic.
“Auditors know intimately how dangerous these cuts are,” Neumann said.
But Neumann said the federal delegation is not listening to Montanans.
She also said the delegation “has phenomenal health care coverage,” and their intransigence on the matter for others confused her.
“For them to sit pretty in Washington and accept some of the best health care coverage in the country while Montanans lose their coverage just reminds me of how out of touch they are with Montana,” Neumann said.
Spokespeople from the offices of Daines and Sheehy did not respond to emails from the Daily Montanan late Wednesday afternoon about the comments they are hearing from Montanans on health subsidies. Both have blamed Democrats for the shutdown.
Some Republicans believe the subsidies, enhanced during the Covid-19 pandemic, went too far, and they can be discussed after the federal government reopens.
But the leaders on the call Wednesday said the matter is urgent.
Neumann said when people lose coverage, they stop seeking care, end up in the emergency room, and the hospital covers the costs — and the vicious cycle puts hospitals on the ropes, and with them, communities.
She said 56% of Montana’s small businesses rely on the marketplace and Medicaid for coverage, and small businesses could collapse without the support.
Byrd said she only receives form letters back from members of the delegation when she has reached out to them, and Neumann said she has not heard a response to a message she sent when the shutdown started (it wasn’t immediately clear which members of the delegation Neumann, of Bozeman, had sent messages to).
Murray said Republicans “moved heaven and earth” this summer to pass a “tax extender” — temporary tax cuts — for billionaires in just a few short weeks, and Democrats repeatedly asked them to do the same for ACA tax credits, “and they refused.”
People in Idaho started seeing increases Wednesday to their insurance costs, and Montanans will on Nov. 1, she said.
“I”m hearing a lot of stress, apprehension, fear, people who are saying that they’re farmers or ranchers, and they’re on the ACA in Montana, and I know that they are counting on us to do the right thing,” Murray said.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/GettyImages-1463564287-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-15 20:56:57.822349

It was Mississippi’s second execution of the year and the third in the U.S. this week, following executions Tuesday in Florida and Missouri. Including Crawford, 38 people have been executed in the U.S. this year, and six more executions are scheduled in the nation through the end of the year.
Crawford, 59, was pronounced dead at 6:15 p.m. 
“To my family, I love you,” Crawford said while strapped to a gurney. “I’m at peace. I’ve got God’s peace. … I’ll be in heaven.”
He also said, “To the victim’s family, true closure and true peace, you cannot reach that without God.”
His final words were, “Thank you, God, for giving me the peace that I have.”
In 1994, Crawford was convicted of capital murder and received a death sentence. The next three decades he pursued appeals challenging the sentence, as well as separate sentences for aggravated assault and rape that were used as a basis for the death penalty. 
At the time of the killing, Crawford was days away from a separate trial for sexual and physical violence against two teenage girls. He cut through the screen to the bedroom of Ray’s home and left a ransom note demanding $15,000. 
He took her to a wooded area where he raped her and then stabbed her in the chest. He claimed to experience blackouts but was able to show law enforcement where to find her body. 
On Wednesday, Ray’s mother Mary traveled to Parchman to witness the execution, but her father Tommy was not able to be there because of his health, the Northeast Mississippi Daily Journal reported.  
Mary Ray did not offer comment after the execution, but last week she told the Tupelo newspaper that witnessing it would not change a thing. 
“I don’t like the word ‘closure,’” she said. “I have a hole in my heart as big as my heart that will never be closed.”
After the execution, Republican Attorney General Lynn Fitch said her office has pursued justice for the Ray family and Crawford’s other victims and prayed they received long-awaited closure. 
Leading up to the execution, Crawford petitioned the U.S Supreme Court to halt the execution. The high court denied his final appeal Wednesday evening. 
The day of the execution he also filed emergency motions to stay the execution with the Mississippi Supreme Court, which were denied by the afternoon. 
Republican Gov. Tate Reeves denied a clemency petition, noting circumstances of the crime and  how Crawford did not claim innocence. 
A consciousness check was performed on Crawford after the first of the three lethal injection drugs were administered, which prison officials said earlier in the day was required at the state’s most recent execution in June. 
In a statement after the execution, Crawford’s attorneys from the Mississippi Office of Capital Post-Conviction Counsel said he was put to death without receiving a fair trial.
“Despite a legal system that failed him, Charles Crawford (‘Chuck’) spent every day in prison trying to be the best person, family member, friend and Christian he could be,” the statement read.
Crawford’s surviving family members include a sister, his father and stepmother. 
At trial, prosecutors asked several of Crawford’s family members if they still loved him in spite of the crimes and if they wanted him to be executed. They said they love him but don’t support what he did, and that they did not want him to receive the death penalty.
In closing arguments before the death sentence was handed down, prosecutors said the Crawford family shifted blame onto others for his actions and they criticized his mother for a number of actions, including not calling law enforcement earlier, helping him pay for bond and “letting him out” of the house with a shotgun. 
Hours before the execution Wednesday, Parchman Superintendent Marc McClure said Crawford seemed relaxed and visited with his family and a preacher he requested. 
Crawford asked for a double cheeseburger, fries and two desserts – peach cobbler and chocolate ice cream – for his last meal, prison officials said. 
Starting in the afternoon, demonstrators gathered outside the prison gates in the Delta community of Parchman and the Governor’s Mansion in Jackson. 
Organizations including Death Penalty Action and Catholic Mobilizing Network circulated petitions that called on the governor to stop the execution, citing Crawford’s argument about how his trial attorneys admitted his guilt and pursued an insanity defense against his wishes. 
Crawford was the second Mississippi inmate executed this year, following the lethal injection of Richard Jordan in June. The state resumed executions in 2021 after a 12-year hiatus. 
Thirty six people remain on death row in Mississippi, and the attorney general’s office is seeking execution dates for two – Willie Jerome Manning and Robert Simon Jr.

(Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)Picture this: You work for a cybersecurity team at a company that’s just had its network filleted open by a cyberattack. Your company’s CEO is calling. The press is calling. Other assorted stakeholders are calling with their immediate concerns. 
That was roughly the intense and hectic scenario described by Douglas Alexander, the director of Rhode Island College’s (RIC) Institute for Cybersecurity & Emerging Technologies, during a Wednesday walkthrough with press and state leaders of the institute’s new cyber range.
“As we all know, sometimes under pressure, we all don’t respond at our best,” Alexander said. 
The new cyber range is designed to help students learn how to perform within the unique gravity and demands of these scenarios in a more realistic way via staged cyber attacks. The range is the latest addition to the cyber institute, which opened in 2023 and is chaired by noted cybersecurity sage and former congressman Jim Langevin, who shared progress images of the range with Gov. Dan McKee earlier this year.
“I felt I was looking at ‘Star Wars’ or something like that,” McKee said during a public ceremony for the range’s grand opening before the walkthrough. 
The range relies on IBM’s Cloud Range platform to simulate cyberattacks and teach students how to respond to them. Simulations displayed as tiles on a screen at the range Wednesday sported difficulty levels ranging from novice to advanced, with titles pulled from real threat actors’ strategies or broader tactics like ransomware or website defacements. 
The Pawtucket-based firm LLB Architects — also enlisted recently by the Department of State to conduct a feasibility study for a state archives building — designed the classroom, which accommodates up to 24 students across four workstations. Each workstation has six computers, outfitted with Dell monitors and Alienware mice and keyboards that, on Wednesday at least, glowed with a futuristic blue. The room’s ceiling is outfitted with LED fixtures in similarly glowing hues, and the front wall sports a 24-foot-wide by 4-foot-tall screen that plays out the simulations.
The cyber range’s network is also isolated from the rest of the RIC network, to prevent spillover of any malware to other computers on campus. The school is also making it available to outside parties for “single-session engagements, annual multi-exercise programs, and comprehensive incident response plan stress tests,” according to an institute press release.










I felt I was looking at ‘Star Wars’ or something like that.


– Rhode Island Gov. Dan McKee 


RIC is the third school to use the cyber range as part of the IBM Cyber Campus program, which is the company’s partnership with Cloud Range, the latter’s founder and CEO Debbie Gordon confirmed in an email Wednesday.
Wednesday’s ceremony also included a “powering up” — an electrified equivalent of a ribbon cutting, in which McKee and other state and university leaders joined together to press a big blue button before the cyber range’s 24-foot-wide screen lit up for ostensibly the first time.
Alas, the room has already seen some use this semester, Lindsay Russell, a spokesperson for RIC’s cyber institute, confirmed over phone Wednesday. 
But students and faculty have largely “been dipping their toes in,” Russell said, acquainting themselves with the space, and by next semester the classroom will be more fully integrated into the institute’s curriculum. 
The range’s home is on the first floor of Alger Hall. RIC intends, however, to move the simulation space to Whipple Hall once the renovations there are complete — including about $73 million for the makeovers drawn from the funds voters authorized via a 2024 ballot measure.



More pressure on state and local leaders
During the speaking program before the cyber range’s ceremonial powering on, retired U.S. Rear Adm. Mark Montgomery highlighted the need for cybersecurity education amid looming and numerous international threat actors which are beginning to target U.S. infrastructure more and more frequently. 
“Really complicating this is that right now, Washington is tied up,” Montgomery said. “They’re tied up in knots, and they’re not able to proceed on a lot of these issues. So in my mind, that means the solutions have to push down to the state and local level, to the academics, to the nonprofits, to push these issues, to think of the solutions to drive change.” 
Alexander echoed that sentiment during his demonstration, and recalled a recent “60 Minutes” special that detailed how Littleton, a town of about 10,000 in western Massachusetts, had its electric and water utility system hacked by Volt Typhoon, a prolific cyber crime outfit with ties to the People’s Liberation Army Cyberspace Force. The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Agency (CISA) first issued an advisory on the group in 2023, outlining Volt Typhoon’s playbook and its purported sponsorship by the People’s Republic of China, which has denied any connections to the group.
Volt Typhoon primarily uses living-off-the-land techniques, according to Microsoft and CISA. That means embedding within a network’s existing administrative toolbox to limit logging, avoid detection and then run scripts as needed. The group is known to use Windows’ native command line to gain a foothold in government and infrastructure networks. 
Volt Typhoon is also one of the simulations available in Cloud Range’s portfolio of exercises at RIC. It’s an advanced level simulation.
“This is the sword of Damocles that China has hanging over us, is ‘We could shut down your critical infrastructure, if we wanted to,’” Alexander said. “That is a heck of a leverage.”
But one does not have to go as far as Beijing or even as close as Massachusetts to find high-profile instances of cybercrime. Alexander gave the now canonical example of a large-scale data breach in Rhode Island, RIBridges. The breach of the state’s public benefits and health insurance marketplace in 2024 siphoned personal information of approximately 650,000 Rhode Islanders from state servers, which Alexander called “a fairly traumatic event for a sizable number of Rhode Island citizens.”
Two of the state’s top IT officials who wrestled with that breach — Chief Information Officer Brian Tardiff and Chief Information Security Officer Nathan Loura — attended Wednesday’s event. Both men left by the time Alexander gave his demo in the cyber range, which gave him permission to sing Tardiff and Loura’s praises.

“They actually were very proud of their command center and how they responded internally to that attack,” Alexander said. “It was a brutal time. It was clearly not optimal for them, but they pulled together.” 
Alexander credited Tardiff and Loura’s performance on the backend of the incident response as grounded in the pair’s “pre-existing relationships with each other that even predated their positions at the state.”
“Now, we still need to get their team in here to really test that out, because we’ve got some advanced scenarios so that could put them to the test,” Alexander said of the state IT team.
That teamwork is what hardens a war room against attack, Alexander said. The cyber range is geared toward giving students “a fairly immersive, pressure filled situation,” he said, which will replicate the intensity of a real-time cyberattack, rather than the abstraction of tabletop scenarios. 
Alexander likened tabletop scenarios to a game of Dungeon & Dragons — a pattern of action and response with a predictable pace, something lacking the “hands-on” experience a simulation can provide. 
“Those poor professional skills are often the make or break differentiator between a successful defense and a failed defense, or an attack that goes on for too long,” Alexander said.
The cyber range’s post-scenario evaluations include a rubric to indicate the quality of teamwork during a given exercise. Perhaps a team does well overall, but individual members didn’t communicate well with others or had conflicts that impacted their work.
“These are all very human responses, especially under pressure,” Alexander said. “But if we can do that in a safe space…we’re much better off than if that happens in a real life attack.”

(Photo by Antoinette Grajeda/Arkansas Advocate)A Pulaski County circuit judge said she would issue a ruling quickly in a lawsuit seeking to move up the dates of the Senate District 26 special election after a hearing Wednesday.
The lawsuit, which attorney Jennifer Waymack Standerfer filed last week in Pulaski County Circuit Court on behalf of Franklin County resident Colt Shelby, seeks an earlier date for a special election to fill the seat left vacant by the death of Branch Republican Sen. Gary Stubblefield. The suit alleges the current schedule prevents District 26 voters from having a voice during the 2026 fiscal session, which begins in April.
The attorney general’s office is representing the defendants, Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders and Secretary of State Cole Jester. During Wednesday’s hearing, Senior Assistant Attorney General Ryan Hale said the case should be dismissed because the plaintiff failed to state a claim and because of sovereign immunity, the legal doctrine that the state cannot be sued in its own courts.
Franklin County resident sues to move up election to fill Arkansas senator’s seat

Pulaski County Circuit Judge Patricia James said she understood the time-sensitivity of the case at the end of the two-hour hearing Wednesday, but didn’t issue a ruling.
“I know it’s important to everyone here” that a decision be made in the case soon, James told the packed courtroom. “It will be quick.”
In an amended complaint filed Tuesday, Standerfer asked the court to order Sanders to schedule the special election “on the earliest date” possible prior to the 2026 fiscal session, while still complying with election laws and deadlines.
Hale argued the court does not have the authority to grant the plaintiff’s request.
“Specifically, the Court has no authority to set the timeline for the special election,” Hale wrote in court documents. “And to the extent a declaration is based on an equitable request for relief, the Court does not have authority to declare that the special election must occur in advance of the 2026 fiscal session, that the Governor failed to follow the law concerning vacancies, or that the Governor’s determinations related to the special election were ‘untimely and violative of law.’”
State law requires a special election be held within 150 days of a legislative vacancy, unless the governor finds it is “impracticable or unduly burdensome” to do so.
Standerfer argued Wednesday that the issue was “largely” a question of law, because Sanders “neglected” to explain her reason for determining that holding the election sooner was not possible or too burdensome.
State law gives Sanders the authority to determine if the 150-day requirement is impracticable or too burdensome, Hale said, not the courts. There is no requirement in the special election law that Sanders justify her use of the exception, so the governor’s decision is not challengable, Hale argued.
Numerous special elections over the last 15 years have gone past the 150-day mark, but Sanders’ proposed schedule for Stubblefield’s seat is the longest by far, according to an unpublished Senate memo.
Sanders originally scheduled the special primary and general elections for the seat on March 3 and Nov. 3 of next year, coinciding with the state’s regular midterm election schedule. After bipartisan pushback, she revised the general election date to June 9.
Much of that criticism focused on a lack of representation for residents of District 26, which includes parts of Franklin County where the state has proposed building a 3,000-bed prison. During the fiscal session that starts in April, lawmakers are likely to vote on funding for the controversial project, which is expected to cost $825 million, according to preliminary estimates. Many locals living near the site are staunchly opposed to the prison, and an appropriations bill for the project failed five times during the 2025 legislative session.
The state did not call any witnesses during the hearing, while Standerfer called six — Shelby; Stubblefield’s daughter, Amber Sullivan; Republican Sen. Bryan King of Green Forest, an outspoken critic of the proposed prison; and three election workers from Franklin and Logan counties.
Jo Dawn Carter, Logan County’s election coordinator, testified that the longer it took to set election dates, the more work it would be to ensure the county was prepared. However, Carter said Logan County election officials would do everything necessary to ensure a smooth election if the dates are moved up.
In an interview with the Advocate after the hearing, Carter said she’d already begun preparing for if the election dates are changed.

While the Trump administration and Montana’s elected officials continue pushing to expand the state’s coal industry, companies on the ground appear to have a waning appetite. 
The federal government recently rejected a bid on a new coal lease offered for 167 million tons of coal from Montana’s Powder River Basin and postponed a sale in Wyoming scheduled for last week. 
Navajo Transitional Energy Company was the only company to submit a bid for the lease in Montana for $186,000 for federal coal near the company’s Spring Creek Mine in Big Horn County. That works out to just a fraction of a penny per ton, and well below what the Bureau of Land Management estimates as the market value. 
The last federal coal lease sale in the region went for $1.10 per ton, according to federal data, for a total of $793 million for 721 million tons, back in 2012. At the same price, a bid for the Spring Creek lease would generate more than $183 million.  
Navajo Transitional Energy operates the Spring Creek Mine in the area, which the federal government approved for expansion earlier this year, allowing access to an additional 39.9 million tons of coal, which could keep the mine operational for up to 16 more years. 
Wyofile previously reported that Navajo Transitional had warned that market value for coal in the Powder River Basin was far below previous valuations, and in documents submitted before the bid said that one reason included low forecasts for selling the coal, as many coal-fired power plants in the region are set to go offline in the next two decades. 
The Bureau of Land Management rejected NTEC’s offer for the Spring Creek lease, saying it did not meet the requirements of the federal Minerals Leasing Act, which requires a fair-market value for any federal lease. 
In an email, a spokesperson for the Department of the Interior said the BLM determines fair market value through “a rigorous process that includes economic modeling, analysis of comparable sales, and current market conditions to ensure taxpayers receive a fair return.”
“The BLM remains committed to supporting responsible coal development as part of a balanced approach to managing public lands and resources,” the department said. 
Funds from federal coal leases are split between the federal government and the state where the coal is mined, but part of the Trump administration’s “Big Beautiful Bill” lowered the federal coal royalty rate from 12.8% to 7%, decreasing how much money Montana is set to earn from each lease. 
The low offer for the Spring Creek lease prompted BLM to postpone another auction on a 441 million ton West Antelope III federal lease in Wyoming. Navajo Transitional also requested the sale in association with its Antelope coal mine, and was reportedly the only party interested in bidding. 
“While we had hoped for stronger participation, the postponed West Antelope III coal lease sale in Wyoming underscores the lasting damage from the Obama-Biden administration’s decades-long war on coal, which aimed to dismantle domestic production and shake investor confidence in the industry,” an Interior spokesperson wrote in an email. “Under President Trump, the Department of the Interior and BLM are restoring trust between government and industry as part of the broader push for American Energy Dominance.”
The West Antelope III sale has yet to be rescheduled. 
 Mining for Montana’s benefit

The low interest in coal leases comes as the Trump administration and Congress, with the support of all four members of Montana’s delegation have moved to greatly expand the potential offerings across the West. 
Last year, the Biden administration had announced that it would be halting much coal leasing in eastern Montana, and had made steps toward stopping coal leasing on federal tracts of land due to concerns about climate change.
But just last week, the U.S. Senate voted to roll back the Biden-era Resource Management Plan (RMP) amendment for the Miles City BLM office, spanning most of eastern Montana, which had prohibited future coal leases in the region. The U.S. House voted in favor of the amendment in September, with both of Montana’s representatives joining the Republican majority. 
“Montana energy is back,” Sen. Steve Daines said in a press release. “Mining is a vital part of Montana, providing nearly a thousand well-paying jobs and contributing nearly $3 billion to our state’s economy. That’s why I introduced a bill along with the rest of our Montana delegation to remove this anti-energy rule and support Montana’s coal miners.”
Daines did not respond to questions about the low interest in the recent coal lease or how increasing potential supply could further impact the market and Montana’s financial coffers. 
Montana’s Republican Gov. Greg Gianforte had also supported reopening eastern Montana for coal leasing, saying it was essential to the state’s economy and revenue. Montana supplies 5% of the nation’s coal and derives 37% of energy generation from coal-fired power plants.  
“Under the Biden Administration, BLM’s proposal would have rendered Montana’s coal resources useless, depriving Montana schools and other institutions of a critical funding source,” Gianforte wrote in a letter to the Trump administration. “Montana’s schools and public institutions need a good partner in BLM, and it is imperative that the agency embrace the opportunity to maximize the development opportunities for coal resources in Montana.”
Gianforte’s office did not respond to questions about the low interest in the recent coal lease or how increasing potential supply could further impact the market for Montana coal and the state’s financial benefit. 
Conservation groups decried the move by Congress to overturn the resource management plan, saying that it came about through a multi-year public process, but was revoked through a single vote. 
“It’s an egregious example of rich politicians thinking they know better than locals and experts. By legislating day-to-day management, Congress is hijacking careful planning and stewardship developed by local communities and experts,” said Alex Blackmer, with Wild Montana. “This reckless move puts not just one plan, but hundreds of land plans nationwide at risk of Congressional interference, unleashing chaos and uncertainty on ranchers, hunters, hikers, anglers, and businesses that depend on our public lands.”
Additional resource management plans from the Biden administration that banned future coal leasing, including in Wyoming’s Powder River Basin, are also being challenged in Congress. 
In Montana, Gianforte has continued to push for expanding energy production in the state, most recently by convening an energy task force to “unleash American-made energy,” following Trump’s executive orders to bolster nationwide domestic fossil fuel energy sources.

,Mississippi Today,2025-10-15 23:51:50+00:00,Mississippi Today,US Supreme Court seems inclined to limit race-based electoral districts under the Voting Rights Act,Associated Press,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/10/15/supreme-court-race-based-electoral-districts-voting-rights-act/,The U.S. Supreme Court appears ready to gut a key tool of the Voting Rights Act that has helped root out racial discrimination in voting for more than a half century.,"WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court on Wednesday appeared ready to gut a key tool of the Voting Rights Act that has helped root out racial discrimination in voting for more than a half century, a change that would boost Republican electoral prospects, particularly across the South.
During more than two hours of arguments, the court’s six conservative justices seemed inclined to effectively strike down a majority-Black congressional district in Louisiana because it relied too heavily on race.
Such an outcome would mark a fundamental change in the 1965 voting rights law, the centerpiece legislation of the Civil Rights Movement, that succeeded in opening the ballot box to Black Americans and reducing persistent discrimination in voting.
A ruling for Louisiana could open the door for legislatures to redraw congressional maps in southern states, helping Republican electoral prospects by eliminating majority Black and Latino districts that tend to favor Democrats. Legislatures already are free to draw extremely partisan districts, subject only to review by state courts, because of a 2019 Supreme Court decision.
In September, Mississippi Attorney General Lynn Fitch filed papers asked the U.S. Supreme Court to to sharply curtail the federal Voting Rights Act by limiting who can sue to enforce protection against racial discrimination at the ballot box. 
Fitch, a Republican, is appealing a federal district court judge’s ruling that said state lawmakers must redraw the three Mississippi Supreme Court districts because they dilute Black voting strength. The district court judge’s ruling forbids the state from using the current maps in future Mississippi Supreme Court elections. It is pending before the U.S. 5th Circuit Court of Appeals. However, the appellate court has paused all proceedings in the appeal until the U.S. Supreme Court rules on redistricting cases.
Just two years ago, the nation’s highest court, by a 5-4 vote, affirmed a ruling that found a likely violation of Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act in a case over Alabama’s political boundaries. Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Brett Kavanaugh joined their three more liberal colleagues in the outcome.
Roberts and Kavanaugh struck a different tone Wednesday, especially in their questions to civil rights lawyer Janai Nelson.
The chief justice suggested the Alabama decision was tightly focused on its facts and should not be read to require a similar outcome in Louisiana.
Kavanaugh pressed Nelson on whether the time has come to end the use of race-based districts under the Voting Rights Act, rather than “allowing it to extend forever.”
The court’s liberal justices focused on the history of the Voting Rights Act in combating discrimination. Getting to the remedy of redrawing districts only happens if, as Justice Elena Kagan said, a court finds “a specific identified, proved violation of law.”
A mid-decade battle over congressional redistricting already is playing out across the nation after Republican President Donald Trump began urging Texas and other GOP-controlled states to redraw their lines to make it easier for the GOP to hold its narrow majority in the House.
The court’s conservative majority has been skeptical of considerations of race, most recently ending affirmative action in college admissions. Twelve years ago, the court bludgeoned another pillar of the landmark voting law that required states with a history of racial discrimination to get advance approval from the Justice Department or federal judges before making election-related changes.
The court has separately given state legislatures wide berth to gerrymander for political purposes. If the Supreme Court now weakens or strikes down the Voting Rights Act’s Section 2, states would not be bound by any limits in how they draw electoral districts. Such a result would be expected to lead to extreme gerrymandering by whichever party is in power at the state level.

The court’s Alabama decision in 2023 led to new districts there and in Louisiana that sent two more Black Democrats to Congress.
Now, though, the court has asked the parties to answer a fundamental question: “Whether the state’s intentional creation of a second majority-minority congressional district violates the Fourteenth or Fifteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution.”
Louisiana and the Trump administration joined with a group of white voters in arguing to invalidate the challenged district and make it much harder to claim discrimination in redistricting.
The arguments led Justice Sonia Sotomayor to assert that the administration’s “bottom line is just get rid of Section 2.”
Justice Department lawyer Hashim Mooppan disagreed and said state lawmakers would have no incentive to get rid of every majority-Black district because doing so would create swing districts and imperil some Republican incumbents.
In addition, Mooppan said, only 15 of the 60 Black members of the House represent majority-Black districts. “But even if you eliminated Section 2 entirely, fully 75% of the Black congressmen in this country are in districts that are not protected by Section 2.”
In the first arguments in the Louisiana case in March, Roberts sounded skeptical of the second majority-Black district, which last year elected Democratic Rep. Cleo Fields. Roberts described the district as a “snake” that stretches more than 200 miles to link parts of the Shreveport, Alexandria, Lafayette and Baton Rouge areas.
The court fight over Louisiana’s congressional districts has lasted three years. The state’s Republican-dominated legislature drew a new congressional map in 2022 to account for population shifts reflected in the 2020 census. But the changes effectively maintained the status quo of five Republican-leaning, majority-white districts and one Democratic-leaning, majority-Black district.
Civil rights advocates won a lower-court ruling that the districts likely discriminated against Black voters.
Louisiana eventually drew a new map to comply with the court ruling and protect its influential Republican lawmakers, including House Speaker Mike Johnson. But white Louisiana voters claimed in their separate lawsuit that race was the predominant factor driving it. A three-judge court agreed, leading to the current high court case.
The Supreme Court is expected to rule by early summer in 2026.

(Governor's Office photo)Gov. Greg Gianforte ceremonially signed two fire-related bills from Rep. Llew Jones, R-Conrad, on Wednesday, which also ended his annual tour of all 56 Montana counties.
Gianforte signed House Bill 127, which increases funding in the state’s fire suppression fund. It also mandates the Department of Natural Resources and Conservation submit a report on expenditures made under the Fire Suppression Account.
Gianforte said the bill gives more flexibility to the state in regards to fire suppression. Montana pursed an “aggressive” attack on the fires that did pop up this year, he added. Very few fires grew larger than 5,000 acres in the state this past year and about 100,000 acres in total burned, Gianforte said.
“That’s a credit to really DNRC and local fire companies for getting after it,” Gianforte said. “And we got a lot better cooperation from the Forest Service this year than we have in past years.”
House Bill 130, also from Jones, stipulates that the state has a duty to engage in fire suppression regardless of land ownership. It also allows the state to bill the federal agency responsible for the land where a wildfire occurred to reimburse state and county costs associated with the blaze.
“Through House Bill 130, we are able to work with DNRC to respond quickly to all fire starts to execute an aggressive initial attack regardless of who owns the land of where the fire started,” Jones, said in a press release.
Gianforte signed the bills at Lincoln Fire Fall and met with firefighters and emergency responders there, a press release said.

Oct. 15, 2025. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — Green shirts filled a hearing room in Lincoln full of Nebraskans who support the legalization of medical cannabis but oppose the regulations of the product proposed by the state’s new Medical Cannabis Commission.
Thirty-two people testified against the proposed regulations Wednesday. None spoke in support. Testifiers argued the regulations would not be feasible for most people needing medical cannabis, and roughly half called out commissioners for not attending the hearing to listen to their concerns.
“I feel like Nebraska just wants to make it as uncomfortable and unbearable as possible,” said testifier Nathan Brown.
In 2024’s general election, 71% of Nebraska voters voted to legalize medical cannabis, and 67% voted to create the new regulatory commission. Since December, Nebraskans have been able to legally possess up to 5 ounces of medical cannabis, so long as they have a health care practitioner’s recommendation.
However, medical cannabis can’t yet be legally purchased in the state. Just last week, the Medical Cannabis Commission granted two of its four cultivator licenses to Nancy Laughlin-Wagner of Omaha and to Patrick Thomas of Raymond. Chief Legal Officer for Nebraska’s Department of Health and Human Services Bo Botelho said both licenses had been accepted.
In September, the commission advanced a stricter set of regulations in comparison to emergency regulations the group approved in June. Gov. Jim Pillen accepted the new regulations with one revision — to limit cultivators from growing more than 1,250 flowering plants at one time.

The revised regulations would, for the first time, set extensive testing and security requirements and establish a “Recommending Health Care Practitioner Directory” for in-state physicians to recommend medical cannabis. If approved, the rules would remain in effect for up to 90 days.
Under the regulations, patients or caregivers could purchase up to 5 ounces of medical cannabis in a 30-day period, which is about 142 grams. But they could purchase no more than 5 grams of delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) from the same dispensary within a 90-day period. Delta-9 THC is the part of cannabis most associated with a “high.”
Several testifiers said this limit was too restrictive. Testifer Shari Lawlor said a single joint usually weighs about 1 gram, so expecting people with medical needs to be limited to 5 grams of THC over 90 days is impractical.
State Sen. John Cavanaugh of Omaha, who testified at the hearing, went a step further and called the limit a bold violation from the ballot language voters approved in November, which allowed possession of up to five ounces.
Testifiers largely agreed that the proposed regulations go against what voters asked for. Several argued it tells them the people tasked with drafting the regulations lacked an understanding of medical cannabis.
Crista Eggers, campaign manager for the Nebraskans for Medical Marijuana initiatives, brought a large stack of papers representing the roughly 240,000 signatures gathered between both petitions as a visual example of the level of public support for medical cannabis.
“I will guarantee you that every single one of them wished they could be here today,” she said. “You know what, they shouldn’t have to be. They did their part. Voters spoke.”

Some testifiers criticized the limits on acceptable forms of medical cannabis. The proposed regulations exclude smoking and vaping.
Edward Williams, a veteran and member of the Legal Marijuana Now Party, said smoking or vaping is the most effective method of treating him when he wakes up from nightmares due to his PTSD. The key factor is that smoking and vaping is quicker to take effect than other forms of cannabis, such as edibles.
“You can’t really wake up with nightmares or flashbacks and expect to have to wait for an hour or two for an edible to work,” Williams said.
Williams wasn’t the only veteran to testify. Several others spoke about how medical cannabis has benefitted them and said they have lost friends to suicide who didn’t have access to the same treatment.
A majority of Wednesday’s testifiers offered emotional stories about how medical cannabis can alleviate painful ailments for them or their relatives. They described medical cannabis as a safer and cheaper option than other pain relief treatments.
“Instead of needing to put my mother on morphine at the end of her life, where she then went into a coma just to control her pain, we could have had a meaningful and loving last few days had she been prescribed medical cannabis,” said testifer Kathy Jensen.
Registered Nurse Tracey Davidson, who did not testify but attended the hearing, said she was first exposed to the benefits of cannabis when her brother-in-law was diagnosed with cancer about 12 years ago. Because he lived in Colorado, he had access to medical cannabis, and she said he credited that as part of the reason he could continue working and biking until days before his death.
“I view cannabis as medicine,” Davidson said. “I’ve seen it work through my career for a lot of different situations, from pain management, to sleep, to PTSD.”
Many testifiers also criticized the three active medical cannabis commissioners for not attending the hearing, calling it “shameful” and “insulting.” The hearing was required under statute.
Some testifiers even accused members of being “bought off” by anti-marijuana politicians. At a commission meeting several weeks ago, testifier Georganna Schroeder-Stanley said she observed “indifference, boredom and even contempt” on the faces of some commissioners listening to public feedback.

Cavanaugh interviewed the appointees for the commission as part of his duties as a state senator. He said his “fears have come true,” from those interviews — that members are “pursuing a political agenda” that aligns with Pillen’s.
Chair Monica Oldenburg did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Several other testifiers said that Nebraska is missing out on much-needed revenue. Brown argued this is silly considering how easy it is for Nebraskans to access cannabis by crossing state lines.
Brown said Nebraska would lose residents because of the government’s resistance to accepting medical cannabis. Another testifier, Dawn Weir, said she moved back to Nebraska this year because she’d heard that medical cannabis had been legalized.
The aftermath of the 2024 ballot initiatives has made some testifiers question whether they should continue voting if the state can interfere so easily. Cavanaugh pleaded with attendees to continue voting, but urged them to vote for people “who actually respect you.”
Proponents of medical cannabis have long argued the issue is nonpartisan, and several testifiers identified themselves as registered Republicans who either regret voting Republican in 2024, or are reconsidering their party affiliation.
“I don’t know how long (my Republican registration) is going to last with watching this state going so far to the other side,” said testifier John Reagan.
With the hearing concluded, the commission will decide whether to formally adopt the regulations or make changes. If finalized, the regulations would be sent to Nebraska Attorney General Mike Hilgers’ office for legal review. Pillen would have the final say. Hilgers’ office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Ford,,,,,https://marylandmatters.org/2025/10/15/attorney-general-limits-what-maryland-police-can-do-when-working-with-federal-authorities/,"Maryland Attorney General Anthony Brown issued guidance to local police agencies Wednesday, reminding them that they are still bound by state law when working with federal agencies, and are limited in what they can do in such partnerships.","U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents make an arrest in Chicago Jan. 26, 2025, during an operation that featured a number of federal agencies. (Photo by Immigration and Customs Enforcement)Maryland Attorney General Anthony Brown issued guidance to local police departments Wednesday reminding them that they are still bound by state law when working with federal agencies, and are limited in what they can do in such partnerships.
The 11-page document lists what local police “must do, may do and must not do” in a range of interactions with federal authorities, from simple backup to formal joint task force agreements. But it includes specific language on what local officers can and can’t do when it comes to immigration enforcement.
Among other limits, the guidance says Maryland officers may not ask a suspect’s immigration status, or extend a suspect’s detention to determine their immigration status; must identify themselves by name and badge number, and cite a reason when making a traffic or other stop; and must adhere to state use of force standards, and not treat peaceful protestors or demonstrators as suspects, among other rules.
It pointedly says that Maryland officers “may not enforce civil immigration laws or assist federal agents in enforcing such laws.”
“Maryland’s law enforcement officers are governed by Maryland law and the communities they serve, regardless of shifting federal priorities,” Attorney General Anthony Brown (D) said in a statement. “We are providing this guidance to help our officers ensure they are complying with applicable State standards for use of force, civil rights protections, and police accountability when they are working with federal agents who may not be bound to the same requirements.”
﻿﻿
The guidelines come as an increasing number of law enforcement agencies in Maryland are cooperating with Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers under various 287(g) agreements, which allow ICE to delegate certain immigration enforcement abilities to state and local law enforcement officials. Maryland agencies are mostly restricted to the jail-based model of the agreement, where local jails can execute administrative immigration warrants on people already in their custody.
As of this summer, eight Maryland counties had signed 287(g) agreements to work with ICE, up from five just a year before.
The memo also comes as immigration arrests are surging under the Trump administration’s promised deportation push. ICE arrests in the state have gone from 3.1 per day in 2023 to 3.7 per day in 2024, before jumping to 9.8 per day this year, according to the Deportation Data Project.
The wave of apprehensions have put immigrant communities on edge, particularly since many of the stops are made by masked officers in unmarked vehicles who may not identify themselves or being wearing identifying information — all practices prohibited for Maryland officers, Brown’s memo said.
The attorney general’s guidance released Wednesday notes a provision in state law that prohibits civil immigration enforcement and for Maryland officers to perform “the functions of an immigration officer.” Other provisions for local police outlined Wednesday by the attorney general’s office include:

Officers must properly use body-worn cameras in accordance with state law and agency policy, identify themselves when making stops, and comply with other key State-law requirements that do not govern federal agents;
They should not directly participate in federal search practices that violate state standards, including failure to comply with documentation requirements; and
Maryland agencies should consider providing training to officers based on the principles documented in the guidance.

The release of the document also comes as President Donald Trump (R) has aggressively sought to expand federal involvement in local police enforcement. He has moved to deploy National Guard troops in Democratic-led cities such as Chicago, Los Angeles and Portland, Oregon, and federalized control of the Washington, D.C., police force this summer and sent in D.C. guard members as well as guard units from other states.
Sheriffs defend cooperation with federal officials on immigration enforcement

Trump claims military force is needed to respond to out-of-control crime scenes that state and local officials insist are simply untrue. He has also said a military presence is needed to protect federal facilities from attack or, in the case of Portland, to put down a rebellion. A U.S. District Court judge who blocked the Portland deployment wrote that protests “in Portland did not constitute a rebellion and did not pose a danger of rebellion,” and that the president’s claims about the situation in the city were “simply untethered to the facts.”
Brown’s office has been active, with attorneys general in other Democratic-led state, in challenging Trump administration policies in court, including its recent efforts to deploy troops to U.S. cities. The Maryland attorney general’s office has either led or joined in 101 lawsuits or legal briefs against administration actions since Trump returned to office on Jan. 20.
Maryland supporters of local police cooperation with ICE on immigration efforts either did not respond to requests Wednesday for comment on Brown’s guidance memo for local police, or said they had not seen the document and would not comment.
But Del. Nicole Williams (D-Prince George’s), who sponsored an unsuccessful bill in the last legislative session that would have prohibited local police from entering into 287(g) agreements, was able to skim through the memo and said it was “a good reminder” for Maryland agencies.
“This is what our state law is in regards to all these various subject areas,” she said. “It is not stating you can’t cooperate with federal law enforcement. It’s just a little reminder of some of our provisions in our state law.”

(Photo: Wes Muller/Louisiana Illuminator)Smitty’s Supply Inc. has filed a lawsuit against two companies it blames for the August fire and explosion that destroyed the facility and caused an environmental disaster in Tangipahoa Parish.
The company filed the lawsuit Tuesday in the 21st Judicial District Court in Amite against Fulton Thermal Corp., a New York-based company that manufactures industrial boiler tanks, and J&M Boiler Combustion Control Services of Baton Rouge, which installs and maintains the tanks.
The lawsuit alleges Fulton sold Smitty’s a defective boiler tank, which they call a “thermal fluid heater,” though the pleading does not specify what was wrong with the unit. In the filing, Smitty’s suggests the boiler malfunctioned, exploded and caused the fire.
Tangipahoa Parish Robby Miller told the Illuminator in a Sept. 8 interview that the facility first caught fire and then exploded.
According to the lawsuit, Smitty’s purchased the boiler in 2021 and “regularly inspected and serviced” it but never noticed any defects. The lawsuit doesn’t state how the company became aware of any alleged defects with the boiler.
The lawsuit includes similarly unspecific claims against J&M Boiler Combustion Control Services, claiming the company was negligent in installing and maintaining the boiler unit but does not say exactly how.  
“The injuries and damages which occurred herein were caused, in part, by the negligence of J&M and by the negligent installation and/or maintenance of J&M,” the lawsuit states.
Clay Garside, an environmental litigator with the New Orleans-based Waltzer, Wiygul & Garside firm, reviewed Smitty’s Supply’s legal filing on Wednesday and said the claims will likely have difficulty succeeding in court.

“It’s hard to say whether Fulton Thermal or J&M had any role in causing the explosion based on the allegations in this lawsuit,” Garside said. “There doesn’t seem to be a single factual allegation about anyone other than Smitty’s.”
Calls and emails to the sued companies were not returned Wednesday, though Jean Windown, J&M Boiler’s president, told WVUE-TV Fox 8 that it hasn’t worked with Smitty’s Supply for several years.
Through a news release from a public relations firm, Smitty’s Supply said Tuesday that it is focusing on supporting the “safe and efficient cleanup efforts” of the government agencies that have responded. 
The Aug. 22 fire and explosion at the Smitty’s Supply plant, which manufactures, bottles and distributes petrochemical products for automotive and industrial retailers, resulted in a chemical blaze that took two weeks to fully extinguish. The incident sent smoke, soot and oily residue into the air and onto nearby homes, businesses and an elementary school. 
Hazardous materials from the plant spilled into area waterways, including several adjacent ponds and the Tangipahoa River. Oil-based chemicals have flowed nearly 40 miles downriver toward Lake Pontchartrain, though officials say the lake hasn’t been affected. 
The Environmental Protection Agency still has crews cleaning up and decontaminating the area. The agency is also still analyzing water samples from area waterways. EPA Regional Administrator Mason Scott has said the cleanup would not be affected by the ongoing federal government shutdown.
The federal agency has relinquished the destroyed facility back to Smitty’s Supply. In a news release Wednesday, the company said it will begin an EPA-approved remediation plan at the site.
Meanwhile, town officials in Independence, 15 miles south of the Smitty’s plant, have approved permits to allow the company to set up shop at a storage facility, WVUE reported. The site will only be used for storage and not to blend products, a Smitty’s representative told the news station.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-10-15 23:10:19+00:00,CT Mirror,Report: High summer temperatures at state prisons threaten inmates’ health,Emilia Otte,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/10/15/ct-prison-ombuds-report-heat-osborn-bridgeport-hartford/,The report found high indoor temperatures is risking the health of incarcerated individuals and may violate their constitutional rights.,"High indoor temperatures combined with a lack of cold drinking water and cooling fans in three of the state’s prisons during the summer months is risking the health of incarcerated individuals and may violate their constitutional rights, according to a new report from the Corrections Ombuds.  
The report, released Wednesday, details observations from the three facilities without air conditioning — Hartford Correctional Center, Bridgeport Correctional Center and Osborn Correctional Institution — during late June and July. Combined, the three facilities house about 2,700 people. 
Corrections Ombuds DeVaughn Ward said in the report that his office has received multiple complaints from incarcerated people and their families about the heat. One mother who wrote to the ombuds on July 24 complained that her son, who was housed at Osborn, had contracted scabies and was being frequently kept in his cell on lockdown without a fan or air conditioning.
“The officers come around every few hours with semi-cold water to cool off during this heat wave, but it’s still uncomfortably hot,” she wrote.
Another mother who said her son was housed at Osborn wrote that the heat was exacerbating her son’s asthma and making it difficult for him to breathe. 
On a 96-degree day in late June, Ward visited Bridgeport Correctional Center and found that overcrowding was forcing people to be housed in the facility’s gym, where there were no fans and no ice water. Other blocks where incarcerated people lived were also lacking water and fans. 
“In other units, fans were observed stored under stairwells and not deployed despite high temperatures and residents being out of their cells, and some fans that were in use were covered in debris,” Ward wrote. 
When Ward returned to Bridgeport Correctional for an unannounced visit in early July, more than fifty people were being housed in the gym because of a plumbing problem. The gym had a single small fan and one cooler with “minimal” water for drinking. 
A visit in late July found water and ice available across the facility, and the department had purchased fans and distributed them across the facility. 
In Osborn Correctional Institution on June 24, certain housing blocks recorded temperatures above 90 degrees, with several more hitting temperatures above 80 degrees. During a second visit a few days later, Ward reported seeing drinking water in some blocks but not in others. Incarcerated individuals also told him that staff members would turn fans off “as a form of retaliation.” 
Ward warned in his report that extreme heat conditions could be viewed by a court as a violation of the Eighth Amendment, which forbids cruel and unusual punishment, particularly in light of a recent case filed in a district court in Texas claiming that excessive heat in the prisons there may violate the constitutional rights of prisoners. The case is still ongoing.
The State of Connecticut has already approved two HVAC projects at Bridgeport Correctional Center and Hartford Correctional Center, which are scheduled to be completed in 2027. But at Osborn, where estimates for the cost of retrofitting the institution hover between $76 million and $85 million, the state has opted to expand the use of generator-powered air conditioning units instead of investing in a complete overhaul. 
In a statement to CT Mirror, Department of Correction Spokesperson Andrius Banevicius said that Commissioner Angel Quiros had received the report and was preparing a response. He said that while upkeep of the “aging infrastructure” in the prison buildings “presents significant and costly challenges,” the department was in the process of carrying out the upgrades Ward mentioned in his report. 
Ward recommended that the Department of Correction develop maximum and minimum temperatures for the facilities, keep hourly temperature logs, ensure that fans are fixed before the summer months, allow inmates to take more showers during heat waves and make sure that bedding and laundry are washed weekly to lower the risk of skin infections and funguses.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/20201118_PrisonRally_Hartford_KIM_09.jpg,,,2025-10-15 20:56:57.822349

(Source NM file art) It remains to be seen if the 2026 race for New Mexico governor will break the fundraising record set in 2022, but the two Democratic frontrunners have already pulled in millions of dollars in campaign contributions, according to the latest filings with the New Mexico Secretary of State.
Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham, also a Democrat, can’t run again due to term limits. Her last general election against Republican Mark Ronchetti in 2022 broke campaign spending records. She raised nearly $13 million and he raised more than $9 million.
Deb Haaland, a former U.S. Secretary of the Interior and previous member of the U.S. House of Representatives for New Mexico’s 1st Congressional District, reported in a news release raising a little over $4 million in campaign contributions in the last six months. However, Haaland’s full report was not publicly available on the Secretary of State’s website by the state filing deadline of Oct. 14. A campaign spokesperson told Source NM via email: the report “was so large it overwhelmed the SOS website,” and also said it could not be shared through email.
The most recent filing date covers donations and spending in between April and September. The next reports will be due next year.
Secretary of State Maggie Toulouse Oliver confirmed in a text message to Source NM Haaland’s recent filing was too large for the system and said the state has been “working with them and the vendor to get it parsed properly so we can upload.” As of the end of the day Wednesday, Haaland’s report had not yet appeared on the site.
In a statement about the donations, Haaland thanked her supporters, noting she has received more than 21,000 donations from New Mexicans since announcing her campaign in January.
“I look forward to continuing to travel the state, hearing directly from New Mexicans about their struggles, and what they want to see in plans for affordability, healthcare, education, and public safety,” she said.
Source will provide reporting on Haaland’s top donors when the report becomes available.
Her closest competitor contribution-wise, Sam Bregman, has raised $2.4 million in campaign contributions since April. Of the more than 2,240 recorded donations, about 20% were from out-of-state contributors. Bregman, the top prosecutor for the 2nd Judicial District in Bernalillo County, announced his candidacy in April.
“This campaign is powered by New Mexicans who want a candidate with a real common-sense plan for the future.” Bregman said in a statement. “As the outsider in this race, nobody expected us to raise this kind of money. But I’ve never been one to shy away from hard work. This incredible show of support proves folks are ready for something new.”
Bregman’s largest campaign donors include New York Investment firm Garnett Station Partners and the Sunland Park Racetrack and Casino; and Thomas Jorden, the CEO at Texas oil company Coterra Energy. His son, Boston Sox third baseman Alex Bregman also donated the maximum: $12,400.

The third Democratic gubernatorial candidate Ken Miyagishima, the former longtime mayor of Las Cruces and insurance salesman, raised just over $19,000 since April, and loaned his campaign more than $50,000.
In a call with Source NM, Miyagishima said he planned to ramp up fundraising in the next month.
“If you look at all my previous elections, I probably financed about 80% to 90% of them,” he said. “That’s not the preferred method, but I just have a hard time asking people for money.”
Of the four announced Republican candidates, Rio Rancho Mayor Greggory Hull pulled in the most donations — just over $123,000 since April. His top donors include Brady Lovelady, owner of Perfection Honda in Rio Rancho; retired business owner Nancy Nunnally from Rio Rancho; and Roswell car dealership owners Tom and Linda Krumland.
“Our campaign is proud to have raised over $329,000, the most of any candidate in the Republican primary,” Hull said in a statement to Source NM. “Considering that we reached this milestone before even announcing, we’re encouraged by the level of support and momentum behind this campaign.”

Three other Republican candidates who have filed paperwork to run, but have not declared formal campaigns yet, all reported no expenditures or donations in the last six months.
They include Brian Cillessen, a 53-year-old Farmington resident, veteran and hunting show host; and Duke Rodriguez, CEO of Ultra Heath Cannabis and a former cabinet secretary for former Republican Gov. Gary Johnson. Las Cruces personal trainer and businesswoman Belinda Robertson did not file a report.
Two candidates have declared a campaign for governor without political party affiliation. Jacob Smith, a Rio Rancho resident, reported a sole donation of $2,000 from himself. Gene Pettit, a nondenominational pastor in Radium Springs, reported two donations from himself, and a donation of $1.25 from an Alamogordo resident.
New Mexico’s primary election will be held June 2, 2026.

(Photo by Christine Condon/ Maryland Matters)Wednesday was a busy day in the Democratic race to succeed Howard County Executive Calvin Ball, a race that was already busy to being with.
Del. Vanessa Atterbeary officially kicked off her campaign before a packed crowd at Columbia’s Harriet Tubman Cultural Center, become the latest candidate to join Howard County Councilmember Deb Jung, County Council Chair Liz Walsh and Del. Jessica Feldmark (D-Howard) in the Democratic primary that will be held next June.
Not to be outdone, Feldmark unveiled endorsements Wednesday from high-ranking current and former Howard County officials, including Ken Ulman, former Del. Shane Pendergrass, Del. Pam Guzzone (D-Howard), Board of Education member Andrea Chamblee and county Register of Wills Byron Macfarlane. Ulman, who stepped down this year as chairman of the Maryland Democratic Party, served as county executive from 2006-2014, and Feldmark was his chief of staff for much of that time,
“Howard County is facing threats from a hostile federal administration and an uncertain economic future. Jessica’s experience and leadership will ensure we remain a thriving community for all Howard County residents,” said Ulman, who said he was “thrilled” to endorse Feldmark, who has served in the House of Delegates since 201i9.
Pendergrass praised Feldmark for “both her competence and her compassion” and said she knows “how Howard County works more than anyone and is the only person ready to take on the job of County Executive on day one.”
But Feldmark has to get past her primary opponents first, not the least of which is Atterbeary, chair of the House Ways and Means Committee, who highlighted her work in the legislature as she began making her case Wednesday for the county’s top job.

“I am a daughter, I am a sister, I am a mother. I am a native Howard Countian,” Atterbeary told a packed crowd. “I have lived here my whole life, born and raised, and I’m here tonight to tell all of you that I am running to be your next county executive.”
She pointed to her work on police accountability reform, the Blueprint for Maryland’s Future and gun violence prevention, in particular.
“Everything that we’ve been able to pass at the state level needs to be implemented correctly at the local level, whether we’re talking about schools, whether we’re talking about funds that we get from the state,” Atterbeary said. “I was the only person in the race that was in those actual rooms, making those negotiations and working on the actual legislation.”
Atterbeary touted endorsements of her own Wednesday, from State Treasurer Dereck E. Davis, Howard County Councilmember Opel Jones and C. Vernon Gray, the first Black man to be elected to the Howard County Council. House Speaker Adrienne A. Jones was also among the legislators who showed up for the announcement, although she did not deliver remarks.
Atterbeary said her campaign will focus on growing the county’s affordable housing options, so that more families can afford to live in Howard, and bolstering the public school system. She’ll make her case partially during what could be her last session in the General Assembly.
“It’s going to be a lot of work,” she joked. “We’re going to do all the things. We’re going to raise money. We’ve only been in the race a short amount of time, and we’ve raised quite a bit of money. We’re going to be knocking on doors. We’re going to be going to all the events. I don’t think my social media has ever been this active.”
Conway makes it official in 7th District
Baltimore City Councilmember Mark Conway made it official Wednesday: He plans to challenge veteran U.S. Rep. Kweisi Mfume in next June’s Democratic primary for the 7th District seat in Congress.
Conway, who created a campaign fundraising committee earlier this month for a possible challenge, went to the Penn North neighborhood in Baltimore, which has been plagued by multiple opioid overdoses in recent months, for his announcement. He called for a new generation of leadership while acknowledging the uphill battle he faces against the well-known and much-admired Mfume.
“It’s not a small feat to challenge a popular incumbent,” Conway said in an interview. “But after a lot of soul-searching and sleepless nights, I decided to try to become the change I want to see.”

Conway said he has “an immense amount of respect” for the 76-year-old incumbent, and hailed Mfume’s 40-plus years of public service. But he said that with the Trump administration threatening U.S. democracy on a variety of fronts, “we are in a dramatically different world. Ronald Reagan is not president. It’s not the ’80s or ’90s or even the early 2000s. I think people are desperate for change.”
Mfume, who represented the Baltimore-based 7th District in the U.S. House from 1987 to 1996 and returned to Congress in 2020 after winning a special election, said in a statement to Maryland Matters that he is looking forward to continuing to work for his constituents.
“I am running for reelection and with God’s blessings I intend to win,” the congressman said. “I am a fighter for people, and this is one more fight to win.”
Mfume has a major head start on the fundraising front. Through Sept. 30, he had $705,736 in his campaign account, according to the latest campaign filings with the Federal Election Commission.
Conway, 36, estimates he’ll need to raise at least $1 million to be competitive in the June 23 primary. But he does not plan to accept campaign donations from Baltimore Gas & Electric or its parent company, Exelon, or from AIPAC, the pro-Israel lobbying and political powerhouse.
Conway said he believes talking about issues like the high cost of energy and the Israel/Gaza conflict will help distinguish him from Mfume – and he has already returned contributions he received from BG&E for his council campaigns. He said he’ll also emphasize housing, health care, immigration and the opioid crisis on the campaign trail.
Several older Democratic members of the U.S. House are being pressured to retire from Congress or are facing primaries with aggressive young challengers. Three septuagenarian House Democrats died earlier this year. Just last week, 30-year-old Tennessee state Rep. Justin Pearson (D) announced he’d be taking on 76-year-old U.S. Rep. Steve Cohen, the Volunteer State’s lone congressional Democrat, who is in his 10th term.
Conway does not have to sacrifice his council seat to run for Congress in 2026, sparking some speculation in Maryland political circles that he’s using this campaign to raise his profile for another race in 2028 or beyond. But the second-term councilmember insists he’s focused on the urgency of the current political moment.

“If I wait until 2028,” he said, “there may be no democracy left.”
So will it just be K?
Damian O’Doherty, a founding partner with Steve Kearney of KO Public Affairs, will leave the well-known public affairs firm after 17 years to launch his own firm, O’Doherty & Associates.
“In a time of momentous change, firms like KO are only growing in value. I’m deeply grateful to have worked with such smart and driven people — and to exit at the right time for my family,” O’Doherty said in a joint statement. “My global work in law, influence, and capital continues at O’Doherty & Associates LLC, helping leaders gain resonance in the AI epoch.”
The firm was founded in 2008 by Kearney and O’Doherty, who has been based out of Colorado for the last several years. Last year, the firm announced a merger with Sandy Hillman communications, adding consumer marketing to KO’s public affairs efforts, and in 2023, the firm added Josh White to its lobbying arm in Annapolis.
“We have built a tremendous firm over the last 18 years, working on some of the toughest issues in Maryland,” Kearney said in the statement. “While our work continues, we wish Damian the best in his new venture and are grateful for his contributions. We are excited for him and look forward to collaborating with him in the future.”

(Photo by Glenn Fawcett/Customs and Border Protection)Baltimore/Washington International Thurgood Marshall Airport has joined major airports across the country that are declining to play a video in which Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem blames Democrats for the federal government shutdown. 
“Democrats in Congress refuse to fund the federal government,” Noem said in the video. “And because of this, many of our operations are impacted, and most of our TSA [Transportation Security Administration] employees are working without pay.”
The 30-second video recognizes the potential impacts the shutdown may have on travel, and concludes with Noem “hoping the Democrats will soon recognize the importance of opening the government.”
A BWI spokesperson said in a statement Wednesday that the airport does not plan to display the video because it does not “offer critical information related to travel for our passengers.” BWI communications director, Jonathan Dean’s statement also said that there is no requirement for the video to be shown. 
Agency shutdown messaging draws Hatch Act, Antideficiency Act challenges

The video is not playing at Salisbury Regional Airport, where Director Tony Rudy said Wednesday he was not aware of the video until someone mentioned it to him. But the airport was not asked to run the video, he said, and would not be able to run it even if asked, since he said they do not have the capabilities to show the video in their airport.
When asked if the video was running at Hagerstown Regional Airport, an employee who answered the phone said the airport had not comment.
Airports across the country have refused to play the video, according to published reports. Many say it violates local prohibitions on political advertising in public facilities, while others worry it is a clear violation of the Hatch Act, which prohibits partisan activity by federal workers when they’re on the clock or when using public equipment or facilities.
Noem’s video is not the first Trump administration action during the government shutdown that has raised Hatch Act concerns. With most of the government shut down because Congress could not agree on a budget, federal agencies have posted notices on their websites saying service and site updates may be delayes. But while some departments have simply cited a “lapse in funding,” others have blamed the shutdown on Democrats or, in some cases, “radical Left Democrats.”
The organization Public Citizen has filed a number of complaints with the government’s Office of Special Counsel over the “explicitly partisan messaging” by the departments that blame Democrats for the shutdown, calling the messages clear violations of the Hatch Act.
“The Trump administration is violating the Hatch Act with reckless abandon, using taxpayer dollars to plaster partisan screeds on every government homepage that they can get their hands on,” Craig Holman, a government ethics expert with Public Citizen, said in a statement earlier this month.
Sen. Maria Cantwell (D-Wash.) on Wednesday formally asked the Office of Special Counsel to investigate the Noem video for Hatch Act violations. Cantwell said the Department of Homeland Security “is using taxpayer dollars and federal assets to produce and air a video message featuring Secretary Noem, in her official capacity, making political attacks against Democratic Members of Congress.”

(Photo by Skylar Laird/SC Daily Gazette)COLUMBIA — The former director of the State Election Commission misrepresented a more than $30 million contract, worked with other staff members to falsify documents and lie about them, and misused funds for personal reasons, the commission chairman claimed Wednesday.
The commission voted 3-2 last month to fire then-Director Howard Knapp, followed soon after by the firing of his deputy director and the resignation of the agency spokesman, who Chairman Dennis Shedd claimed were in cahoots with the former director. At the time, Shedd said the decision came from a desire for different leadership.
Since Knapp’s termination, more information has come to light, Shedd said.
“This agency, we found out, has become a toxic and perhaps a hostile work environment under (Knapp’s) leadership,” Shedd said.
SC Election Commission fires executive director

Reached by the SC Daily Gazette, Knapp referred questions to his lawyer, who did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Neither did the lawyer for deputy director Paige Salonich.
Knapp and Solonich are under investigation by the South Carolina Law Enforcement Division for wiretapping, a spokeswoman said. SLED is also investigating Knapp, who led the agency since 2023, for unspecified misconduct in office.
The Office of the Inspector General is also looking into the agency’s work under Knapp’s leadership, Inspector General Brian Lamkin told the commission Wednesday.
Shedd declined to give more information on the falsified documents. Nor did he provide any more detail on Knapp’s alleged misuse of public dollars and equipment, though he suggested that was at least part of the SLED investigation.
After Knapp’s firing, the interim director was instructed to investigate two other employees: Salonich, who was also Knapp’s “very close friend,” and spokesman John Michael Catalano, Shedd said. He claimed Salonich and Catalano worked with Knapp to produce false records of conversations and lie about it.
Catalano told the SC Daily Gazette he resigned effective Friday but declined to say much else.
“I’m deeply grateful for my time there, but it was time for me to move on,” he said in a statement, adding that he’s not involved in any investigation by SLED or attorney general’s office.
Salonich was fired Sept. 22, following nearly a week of unpaid suspension, after raising her voice at agency leadership, using profanity, making disruptive remarks and placing an unauthorized device in a confidential meeting, according to her termination letter. Catalano resigned Friday, without giving a reason in his letter, which was provided to the SC Daily Gazette.
Salonich is suing the commission, claiming that someone working for the commission leaked intimate information about items found in her work desk to the press. The agency has not responded to the lawsuit, which was filed Sept. 30 in Richland County.
One of the commission’s five board members, Linda McCall, also resigned her post Sept. 22, saying she was not able to focus on the work because of personal conflicts, “as well as what went on with the ousting of the Director at our last meeting,” according to her resignation letter.
The letter did not elaborate as to what she meant, and she did not respond to a voicemail requesting comment.
None of the recent turmoil has any effect on the state’s elections, Shedd emphasized.
The most pressing issue facing the commission is an approximately $10 million bill for ballot scanners due Sept. 30 that the agency has yet to pay. Legislators included nearly $11 million in the state budget for the upgrades, about a third of the total price, but the agency won’t get that money until February, Shedd said.
One-time allocations approved in the budget are usually dispersed to agencies in the fall. But this year, the Legislature put in a directive to hold off until Feb. 20 just in case the economy went south and last year’s surplus would be needed to cover a shortfall. (As of this week’s revenue update for the first quarter, collections remain above expectations.)
SC elections agency faces ongoing legal challenges over voter rolls amid directors’ firings

Commissioners approved a contract last year to purchase more than 3,200 ballot scanners ahead of the presidential election. At the time, however, commissioners believed the commission would pay $28 million, that legislators had agreed to include the full amount in their spending plan for the year, and that anything not appropriated would be paid for by the state treasurer’s office, Shedd said.
That was not the case, Shedd said Wednesday.
When Knapp sent the final contract to the treasurer’s office, it was for $32 million. The treasurer signed the agency up for a program that provides low-cost financing to upgrade state agencies’ equipment, but the commission remains on the hook for paying it back, Treasurer Curtis Loftis told commissioners Wednesday.
Shedd didn’t know why the contract ended up being $4 million more than what commissioners anticipated, he said. When he asked the other three commissioners whether they recalled Knapp mentioning the increase in price, they all shook their heads.
The agency needs to come to some sort of agreement with the bank financing the loan before costly monthly penalties begin to mount, or before the bank moves to repossess the voting equipment, Loftis said.
“It sounds like a bigger problem than it is,” Loftis told the commission. “It’s just a mismatch.”
The bank is willing to move the due date back to February, but Shedd said he didn’t want his name on the agreement Knapp penned. The commission instructed interim director Jenny Wooten to come up with a solution with the bank that will allow the commission to postpone payments without signing the original contract.
The agency is asking legislators for $25 million to cover the remainder of the cost, plus any other costs that come up, in the coming state budget, Wooten said.
While the next fiscal year doesn’t start until July 1, 2026, the budget process begins with agencies sending in their requests this fall.
The firings were unrelated to an agreement in the works between the state and the Department of Justice to release voter information, Shedd said. Knapp and commissioners agreed the agency needed to do everything in its power to protect private voter information while also complying with the federal government, he said.
The agency is still waiting for a template of an agreement from the Department of Justice to continue discussions, Shedd said.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_4244-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-10-15 19:02:30.495899

Maybe not his truest feelings — that might be going a little bit too far. But Stephen, thank you for doing an incredible job. The people of this country love you.”Political crime and Caribbean boatsTrump again broached the possibility of defying two typical norms of presidential power: calling for prosecutions to retaliate against officials who’d investigated him and defending the extrajudicial strikes on alleged drug runners in the Caribbean Sea that he said could expand to land.Standing between Patel and Attorney General Pam Bondi, Trump said U.S. Sen. Adam Schiff, who, as a U.S. House Democrat before joining the Senate, led congressional investigations into Trump, and former prosecutor Jack Smith, who led criminal prosecutions, should be investigated.“Deranged Jack Smith is, in my opinion, a criminal,” Trump said. “I hope they’re looking at Shifty Schiff,” he added, referring to the California Democrat. “I hope they’re looking at political crime, because there’s never been as much political crime against a political opponent as what I had to go through.”Trump said the military's attacks on vessels suspected to be bringing drugs to the United States had effectively halted drug importation from Venezuela. The operation could expand to land targets, he said.“We are certainly looking at land now, because we've got the sea very well under control,” he said.",,,,2025-10-15 19:02:30.495899

Denise Garner, both members of the Arkansas Early Childhood Commission, listen to Republican Rep. Julie Mayberry during a work session to discuss child care funding on Oct. 15, 2025 in Little Rock. (Tess Vrbin/Arkansas Advocate)Arkansas’ child care system needs additional funding to avoid widespread closures and layoffs due to changes to the state’s financial aid program for low-income families, providers told the state Early Childhood Commission during a Wednesday work session.
A survey of providers found that about a quarter of them, spread out among 50 of Arkansas’ 75 counties, expect 400 layoffs by November, said Shahid Sheikh, owner of four Northwest Arkansas child care centers. Sheikh was among several child care providers and experts invited to the commission’s work session for discussion.
Eighty of the 250 facilities who responded to the survey are likely to close in the next 60 days, and many of them are located in low-income communities where child care is already scarce, Sheikh said.
Sheikh and other child care providers have expressed concern in recent weeks about the Arkansas Department of Education’s proposed changes to the School Readiness Assistance Program. In September, the agency announced a new reimbursement structure and a sliding-scale copayment structure, with the goal of reducing the four-digit child care waitlist and making the program more financially sustainable.
Child care advocates said the changes would create barriers to access for families in need. The education department responded to the pushback by delaying cuts to providers’ reimbursement rates until Nov. 1, but moved forward with participant co-payments on Oct. 1 as planned, according to the Arkansas Democrat–Gazette.
Arkansas child advocates concerned about changes to school readiness program 

The reimbursement rate cuts are expected to cost providers statewide $727,000 per week, according to the survey. That adds up to $37.8 million in lost revenue for local economies, Sheikh told the commission Wednesday.
“We stand to lose more money by not investing in [child care] than we do by investing, so while this may be a budget problem right now, in a year’s time, it’s going to be a budget disaster for the state,” he said.
Education department officials are “going through our budget with a fine-toothed comb” in search of solutions, said Stacy Smith, deputy commissioner for the department’s Division of Elementary and Secondary Education.
Families who are working or enrolled in school with income at or below the state poverty level will not pay a copayment for children before kindergarten, and families above the poverty level will pay a copay scaled to income and the age of the child, according to ADE.
Providers said their concerns about the copays being too expensive have come true.
“The amount that we’re asking families to pay is unreasonable for most of them, especially as such a quick ask,” said Jenny Castillo, who owns five Spanish language-immersion child care centers in Northwest Arkansas. “For it to be so fast, they have no time to prepare, to pivot.”
Castillo said she hopes the state finds a way to ensure that families pay no more than 7% of their household income for child care, a national recommendation.
The increased copayments as of Oct. 1 have already forced some Arkansas child care centers to close because parents could not afford to pay anymore, Sheikh said.
“We’ve already heard from some who have essentially [said], ‘It’s easier for me to quit my job and get on SNAP and have food stamps cover me than for me to go and work’” to try to afford child care, Sheikh said.










While this may be a budget problem right now, in a year’s time, it’s going to be a budget disaster for the state.

The School Readiness Assistance Program is funded by the federal Child Care and Development Fund. Education department officials are currently unable to seek help from the federal government regarding the program because of the ongoing government shutdown, Smith and Education Secretary Jacob Oliva both said.
The shutdown might force the department’s Office of Early Childhood to lay off federally-funded staff, Smith said.
State Reps. Denise Garner, D-Fayetteville, and Julie Mayberry, R-Hensley, were the only lawmakers present at the work session. The Legislature will meet in April for its regularly scheduled fiscal session, but child care providers said Wednesday that they can’t wait that long for financial aid.
Mayberry said she appreciated the input from the providers, particularly the data, and said a special legislative session might be necessary to address the problems presented. Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders is responsible for calling a special session, and Mayberry urged providers and the education department to involve Sanders’ office in discussions of next steps.
Garner, a member of the commission, said she hopes the discussion will soon create “action items.” 
“The things we need to know as legislators are what pots of money we actually have…how much money is that and where to pull money from the rest of the state budget and put it into early childhood [education],” Garner said.
The commission is scheduled to meet again at 10 a.m. Tuesday.

(Photo by Dave Cummings/New Hampshire Bulletin)Gov. Kelly Ayotte said she is eager to replace New Hampshire Supreme Court Justice Anna Barbara Hantz Marconi, who was convicted last week of criminal solicitation but is being allowed to remain a justice, in February.
“I really think this is something that needs to be addressed to the Department of Justice, to the attorney general,” Ayotte told reporters Wednesday. “But I will tell you that I am looking forward to February when I can replace her.”
Associate Justice Anna Barbara Hantz Marconi
Hantz Marconi pleaded “no contest” — which means she isn’t openly admitting guilt but she is accepting conviction — on Oct. 7 in a Concord courtroom to charges related to a conversation with then-Gov. Chris Sununu about an investigation into her husband. Prosecutors accused her of attempting to wield her influence as a Supreme Court justice to convince Sununu to intervene in a criminal investigation into whether Geno Marconi, her husband and the state port authority director, had illegally shared confidential records. As part of a plea deal, Hantz Marconi was fined $1,200 and will not serve time in jail. Notably, she is being allowed to return to her position after a panel of judges convened to discuss the matter concluded she hadn’t committed a “serious crime.”
In February, Hantz Marconi will turn 70 and reach the mandatory retirement age for New Hampshire judges. At that point, Ayotte will have the opportunity to nominate her replacement. The justice was appointed and sworn in by Sununu in 2017. After she heard arguments in cases Wednesday, she became the first convicted criminal to serve on the state’s Supreme Court.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Supreme-Court1-1024x646.jpeg,,,2025-10-15 19:02:30.495899

Evers has written the Department of Energy urging officials not to cancel $1.5 billion in funds for Wisconsin projects. (Photo by Baylor Spears/Wisconsin Examiner)With more than $1.5 billion in federal energy investments in Wisconsin at risk, Gov. Tony Evers is urging the Trump administration not to roll back previously awarded funds in the face of rising energy costs.
Evers’ response, in a letter to U.S. Department of Energy Secretary Chris Wright, followed multiple news reports in the last week about energy projects on target lists for cancellation.
The governor’s office has compiled a list of 22 projects for which federal Energy Department funding totaling $1.56 billion has been marked for cancellation.
“Federal support plays a critical role in advancing the Wisconsin Idea and American innovation, lowering energy bills for families across America, supporting clean energy development to improve energy independence and resilience, creating good-paying jobs in innovative industries and sectors, and maintaining our nation’s leadership in science and technology,” Evers wrote Tuesday in his letter to Wright.  
“Given these clear benefits and the importance of these investments to Wisconsin’s and our nation’s economy, I was deeply concerned to see reporting last week containing a list of over 600 DOE funding awards that are potentially going to be targeted for termination with no clear reasoning or justification.”
Evers’ letter mentions several Wisconsin projects and companies on the target list, including several that the Wisconsin Examiner reported on this week.
The letter also notes forecasts of rising costs for electric power that the energy policy think tank Energy Innovation attributes to the tax and spending cut megabill that President Donald Trump signed July 4.
“Terminating these funding awards at a time of record-high energy demand and rising costs would be counterintuitive, reckless and ill-advised,” Evers concludes in his letter to Wright. “I urge you to reaffirm DOE’s commitment to honoring these funding awards and to continue supporting these investments that drive Wisconsin’s and the nation’s energy landscape forward.”

The world’s attention is focused on the Middle East this  week as a fragile ceasefire takes hold in Israel’s two-year long war in Gaza. Split-screen images show joyous reunions as Palestinians and Israelis who had been held captive greet their families, alongside scenes of shocking devastation in the Gaza Strip.
For Mohsen Mahdawi, this story is personal. In April, Mahdawi sat in a Vermont jail cell for more than two weeks fighting for his freedom. Mahdawi is a Palestinian-born student at Columbia University who was arrested by immigration agents at what he was told would be a citizenship interview in St. Albans. Mahdawi, 35, grew up in a refugee camp in the Israeli-occupied West Bank but is now a legal permanent resident living in Vermont. He is a practicing Buddhist, was president of the Columbia University Buddhist Association and co-founded Columbia’s Palestinian Student Union.
The Trump administration is trying to deport Mahdawi, claiming that his pro-Palestinian campus activism poses a threat to national security. Vermont federal Judge Geoffrey Crawford ordered Madahwi’s release on bail on April 30, comparing his arrest to the unlawful repression of free speech under McCarthyism. But the Trump administration appealed, arguing that Crawford did not have the right to intervene in Mahdawi’s detention. Madahwi vs. Trump was argued before the Second Circuit Court of Appeals in New York on Sept. 30. Madahwi has a separate deportation case in immigration court that is ongoing.
“It’s not my case that is on trial,” Mahdawi said. “It is the constitution that is on trial. One of the most important and significant principles of democracy is the ability of expression and free speech. That’s the first amendment right in this country, and what we’ve seen through targeting me and other students and other even journalists is a direct violation of this principle that every American is so proud of and they hold very dearly.”
This legal drama has not slowed or silenced Madahwi. While out on bail this spring, Mahdawi graduated from Columbia University, receiving a standing ovation from his classmates as he walked across the stage to receive his diploma. This fall, he began a master’s degree at Columbia’s School of International and Public Affairs.
“I felt validated, that my efforts and the risk that I have taken is being honored and respected,” he said of the support from his Columbia classmates. “I felt that I’m not alone, and I felt a strong level of solidarity and that the community here made it very clear to the government and to those who have been targeting me that they are standing on the right side of history.”
Mahdawi was just named a 2025 Beerman Foundation Fellow for Peace and Justice for his work that “bridges faith, activism, and dialogue to advance nonviolence and dignity for all.”
Mahdawi is guardedly optimistic about the new Israeli-Palestinian peace plan.  
“While there is a sense of relief and ability to say ‘I’m glad this is happening’, there is also still suspicion about how long this would last,” he said. 
“I pray that the war is over, but at the same time, I see that Israel now is saying that they have a historic right to the West Bank, which would prevent the creation of a Palestinian state, something that the majority of the world, more than 80% of the international community, the states, have recognized Palestine as a sovereign state, except America, and America has vetoed it,” Mahdawi said. “So I don’t say the war is over before giving Palestinians their rights — the right to self-determination, the right to freedom, the right of return and the right to live in dignity.”
The Vermont Conversation also spoke with Bernard Avishai, a visiting professor of government at Dartmouth College, and the author of four books including “The Tragedy of Zionism.” He writes regularly about Israeli politics for the New Yorker, The New York Times Magazine, Politico and other publications. He lives half the year in Israel.
“I do feel much more sense of hopefulness that both sides have learned what losses are entailed by this kind of war, and that it might be time to turn the page,” Avishai said. 
Avishai is a strong critic of Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who he believes “is slowly converting (the) country from an open society to a closed and authoritarian one.”
“The real divide in Israel is between supporters of Greater Israel,” the nationalist movement intent on taking over Palestinian lands — “and supporters of global Israel,” or those who want to integrate Israel into the global economy.
Avishai believes that the Netanyahu government must go. “A change of government, a change of face to Israel, will at least begin the process of having Israel kind of rebuild relations with the Western world, but it’s a fundamentally dangerous economic situation for Israel to be on the one hand trying to build a global technological center, a hub in the global economy, and at the same time be alienating all the people they have to work with.”
Avishai said that Israeli media largely showed images of Israeli losses over the past two years, not Palestinian suffering. 
“It became tremendously numbing, and we have not, with all that numbing and self absorption and grief, really been able to focus on the cruelty and the difficulties we created in Gaza,” he said. “And I would like to believe that over the next five, six years, we will.”

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch)A group representing faculty at each of Iowa’s public universities is speaking out against the higher education compact developed by President Donald Trump and his administration and touted as a great opportunity by Iowa lawmakers.
The Iowa Higher Education Coalition sent a press release Wednesday in which it “rejects” calls from Rep. Taylor Collins and Sen. Lynn Evans for the Iowa Board of Regents to sign on to the Excellence in Higher Education Compact, which would have universities freeze tuition, limit international student enrollment and more.
Represented by the coalition are organizations including University of Northern Iowa faculty union United Faculty, Campaign to Organize Graduate Students at the University of Iowa, American Association of University Professors at the UI and Iowa State University and the Iowa Federation of Labor.
“The compact would subject our Iowa-operated public universities to extortion, based on demonstrating partisan loyalty to the federal government,” said United Faculty President Christopher Martin in the release. “Iowans would lose control of the universities. That’s a terrible deal for Iowa taxpayers.”

Universities would need to follow policies relating to admission and hiring, academic freedom, information on finances and institutional neutrality. Tuition would also freeze for five years. Those who do not enter into the compact possibly risk federal funding.
The compact’s vagueness on requiring a variety of viewpoints at all levels of campus community and use of language like “neutrality” and “excellence” is part of “an attempt to assert federal control over universities,” said United Faculty Vice President Fernando Calderón in the release.
Financial consequences of signing on to the compact could also be dire, the release stated, especially as state funding could remain flat in the upcoming fiscal year.
Tuition is the largest revenue source for Iowa universities and state funding makes up less than one-third of total revenues, and the release cited a Postsecondary Education & Economics Research Center paper that stated net costs for students and families have increased as a result of tuition freezes in other states.
The U.S. Department of Justice will be in charge of reviewing universities for compliance with the compact and will have those who have violated it forfeit federal funding and other “benefits” from the federal government for at least one year, according to the compact. The opponents’ release stated this would create even more financial uncertainty.
“The compact weaponizes public funding to compel ideological obedience. It transforms education from a public good into a conditional privilege granted only to institutions willing to align with state-sanctioned norms,” Calderón said in the release.
Protections for freedom of speech and “civil discourse in the classroom” are already set in place in Iowa Board of Regents policy and state code, the release stated, that provide guidance for how professors handle potentially controversial matters and ensure individuals can share their thoughts and ideas.
“We all want Iowa’s public universities to be places where students and faculty — regardless of political orientation — are not just free but encouraged to pursue their own intellectual discovery and to contribute to a campus culture devoted to excellence, curiosity and tolerance,” said Cullen Padgett-Walsh, president of Iowa State University’s AAUP chapter, in the release. “Bullying from the federal government isn’t the way to get there.”

Young I State House News Service,,,,,https://commonwealthbeacon.org/government/congressman-moulton-will-challenge-markey-for-us-senate-seat/,"""Congressman Seth Moulton of Salem announced Wednesday morning that he will run for U.S. Senate next year, arguing that Massachusetts cannot wait another six years to install someone from a younger generation in the Senate.""","For the second election cycle in a row, U.S. Sen. Ed Markey will face a challenge from a younger Democrat in the state’s Congressional delegation.
Congressman Seth Moulton of Salem announced Wednesday morning that he will run for U.S. Senate next year, arguing that Massachusetts cannot wait another six years to install someone from a younger generation in the Senate. The Democrat has not been shy about challenging members of his own party — he won his seat in the U.S. House in 2014 by defeating longtime Democratic Congressman John Tierney, briefly challenged U.S. Rep. Nancy Pelosi for the speaker’s gavel in 2018 and joined a crowded field for president in 2019.
“Our party has clung to the status quo, insisted on using the same old playbook, and isn’t fighting hard enough. The next generation will keep paying the cost if we don’t change course. This isn’t a fight we can put off for another six years. The future we all believe in is on the line,” Moulton said in his introduction video.
The 46-year-old (turns 47 this month) adds, “We’re in a crisis, and with everything we learned last election, I just don’t believe Senator Markey should be running for another six-year term at 80 years old, even more, I don’t think someone who’s been in Congress for half a century is the right person to meet this moment and win the future.”
Democrats limped out of the 2024 national elections without control of the White House or either branch of Congress, and President Donald Trump returned to office having improved his standing with some voters.
Moulton made waves early in his party’s self-reflection period with comments about transgender athletes, telling the New York Times that Democrats “spend way too much time trying not to offend anyone rather than being brutally honest about the challenges many Americans face.”
Gov. Maura Healey and other Massachusetts Democrats publicly spoke against Moulton’s commentary on transgender athletes. His comments also started a push to challenge Moulton in the 2026 primary, and his announcement will mean an open contest for the 6th Congressional District U.S. House seat north of Boston.
In his announcement, Moulton’s campaign said he is focused on “affordability, health care, climate change, banning assault weapons and protecting our democracy.” His announcement cites his authorship of “the most ambitious high-speed rail plan in decades” and his work to launch a bipartisan 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline.
Markey, 79, often cites the “age of your ideas” as most critical and has steadily rolled out endorsements from scores of federal, state and local elected officials as he has made his case for reelection. In the last week alone, he has announced the backing of the Mass. Nurses Association, League of Conservation Voters Action Fund, five state senators and more than a dozen state representatives from Greater Boston and a handful of mayors. House Speaker Ronald Mariano and Senate President Karen Spilka endorsed Markey in September.
Moulton completed four combat tours in Iraq as an infantry officer in the U.S. Marine Corps. In Salem, he co-founded and was president of Eastern Healthcare Partners.
In a recent poll by Advantage, Inc. for the Fiscal Alliance Foundation, Moulton was ahead of Markey 43 percent to 21 percent among all likely general election voters, with 36 percent undecided. Among likely Democratic primary voters, Moulton was chosen by 38 percent to Markey’s 30 percent.
In 2020, when Markey faced a primary challenge from then-Congressman Joseph Kennedy III, the Malden Democrat took 55 percent of the primary vote to Kennedy’s 45 percent. Markey  won reelection by defeating Republican Kevin O’Connor.",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/48714536903_4f4cca6f55_k.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-10-15 18:04:53.282818

Josh Stein, ruling Wednesday that the Republican-led General Assembly unconstitutionally altered the makeup of some state boards in 2023.
The three-judge panel ruled that the General Assembly violated the separation of powers when it restructured the Board of Transportation, Economic Investment Committee and Commission for Public Health, removing the governor’s ability to appoint a member of those boards.
The decision represents a partial victory for North Carolina Gov. Josh Stein, pictured on March 19, 2025, as he retains majority appointment power on three boards. (Photo: Galen Bacharier/NC Newsline)
The decision left open the possibility that the General Assembly could take away appointments by the governor and award them to other members of the Council of State, including those of the opposing party. They upheld the restructuring of four other boards, such as the Building Code Council and Environmental Management Commission, where the Council of State as a whole retained majority control, even where the governor could not appoint a majority.
The appeals court partially overturned a 2024 ruling by a Wake Superior Court panel, which had held that only the Board of Transportation and Economic Investment Committee restructurings violated the separation of powers. That ruling had been challenged both by the governor’s office and legislative leaders, who sought that all changes be ruled unconstitutional or constitutional, respectively.
The laws in question — Senate Bill 512 and House Bill 488, passed in August 2023 — cut the number of gubernatorial appointees on several state boards and commissions and expanded appointments by legislative leaders and Republicans on the Council of State. The BOT, for example, was changed from a body of 20 appointees by the governor to one made up of 14 legislative appointees and six gubernatorial appointees.
The Court of Appeals found that the Superior Court erred in allowing the restructuring of the Commission for Public Health as it stripped the governor of the ability to appoint a majority of the board — the General Assembly claimed four of the original nine gubernatorial appointees for itself, while four others are appointed by the North Carolina Medical Society.
“The General Assembly has ‘prevent[ed] another branch from performing its constitutional duties,’” Judge Jeffery Carpenter wrote in the decision. “The executive branch cannot take care that the laws be faithfully executed as there is no guarantee that the members from the North Carolina Medical Society will support the Governor’s policy preferences.”
The panel — made up of Carpenter, Judge John Tyson, and Judge Tom Murry, all of whom are Republicans — upheld the lower court’s ruling that the changes to the EMC, Coastal Resources Commission, and Wildlife Resources Commission are permissible. 
“While the Governor does not directly appoint a majority of each commission’s members, the executive branch holds majority-appointment power,” Carpenter wrote. “The Commissioner of Agriculture and Commissioner of Insurance, both members of the Council of State, along with the Governor combine to grant the executive branch majority-appointment power concerning the EMC, CRC, and WRC.”

Both seats on the Council of State are held by Republicans — with Steve Troxler serving as agriculture commissioner since 2005 and Mike Causey serving as insurance commissioner since 2017 — meaning Republicans hold a majority of appointments on the three boards between the Council of State and the legislature.
The Court of Appeals also sided with the General Assembly on H.B. 488’s changes to the Building Code Council, transferring many of its functions to a new Residential Code Council, as a majority of the new body’s members are still appointed by the governor.
In a concurring opinion, Murry noted that unlike the federal government, North Carolina’s state constitution has historically given the legislature greater authority than the other two branches of government — not granting the governor veto power until the 1990s — and divides executive power among several elected members of the Council of State.
“The majority correctly upholds the constitutionality of restructuring the WRC, EMC, and CRC into the Agriculture and Insurance Commissioners’ portfolios because doing so preserves the power of the Executive Branch relative to the Legislative,” Murry wrote.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/NC-Court-of-Appeals-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-10-15 18:04:53.282818

(Timisu graphic via Pixabay)Saying that this week alone an individual has called more 35 times making threats to the Florida Commission on Ethics, the chairman of that state agency is requesting that lawmakers provide a public records exemption for the personal information and addresses of the staff and commissioners during the 2026 legislative session.
Jon Philipson, appointed by Gov. DeSantis to chair the commission in July, made that request while addressing the members of the Senate Committee on Ethics and Elections Wednesday afternoon.
“In this time where we’re having more political violence, more strife, the Commission on Ethics, an independent agency that serves to ensure that our Constitution is followed when it comes to ethics, is constantly under attack,” Philipson said.
He added that those attacks include a previous executive director of the commission being threatened at their personal home address after the panel denied an individual’s complaint — while that individual was exiting prison.
“The threats are real,” he said.
Another factor is that commissioners must now complete a Form 6 financial disclosure, which Philipson said was “more invasive and more expansive” than a previous version. Public officials are required to reveal their entire net worth, including the dollar amounts of bank accounts, 401(k) plans. and other assets.
Philipson had three other asks of the Legislature for the 2026 session.

Expanded protections for public employees and contractors from retaliation when they report ethics violations, including the misuse of public money, conflicts of interest, and abuses of authority. A bill (SB 92) has already been filed in the Senate by Ethics and Elections Chairman Don Gaetz, R-Seaside, and in the House (HB 139) by Patt Maney, R-Okaloosa County.
Expand the definition of “family” with regards to the disclosure of gifts. Currently, lawmakers do not need to disclose a gift worth more than $100 if it comes from a family member, which can include fiancés and roommates. The proposal would expand the definition to cover foster children and foster parents.
A waiver on fines to late filers of financial disclosure forms. Currently, fines begin at $25 a day, up to $1,500. Individuals who hit that $1,500 fine would not be eligible for that exemption. Philipson said that the commission has had “success” with a similar law providing waivers for lobbyists who file compensation reports late. “We’ve seen a low level of recidivism for that one-time waiver,” he said.

The first day of the regular legislative session takes place on Jan. 13.

(Photo by Michael Achterling/North Dakota Monitor)A committee of North Dakota lawmakers will decide next week whether to endorse four bill drafts that could help the state get more money from a sweeping federal rural health care grant.
Congress created the $50 billion Rural Health Transformation Program this summer as part of its 10-year budget reconciliation law. The program was advertised as a way to support rural states in light of cuts to Medicaid in the bill.
The grant money is intended to go toward areas like behavioral health, workforce, infrastructure development and disease prevention.
North Dakota by Nov. 5 must submit an application to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services that includes a detailed plan for how it will use its share of the funding.

Every state will get at least $500 million, though the federal government has identified ways states can get additional funds — including by adopting certain health policies.
A 33-member committee met this week to help the state prepare its application.
On Wednesday, the committee asked Legislative Council to draft four bills to implement some of the policies singled out as favorable by the federal government.
The Department of Health and Human Services told lawmakers at the meeting that the state could get more funding by including the bill drafts in their application, which would signal to the federal government that the Legislature intends to adopt the policies. 
The policies would require schools to participate in a federal fitness test, make doctors receive ongoing nutrition education, have North Dakota join a physician assistant licensure compact and to expand what kinds of services pharmacists are legally allowed to provide.
The committee will weigh the merits of the bill drafts when it reconvenes next Tuesday. Committee members will vote on whether to forward the legislation for consideration by the full Legislature, which is expected to hold a special session in January or February.
The first bill draft would make schools in North Dakota conduct the Presidential Fitness Test. The test was retired by President Barack Obama in 2012, but Trump revived it in a July executive order. 
The federal government has not yet announced what would be required under the new Presidential Fitness Test, but in 2012 it included a mile run, a sit-up test, a sitting flexibility test, a shuttle run and a push-up or pull-up test.
Another proposal the committee will consider next week is to require doctors to have continuing education on nutrition.
Sarah Aker, executive director of medical services for the Department of Health and Human Services, told lawmakers that the federal government is incentivizing this policy based on research that shows doctors often lack sufficient nutrition education. 
Sen. Jeff Magrum, R-Hazelton, was the only lawmaker to vote against drafting the bill Wednesday.
“It seems like a person that’s gone to medical school would have had plenty of training in nutrition,” he said.
The third bill draft that the committee will vote on next week is a proposal to have North Dakota join a multi-state physician assistant licensure compact.
The idea is to make it easier for North Dakota physician assistants to practice in other states.
A bill to have North Dakota join the licensure compact was considered during the 2025 legislative session, though it died in the Senate. 
North Dakota lawmakers build wish list for $500M federal rural health care grant

The last bill draft would give pharmacists more authority to conduct laboratory tests and issue prescriptions.
North Dakota Pharmacists Association Executive Vice President Mike Schwab told lawmakers that this policy could improve access to health care in rural areas of the state that don’t have full-time medical clinics.
“I can think of a few communities where the clinic’s only open a couple days — outside of that they have to travel 30 to 50 miles to the nearest clinic,” Schwab said.
The Rural Health Transformation Program created incentives for some policies that the committee declined to take up. 
One of them would have involved lifting the state’s nursing home bed moratorium.
The Legislature adopted the moratorium in 1995 and most recently renewed it during the 2025 legislative session.
The reason for the moratorium is partly to prevent the number of beds across the state from growing to an extent that could threaten the financial stability of rural providers, including by diluting federal subsidies.
“I’ve always believed that the moratorium helps keep beds in rural areas, and by opening this up we could do damage to that situation,” said Rep. Kathy Frelich, R-Devils Lake.
Supporters also argue the moratorium helps promote senior care alternatives most aging Americans prefer, like home health services.
Opponents of the moratorium during the session criticized it as overregulation.

The committee on Wednesday decided against taking another look at the moratorium after some lawmakers expressed that reviving the debate was unlikely to be productive.
“This discussion would take us weeks,” Senate Minority Leader Kathy Hogan, D-Fargo, said during the meeting.
The committee also decided against drafting bills that would expand services that dental hygienists could provide, and creating a license and registration process for telehealth providers.
The Rural Health Transformation Committee will reconvene Tuesday at 12:30 p.m.

Another two criticisms and two positive comments were offered verbally Wednesday during a hearing in Aberdeen conducted by the state Board of Education.
In response, department officials said they will amend the proposal. 
The proposed standards were reviewed by a 20-person revision committee after being developed by a statewide advisory group. South Dakota Secretary of Education Joe Graves said the proposal leaves core concepts largely unchanged but describes them more clearly and concisely.
“The department aimed to make them more accessible and understandable for educators, students and families alike,” Graves said.

Others disagreed with that characterization. Sharon Vestal, a math professor at South Dakota State University, said she was concerned the simplification has “taken out some of the precise mathematics and the meaning behind it.” 
Oldham-Ramona math teacher Susan Gilkerson said she is “on the fence” regarding the changes. She worries the new standards “took the meat off the bones” and will not give educators a clear understanding of just how deeply they need to teach a subject to ensure they meet the new standards.
The proposal pulls from other states’ standards across the nation, and from the Archimedes standards, which were written by an assistant professor at Hillsdale College. The Michigan-based private college was also involved in South Dakota’s revised social studies standards, accepted in 2023 and implemented this school year.
State board approves controversial social studies standards on 5-2 vote

One of the states from which the proposed math standards are drawn is Arkansas, which has historically had lower test scores than South Dakota. Graves said Arkansas went through a similar process to simplify and improve its math standards a few years ago.
“The results of that change haven’t appeared. We don’t know what that’s going to result in,” Graves said.
Graves added that South Dakota students “lack significant progress” on math testing since the COVID-19 pandemic, which he attributed to the current standards. About 44% of students were proficient or above on the state test annually over the last five years, he said. 
Vestal told board members the scores are a result of disruptions students suffered during the pandemic.
“A lot was lost that year when they went online, and we’re still trying to gain that back,” Vestal said. “That has been a huge problem, and we haven’t recovered.”
The U.S. Education Department awarded South Dakota a five-year, $3.7 million grant to support implementation of new standards, provide professional development for elementary school educators, facilitate higher education collaboration, and allow school district math leaders to meet and develop math plans. 
Graves said the department will take the critiques raised in the public comments, “figure out what to do, and be back in November with ideas on those.” The next meeting will be Nov. 10 in Sioux Falls.",https://southdakotasearchlight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Social-Studies-Testimony-scaled-e1760565193320-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-15 18:04:53.282818

(Photo by Will Steinfeld/New Hampshire Bulletin)I wish I could blame congressional Republicans or congressional Democrats for the government shutdown, now in its third week.
I wish I could hold decades of New Hampshire lawmakers, on the left and right, responsible for a system that has consistently punished school districts, and consequently the children they serve, for the sin of being poor.
I wish I could point the finger at the Trump administration for the appalling way this country treats women, immigrants, people with mental illness, Black people, Native Americans, people with disabilities, trans people, young people, old people, working people.
But I can’t, because this is what we built together. You and I. Us.
And we should have seen it coming — this moment right now — a long time ago, whenever it was that we made politics a central form of entertainment. From that very first day that we started seeing ourselves as political spectators with rooting interests — Go Red! Go Blue! — rather than the employers of our public servants, we should have known. When the Donalds, and Hillaries, and Kamalas, and Bernies became celebrities rather than people asking us for a job, that should have been the brightest of red flags. 
And we should have understood, when modernity handed each of us our own printing press, radio station, and movie camera, that truth would lose currency in the swell and din. 
We should have expected, through the rudeness with which we treat the people who serve our coffee, the allegations we hurl at those who teach our children and treat our illnesses, and the way we belittle and dismiss those who dare disagree with us on social media, that a government created in our own image would find it so easy to blame, to hate, to inflict harm.
We should have known that our ever-dimming enlightenment would open the door to the most strident champions of our basest instincts — from President Donald Trump, to U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson, to N.H. House Majority Leader Jason Osborne — who seek not to do good broadly but to punish strategically.
If you listen, really listen, to politicians like that, it should be clear enough that they are not invested in people or their problems. When Osborne talks about the Claremont School District’s financial issues, for example, there is no concern for the kids who are most affected. There is only calculation — what can be seized politically to advance an ideology to which the people of New Hampshire are incidental rather than fundamental? 
And we should have known that this rise of the far right would also recalibrate the center, creating a place where New Hampshire’s two Democratic U.S. senators felt comfortable voting to confirm a billionaire, Scott Bessent, for treasury secretary and another Cabinet member who just this week suggested that peaceful protesters are domestic terrorists. The state’s two U.S. representatives, also inhabitants of the new center, have similarly taken “go along to get along” positions, most notably with their support of the unconstitutional, anti-immigrant Laken Riley Act.
Democrats hate that kind of criticism. They call it “false equivalency” because their position is that the scope of what Republicans are doing is far worse. While they’re right about that second part, they’re wrong about the first. Every public servant should be held to a higher standard than the baseline idiocy and cruelty of their opposition. That’s one of the ways we’ll get out of this mess — if we can get out of this mess.
But first, we the people need to rediscover both our goodness and our authority.
I hope those who are inclined to support this gang of Republicans, at least those who aren’t just in it for the racism and misogyny, spend a little less time cheering for the libs to get owned and start asking better questions about who really stands to gain from Trump’s economic manipulations (most notably what the Trump family stands to gain), from crypto to tariffs to the gutting of the IRS to those rich-guy tax cuts. I hope they ask tougher questions, too, of the Republicans in the New Hampshire State House who seem more interested in mimicking the Trump administration’s lies and barbarity than addressing real state-level challenges.
And I hope those who tend to vote Democratic will interrupt their candidates when they go on for too long about what and whom they’re against to ask more about what it is they’re actually for. It doesn’t take much political bravery to go after America’s 1,135 billionaires or roughly 10,000 centi-millionaires on principle, so what does a policy outline toward more economic fairness look like? In this Wild West era of campaign finance, what financial enemies are Democratic candidates actually willing to make? And, in New Hampshire, do the state party’s chosen candidates have the courage to run on what’s right for the people rather than just what’s considered politically safe in the land of The Pledge?

The town of Shelburne has terminated a police sergeant who pleaded guilty last month to a criminal misdemeanor charge of driving his cruiser while on duty and striking and killing a cyclist.
The town’s selectboard held a personnel hearing in closed session Tuesday night and then issued a statement that read, “Kyle Kapitanski is no longer employed by the Town of Shelburne.” 
The selectboard, the statement added, would not be releasing its written decision in the matter, contending it is exempt from disclosure under the law a “personal” document. 
The statement did not specify what policies or procedures Kapitanski may have violated leading to his termination. 
Kapitanski entered a plea agreement in September that allowed him to avoid jail time for his role in the November crash that killed 38-year-old Sean Hayes of Burlington. 
Kapitanski had been on paid leave by the town since the crash, pending an internal investigation.
He was initially charged with a felony offense of gross negligent operation of a motor vehicle with death resulting. That charge was reduced to a misdemeanor offense of negligent operation of a motor vehicle with a fatality as part of the plea deal he entered into with prosecutors.

As part of that agreement, Kapitanski was sentenced to six to 12 months in jail, all suspended, and he was placed on probation for two years. 
Kapitanski was driving his cruiser 40 to 45 mph in a 35-mph zone on Shelburne Road in South Burlington when the early morning crash took place, prosecutors said during September’s hearing in criminal court in Burlington. 
Hayes, court records stated, appeared to be adjusting his bicycle and a trailer attached to it before he started walking southbound with the bicycle when Kapitanski’s cruiser struck him.
Leading up to the crash, a charging affidavit stated, Kapitanski had YouTube videos playing on a computer tablet mounted in his cruiser. A link to the last video was provided in the filing and it was titled, “Trans woman CONFRONTING Matt Walsh takes UNEXPECTED turn,” the affidavit stated. 
David Sleigh, Kapitanski’s attorney in the criminal case, contended there was no proof his client was distracted while driving by videos. 
The prosecutor in the case said at the hearing that Kapitanski’s possible return to his job in law enforcement has “effectively” been prevented.  
Shelburne Town Manager Matt Lawless, in an email to reporters Tuesday night, wrote that the executive session held by the selectboard was warned under a provision in the law to consider  “disciplinary or dismissal action against a public officer or employee.”
Lawless added that town officials would not be providing additional records or details related to Kapitanski’s termination. 
“The trial documents establish the facts of the case, so I’ll leave it at that,” he wrote.
Kapitanski could not be reached for comment. 
Hayes’ estate has also brought a civil lawsuit that remains pending against the town of Shelburne in connection with the fatal crash.

The number of measles cases statewide reported so far this year rose to 16 this week, the highest number since the disease was eradicated more than two decades ago.
All 16 people were unvaccinated, and none had immunity from a previous infection, according to the state Department of Public Health.
Health officials are now warning unvaccinated patrons of a Greenville gym, which offers day care for customers, that they may have been exposed.
The health agency reported a confirmed case in a Greenville County child last week. Bell said officials don’t know how the child contracted the disease and the child might have spread the virus to others.
“We don’t want anyone to have a false sense of security,” Bell said. “We want people to be aware that we have evidence of transmission in the community. So, exposures can be unexpected, can be unpredicted.”
150 Spartanburg County students quarantined as measles continues to spread in SC

Officials urged the parents of any unvaccinated children at the Crunch Fitness’ location at 1332 S. Pleasantburg Drive in Greenville between 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. on Sept. 30 to see their health care provider.
“This is an ongoing investigation and that facility is working with us to provide the names of the children who may have been dropped off at that facility during the timeframe,” Bell added. “We have not yet confirmed the vaccination status of the (other) children who were there at the same time.”
A dozen of the other cases to date are directly linked to an outbreak centered around two Spartanburg County schools: Fairforest Elementary School, which is part of Spartanburg School District 6, and Global Academy, a public charter school, department officials said.
The five newest diagnosed cases are among the 139 students of those two schools who remain quarantined at home after being exposed to the virus, meaning it is less likely those children have spread the virus to others.
South Carolina requires all children enrolled in school, both public and private, to be up to date on vaccinations, though there are exemptions granted for religious or medical reasons.
Spartanburg County, the center of the outbreak, has one of the lowest vaccination rates among school children in the state, according to health department data.
More than 8% of Spartanburg County’s 58,000 students received a religious exemption during the 2024-2025 school year, by far the most of any county in the state.
“Another concern in particular about this low coverage in the school districts in the Upstate is that they are also have among the highest enrollment in the state,” Bell said.
About the disease
Measles symptoms usually start with a fever, cough, red eyes and runny nose, followed by a rash that typically begins on the face before spreading to the rest of the body. The rash can last up to a week.
Severe cases of the virus can cause pneumonia or brain swelling, which can be fatal, especially in young children, according to the public health department.
The virus can linger in the air for up to two hours after a sick person passes through a room, making it possible to get sick without directly interacting with an infected person. Those exposed are expected to stay home for 21 days, which is how long the virus can stay in a person’s body before they realize they’re sick, Bell said.
The two-dose vaccine has been in use for decades and provides lifelong immunity to nearly all who receive it. Side effects, including soreness or an allergic reaction at the injection site, are possible.
“But what we want people to pay careful attention to is that the complications from the disease itself far outweigh any rare adverse events that might be associated with the vaccine,” Bell said.
Up to 90% of unvaccinated people exposed to the measles will get the virus, she said.
An unvaccinated person exposed to the disease can potentially avoid getting sick or have a more mild reaction to the virus if they receive a dose of the vaccine within 72 hours of exposure, Bell said.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/GettyImages-2202122299-1024x683-1.jpg,,,2025-10-15 18:04:53.282818

Troy Carter, a Louisiana Democrat and member of the caucus, cautioned his state could lose two majority Black congressional districts if the court strikes down the section in question.“Critics claim that the VRA is no longer needed, but history and data tells quite a different story,” Carter said.“Though Black people make up one-third of the population (in the state), only five (Black) Louisianians have served in the U.S. House out of 171. That's not equal representation. That's a travesty. Without protections like Section 2, Black communities will lose power. Their concerns are sidelined, and our democracy is weakened.”

U.S. Rep. Terri Sewell, a Democrat of Alabama, said she sat through the more than two hours of oral arguments in the Supreme Court Wednesday morning into afternoon.“What was clear in the questioning of the majority on the court is that they have something in mind,” Sewell said, adding that she believes the conservative majority wants to “claw back Section 2, if not to eliminate it totally.”

Two years ago, the justices affirmed Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, finding that an Alabama congressional district map likely violated it. “This case is more than just about congressional maps. It's about who we are as a nation and what we want our democracy to be. Now, I may be the first Black congresswoman from Alabama, but I damn sure won’t be the last,” Sewell said.Earlier Wednesday, hundreds of demonstrators gathered outside the Supreme Court before and during oral arguments. Nearly two dozen advocacy groups organized the rally, dubbed “Fight for Fair Maps.” Speakers included leaders from the NAACP, The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, The Urban League and the National Council of Negro Women.

Attorney General Marty Jackley, who announced the charges against 56-year-old Nova J. Collins in a Wednesday press release, said the charges were the first to be filed under a new state law that requires all state employees to disclose suspected “improper conduct” by their coworkers.
The legislation came in response to a crush of state employee criminal cases in 2024 across multiple state agencies. The most costly to taxpayers involved the misappropriation of $1.78 million by a former Department of Social Services employee.

The press release on Collins’ indictment says the charges are related to “falsifying reports related to a child abuse investigation,” but does not include further details on the alleged behavior.
Tony Mangan, spokesman for Jackley, said he could confirm that Collins was reported by a “fellow state employee.” Mangan said he couldn’t offer more details during an ongoing investigation.
As of Wednesday afternoon, Collins referred to herself as a supervisor with the state of South Dakota on her LinkedIn profile. It says she’s worked for the state for 25 years. Jackley’s press release referred to Collins as a “former state employee.”
Collins’ indictment lists four felony charges related to forgery and falsified evidence, as well as a misdemeanor charge for falsification of public records by a public officer or employee. If convicted on all counts, she could be incarcerated for up to 15 years.
According to the indictment, each charge relates to Collins’ alleged falsification of a document called a DSS Initial Family Assessment and Child Safety Determination report for a minor child, identified only by initials, between January and June of this year.
Such a document is completed by a Department of Social Services employee following a report of abuse and neglect, according to the department website. 
The indictment provides no further details, and it’s so far the only public court document filed in the case.

Wyoming ranch owner Eshelman says justices should review his failed lawsuit because lower court's ruling carries ""profound"" legal consequences.
The post Corner-crossing petition to Supreme Court employs successful past strategies appeared first on WyoFile .","As Supreme Court justices meet Friday to consider hearing the Wyoming corner-crossing case, attorneys for ranch owner Fred Eshelman are citing reasons that others have successfully employed to get their cases accepted for review.
The Supreme Court should accept Eshelman’s petition and hear the case because, his attorneys say, the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals’ decision on corner crossing “contravenes” Supreme Court precedent. The case also has “profound legal and practical importance,” Eshelman argues.
Eshelman is appealing the 10th Circuit Court’s decision that he cannot block the public from corner crossing to reach public land surrounded by his Carbon County ranch. He sued four Missouri hunters who stepped from one piece of public property to another adjacent one where the two met at a checkerboard corner with two parcels of Eshelman’s Elk Mountain Ranch. The hunters did not touch the ranch owner’s land.
Eshelman, through his ranch-owning company Iron Bar Holdings, maintains the hunters trespassed when they passed through the airspace above his property, a violation of Wyoming law. In seeking a Supreme Court hearing, Eshelman’s attorneys use two of the most successful approaches, expert Dan Schweitzer wrote in a guide, that petitioners have employed to convince the court to hear their cases.
“This petition does not meet this Court’s criteria for granting review.” Ryan Semerad
Eshelman’s petition, however, is not based on the first reason the court lists for taking up petitions for a writ of certiorari, or review. That’s when there are conflicting decisions on the same matter between two of the 13 federal circuit courts of appeal.
That’s fodder for the hunters who say they don’t want the court to consider the case, but are willing to fight if it does.
“This petition does not meet this Court’s criteria for granting review,” one of the hunters’ attorneys, Ryan Semerad, wrote in a Supreme Court filing. “Iron Bar doesn’t claim that the decision below implicates a circuit split.”
Because the 10th Circuit Court is the only one to address corner crossing, “No split exists,” the hunters contend.
Only 5% of petitions succeed
The 10th Circuit agreed with the hunters that the 1885 Unlawful Inclosures Act prevents Eshelman from blocking corner crossers. Based on the 10th Circuit’s decision in March, corner crossing to reach isolated tracts of federal public land is now legal in Wyoming, Colorado, Utah, New Mexico, Kansas and Oklahoma.
Corner crossing arises from the public’s desire to reach its own public land in the checkerboard area of Wyoming. The checkerboard pattern of alternating square mile ownership overlays Eshelman’s wildlife-rich, 20,000-acre-plus Elk Mountain Ranch.
By preventing corner-crossing, Eshelman, a hunter himself, reaps for himself the bounty of public property — property owned by all Americans — critics contend.
Obtaining a review of federal appeals court decisions is rare. In 2024, the Supreme Court agreed to hear 5.2% of 1,344 petitions (not counting petitions from indigent appellants, of which there are many), according to an analysis that Empirical SCOTUS writer Adam Feldman published on SCOTUSblog.
Eshelman’s attorneys explain their reasoning that the appeal should be among those rare cases the court considers. They are second- and third-tier reasons, according to Schweitzer’s 2019 guide — lower court decisions that “directly conflict[s] with Supreme Court precedent” and issues that are “extremely important.”

Iron Bar claims the 10th Circuit Court contravened the Supreme Court’s own 1979 decision known as Leo Sheep. (Leo is a rural Carbon County settlement; Leo Sheep was a company named after the place.) In that case, the court ruled that the government did not have an implied easement to build a road across a common checkerboard corner to reach a reservoir used for recreation.
But Leo Sheep doesn’t apply to the Iron Bar case, the hunters, and the 10th Circuit, contend. Among other things, Leo Sheep dealt with a road constructed on private land, and there also was another way to reach the reservoir.
The 10th Circuit’s decision, written by Judge Timothy Tymkovich and agreed to by two other appellate judges, said that “the Supreme Court can also reconsider the scope of Leo Sheep, as it applies to this case.”
Profoundly important
Attorneys who write successful petitions also argue that their issue is an important one and, as Schweitzer puts it, their pleadings therefore “dive into the merits to a far greater degree.” Schweitzer writes that decisions that impair government officials from doing their jobs or that create a devastating impact on an industry can qualify for review.
“If a 140-year-old fence statute can be read to extinguish [state trespass laws] then no realm of traditional state property law is secure,” Eshelman’s attorneys wrote. The 10th Circuit, if its decision stands, creates “uncertainty for millions of landowners, recreationalists, and law enforcement officials across millions of acres of land.”
Stockmen warn that “unrestrained public access … can cause great stress to livestock,” Eshelman’s filings state. Further, the 10th Circuit’s “sweeping” decision affecting property rights across millions of acres is “an important question of federal law,” that the Supreme Court should address.
Hunters say Eshelman has done an about-face.
When resisting the hunters’ request to move the case from state to federal court, Eshelman and Iron Bar “denied that this case implicates ‘an important question of federal law,’” the hunters state. Instead, the ranch owner described any federal issues as “not substantial.”
Eshelman argued in Wyoming’s civil court that the case concerned “only two sections” of his property and that the controversy involved “well under $75,000,” in value, a hunters’ brief states. Eshelman argued unsuccessfully in 2022 that those limited impacts should allow the ranch owner to pursue his suit in the state court system and not the federal one.
The hunters, however, convinced a federal judge to move the case to the federal court system. “Only after losing [his effort to keep the case in Wyoming courts] did Iron Bar revise its estimated damages from the hunters’ momentary incursions on its airspace upwards to $8 million,” the hunters’ attorneys wrote in a brief to the Supreme Court. Now Eshelman contends the impact is “billions,” they wrote.
Eshelman could benefit from amicus briefs filed to support his petition, SCOTUSblog’s analysis of the last eight years of petitions shows. The United Property Owners of Montana, the Wyoming Stock Growers Association, the Wyoming Wool Growers Association, the Claremont Institute’s Center for Constitutional Jurisprudence and Montana Stockgrowers Association’s amicus filings boost Eshelman’s chances of obtaining a writ because they indicate a “national stake.”
The hunters’ attorneys, however, chose neither to enlist an “elite” and practiced Supreme Court lawyer nor ask for briefs from groups that support their public-access case. Doing either could have signaled to the Supreme Court that the case is indeed nationally significant, contrary to the hunters’ position that the 10th Circuit appropriately took care of all necessary business.
The Supreme Court’s hearing on Friday will be held behind closed doors. Within several days, the court is expected to publish a list of cases that it will accept for review.

(Photo credit: Christine Sexton/Florida Phoenix)Florida’s Republican-controlled House, undeterred by Gov. Ron DeSantis’s veto earlier this year of identical legislation, is pushing ahead again with an effort to broaden the class of people who can bring wrongful death lawsuits against physicians.
“If you’re feeling a little déjà vu today it’s because you should be feeling a little déjà vu. We heard this exact bill in this committee,” Fort Pierce Republican and HB 6003 bill sponsor Rep. Dana Trabulsy said Wednesday.
The GOP legislator made her comments before a House panel voted overwhelmingly for the bill that allows parents of single, childless, adult children to sue for noneconomic damages such as pain and suffering arising from alleged medical malpractice.
Florida also bans adults (defined as 25 and older) from pursuing wrongful death claims for single parents who die from medical malpractice, and the bill would remove that ban, too. The Legislature adopted the bans during the 1990s as the state wrestled with rising malpractice premiums but Florida remains one of the few states to have such restrictions in place.
HB 6003 cleared the House Civil Justice & Claims Subcommittee with two dissenting votes, although some representatives hinted that their continued support would hinge on changes, including caps on noneconomic damages that could be recovered in all medical malpractice lawsuits.
“While I vote up on this bill today, I am hopeful that in the future, either in this chamber or the next, that reasonable limits will somehow find their way into this bill, thereby achieving the balance and allowing us to achieve justice without inadvertently creating another injustice to replace that one,” said Jacksonville Republican Rep. Dean Black.

HB 6003 reignites a long-standing fight between trial attorneys, organized medicine, and insurance companies over Florida’s medical malpractice laws and the amount of noneconomic damages plaintiffs can recover.
Florida has not had caps on pain and suffering awards in medical malpractice lawsuits since 2014, when the Florida Supreme Court ruled that they are unconstitutional. But the makeup of the court has changed since then, with the majority of the justices having been appointed by DeSantis.
The insurance and business communities see HB 6003 as a vehicle to reinstate the caps, hopeful that a reconfigured DeSantis-appointed court will uphold them.
Representatives of families who’ve been barred under the law from filing lawsuits have repeatedly traveled to Tallahassee to share their stories of heartbreak and testify against what they call the “free kill” law as well as a regulatory system they say allows bad doctors to continue to practice medicine.
Opponents have dubbed the efforts to alter the law as “jackpot justice.”
Both sides squared off at the first stop of the bill.

Tallahassee orthopedic surgeon Andy Borom said he was “offended” by the “free kill” title.
“As if there’s a bunch of physicians who spent their entire adult lives training and taking care of patients who are sitting around salivating at the opportunity to kill people for free. That’s just gross,” he said.
Borom, 58, has been practicing medicine for 25 years. He said he’d consider expediting his retirement if the Legislature were to allow more lawsuits to be filed without capping noneconomic damages.
“There’s enough things that are punishing about the practice of medicine,” said Borom. “Right now, Medicare is cutting rates, the cost of medical practice goes up well in excess of the costs of reimbursement, and then you throw on the hazard of medical liability, which oftentimes doesn’t always comport with actual malpractice, sometimes it’s just somebody looking for a buck.”
He said the legislation could expedite his retirement by 10 years.
“That’s about 40,000 patients that won’t be seen, about 5,000 surgeries that won’t get done,” he said.
Jacksonville resident Cindy Jenkins testified before the House House Civil Justice & Claims Subcommittee October 15,2025.
Jacksonville resident Cindy Jenkins shared the story of how her 25-year- old daughter, Taylor Jenkins, died in a Florida hospital after waiting for emergency surgery. Devastated, she said she paid for a private autopsy, the results of which, she said, caused the medical examiner to change the cause of death on her death certificate.
She told the committee that following the experience she “set out on a mission to hold the hospital and doctors accountable and, with all due respect to those in favor of this law, I learned that the doctors got a free pass because my daughter had been 25 for two and a half months.”
Jenkins said she filed a complaint against the physician with the Florida Department of Health but that it was dismissed.
As she concluded her testimony, Jenkins countered the claims DeSantis made at a press conference announcing his veto, when he criticized the legislation because it did not reinstate caps on noneconomic damages. She also addressed opponents’ assertions that as many as 1,500 additional lawsuits could be filed if the law was changed.
“I do not want the grave of my dead child danced on nor 1,500 people per year to be able to have access to the courts in return for hurting the masses. I will wear the badge ‘free kill mom’ like honor,” she said, adding, “I will never agree to trade off opening courts to a small percentage of the people to hurt everybody.”

(Photo by William Skipworth/New Hampshire Bulletin)As the federal government remains closed over Senate Democrats’ health funding demands, Gov. Kelly Ayotte said the prospect of New Hampshire’s SNAP program halting keeps her up at night.
Earlier this month, the federal government shut down after the Senate failed to pass a spending plan. Republicans proposed a plan that would’ve kept funding largely at current levels. Democrats rejected that plan, saying they won’t vote for a package that doesn’t extend a set of tax credits used by Americans to purchase health coverage on HealthCare.gov that are set to expire in December. The Democrats put forth a spending plan that extends those subsidies and reverses many of the spending cuts Republicans instituted through the One Big Beautiful Bill Act in July, at an additional cost of roughly $1 trillion. The sides could not reach an agreement before Oct. 1, causing all nonessential federal government services to cease.
That includes the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, commonly known as SNAP or food stamps, which helps low-income Americans pay for food. The program is operated jointly by federal and state governments, but 100% of the benefits are paid for by the federal government. If Congress doesn’t approve a spending plan before Oct. 31, the federal government won’t provide the funding for the state to administer the program here.
“As governor, this is on my mind, and I think about it at night when I’m going to sleep,” Ayotte, a Republican, said during Wednesday’s Executive Council meeting. “And working with the commissioner (Lori Weaver of the Department of Health and Human Services) and her team on this, we will do everything we can to make sure that for people who need help with food insecurity and their children, that we do whatever we can with our state to make sure that they get what they need.”
Ayotte, a former U.S. senator who has criticized Congress’ failure to fund the government multiple times this month, noted “Washington can end this now.”
“If Washington gets their act together and would vote to fund the government, then we would not have this issue,” she said.
Chris Santaniello, associate commissioner of the state Department of Health and Human Services, told councilors the department was in “active conversation” with SNAP enrollees and is working with the USDA Food and Nutrition Service — though many employees at the FNS have been furloughed as a result of the shutdown — on a plan should the shutdown continue into November.
“The goal is to make sure no one goes without the benefit,” Santaniello said.
She said she didn’t yet have specifics on that plan to share.
“I’m glad to hear that you’re working on plans,” Councilor Karen Liot Hill, a Democrat, said. “Families need to know how they’re going to be able to send their kids to school not hungry, and be able to go to work not hungry.”
SNAP is facing other funding threats, too. The One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which President Donald Trump signed into law in July, included a number of cuts to the program. The new law reduces the amount of benefits families receive by restricting the factors used to determine benefit amounts. It passes off much of the program’s administrative costs, which are currently covered by the federal government, to state governments, which may or may not be willing and able to cover them. It also caps future SNAP increases to the rate of inflation, bans many legal migrants (specifically refugees and asylees; people in the country without legal status were already ineligible) from receiving benefits through the program, and makes work requirements stricter. Those changes take effect at varying dates over the next few years.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/ayottesnap-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-10-15 18:04:53.282818

The state Department of Education released results of the college readiness exam Wednesday. South Dakota students earned an average composite score of 21. The highest possible score on the ACT is 36.
South Dakota’s results continued a trend of lower scores since the state’s recent high of 21.9 in 2018. The state averaged 21.1 in each of 2023 and 2024. The minimum score for acceptance at the state’s public universities is 18.
“These numbers reflect what we know to be true – that South Dakota students who take the ACT are well-prepared to move on following their K-12 careers,” said Secretary of Education Joe Graves in a news release.


The national average composite score this year is 19.4, which is the same as last year and an eighth straight year of lower or unimproved scores after a peak score of 21 in 2017. 
Sixty percent of South Dakota’s high school graduates took the ACT this year, according to the department. Of students who indicated they want to attend college, 75% said they plan to attend higher education institutions in South Dakota. Forty-one percent of South Dakota test-takers met college readiness in three or four academic skill areas: English, mathematics, reading and science.
Comparing states based on their average ACT scores is difficult, because not all states require the test, and the percentage of students taking it in each state varies widely. The state will require all South Dakota juniors to take the test beginning this spring, replacing the state assessment test administered to high school juniors.


“Providing all public-school juniors the opportunity to demonstrate their readiness this spring is an exciting and important step. Having an ACT score in hand can open doors to opportunities students may never have considered before,” Graves added. “I look forward to seeing students who would not typically take the ACT realize what their future may hold.”
South Dakota will join nine other states that reported 100% of students taking the ACT. Among those states, the average score was 18.2.
South Dakota’s average score of 21 for the roughly 60% of students who took the test is better or equal to states with the most similar participation rates, according to the ACT. Missouri, with 70% participation, reported 19.8; Hawaii, with 68% participation, reported 17.5; Minnesota, with 68% participation, reported 20.6; and Iowa, with 41% participation, reported 21.

Vermont Republican leaders continued to distance themselves from freshman Sen. Sam Douglass on Wednesday. During a press conference, Republican Gov. Phil Scott said his message for the Young Republicans was simple: “Clean up your act. Be good people.” 
The governor publicly called on the Orleans County senator to resign Tuesday after a Politico article outed Douglass, among other politicians in the Young Republicans, a national group, for exchanging racial slurs and derogatory messages in a group chat. 
Douglass, 27, has not resigned, despite calls for him to step down from both sides of the political spectrum. In a Wednesday press release, Douglass denounced the “vile and disgusting comments” included in the Politico story and said he had “cut ties with those involved.”

In a June exchange between former New York State Young Republicans co-chair Bobby Walker and chair Peter Giunta, Walker mentioned a mutual friend who had dated an “obese Indian woman,” according to the report. Giunta replied that the woman was not Indian, to which Douglass responded: “She just didn’t bathe often.”
After Douglass made a comment about a Jewish colleague potentially making a procedural mistake, his wife and national Young Republicans committee member Brianna Douglass responded, stating, “you’re giving nationals to (sic) much credit and expecting the Jew to be honest.”
Sam and Brianna’s comments are among thousands of racist, antisemitic and violent messages revealed in a leaked national Young Republicans group chat. Members in the chat referred to Black people as “the watermelon people,” and joked about killing political opponents and sending them “to the gas chamber.” Another chat member wrote, “I love Hitler.”
In his statement, Douglass suggested he had little to do with the chat, and said his role “was a procedural one about bylaws and floor strategy.”

“There were often periods of multiple days when I didn’t check this group chat and I was unfortunately unaware of those comments,” he wrote. “I should’ve been more vigilant, more careful, and less naive about who I associate with and my digital environments.
He added that his comment highlighted in the Politico story “was not a generalization and doesn’t represent my views or character.”
“I apologize so deeply to my constituents and colleagues that our county and state have been dragged into this,” he wrote. “I am currently weighing all my options to ensure that the outcome of this is what’s best for the safety and wellbeing of my family and my constituency, and I will make another statement before the end of the week.”
Group chat members in other states have faced similar calls for resignation from Republican counterparts. In New York, assemblyman Mike Reilly fired Giunta as his chief of staff over Giunta’s messages, according to SILive. 
Brianna Douglass was not made available for a comment after an interview request on Tuesday.
Earlier Wednesday afternoon, Scott said he and Douglass haven’t spoken since Scott made his Tuesday statement. He added that he has a zero tolerance policy for the language used in their messages. “What we saw in that article, we should reject it,” Scott said. 
“We’re better than that,” he added later on. 
Scott previously endorsed Douglass during Douglass’ campaign in the 2024 election. At the time, Scott posted pictures with Douglass touting his support for the prospective senator. On Wednesday afternoon, those posts were no longer visible on Scott’s accounts. 
Fellow Republican lawmakers from the Northeast Kingdom also disavowed Douglass on Wednesday in a statement signed by Sens. Russ Ingalls, Michael Marcotte, Richard Nelson and others. 
“This is a sad day for our party and for our state,” they wrote. “These comments have no place within our society as a whole and will not be tolerated.”
Vermont GOP Chair Paul Dame called the language used in the group chat “shocking and grotesque to all Republicans,” according to a press release issued Wednesday. He said he would be removing Douglass from the duties he has with the state party “until this matter is resolved.”
Douglass had been serving as the chair of the Republican Party in Orleans County and was an officer with the state chapter of Young Republicans. 
“If Sen. Douglass can not meet the minimum standard for informing the public about issues he is involved in, then I will also join the Governor and legislative colleagues in calling on him to resign,” he said in the press release.
While Dame suggested that the remarks attributed to Douglass “themselves were not bigoted or racist,” he noted that because of his participation in the group, “it has reflected poorly on himself, our party and Young Republicans everywhere.”
Sam Douglass works as a mental health professional with the Lamoille County Mental Health Services, and as a real estate agent. 
In a phone call, Jennifer Stratton, the head of the Lamoille County Mental Health Services, said the organization was “aware of the current situation” but said it was “an employee matter that we’re looking into.”
Stratton added the agency is “supportive of all people, of all races, cultures and religions” and that they “want all of the individuals we serve to feel safe and supported.”  
Douglass was among a number of Republican candidates that Scott and the GOP establishment campaigned for in the run up to the 2024 elections, building off of public concerns over taxes and affordability. Republicans secured multiple upset victories in the House and Senate, effectively dismantling the Democrat’s supermajority in the Legislature.
Six seats were flipped in the Senate, including the Orleans County seat now held by Douglass. Douglass beat Democrat Katherine Sims of Craftsbury, a state representative at the time, by more than 2,200 votes.
“Up in the Northeast Kingdom, we’re a very tight knit bunch, and we know when you’re not authentic,” Douglass told VTDigger after his victory. “This might be a little radical to say, but I don’t think it was Republicans that won. I think it was common sense that won.”
Scott endorsed Douglass during his 2024 campaign, appeared in a photo with him on social media and contributed money to his campaign. In the social media post, which has since been deleted, Scott said Douglass was “a common sense candidate who will always vote in the best interest of the Northeast Kingdom, regardless of party.”
“We need him in Montpelier, and I encourage the people of Orleans County to vote for Sam Douglass for state Senate,” Scott wrote.

(Pool photo by Travis Heying/Wichita Eagle)MARION — Former Marion Police Chief Gideon Cody probably committed a felony crime when he told a witness to delete text messages they exchanged before, during and after he led raids on a newspaper office and the publisher’s home, a district judge ruled Wednesday.
But Cody won’t be tried for the raids, which Marion County Record editor-publisher Eric Meyer says is the real crime.
A two-hour preliminary hearing revealed new details about the texts that Cody exchanged with Keri Newell, whose drunk driving record and request for a liquor license at her restaurant ignited an international drama two years ago. Newell took the stand and testified that Cody told her during a phone call to delete text messages between the two of them so that people wouldn’t get the wrong idea about whether they were romantically involved.
“Chief Cody had stated that he felt it would be in my best interest to delete those,” Newell said.
About six weeks after the raids, Newell texted Cody to say she was concerned about having deleted their earlier messages, she said. Cody replied that she was being paranoid.
Their exchange coincided with widespread scrutiny of the police raids in August 2023 of the newspaper office in flagrant disregard for the First Amendment and legal protections for journalists. Kansas Reflector first reported on the chilling raids.
Cody, working in coordination with the sheriff’s office, county attorney and Kansas Bureau of Investigation, had investigated whether Meyer and reporter Phyllis Zorn committed identity theft and other crimes by looking up Newell’s driving record in a public online database. A magistrate judge, ignoring the absence of evidence and state law, authorized the police raids of the newspaper office, Meyer’s home, and the home of city Councilwoman Ruth Herbel. Meyer’s 98-year-old mother died in distress a day later.
Police exceeded the scope of the search warrants by seizing reporters’ personal cellphones, work computers, and other equipment. Video showed Cody reviewing a reporter’s file on allegations that had been made against him.
At the KBI’s request, the Colorado Bureau of Investigation conducted a yearlong inquiry into whether Cody or anyone else had committed a crime. Special prosecutors Marc Bennett, of Sedgwick County, and Barry Wilkerson, of Riley County, cleared all law enforcement of any wrongdoing in carrying out the raids, which spawned five ongoing federal lawsuits.

However, CBI special agent John Zamora learned from talking to Newell that she had deleted text messages at his request, spanning a period of one week before to one week after the raids. 
The prosecutors presented an exhibit at Wednesday’s preliminary hearing that totaled 31 pages of text messages, including one where Cody said he was working with a publisher to write a book about the experience.
Zamora testified that he interviewed Newell in person in December 2023.
“Just tell me what’s happening,” he recalled telling her. “What’s going on here?”
Newell told him she agreed to delete texts, at Cody’s request, because she was worried that her now ex-husband would accuse her of having an affair with Cody, Zamora said.
Wilkerson asked Zamora, who has 30 years of law enforcement experience, if he had ever directed a witness to delete messages or documents.
“No,” Zamora said.
After talking to Newell, Zamora said, he obtained the deleted text messages from Jennifer Hill, the attorney who is defending the city and county from federal lawsuits over the raid. Cody, who had given her his cellphone, had not deleted the text messages himself.

Cody’s attorney, Sal Intagliata, of Wichita, cross-examined Zamora about his investigation. According to Intagliata, the special agent told Hill that he was just trying to “check all the boxes.” Zamora said he didn’t remember making the comment.
When Newell took the stand, she said she has had no communication with Cody since leaving town amid the controversy two years ago.
Zorn and Meyer sat front and center in the courtroom, with Zorn tightlipped and taking notes and Meyer in an incredulous slouch, newspaper tucked in his pants pocket.
Cody, who now lives in Hawaii, appeared by Zoom. He sat expressionless with his chin on his hand for most of the hearing.
District Judge Ryan Rosauer rejected Intagliata’s argument that it was “a legal impossibility” to blame Cody for deleting texts that he ultimately turned over himself. The judge found probable cause that Cody had committed the low-level felony crime of interfering with the judicial process by inducing a witness to withhold information in a criminal investigation.
Cody entered a not guilty plea, and Rosauer scheduled a trial for February.
If convicted, because he has no criminal history, Cody’s sentence would be presumptive probation.

In an interview after the hearing, Meyer said he was worried about the “big picture.”
“None of this has anything to do with the crime,” Meyer said, referring to the raids on his newsroom and home.
“This is not even about the case,” Meyer said. “This is about what he did after the case.”
He also said he was concerned that Cody was being made a scapegoat for the raids, despite the widespread involvement of other people and law enforcement agencies.
“We still want some statement, an official judgment of the court, that this was wrong, so that no one can use this excuse anymore that, ‘Oh, we aren’t sure that it’s illegal to raid newsrooms, and because we’re not completely sure, we can still do it,’ which seems like a stupid excuse to me,” Meyer said.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/101525cody_th1-1024x655.jpg,,,2025-10-15 18:04:53.282818

Some Michigan GOP members have responded, including Krish Mathrani, who is the Youth Chair of the Michigan Republican Party. 
In a statement posted to X, Mathrani wrote, “I am deeply disturbed and outraged by the contents of the leaked Young Republicans group chat messages recently exposed by Politico. These messages — filled with racist epithets, antisemitic conspiracies, references to praise of Hitler, and dehumanizing language — are grotesque and must be denounced.”
He continued on to say that “There is no excuse or mitigation for this kind of rhetoric,” and called on Republicans and conservatives to condemn the chat publicly.   SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Others downplayed the messages. That included Meshawn Maddock, the former co-chair of the Michigan Republican Party and wife of state Rep. Matt Maddock (R-Milford), responded on X to messages criticizing her for not denouncing the chat with GIFs reading “Blah, blah, blah” and “I’m still bored.” 
No member of Michigan’s Young Republicans chapter was named in the report as being a part of the group chat directly, but were referenced in the messages quoted by POLITICO. 
Specifically, POLITICO reported that Alex Dwyer, the chair of the Kansas Young Republicans, told the chat that he had been told by the vice chair of Michigan’s chapter that “My delegates I bring will vote for the most right wing person.” Peter Giunta, the chair of the New York State Young Republicans at the time, responded to that message saying, “Great. I love Hitler.”
“These messages are absolutely reprehensible and have no place in Michigan or anywhere else. The fact that Michigan Young Republicans are linked to this report makes the silence from Michigan’s Republican leadership even more alarming,” wrote Michigan Democratic Party chair Curtis Hertel, who specifically called on gubernatorial candidates Mike Rogers and John James to condemn the messages. “Every single leader has a moral obligation to condemn all forms of antisemitism, racism, and hatred – no exceptions and no qualifications.”
Neither the Michigan Republican Party nor the Michigan Young Republicans responded to requests for comment from the Michigan Advance, and neither group had posted to social media regarding the chat.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/cellphone-1024x6831677068277-1.jpeg,,,2025-10-15 18:04:53.282818

The organizations are asking leaders in Scott’s administration to halt the changes if they cannot prove they have the authority to implement them.

This story, by Report for America corps member Carly Berlin, was produced through a partnership between VTDigger and Vermont Public.
Leaders of environmental and democracy groups say that Gov. Phil Scott overstepped his authority when the Republican issued an order aimed at speeding up housing development by rolling back regulations last month. 
In a letter sent to top administration officials on Wednesday, the organizations claim the executive order — issued while lawmakers were not in session — “directly undermines the authority of the legislature and the separation of powers” established in the state Constitution.

The order made a suite of changes to housing permitting in Vermont that, given the state’s deep housing deficit, Scott and his allies argued could not wait until lawmakers reconvene in January. It alters rules for building in wetlands, allows builders to comply with older and less stringent energy efficiency codes, and changes timelines for decision making under Act 250, Vermont’s development review law, among other measures.
Lauren Hierl, executive director of the Vermont Natural Resources Council – one of the groups that issued Wednesday’s letter – said policy decisions on these issues should be made via open discussion and debate. 
“Instead, we’re having to have this conversation about an illegal overreach of executive power, which is really frustrating and concerning,” she said. 
At a regularly-scheduled Wednesday press conference, Scott defended the administration’s decision to issue the order, but noted he had not yet been made aware of the groups’ opposition.
“We believe it’s in our authority,” Scott said. “We believe that housing has been stated as an emergency in Vermont.”
The letter asks state agency leaders to determine whether they have authority to carry out the changes in the executive order, while strongly suggesting that they lack it. If the agencies cannot prove that they have the authority, they should halt implementation of the order’s changes, the letter says.
At least one developer has signaled that the executive order might open up new options for their project. In Manchester, builders of a 43-unit project indicated last month that the governor’s amendment to wetland buffer areas might offer flexibility for the project’s design, according to reporting from the Manchester Journal. The development has drawn scrutiny for being sited in a flood-prone area.
The pro-housing lobbying group Let’s Build Homes praised Scott’s order last month. The group’s executive chair, Miro Weinberger, said in a text message on Wednesday that the group would not comment on the procedural and legal objections to the order.
“We continue to be appreciative that the Governor is attempting to use the independent authorities he does have to remove barriers to new homes,” Weinberger added.
Asked if the Vermont Natural Resources Council is considering pursuing legal action, Jon Groveman, the organization’s policy and water program director, said the council is giving the agencies a chance to respond and clear up the order’s implications “without having to go to court.” But the council will “consider all our options going forward” after the state responds, he added.
The letter is directed to Julie Moore, secretary of the Vermont Agency of Natural Resources, Kerrick Johnson, commissioner of the Department of Public Service, and Janet Hurley, chair of the Land Use Review Board. In addition to the Vermont Natural Resources Council, it is signed by representatives from the Conservation Law Foundation, the Vermont chapter of the Sierra Club, Vermont Conservation Voters, Vermont Public Interest Research Group and the ACLU of Vermont.

(Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — Attorneys representing plaintiffs in a competency restoration settlement agreement are asking a judge to fine the Oklahoma Mental Health Department $10,000 a day for failing to meet required benchmarks. 
The Oklahoma Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services hasn’t met the required terms of the settlement yet, according to a September report from court-appointed consultants. This included providing consultants with “incomplete and internally conflicting” data, submitting plans missing essential information, and not demonstrating “true urgency” in carrying out the consent decree. 
The consent decree settled a 2023 lawsuit that alleged the Mental Health Department violated the rights of mostly indigent defendants who had been declared incompetent to stand trial by failing to provide timely court-ordered competency restoration treatment. The Legislature approved the settlement in March. 
Attorneys representing the plaintiffs filed a motion in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Oklahoma on Monday. 
Paul DeMuro, an attorney representing the plaintiffs, said it’s been seven months since the consent decree’s entry and four months past the deadline for the agency to have a plan to implement the consent decree’s requirements. 
“It wasn’t like (the consent decree) appeared out of thin air,” DeMuro said. “… What it boils down to is the department is treating this consent decree as if it were merely suggestions, as opposed to a federal court order.”
Hundreds of people are still “suffering” while awaiting treatment in custody, he said. This creates mental health emergencies, risk of physical harm and “ongoing violation of their due process rights,” DeMuro said. 
The plaintiffs’ request includes asking a judge to hold a hearing, impose a fine of $10,000 a day until an approved plan is implemented by the Mental Health Department, and ordering the agency to have one representative responsible for overseeing compliance. 
“Nothing motivates more than money,” DeMuro said. “So the fine is intended to motivate the department to get a plan together.”
The agency representative would offer “institutional knowledge” despite any leadership turnover, he said. Multiple agency heads have already been involved with the consent decree, DeMuro said. 
If ordered by the court, the requested fine would continue until the Mental Health Department develops and implements a plan that complies with the consent decree. 
“When this lawsuit was filed in March 2023, the Class Members were already suffering and in crisis due to unconstitutionally prolonged wait times for restoration services while languishing in county jails,” according to the motion. “More than two and one-half years later, due to Defendants’ willful failure to develop and implement the Court-ordered Plan, Class Members’ suffering persists with no relief in sight.”
The settlement is expected to cost between $26 million and $45 million over three to five years, depending on the agency’s ability to provide competency restoration services on a set timeline, as required. 
The Mental Health Department requested $17 million from the Legislature for next budget year to implement the consent decree and to cover any related fines for noncompliance. 
A spokesperson for the Mental Health Department did not immediately return a request for comment.

Stanley Dunlap/Georgia RecorderA woman who says she developed a medical condition after using a common hair product can continue legal action against the manufacturers after a decision from the Georgia Supreme Court released Wednesday.
The justices did not rule on the specifics of the woman’s case, but their decision could impact Georgians who say they have been harmed by prolonged exposure to many types of product.
Kiara Burroughs told the court she started using chemical hair relaxer products, which help straighten naturally curly hair, around 1995, including products manufactured by Strength of Nature and L’Oreal. She said she used them regularly between 1995 and 2001 and from 2002 to 2014.
In 2018, Burroughs was diagnosed with uterine fibroids, which are common, non-cancerous growths on the uterus. According to the Mayo Clinic, many women develop uterine fibroids but never know it because they usually cause no symptoms. In some cases, however, the growths can lead to serious pain or cause menstrual or urinary problems.
Burroughs filed suit against Strength of Nature and L’Oreal in October of 2022 after reading a study published that month finding a possible link between hair straightening products and uterine cancer.
The companies moved to dismiss the lawsuit because Burroughs’ first purchase of the products fell outside Georgia’s 10-year statute of repose, which says that legal action can’t be brought “after ten years from the date of the first sale for use or consumption of the personal property causing or otherwise bringing about the injury,” according to Georgia code.
Burroughs’ attorneys said her lawsuit is valid because she bought some of the hair relaxer within the 10-year window.
The Georgia Court of Appeals sided with the companies, agreeing that because she first bought the products as early as 1995, that earlier purchase set the “first sale” timer.
But the justices rejected that argument, finding that the phrase “first sale” in the state law refers to the retail sale to a user as opposed to any future resale.
“If that is what ‘first’ does in this provision—and it is—then there is no room for the manufacturers’ view that the word ‘first’ in this provision specifies which sale in a chain of sales to the same end user starts the statute of repose for the entire chain,” wrote Justice Andrew Pinson in the unanimous opinion. “That word cannot simultaneously carry a second, entirely different meaning and purpose, like a linguistic chameleon that changes its meaning and purpose on the fly depending on the facts of the case.”
The justices sought to keep the opinion narrow, noting that a plaintiff like Burroughs has the ultimate burden of proof that the units sold within the 10-year window were the cause of their injury – and they said that may prove difficult if a significant portion of the units were used outside the repose period.
In a concurring opinion written by Justice Charlie Bethel and joined by Chief Justice Nels Peterson and Justices John Ellington, Shawn Ellen LaGrua and Benjamin Land, Bethel emphasized that the court did not address the question of whether a claim could succeed if it relies in part on a theory that a plaintiff’s injuries were produced by a combined effect that includes products purchased both inside and outside the 10-year window.
Attorney Elizabeth Stone, part of the team representing Burroughs, celebrated the win and said the team looks forward to the discovery phase of the trial, “which will allow us to determine what the manufacturers knew about the potential health effects of their hair relaxer products on the consumers to whom the products were being marketed,” she said in an email.
“We look forward to continuing to pursue this litigation on behalf of Ms. Burroughs,” she added.
Stone said the opinion will set a precedent affecting any type of product liability claim brought about in Georgia, which could be significant for consumers looking to sue for injuries caused over a prolonged period.
“And we are certainly glad the Court has clarified that; given that we live in a time when science can identify dangerous products in more exacting fashion than in the past, the governing Georgia statute certainly needed some clarification,” she said.
Attorneys for Strength of Nature Global and L’Oreal USA responded to requests for comment with a statement they attributed to L’Oreal:
“We are disappointed by today’s ruling. However, this ruling only pertains to a procedural matter and we are pleased the Georgia Supreme Court made clear its decision does not relate to the cause of Plaintiffs’ alleged injuries. L’Oreal USA strictly follows all regulations in every market in which it operates, and its products are always subject to a rigorous scientific evaluation of their safety. The health and wellbeing of all our consumers are of utmost importance to us. We are confident in the safety of SoftSheen-Carson’s (a division of L’Oreal that markets hair care and beauty products designed for people of color) products and believe the allegations made in these lawsuits will be proven to have neither legal nor scientific merit.”

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-10-15 20:59:19+00:00,CT Mirror,CT finalizing plan to blunt funding cuts amid government shutdown,Keith M. Phaneuf,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/10/15/ct-special-session-funding-cuts/,CT legislators are planning a Nov. 12-13 special session to OK using up to $500 million to blunt federal cutbacks to human service programs.,"Gov. Ned Lamont and Democratic legislative leaders have nearly wrapped plans to use part of last fiscal year’s historic state budget surplus to blunt federal cutbacks to vital human service programs.
The two sides won’t use more than $500 million from last fiscal year’s $2.5 billion surplus — the second-largest year-end cushion in state history — for a response fund, House Speaker Matt Ritter, D-Hartford, and Senate President Pro Tem Martin M. Looney, D-New Haven, said Wednesday.
But the two sides still haven’t settled on an amount, nor have they specified how and when funds might be disbursed to bolster certain programs.
Still, both Ritter and Looney said they expect the General Assembly to be called into special session Nov. 12 and 13 to approve a response fund.
“This fund is meant as a bridge,” Ritter told the Connecticut Mirror on Wednesday. “It’s a short-term fund that’s meant to address more immediate things” that may crop up between now and adoption of the next state budget in early May 2026.
Most of the big cutbacks in federal aid that President Donald Trump and Congress ordered last July won’t take effect until late 2026 or later, leaving Lamont and the General Assembly more time to plan a response.
But the partial federal government shutdown triggered Oct. 1 by congressional gridlock has created a host of short-term threats.
The Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children — commonly known as WIC — already is out of money. Connecticut, which administers the federal program here, is fronting the $6 million needed monthly to maintain aid to about 52,000 infants, older children and women.
The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, commonly known as SNAP, which provides about $72 million in nutrition assistance to more than 391,000 Connecticut residents monthly, runs out of reserves in early November, according to the Lamont administration.
The same is true for the state’s winter heating assistance program, which is funded chiefly with federal Low Income Household Energy Assistance Program grants. The Lamont administration projects more than 100,375 households will need heating assistance this winter, up more than 12% from one year ago.
And the governor’s social services commissioner, Andrea Barton Reeves, said if the federal shutdown lasts until March, it likely would impact Medicaid, a massive program that pumped almost $7 billion in federal funding last year into nursing homes, at-home care services, hospitals, federally qualified health clinics and health insurance for low-income households in Connecticut.
Federal block grants that Connecticut uses to support community action agencies — regional nonprofits that link vulnerable households with housing, energy, employment, child care and other human services — also face a funding crunch in early 2026.
“I think that we are fortunate to have a response fund,” Looney said. “Many other states are facing the same cuts and crises but without the capacity” to temper those reductions.
The $2.5 billion surplus Connecticut generated in the fiscal year that closed June 30 represents 11% of the General Fund. Given that just one-quarter of the state budget involves discretionary funding, leaving 11% unspent is huge.
Since the General Assembly established an aggressive series of budget caps in 2017, Connecticut has generated an annual average surplus of $1.8 billion, or more than 8%.
State officials have used these surpluses to build reserves and shrink pension debt, though many concede that effort has taken a toll on education, health care, municipal aid and other core programs.
Looney also noted that even if $500 million from the last surplus is deposited in a response fund, there is plenty available to meet other needs.
Officials estimate about $220 million from that surplus would be added to the $4.1 billion already in Connecticut’s rainy day fund. This deposit would ensure the rainy day fund remains equal to 18% of annual operating costs, the maximum allowed by current law.
Another $300 million would be used, as Lamont and lawmakers agreed last spring, to launch a new effort to dramatically expand affordable child care services.
The remaining $1.5 billion would be used to further shrink pension debt, which entered last fiscal year at about $35 billion.
State Treasurer Erick Russell said Wednesday he remains confident that Wall Street credit rating agencies would not object to this plan for allocating state budget surplus.
“I think this is consistent with the work we have done and the track record of fiscal responsibility,” the Democratic treasurer said, adding it is prudent to protect programs against “the chaos, uncertainty and cruelty that’s coming out of Washington.”
Last spring, when Trump and the GOP-controlled Congress began planning big cutbacks in federal aid to states, majority Democrats in the General Assembly first proposed redirecting a portion of these big surpluses to supplant lost assistance and mitigate the deepest federal cuts.
Connecticut officials specifically planned two lines of defense: one for the short-term and another for down the road.
Next month’s special session would set aside funds to shore up holes in key programs during the fall and winter — whether caused by federal cuts or the government shutdown.
The long-term response is partially in place. State lawmakers modified one budget cap last spring, moving $600 million from the must-save category back into the General Fund for use in future years. But legislators still may need to modify another cap before those dollars can be used, and that’s unlikely to occur before the next state budget is adopted in May 2026.
Lamont’s budget spokesman, Chris Collibee, confirmed Wednesday only that the administration and Democratic legislative leaders continue to talk about a response fund.
“Nothing has been finalized at this time,” he said.
House Minority Leader Vincent J. Candelora, R-North Branford, criticized the response fund. Connecticut should be following Washington’s example, he said, and seeking first to tighten its own spending before tapping state reserves to bolster federal programs.
“The Democrats [in Connecticut] have become very unprincipled,” Candelora said, adding that if the economy slips into recession this winter, as some economists predict, the state budget surpluses that legislators are counting on could vanish quickly. 
“The legislature and the governor have already forgotten what happens when the economy goes south,” he said.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/IMG_6839-2-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-10-15 17:02:58.904641

The five-year legal battle over Idaho’s transgender athletics ban will continue, in at least one federal court.
On Tuesday, Chief U.S. District Court Judge David Nye kept the case alive in Idaho federal court, while a U.S. Supreme Court appeal is in limbo.
Lindsay Hecox, a Boise State University transgender student, has fought Idaho’s transgender athletics law since its passage in 2020. But Hecox has asked the Idaho federal court and the U.S. Supreme Court to drop her case. Hecox says she is focusing on graduating from college and no longer plans to play in women’s sports at Boise State.
The Supreme Court has not acted on Hecox’s request.
And while Nye said he was conflicted on the matter — and reluctant to force Hecox to continue a case she no longer wants to pursue — he says the state and the public have a vested interest in seeing the case through to a ruling.
“The state of Idaho has defended this case vigorously for years,” Nye wrote. “It would be fundamentally unfair to abandon the issue now on the eve of a final resolution.”
Attorney General Raúl Labrador hailed the ruling.
“This decision keeps our lawsuit alive, and I won’t stop until women and girls are safe to compete, participate, and excel in competitive sports,” Labrador said in a Wednesday news release.
Idaho’s first-in-the-nation law bans transgender athletes from competing in women’s and girls’ sports. The law is on hold; the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit has blocked it from going into effect.
Idaho has appealed the Circuit Court ruling, and in July, the Supreme Court agreed to hear the case.
If the Supreme Court indeed hears the case, rejecting Hecox’s motion to drop it, oral arguments are likely in January, Labrador’s office said Wednesday.

(Photo by Jane Norman/States Newsroom)During arguments in a Louisiana case, U.S. Supreme Court justices seemed open to limiting the consideration of race in the redistricting process, a move that would undermine a key provision of the Voting Rights Act. 
Conservative justices, who make up the court’s majority, seemed sympathetic to arguments made by Louisiana Solicitor General Benjamin Aguiñaga and President Donald Trump’s administration. They argued the consideration of race in the redistricting process violates Constitutional requirements that people are treated equally regardless of race. 
The case in question, Callais v. Louisiana, challenges the legality of a second majority-Black congressional district Republicans state lawmakers drew in 2024 in response to a federal court finding a 2022 version of the state’s congressional maps was unconstitutional. Louisiana has six seats in the U.S. House of Representatives, but just one favored a Black candidate before the redistricting process in a state where nearly a third of the population is Black.
How we got here: Louisiana’s redistricting case puts the Voting Rights Act on trial 

The case has since been shaped into a test of Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, a landmark federal law that prohibits racial discrimination in elections. Section 2 prohibits voting laws or procedures that purposefully discriminate on the basis of race, color or membership in a language minority group.
The outcome of the case could have nationwide implications, as it could determine the degree to which race can be considered when drawing election maps after each decennial census. 
The Callais case is also notable because justices were originally supposed to rule on the case earlier this year. But in a rare move, they punted a decision to their next term. 
They also posed new questions for parties to answer: Did the Louisiana Legislature’s creation of a second majority-Black district violate the 14th or 15th amendments to the U.S. Constitution? 
​The 14th Amendment, in part, covers representation in Congress, and the 15th Amendment prevents citizens from being denied the right to vote based on their race.   
The case is being carefully watched, as any ruling that cuts back on Section 2 would likely lead to states redrawing their congressional maps to eliminate majority minority districts.
Fair Fight Action, a progressive voting rights organization, predicts that if the Supreme Court sides with conservatives and hollows out Section 2, states could redraw up to 19 majority Black districts to make them competitive or safe seats for Republicans.
Though Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill originally defended the map challenged by Callais, her short-lived alliance with Black voters ended in September when Republicans and groups supporting Black voters filed opposing briefs. 
Attorneys representing the state, the Trump administration and the white voter plaintiffs in Callais argued the framework for proving a Section 2 violation should be modified. The so-called Gingles test, which arose from a 1986 Supreme Court ruling, set the standards for determining whether election districts meet federal standards. 




The Gingles test
Created by the U.S. Supreme Court in the 1986 case Thornburg v. Gingles, plaintiffs must show the existence of three preconditions to prove racial vote dilution:

The racial or language minority group “sufficiently large and geographically compact to constitute a majority in a single-member district”
The minority group is politically cohesive
The majority votes sufficiently as a block to usually defeat the minority’s candidate of choice





Chief Justice John Roberts and Associate Justice Brett Kavanaugh voted to uphold the constitutionality of Section 2 just two years ago in Allen v. Milligan, an Alabama case that required the addition of a majority-Black congressional district. Both asked questions during Callais arguments, indicating their openness to revisiting the recent precedent. 
“This court’s cases in a variety of contexts have said that race-based remedies are permissible for a period of time, sometimes for a long period of time, decades, in some cases,” Kavanaugh said, “but that they should not be indefinite and should have an end point.” 
Voting rights advocates note that the Gingles test provides a time limit unique to each situation. 
“Section 2, by itself, automatically sunsets as conditions on the ground get better,” Michael Li, senior counsel for the Brennan Center for Justice, a progressive organization that follows redistricting issues throughout the country, said in an interview earlier this year. 
Kavanaugh also seemed sympathetic to U.S. Solicitor General John Sauer’s proposal that plaintiffs seeking judicial relief from a violation of Section 2 should be required to take a state’s political motivations into consideration when offering alternative districts. For example, this could include drawing a district to not just keep an incumbent in their district but to ensure the incumbent’s victory. 
“That suggestion would swallow Section 2 whole,” NAACP Legal Defense Fund attorney Janai Nelson said. “Party cannot trump the responsibility of states to ensure that all voters have an equally open electoral process.” 
Nelson, representing Black voters, argued the Voting Rights Act is the sole reason there is Black representation in Louisiana. 
Until the Voting Rights Act was enacted, many promises of Reconstruction-era amendments to the Constitution were largely unfulfilled as Black voters were suppressed under racially oppressive Jim Crow laws. 
“[Section 2] is an intervention that has been crucial to diversifying leadership and providing an ability of minority voters to have an equal opportunity to participate in the process,” Nelson said. “But it also isn’t a permanent remedy. It corrects itself over time, and it’s only triggered when those extreme conditions exist.” 
Liberal justices on the court sharply questioned Aguiñaga and U.S. Principal Deputy Solicitor General Hashim Mooppan about their proposed changes to the Gingles framework. 
“The bottom line is, just get rid of Section 2,” Justice Sonia Sotomayor said of the pair’s arguments. 
Though conservatives advocate for an end to race-conscious redistricting under Section 2, Aguiñaga said other applications for the statute are “fair game.” Most Section 2 cases are about discrimination at the local government level, primarily challenges to at-large districts that critics say dilute minority voting strength.

Black voters react
As oral arguments were underway, hundreds gathered outside the court. Nearly two dozen advocacy organizations, including the NAACP, the League of Women Voters and the National Urban League, led a “Fight for Fair Maps” rally.
The Rev. Shavon Arline-Bradley, president and CEO of the National Council of Negro Women, told the crowd that as a descendent of slaves in Florida and South Carolina, “I come with blood of resilience in my veins.”
“Every time you face opposition, just look at it and say, ‘No weapon against us shall prosper.’ Section 2 will be intact after they do their work inside that Supreme Court,” Arline-Bradley said. “And I stand on my 10 toes, ready to fight until justice is won.”
Fletcher Johnson of Baltimore stood among the rallygoers and said he’s concerned about voter suppression in next year’s congressional midterm election.
“We’re losing the country really fast, and we got to fight for every inch of it,” Johnson, 68, said. “So this, this decision here, is going to be critical to our voting rights, and they’re trying to dismantle everything that we’ve worked for.” 
Potential outcomes
There is no set date for when justices will rule on Callais, but it is likely to be next spring before the end of June. 
Justices could uphold Louisiana’s challenged 6th Congressional District, which Rep. Cleo Fields, D-Baton Rouge, currently holds. This outcome would lead to few or no changes nationally. 
If justices overturn Fields’ district and remand the case to the state without addressing the constitutional questions, Louisiana would be required to adopt a new map that maintains two majority Black districts. State lawmakers would likely have to do so by picking a map preferred by Black voters, likely one with a district anchored in Northeast Louisiana that complies with more traditional redistricting principles than the one Republicans chose last year. 
This would also likely allow Fields to keep his seat. 
Or justices could overturn Fields’ district and set new precedent scaling back Section 2. That could give Republicans in Louisiana the opportunity to draw a map with one or even no majority Black districts, giving Republicans an opportunity to win Fields’ seat and the 2nd Congressional District, currently held by U.S. Rep. Troy Carter, D-New Orleans. 
“For decades, the court’s conservative majority has chipped away at this landmark civil rights law,” Carter said at a news conference after the arguments. “Now section two, which prohibits voting practices that discriminate based on race, is on the chopping block.”
“If struck down, Louisiana could lose its two majority Black congressional districts, silencing Black voters,” Carter added. 
With the Trump administration leaning on states to carve out extra seats ahead of the 2026 midterms, other Republican-controlled states with majority minority districts could follow suit. 
In anticipation of the ruling, the Louisiana Legislature is considering a special session in the coming weeks to push back the qualification deadline for next year’s congressional elections. Doing so would give lawmakers enough time next year to adopt a new redistricting plan. 
In August, Gov. Landry directed lawmakers to set aside dates for another redistricting special session, but legislative leaders expressed reluctance to do so before justices made a decision in the Callais case.
Whether a decision will come in time to influence midterm election results will vary by state.

(Lance Cheung/USDA)TOPEKA — The federal government shutdown could mean Kansans who rely on food assistance will miss a November payment, and the state is working to determine options should that occur. The possibility troubles a Kansas City-area social services leader who said resources are already stretched to the breaking point. 
The U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food and Nutrition Services notified regional offices Friday that Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Funds may not go through in November if the federal government doesn’t reopen. 
“As stated in our lapse of appropriation correspondence dated October 1, 2025, SNAP has funding available for benefits and operations through the month of October. However, if the current lapse in appropriations continues, there will be insufficient funds to pay full November SNAP benefits for approximately 42 million individuals across the Nation,” said a letter signed by Ronald Ward, acting associate administrator of the SNAP program at USDA.
In May 2025, 186,000 Kansans received SNAP benefits, at a cost of nearly $33 million, according to USDA data.
“The fact that many folks possibly may not receive benefits next month is really scary,” said Susila Jones, executive director of Cross-lines Community Outreach, Kansas City, Kansas. “Food insecurity is already at an all-time high in our area. It’s a concern for folks who already come to our pantry, and I’m assuming there will be a lot of people who have not needed to rely on pantries that may need them.”
Cross-Lines offers food and housing assistance in Wyandotte County, including operating a food kitchen and food pantry, where Kansans can receive food based on the size of their families, Jones said.
When the federal government shut down in 2019, many SNAP recipients experienced a long delay between payment of their monthly benefits before the shutdown was resolved, according to the federal Center for Budget and Policy Priorities.
The state received the notice and is evaluating what could be done for Kansas SNAP recipients, Erin La Row, spokeswoman for Kansas Department for Families and Children, said Wednesday. 
Jones said escalating inflation has caused most food pantries in the Kansas City area to struggle to keep food on their shelves. 
“Over the past year, but especially since the first of the year, we have seen an increase in need,” she said. “We can’t even keep up with it. We can only serve 100 people a day, and we meet that almost every day already.”
In the letter to SNAP regional directors, Ward said his agency is working to gather information to create contingency plans if needed. However, Ward said states that normally would be preparing their electronic transfer files to send out November payments are directed to hold those payments. 
On Sept. 30, the National WIC Association raised concerns that SNAP’s Women, Infant and Children program had only enough funds to make payments for a short time following the shutdown. 
“Every day of inaction brings us closer to a crisis,” said Georgia Machell, president and CEO of the National WIC Association. “Failure to rapidly reopen the government could result in State WIC directors being put in the horrible position of trying to manage their programs with insufficient funds.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/snapmarket-1024x680.jpg,,,2025-10-15 17:02:58.904641

The state elections official said fraudulent messages were reported in Franklin, Johnson, and Madison counties. According to a news release, the mass texts from “an individual or group” are impersonating public officials and candidates and include the message, “I’m listening to residents about what matters most in our community. What issues do you think should be our top priority? Reply with your thoughts or text STOP to opt out.”
Pate said the Secretary of State’s office has confirmed the messages are not authentic. He called for Iowans who have received the messages to immediately report them to his office, as well as local law enforcement and their local county auditor’s office, and to “remain vigilant about messages claiming to be from officials or candidates.”

“With the continued rise of election-related misinformation, we remind Iowans to always verify information through trusted sources: the Iowa Secretary of State’s Office or your local county auditor,” Pate said.
The news release noted there were many legitimate outreach campaigns for candidates competing in the approaching Nov. 4 city and school elections. Early and absentee voting in local elections began Wednesday.
However, the secretary of state’s office stated legitimate candidates and pollsters will not ask for sensitive information from voters. Additionally, the office recommended verifying the legitimacy of any links to donation sites sent through texts.
“We urge Iowans not to provide sensitive information over text, and if making plans to donate, to navigate separately to the candidate’s official donation channels,” Pate said. “If Iowans have any questions, we encourage them to turn to trusted sources of information and reach out directly to campaigns to validate any outreach.”

At a meeting this week, the embattled head of the agency repeatedly argued NorthWestern Energy hasn’t provided as much information to regulators as it should, especially about its new methane-fired plant in Laurel.
Molnar also said the PSC should examine a couple of aspects of the rate case to ensure customers don’t get saddled with costs they shouldn’t bear.
In June, the PSC held a hearing on the rate case, which was controversial. First, customers recall the PSC already approved a NorthWestern Energy settlement in October 2023 that increased rates 28% compared to the previous August.
The case also includes a question about who should pay for the new plant in Laurel, estimated to cost $320 million in August 2024. The utility built the plant without preapproval by the Public Service Commission.
NorthWestern officials have argued the plant benefits customers, and the utility should recover costs from them.
However, energy watchdogs have said the company built the plant without regard to affordability for ratepayers or emissions, and the Montana Consumer Counsel said NorthWestern wants nearly $50 million from customers to pay for its own cost overruns.
At the meeting Tuesday, a PSC staff member confirmed staff were working on an analysis in the rate case, and it could include a recommendation similar to the one Molnar had made, but the report was still in the works.
The complex case included settlements NorthWestern negotiated with some parties, such as a coalition of large businesses, but not all of them.
For example, the Montana Environmental Information Center and Natural Resources Defense Council are among the parties that argued NorthWestern isn’t taking costs related to climate into consideration.
At the meeting this week, Molnar said he wanted to reject the negotiated settlements because the deals hide information from the public, and he wants a full accounting of costs related to the new plant in Laurel and old coal-fired plant at Colstrip.
But Commissioners Annie Bukacek and Jennifer Fielder pushed back against Molnar’s argument that the PSC needed to take action at that time.
Fielder said the Yellowstone County Generating Station, or the Laurel plant, largely wasn’t associated with a settlement.
Fielder also said the commission needed more information from Molnar to properly consider his idea, especially given the fact it had held eight days of hearings on the rate case this summer.
At one point, Fielder waved a piece of paper at him and said Molnar had provided a request on a single sheet “with nothing to substantiate it.”
“If we’re going to make a decision this big, we need to have some basis for it, besides what you just discussed in the microphone here today on the spot,” Fielder said.
Bukacek agreed it was important to receive information in writing.
She said some of the comments Molnar made at the meeting didn’t mesh with her recollection of the hearing, but Molnar accused her of delay.
He said he wanted the commission to reject “black box” settlements where the Public Service Commission doesn’t have complete information and other stakeholders and the public remain in the dark.
He said many questions about the plant went unanswered during the lengthy hearing in June, and the commissioners have a responsibility to dig into the true costs of energy.
“We’re paid big boy wages. It’s time to do a big boy job, and that means you study enough to ask good questions,” Molnar said.
Commissioner Bukacek, though, said some information that is part of settlements is legitimately confidential, such as potential compromises among parties or proprietary models, and a PSC staff member agreed.
Bukacek moved to defer the proposal from Molnar, but of the five commissioners, only she and Fielder supported it, and it failed.
Molnar then moved to reject NorthWestern’s partial settlement on the rate case and direct staff to schedule a hearing on the Yellowstone County Generating Station and Colstrip.
It drew support only from Commissioner Randy Pinocci and also failed, leaving the rate case pending.
A PSC staff member said the staff recommendation on the case is expected to be brought to commissioners by the middle of November, and the commission can take action before the end of the year.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG-0026-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-10-15 17:02:58.904641

University of Vermont Medical Center’s Steve Leffler is promoting a “course correction” as he takes over from former UVM Health network leader Sunny Eappen.

Steve Leffler, the president of UVM Medical Center, officially took the reins Wednesday as the new head of the rebranded UVM Health network. The new leadership signals a new vision for the hospital network, he and its board leadership say — one that emphasizes the hospitals’ work over the network’s.
Sunny Eappen’s resignation as the president and CEO at the network came the same week in mid-September that the state’s main health care regulator, the Green Mountain Care Board, set restrictive budget conditions on UVM Medical Center and its sibling hospitals. Still, Tom Golonka, chair of the network’s board of trustees, said he was surprised by Eappen’s decision to leave.
As he was getting ready for a joint board meeting to discuss the issues that the care board raised during hearings about the network hospitals’ budgets, Golonka received a call from Eappen informing him of his decision, he said.

“The board didn’t have a chance to talk about it, we had a meeting scheduled the next week,” Golonka said. “This wasn’t any type of force. We were completely prepared to support him for a period.” 
At the Sept. 12 meeting of the Green Mountain Care Board, chair Owen Foster laid into the network, which includes the UVM Medical Center in Burlington, Central Vermont Medical Center in Berlin, Porter Medical Center in Middlebury, three hospitals in eastern New York state, and a home health and hospice care provider. Foster outlined what he called a “corporate shell game” of funds moving from the Medical Center’s reserves to the network and its New York hospitals. 
The regulator’s chair also raised concerns about the high executive compensation and the widening gap between what the network’s leadership made each year and what its lowest paid employees earned — in 2024, 19 executives brought home a collective $3 million in bonuses alone.
Foster called the network both “physically and spiritually distant” from the needs of Vermonters and of the UVM Medical Center. 
“That was hard to hear,” Leffler told VTDigger in an Oct. 10 interview. “It became clear that the vision needed to evolve and change a little bit.”
Eappen took that message to heart, both Leffler and Golonka said. 
“After some really thoughtful reflection with the network board, [he] agreed that it’d be better to take a shift and for him to step away,” Leffler said. 
Sunny believed that his stepping down was the best thing for him to do for the sake of the organization, Golonka said. “I really applaud him for his leadership,” he added. “It takes a really strong leader to be able to say that, and to envision a future that doesn’t include him.”
Course correction 
The future that Leffler foresees will be network-lite, with more emphasis on allowing for the autonomy of its hospitals.  
“It’s not going to be top down from the network. The network’s kind of in the background,” he said. “It’s not the center of the solar system. It’s kind of on the outer fringes,” Leffler explained. 
“Now we are going to do a bit of course correction,” he added. “It’s a subtle shift, but it’s a giant shift at the same time.” 
Already, the network has rebranded, with a new website and logos reading University of Vermont Health, dropping “network” from its name.  
The new name echoes the labels used by Dartmouth Health — a network of six hospitals across New Hampshire and southern Vermont that includes a large academic medical center. It’s a model with more hospital autonomy that Leffler said he is looking to mirror.  He described a structure where hospitals and staff on the floor lead decisions and drive change by working primarily with their own boards. 
“I’m a big believer in [saying] the people close to the care know what’s best and know what needs to be done,” Leffler said. “If the network board is going to hear about six different hospitals, then how much time can you spend on any one issue?”
Previously, though, the network had answered that question by taking a heavier hand in management and governance, in the name of efficiency. 
Originally, each hospital board hired and fired its own presidents, and they approved their own budgets that then the network staff and board would review and approve, explained UVM Medical Center Board Chair Jesse Bridges. 
But as the network started to consolidate systems like their electronic medical records and human resources around 2022, the process quickly grew laborious and long. “It was process for the sake of process,” Bridges said. 
Those adjustments resulted in the current streamlined system, where the network board makes the final fiduciary decisions, with input and recommendations from the partner boards.
“Before, there wasn’t coordination or control,” Golonka, the network board chair, described. “We were not rowing in the same direction.” 
The challenge now is figuring out a governance structure that keeps all the boats moving in the same direction, while also letting each row on its own. To find that, “everything can be on the table,” Golonka said. 
Though the rhetoric and governance around the network may be changing, it’s clear that the network structure of the hospital group is not. Leffler and both board chairs voiced a strong belief in the efficiencies that can come from the larger structure, for things like buying materials in bulk or streamlining HR processes and medical records. 
Increasing quality 
At the top of Leffler’s to-do list in the new role will be improving quality of care. 
The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services assigns hospitals quality ratings, and the network hospitals’ numbers have dropped since 2022. Leffler is set on earning back UVM’s stars. 
“At the very first meeting, we’re getting every quality scorecard from 2025 that we have, and we’re going to go over them. We’re going to make a commitment, all of us, every hospital, every clinic, every office, how we’re going to improve them over (20)26,” he said. 
To do so, he wants those on the floor to lead the way, rather than having the network institute top-down changes. 
Improvements to safety for patients and staff, increased access for rural patients, and improved affordability all fall on Leffler’s wishlist of what to address in his new role, he said. UVM Medical Center, where Leffler will remain in charge, is set to continue to play a key role.
“If we’re not playing the right role in all of those areas (of affordability and access), because we’re the biggest, everyone is going to be pointing at us saying, ‘You’re not doing your part,’ ” said Bridges, the medical center’s board chair. 
Bridges cited the network’s recent partnership with Dartmouth Health on kidney transplant surgery. After UVM Medical Center averaged about 12 surgeries a year, it simply wasn’t cost effective to continue offering that care, as a state-commissioned consultant’s report on health care costs found. The partnership with Dartmouth allows patients to do pre- and post- surgery care in Burlington despite having surgery in the New Hampshire hospital.
“Access might have to look different in order to get at affordability and quality,” Bridges said, adding that it will require the network to look within its own system while also thinking on broader scales of partnerships at the state and regional levels. 
Born and raised
Eappen joined the network in 2022 as it was still navigating the fallout of the Covid-19 pandemic. He came to Vermont after working as an administrator for 14 years at Brigham & Women’s Hospital in Boston. Under his leadership, the network saw more integration of processes and began to operate as an interlocking system, rather than a collection of affiliated hospitals, Leffler and Golonka both echoed. 
Eappen took over after John Brumstead had led the hospital system for over a decade. Brumstead created the network, overseeing the initial effort to join UVM Medical Center with Central Vermont Medical Center, in 2011. The partnership grew to encompass six hospitals in the ensuing six years, taking the name University of Vermont Health Network in 2014.
“At the time Sunny was just the right guy to transition from John Brumstead, who was this kind of Vermont icon,” said Betsy Vicencio, the network board’s vice chair.
“Sunny just had a different way of trying to invite change and trying to invite new relationships. Clearly some were really successful and some that were maybe less than successful,” she said. “Vermont and New York, we don’t necessarily do different as well as other places. We have some cultural limits that are hard.”
Though Vicencio said she does not think Eappen himself focused or worried about being from outside Vermont, she does suspect that his Boston background contributed to some of the external pressures that ultimately led to his departure. 
“It is absolutely within the cultural ethos of upstate New York and Vermont to not be as welcoming to people that are not born and raised here,” she said. 
With Leffler, the network is returning to homegrown leadership. 
He grew up in Leicester, Vt., where his parents owned a general store, he said. He completed medical school at the University of Vermont, before returning to the emergency department as a young doctor in 1993. He led the emergency department from 2006 to 2011, worked as the hospital’s chief medical officer, and then became the president of the medical center in 2020. 
“I really care about this region. I care about the medical center. It’s my home. I care about the care that we deliver to my friends, my family, my kids and my grandkids,” Leffler said. 
“Steve is Vermont’s beloved son, and he is Vermont’s beloved emergency room doc,” Vicencio said. “He is rural health care at its finest. He lives and breathes and has grown up in all of the things that are foundational to rural health care.” 
She recalled first meeting Leffler at a trustee event when he first stepped into a leadership role nearly 10 years ago. She began asking him about how the hospital could possibly bring down health care costs and watched Leffler light up with ideas: “He was super energized, and he had a vision back then.” 
“I think that he’s going to come in with this kind of refreshed view of making those particular pieces not just rhetoric, but real,” Vicencio said. 
Bridges, of the medical center board, echoed that: “Even though [Leffler] has been here, it’s not going to be more of the same. It’s actually, I think, a fairly substantial change on the horizon.” 
As part of his board chair role, Bridges does rounds through the hospital with Leffler every month. Through that, he’s come to know Leffler as an “honest broker” and eager listener, he said, having watched Leffler pay considerate attention to any patient or provider who approached him. 
“I think part of what makes Steve successful is his willingness to listen, be humble, admit maybe when he said something has come out the wrong way,” Bridges said.

The ISU Presidential Search Committee will spend two days next week interviewing semifinalists for the university’s presidency before announcing finalists and inviting them to campus for further interviews and open forums.
Each of the candidates, identified by numbers to keep their identities confidential until finalists are announced, were selected by the committee from a pool of 78 people, according to an announcement from ISU. The committee spent nearly four hours in closed session in early October to go through the applications.

With ISU President Wendy Wintersteen set to retire in January, the presidential search committee this summer set a timeline to find her successor that was described as “very, very, very tight” by AGB Search Managing Principal Rodrick McDavis during the committee’s first meeting.
Semifinalist interviews will be conducted virtually on Oct. 21-22, according to an agenda for the meetings, and the number of selected finalists will be announced following their conclusion.
Committee chair and ISU Faculty Senate President Meghan Gillette said during the board’s Oct. 6 meeting finalists’ names will be released the day before they come to campus. On-campus interviews will take place in the first week of November.
Once they make it to Ames, Gillette said finalists will meet with “selected members of the campus community” and host a forum that will be open to the public and livestreamed for those who can’t come in person.
“On Nov. 11, the board of regents will review each finalist in closed session, and late that day make their selection for the next president of Iowa State University,” Gillette said.
Qualities the committee has decided they’re looking for in a potential ISU president include the ability to connect to and converse with people from all areas of campus and community, experiences and understanding of higher education and challenges the sector currently faces, and knowledge of budgeting, fundraising and other financial aspects of university leadership.
The best candidates must also be able to look ahead and craft a vision for the future of ISU that will help it navigate change and thrive, the committee decided.

(Photo by Christopher Shea/Rhode Island Current)A federal Rhode Island judge who struck down a Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) directive withholding disaster aid from states that defy President Donald Trump’s immigration policies says the Trump administration is violating his order.
U.S. District Court Judge William E. Smith in September ruled that the Department of Homeland Security directive making enforcement of Trump’s immigration agenda a condition for receiving federal disaster relief grants was unconstitutional and harmful to states and their residents.
Yet Smith found the department has continued to attach the condition to FEMA grants as part of a “ham-handed attempt to bully the states into making promises they have no obligation to make” or else risk losing funding already appropriated by Congress.
“In effect, defendants have done precisely what the memorandum and order forbids,” Smith, a George W. Bush appointee, wrote in a ruling Tuesday. 
R.I. federal judge strikes down Trump edict tying federal disaster aid to immigration

A filing by a coalition of 20 Democratic attorneys general that sued the department over the grant conditions in May accused the Trump administration of violating Smith’s order. Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha is co-leading the case, Illinois v. Federal Emergency Management Agency.
The Oct. 8 motion asking Smith to enforce the order noted that states and municipalities in late September received award letters in which FEMA “copy-pasted the contested conditions” with a clause saying they would only become effective if Smith’s ruling was stayed or overturned.
“Plaintiff States are, as a result, still required to certify, as a condition of obtaining federal funds,” they wrote.
AGs attached letters received by emergency management agencies in California, Colorado and Illinois. The Rhode Island Emergency Management Agency has not received any letters with the immigration language as of Wednesday, spokesperson Courtney Marciano said in an interview.
Smith ordered the Department of Homeland Security to permanently stop enforcing immigration conditions against plaintiff states and that the agency must amend grant awards within seven days to remove language related to complying with federal immigration law.
A Homeland Security spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for inquiry on whether officials intend to comply with the new court order.
The Trump administration argued in an Oct. 10 court filing that it had complied with Smith’s earlier decision and was only seeking to preserve its ability to enforce the immigration-related conditions should the ruling be overturned.
“Cities and states who break the law and prevent us from arresting criminal illegal aliens should not receive federal funding,” Assistant Homeland Security Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement to Rhode Island Current Wednesday. “The Trump Administration is committed to restoring the rule of law. No lawsuit, not this one or any other, is going to stop us from doing that.”
But Smith in his ruling Tuesday said that no matter how confident the Trump administration may be of their chances of appeal, the contested conditions at the moment are unlawful.
“The fig leaf conditional nature of the requirement makes little difference,” Smith wrote.
Neronha commended Smith’s latest ruling against what he called “blatant overreach” by the Trump administration in ignoring the September court order.
“Whether it’s a preliminary injunction, a permanent injunction, or some other enforcement, the courts are holding up,” he said in a statement. “And we will continue fighting for the American people for as long as this administration puts them in harm’s way.”
Besides Rhode Island and Illinois, other states that were part of the lawsuit were California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Washington, Wisconsin and Vermont. The District of Columbia is also part of the case.

Phil Murphy in 2021 ordered closed.,"Gov. Phil Murphy participates in a groundbreaking for a new Edna Mahan Correctional Facility in Chesterfield on Oct. 15, 2025.

(Dana DiFilippo | New Jersey Monitor)New Jersey lawmakers officially kicked off construction of a new 420-bed, $310 million state prison for women Wednesday with a groundbreaking ceremony beside a sprawling, grassy field in Chesterfield, where the troubled Edna Mahan Correctional Facility for Women will relocate.
The new mixed-custody prison will replace a decaying 112-year-old facility in Clinton that Gov. Phil Murphy in 2021 ordered closed after more than a dozen correctional officers were arrested for brutally assaulting incarcerated women during a violent night of forced cell extractions.
The first phase of the project is expected to open in 2027, with construction scheduled to be fully completed in 2028.

Just before officials shoveled dirt Wednesday to mark the coming construction, Murphy alluded to the prison’s longstanding troubles, which include widespread sexual misconduct that prompted federal authorities to intervene and declare oversight.
“For decades, Edna Mahan has stood as a shameful symbol of a deeply flawed status quo,” Murphy said.
Replacing the “woefully outdated” prison will better protect incarcerated women while improving working conditions for officers, he added. And relocating it from the western reaches of Hunterdon County to a 33-acre state plot in centrally located Burlington County will make it more accessible for families who want to visit their incarcerated loved ones, officials said.
“By closing Edna Mahan once and for all, we will save our state’s taxpayers more than $160 million in what would have been much-needed capital projects that would have been the ultimate good-money-after-bad story,” Murphy said. “So today, we’re beginning a new chapter for criminal justice in New Jersey.”
Since the 2021 arrests, state Department of Corrections officials have made changes to ensure a “cultural reformation” too, including requiring officers to wear body cameras and implementing trauma- and gender-informed training, said Victoria Kuhn, the department’s commissioner. The new prison will also have expanded vocational and educational programs, social services, and addiction treatment, officials said.

“When the doors of this new facility open, the foundation for its success will have already been poured with the reforms that we have implemented,” Kuhn said.
The groundbreaking came less than two weeks after a state judge dismissed the criminal indictment of 14 correctional officers arrested in the 2021 beatdown at Edna Mahan. The judge declared the indictment unconstitutionally vague and said a four-year delay in preparing the case for trial constituted “negligence” by prosecutors in the public integrity and accountability office overseen by the state attorney general.
The dismissal prompted complaints that incarcerated women were denied justice and bipartisan calls for an independent investigation and oversight of the office.
But the indictment and its dismissal got nary a peep at Wednesday’s groundbreaking, with Murphy telling reporters after the ceremony that he was “extremely bitter, disappointed, and angry” but otherwise couldn’t comment because the Attorney General’s Office is appealing.
Advocates and Kuhn, though, did talk up legislation now in the Statehouse pipeline that would codify protections for incarcerated women in New Jersey by beefing up oversight, officer training, sexual misconduct safeguards, and rehabilitation and reentry programs and services. Kuhn said she expects the bill will advance after lawmakers return to Trenton in November.
“We want to ensure that all of those protections continue in perpetuity, so that there is never a dialing back to where we were decades ago,” Kuhn told the New Jersey Monitor.
Terry Schuster, the state corrections ombudsperson, seconded support for the bill and called on legislators to act quickly, with the current legislative session set to end and a new governor taking office in January. Republican Jack Ciattarelli, who’s running against Democrat Mikie Sherrill in the race to replace term-limited Murphy, is expected to backtrack some criminal justice reforms implemented during the Murphy and Christie administrations and has often vowed on the campaign trail to “uncuff law enforcement.”

“We don’t know what’s going to happen with the election. We don’t know what’s going to happen with the leadership of the department,” Schuster told the New Jersey Monitor. “We want to make sure that the policy changes that have happened in the last few years really become harder to roll back.”
The new Edna Mahan prison will be a short stroll from the Albert C. Wagner Youth Correctional Facility, an unused prison that closed in 2017, as well as the Garden State Youth Center, which replaced Wagner and now incarcerates about 1,000 young men.
Prison conditions have been a grievance for years for criminal justice reformers, with many lockups in varying stages of disrepair. 
Kuhn and Murphy told reporters Wednesday that updates to other facilities are stalled because of funding.
“With a limited budget, a limited amount of money, you’ve got to prioritize, like anything else in life,” Murphy said. “And I feel very confident and comfortable that this was our top priority. And this is a big day, in that respect.”

(Via Florida Department of Corrections)Sounding as desperate as he ever has since being appointed four years ago, Florida Department of Corrections (FDC) Secretary Ricky Dixon asked a panel of state lawmakers Wednesday for more than $512 million for next fiscal year to maintain the prison system.
“It is a staggering amount of money that we’re asking for. I’m aware of that,” Dixon told the Senate Appropriations Committee on Criminal and Civil Justice. Adding to the scale of the needs, he said that amount did not include funding for salaries of correction officers, which he said rank among the lowest for its size in the country.
“If I continue to do this job, we’re going to have to have the support we need, because we cannot keep going in the direction we’re going in,” he added for emphasis.
Florida houses more than 89,000 inmates in its corrections system, a population that has increased by more than 10,000 since 2021. That is expected to rise by another 4,100 over the next three years.
“We are managing today with relatively the same number of staff we had 10,000 inmates ago, so you can imagine what that’s doing to the staff and inmate ratios,” Dixon said.
The system includes officers as young as 19 with fewer than two weeks’ experience supervising more than 150 inmates in some correction facilities. That’s compared to ratios of one officer to 35 or one officer to 50 inmates in other states, he added.
Starting salaries for Florida correction officers begin at $22 an hour, an annual salary of $45,760. That pales in comparison to nearby Alabama, where legislators two years ago raised the minimum annual salary for correction officer trainees to more than $55,000 at a maximum secure facility (and Dixon said it actually went as high as $73,000).
Funding issues aren’t new
The numbers Dixon cited should have surprised none of the lawmakers on the committee. Many of them served in the Senate a few years ago when a study by the consulting firm KPMG recommended the state immediately appropriate more than $2 billion for immediate repairs and to develop a strategy to modernize the system.
The report added that the full costs of modernizing the state’s prison system would range between $6 billion and nearly $12 billion.
Among some of the specific requests by Dixon is $155 million in operational needs; $60 million in inmate health services; $56.4 million in new housing units; $45 million in drug costs; and $22 million in critical security equipment.
“What this does not include is the pay,” Dixon said, adding that he hopes to “remain competitive” on salaries.
Overtime costs piling up
Reviewing state records showing that the Department of Corrections spent $150 million on overtime last year, Sen. Clay Yarborough, R-Jacksonville, asked Dixon why the state was paying “such a vast amount.”
Dixon cited the addition of approximately 10,000 inmates in recent years.
“They have to live somewhere,” he said. “We have to reopen the dorms that we’re previously closed. We don’t have staffing for those dorms, so we have to pull staffing from one shift to the next and it requires a lot of double shifts to man those dorms. So, that drives that overtime rate up.”
While this Senate committee is focused on funding, not policies, Sen. Rosalind Osgood, D-Fort Lauderdale, mused to Dixon about reducing the state’s inmate population by allowing some elderly prisoners to be released. “Geriatric parole” is legislatively authorized in 24 states around the country, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.
“If I had been in jail 20 to 25 years and I haven’t killed a bunch of people [or] did something horrific, maybe I was just high chasing drugs — I don’t know — but we gotta begin to look at adding some measure of grace for people who we can be comfortable with that they paid a consequence and maybe looking to spend money to transition them back into society in a more cost effective way,” she said.
“I stay in my lane when it comes to who should be in our system and who shouldn’t be,” Dixon replied. “That’s worthy of debate and certainly is debated and should continue to be debated.”
Those debates haven’t taken place in the Florida Legislature, however. One specific measure that would have allowed certain long-time prison sentences to become parole-eligible under certain circumstances introduced in the 2025 legislative session never received a hearing in any committee.

A proposed ordinance sponsored by Mayor Shelley Berkley and Councilwoman Nancy Brune would ban sales in new pet stores and allow existing stores three years to adjust their business model before the ban takes effect.
“With 13 stores, the City of Las Vegas has more stores than 37 states,” Rebecca Goff of Humane World for Animals said at a meeting Monday of the city’s Recommending Committee, which forwards legislation to the council agenda. The item is scheduled for a Nov. 5 hearing before the City Council. 
Goff and former State Sen. Warren Hardy led the unsuccessful legislative effort this year to ban pet sales statewide, which was derailed by lobbyists for the industry. Similar campaigns nationwide are designed to cut off markets to breeders who operate unsanitary and inhumane puppy mills, according to advocates. 
But Alyssa Miller-Hurley, a lobbyist for the Pet Advocacy Network, which opposes the ban on behalf of the pet stores it represents, and opposed the statewide ban, told the committee “these kinds of ordinances do not achieve what they set out to do.” She cited a Los Angeles Times investigation that revealed dogs were being transported to California and sold by middlemen following a statewide ban enacted in 2019.  
Last week, California Gov. Gavin Newsom signed bills designed to close the loopholes identified by the Times investigation. One law bans online sales by brokers, who are defined as individuals or businesses that sell or transport a dog bred by someone else for profit. 
In 2017, the Las Vegas City Council split 4 to 3 when it repealed a 2016 ordinance banning the sale of pets in stores. Under pressure from pet stores and prominent lobbyist Jay Brown, Mayor Carolyn Goodman, Councilwoman Michele Fiore, Councilman Ricki Barlow, and Councilman Steve Seroka voted to repeal. 
The original version of the bill sponsored by Berkley and Brune would have banned pet sales only in new stores, while allowing sales to continue in existing stores – a model embraced by the City of Henderson. 
“There are nearly 800 animals on our campus today at the Animal Foundation,” the organization’s CEO Hilarie Grey told the committee. “With so many animals of every breed, size and age, including puppies and kittens of every breed available for adoption, there’s just no reason for the puppy mill pipeline and sales to continue. People can find the animal of their choice.
The Animal Foundation receives close to $11.5 million a year from Las Vegas, North Las Vegas, and Clark County, and routinely euthanizes animals for lack of space. Last year the shelter put down 2,047 dogs and 1,271 cats, many of them healthy and adoptable. 
Rachel Bergren, the executive director of Heaven Can Wait, a low-cost, high-volume spay and neuter clinic, noted 2028 “seems like a long time away, but we know it will be here soon.” 
Bergren noted that “every day in our spay and neuter clinic, I see the reality of animal overpopulation. Our local shelters, as we’ve heard, are full, and our clinic has a neverending waiting list for spay and neuter, vaccination and microchipping services. We just can’t meet the need. We simply do not have the resources in this city or in this region to meet the basic needs of animals that are already in our community.” 
The Las Vegas Valley Humane Society appreciates the intent of the ordinance, but opposes a delayed ban, representative Bridget Murphy told the committee. 
“If Las Vegas truly wants to be a leader in animal welfare, we should not grandfather in businesses that profit from the suffering of animals,” Murphy said. “Rather, we should impose a complete ban on the retail sale of animals and direct our support instead towards reputable shelters and rescues.”",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/dogpoundpuppy-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-10-15 17:02:58.904641

The state’s HAVA Grant Board, which administers federal money from the Help America Vote Act, met virtually to approve grant requests from Lyman, Oglala Lakota and Todd counties. Those counties are home to much of the Lower Brule, Pine Ridge and Rosebud reservations.

The board voted unanimously to fund the three counties’ requests, totaling about $50,000, to operate in-person, satellite voting sites during the 2026 election cycle. The satellite locations are in addition to early voting and election-day polling places typically located in county courthouses.
Lyman County received $17,800 to hire poll workers, pay travel expenses and rent space for a temporary voting site. Oglala Lakota County was approved for $25,400 for similar expenses, and Todd County received $6,500.
Courts have repeatedly found that South Dakota and some counties have failed to provide equal access to polling locations, registration opportunities and early voting for Native Americans. In some of those lawsuits, judges have ruled that without such voting sites, those Native American voters faced barriers that violate the Voting Rights Act of 1965.

Photo by Win McNamee/Getty Images. President Donald Trump was once quoted by an unnamed source in the New York Times saying this about U.S. Rep. Tom Emmer’s endorsement of him in early 2024: “They always bend the knee.”
Minnesota’s senior Republican was required to add some extra enthusiasm to his genuflection to Trump. That’s because he’d had the temerity to vote to certify the 2020 election results that Joe Biden was the winner.
You might remember that day, Jan. 6, 2021, when a gang of regime partisans took over the Capitol to keep Trump in power after he’d lost the election.
“Hang Mike Pence,” they’d chanted. 
With the House out of session these days — lest any pesky votes to release the Epstein files come up — Emmer seems to have settled into a role as House Republicans’ demagogue.
“The Democrats,” Emmer said this week, “would rather cater to the pro-terrorist wing of their party than to reopen the government.”
This follows up last week’s gem: “This is about one thing and one thing alone,” he said about the government shutdown, “to score political points with the terrorist wing of their party, which is set to hold a hate America rally in D.C next week.”
To use this kind of language is peculiar: I was reliably informed just weeks ago that right-wing star Charlie Kirk’s killing was the result of inciteful language that some of us have used to describe the Republicans’ fascistic turn, but I digress.
Let’s talk about the “hate America” rally that Emmer referred to, known as “No Kings” and being held in 2,500 locations nationwide, including 69 Minnesota cities, among them such hotbeds of anti-American fervor as New Ulm and Owatonna and — in Emmer’s own district! — St. Cloud. 
At the last No Kings rally, in June, Joan Nelson, 82, talked to a Reformer reporter. She was attending a political rally for just the second time in her life, she said, but there she was, with her daughter and granddaughter, too. 
Three generations of America hating! 
The June rally was the same day of the assassination of Mark and Rep. Melissa Hortman, but thousands turned out anyway at the Minnesota Capitol, to demand an end to the unconstitutional actions of an executive run amok. 
Among the people likely to attend Saturday’s No Kings rally: My 76-year old mother-in-law visiting us this weekend, a suburban retiree who spent nearly four decades as a Montgomery County, Md., librarian. 
She married her college sweetheart, an Iranian immigrant. (You wanna hear someone bag on about a regime? Ask my father-in-law about the mullahs.) Massoud was a literal rocket scientist  for decades, helping defend America, including as part of a team that developed the technology we now know as GPS. (Massoud, who has a history of voting for minor party candidates for president, emphasized to me that he won’t be at the protest.) 
They worked hard and sent their kids to college. They go to the beach once a year for a week and invite us along. Massoud likes hockey and country music. (Weird, perhaps, but I don’t judge.) Lisa occasionally, um, borrows our HBO Max password and likes Broadway showtunes. Massoud keeps a lovely yard, and Lisa runs a book club and blogs about her reading.
Theirs is a deeply American story. 
Lisa will join teachers, veterans, tradesmen, nurses and doctors, business people — and no doubt plenty of other librarians — who will go to the rally to express the most American idea ever: They are citizens who share in self-governance, not subjects of a monarch or tyrant. 
Let’s explore why this is called “No Kings.” 
Trump has sent the National Guard from his allied red states to American cities that have no want or use for them. 
He’s ordered masked federal agents to sweep up people without warrants. He’s violated their due process rights and in some cases sent them to repressive foreign lands known for human rights abuses. 
He has ordered career prosecutors to go after his political enemies, and to spare his political friends. He has fired career public servants who refused his unethical orders. 
He has pardoned the people who stormed the Capitol and assaulted police officers in their failed coup attempt. 
He and his family have collected billions of dollars in foreign money while doling out favors — like the right to sell sophisticated technology to the Chinese — to the very same foreign oligarchs. 
And, he’s openly musing about another term despite the Constitution’s prohibition. 
Hey Tom Emmer: Someone around here seems to hate America, or at least the one most of us grew up with. But it’s not my mother-in-law or the millions who will join her across the country Saturday, in burgs and villages and big cities and in your own 6th District, from sea to shining sea, to remind the regime that we are not a nation governed by monarchs and never shall be.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/GettyImages-1754127433.jpeg,,,2025-10-15 17:02:58.904641

“One of my greatest frustrations as a legislator is we never take the time to measure the cost of doing nothing,” Meredith said. “And even though we’ve seen great improvement in colon cancer screening and reducing deaths, the work’s not done yet.” 
Dr. Whitney Jones, the founder of the Colon Cancer Prevention Project and the previous chair of the Kentucky Colon Cancer Screening and Prevention Advisory Committee, said that widespread screening has saved 270 people each year “who don’t die from colon cancer” and 640 people annually who “don’t get colon cancer because we found their polyps and we skipped their cancers.” 
The program provides free screenings for eligible Kentucky residents who are low income and uninsured, age 45 or older or those who are younger than 45 but are at high risk because of family history. The program budget request states demand is “projected to exceed available resources by 2026” and with the additional funds, “​​upward of 300+ colonoscopies could be completed.” 
Rep. Amy Neighbors, R-Edmonton, told her fellow lawmakers from the presenter’s table: “Early detection saved my life, and I don’t want anyone in Kentucky to miss that same chance.” 
“I am an early age onset colorectal cancer survivor, and I often think about how differently my story could have turned out if I had been uninsured or if I hadn’t had access to a timely colonoscopy,” Neighbors said. “Kentucky still has the highest colorectal cancer rates in the nation and one of the highest for early age onset. We can change that, but only if we invest in prevention, in education, on time screening based on family history and quick response to warning symptoms.”  
American Cancer Society data shows that Kentucky has both a high prevalence of cancer screenings as well as a high cancer mortality rate. Cancer mortality has decreased, however, in the state over at least the last decade, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 
“Preventing late stage cancer saves both lives and health care dollars by avoiding the enormous costs of advanced treatment,” Neighbors said. “No Kentuckian should ever lose their life simply because they can’t afford or access a colonoscopy.” 
During the interim, legislative committees are fielding requests for money from a variety of organizations ahead of the 2026 legislative session, which begins Jan. 6. During the 60-day session in Frankfort, lawmakers will pass the next two-year state budget.

Immigration judges are continuing to deny bond hearings for detainees in Iowa and throughout the country, despite being repeatedly overruled by federal district court judges.
Five weeks ago, immigration judges across the country formally adopted the U.S. Department of Justice’s new legal position that detainees suspected of entering the country illegally can be held in jail indefinitely without being afforded a hearing on whether they’re entitled to release on bond while their case is pending.
The immigration judges’ stance stems from a September 2025 ruling by the Board of Immigration Appeals agreeing with the Trump administration’s position that detainees are not entitled to such hearings.
The board’s decision endorsing that view has upended decades of past practice in which immigration judges — who are not part of the judicial branch, and are instead part of the executive branch and the DOJ — released individuals on bond in cases where the detainees were not considered a flight risk or a danger to the public.
In the past few months, hundreds of detainees have sought relief by seeking the intervention of U.S. District Court judges, arguing that being held under such circumstances is a violation of their right to due process.
In an overwhelming number of such cases, the federal judges have sided with the detainees, ordering the immigration judges to hold bond hearings at which the detainees can argue that their history, employment, family obligations or other circumstances warrant their temporary release on bond.
Despite those rulings in U.S. District Court, immigration judges continue to deny bond hearings, leading to even more federal court cases seeking injunctions.
More Iowa detainees seek court intervention 
Among the most recent Iowa cases is that of Filemon Brito Barrajas, a citizen of Mexico who says he has lived in the United States for 20 years without legal status. Court records indicate Barrajas had no criminal record until July of this year, when he was jailed on a charge of contempt of court. Immigration and Customs Enforcement then issued a detainer for him, keeping him in jail after he’d served his sentence for contempt.
On Aug. 18, 2025, Barrajas requested a bond hearing, but was denied by an immigration judge who concluded he lacked jurisdiction, echoing the DOJ’s position on the issue.
Barrajas then took the matter to U.S. District Court, challenging the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and its director, Kristi Noem, as well as U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi, the DOJ and the Omaha Immigration Court.
Attorneys for Barrajas argued he was entitled to a hearing on the question of bond and that, in the alternative, he should be released from custody.
On Sept. 23, U.S. District Judge Stephen Locher of the Southern District of Iowa ordered that such a hearing be scheduled by the immigration court within seven days.
“District courts across the country have addressed arguments similar to – and often identical to – the ones raised here,” Locher wrote in his decision. “The overwhelming majority of these courts have concluded that aliens in the petitioners’ situation are … entitled to bond hearings.”
Locher’s decision was similar to that of many other judges in that while he found that Barrajas was entitled to argue for his release on bond, the issue of whether bond should be granted was for the immigration court, not a U.S. District Court judge, to decide.
“It is not the court’s prerogative to assume the role of the immigration judge by deciding bond or detention,” Locher wrote.
Another recent Iowa case involves Marua Enriquez Reyes, who entered the United States, according to her lawyers, to escape some form of persecution. Shortly after coming to the United States, Reyes was given notice to appear in immigration court and was released on her own recognizance.
But on Sept. 2, 2025, while attending her regularly scheduled check-in appointment at the ICE office in Cedar Rapids, ICE officials allegedly canceled her notice to appear in immigration court, entered an order calling for her expedited removal from the country, and had her detained in the Muscatine County Jail.
On Oct. 1, an immigration judge denied Reyes’ request for a bond hearing. A week later, on Oct. 7, 2025, attorneys for Reyes sought an emergency hearing on the matter in U.S. District Court, arguing the immigration court had violated her due process rights by denying her a hearing.
On Tuesday of this week, the Department of Justice sought and obtained a continuance in the case. Judge Locher has given the DOJ until Oct. 21 to file a response in the case.
The Barrajas and Reyes cases are among at least 20 such bond-hearing cases filed recently in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Iowa. Because the final decisions on bond are still made within the immigration court system, the current status or outcome of the cases is difficult — and in some cases impossible — to track.
Federal judges rule against the DOJ 
Last week, federal judges in the San Francisco area ordered the release of dozens of immigrants held in California detention facilities without a bond hearing. In each case, a U.S. District Court judge had already issued a temporary restraining order or an injunction granting the temporary release of the detainees until the bond-hearing issue could be resolved.
One federal judge in San Francisco, James Donato, recently expressed frustration when a DOJ lawyer argued in court that detainees have no right to a hearing in front of an immigration judge.
“This argument has failed in every court that it’s ever been argued,” Donato told the assistant U.S. attorney. “Just give them a hearing … What’s the master plan for making sure we don’t have the same cases coming up again, and again, and again, in front of every judge in this district?”
Two weeks ago, a U.S. District Court judge in the state of Washington ruled that the Tacoma Immigration Court’s practice of denying bond hearings to detainees was unlawful. That Sept. 30 ruling was made in a class-action lawsuit filed by the Northwest Immigrant Rights Project in March 2025, challenging the then-new practice of denying bond hearings even to people who have lived in the United States for decades.
Other class-action lawsuits over the same issue, as well as the hundreds of individually filed cases, are still pending in courts throughout the United States.",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Gavel-scales-law-books-courtroom-_-getty-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-10-15 17:02:58.904641

The board chair wrote in the complaint that Sen. Scott Beck “used his position and legislative influence to advance a narrative” to push for grade closures that would benefit the private school where he works.

The Danville School District’s board chair filed an ethics complaint on Wednesday against Sen. Scott Beck, R-Caledonia, alleging he “used his position and legislative influence to advance a narrative and push” the district to try and close high school grades, a move that would benefit the nearby private school where he works.
Clayton Cargill wrote in his complaint that Beck had warned Cargill and Cabot School District board chair Chris Tormey that the Vermont Legislature was likely to pass legislation to restrict school choice for districts that close their schools.
Beck advised that the two chairs should encourage their boards to move forward with school closure votes before the new year “if we wanted to preserve the option of tuitioning students to independent schools,” Cargill wrote in his complaint. Beck’s warning was first reported by Seven Days.

Neither town was actively considering closing their schools prior to Beck’s advice, Cargill wrote in an email to lawmakers on the Senate Ethics Committee. Beck is an employee of St. Johnsbury Academy, a nearby private school where he works as a social studies teacher.
“Although Senator Beck provided no evidence for his claims, I took them seriously and raised the issue at the Danville School Board meeting on (Sept. 2),” Cargill wrote in the complaint. 
Cargill wrote that Beck texted him several more times after the Sept. 2 meeting, first asking about undecided board members’ votes on school closure, and later texting Cargill that the board “should let the voters have their say. Takes all the pressure off the board.”
According to the complaint, Cargill replied that did not “have the board votes for that just yet but that’s what I’m working on.” Beck replied that it was “difficult to deny democracy.”
In the complaint, Cargill wrote it was “notable” that Beck only reached out to the Danville and Cabot school districts and not Twinfield, which also operates high school grades nearby.
“He contacted only two, and one—Cabot—is not even in his district,” Cargill wrote. “The only clear link between the schools he approached is their proximity to his employer.”
Cargill, in his email to lawmakers, said the private school “stands to benefit financially if these schools close” and that it was “a clear conflict of interest.”
The Caledonia County senator has refuted claims that he had a conflict of interest, and said he was merely offering his opinion to his constituents.
Beck in an interview on Wednesday said that his “job is to represent and to let people know what the facts are and what my opinions are and what I think their possible courses of action are, and that’s what I’ve done here.”
He pointed to specific language that had been in an earlier version of the legislation last session requiring school districts that close a school and designate just three public schools to receive their students.
“Would it have been responsible of me to not tell anybody that someone just made a serious attempt to take away your local control?” he said. “Should I not tell them that, and just ignore it like it never happened? What happens down the road if it actually does happen? … In some ways I feel like I’m caught in the middle here, I’m the messenger, so people aren’t happy about that.”
Regardless, Beck’s advice to the board chairs in Danville and Cabot has created “urgency and confusion in both communities,” Cargill wrote to lawmakers.
The Cabot School District had previously considered circulating a survey to residents about closing their schools and opting for school choice. But Tormey said that the board decided to hold off on the survey “until we find out next year how Cabot School will be placed within the new statewide map.”
Danville, however, is set to hold a vote on Dec. 6 on whether to shutter its high school grades at the Danville School and instead pay tuition for students to attend other schools, following a petition submitted to the board. Public school faculty said closure would have an immense impact on public high school students in the region.
“Both towns have been thrust into the media spotlight and residents in both communities are worried,” he wrote. “We are in danger of closing based on something Scott Beck told people might happen.”
In his email to lawmakers, Cargill said he was told by lawmakers and other public education officials that Beck’s behavior may have violated legislative ethical guidelines.
“I have sought guidance in all the places I know to seek guidance. I’ve beseeched people I treat as mentors. … I was told by many of your colleagues ‘this isn’t right,'” Cargill wrote to lawmakers. “Many of them encouraged me to be steadfast enough to submit this, and as such, I am.”
Beck was previously the focus of a separate ethics complaint filed in June that accused him and Sen. Seth Bongartz, D-Bennington, of using their positions on a critical committee negotiating the final form of a wide-ranging education bill to advance provisions that benefited the private schools with which they are or have been associated. 
Bongartz and Beck have forcefully denied that accusation.

The “No Kings” rallies are part of a nationwide movement meant to show mass opposition to what protest leaders call Trump’s “authoritarian power grabs.”
Lead Connecticut organizer Jim Chapdelaine says it’s important for those opposed to the administration to see they’re not alone and to take collective action.
“There are powers that be that would prefer we all just stay at our houses and, I don’t know, take up crochet,” Chapdelaine said in a Tuesday interview. “It’s really important to build community and solidarity and unity, [and] especially important to do that in a very peaceful way.”
Chapdelaine said despite the protests’ real stakes, the main rally in Hartford will be “fun.” He said the gathering outside the state Capitol at noon will include live music, puppets and poetry readings.
“I think the way to achieve this peaceful sort of vibe is to make people enjoy things,” he said. “You know, it’s okay to do this kind of work and have fun.”
Performances include singer Nekita Waller, Hartford’s Proud Drill, Drum and Dance Corp, Manchester Poet Laureate Nadia Sims, and Anne Cubberly’s giant puppets “Muchos Colores” and “Mother Earth.”
Chapdelaine rejected claims from leading Republicans in Washington that Saturday’s events were “hate America rallies.”
“We are stressing patriotism. Bring your American flags. Let’s profess our love for America publicly, loudly and peacefully,” he said. “This ‘oh, they hate America’ – no, we love America.”
Addresses by local leaders listed for the Hartford event include Connecticut U.S. Sen. Richard Blumenthal, Connecticut Lt. Gov. Susan Bysiewicz, and Hartford Mayor Arunan Arulampalam.
Among the advocates scheduled to speak are Kica Matos of the National Immigrant Law Group, Bishop John Selders of Moral Monday CT, and Tabitha Sookdeo of CT Students for a Dream.
The Saturday events are a follow-up to “No Kings” rallies in June that attracted thousands across Connecticut.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/PROTESTS-NOKINGS-0614-4-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-15 17:02:58.904641

Ned Lamont is one of 14 governors who intend to share public health information, partly as a rebuke of the Trump administration.","A group of Democratic state governors that includes Gov. Ned Lamont has launched a new alliance aimed at coordinating their public health efforts.
They’re framing it as a way to share data, messages about threats, emergency preparedness and public health policy — and as a rebuke to President Donald Trump’s administration, which they say isn’t doing its job in public health.
“At a time when the federal government is telling the states, ‘you’re on your own,’ governors are banding together,” Maryland Gov. Wes Moore said in a statement.
“Connecticut is proud to join an alliance that strengthens our collaboration with other states and protects the health and well-being of our residents, while preparing against future threats,” Lamont said in a statement. “Whether it was during the COVID pandemic or any other public health crisis, it’s important for governors to speak with one voice and communicate clearly with our communities to keep them safe. Once again, states are stepping up, amid federal uncertainty, to ensure our residents have the information they need to stay protected.”
The formation of the group touches off a new chapter in a partisan battle over public health measures that has been heightened by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s advisers declining to recommend COVID-19 vaccinations, instead leaving the choice to the individual.
Andrew Nixon, a spokesperson for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, said in an email that Democratic governors who imposed school closures and mask mandates, including for toddlers at the height of the pandemic, are the ones who “destroyed public trust in public health.”
“The Trump Administration and Secretary Kennedy are rebuilding that trust by grounding every policy in rigorous evidence and Gold Standard Science, not the failed politics of the pandemic,” Nixon said.
The initial members are all Democrats
The Governors Public Health Alliance bills itself as a “nonpartisan coordinating hub,” but the initial members are all Democrats — the governors of 14 states plus Guam.
Among them are governors of the most populous blue states, California and New York, and several governors who are considered possible 2028 presidential candidates, including California’s Gavin Newsom and Illinois’ JB Pritzker.
The idea of banding together for public health isn’t new for Democratic governors. They formed regional groups to address the pandemic during Trump’s first term and launched new ones in recent months amid uncertainty on federal vaccine policy. States have also taken steps to preserve access to COVID-19 vaccines.
The new alliance isn’t intended to supplant those efforts or the coordination already done by the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials, its organizers say.
A former CDC director is among the advisers
Dr. Mandy Cohen, who was CDC director under former President Joe Biden and before that the head of the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services, is part of a bipartisan group of advisers to the alliance.
“The CDC did provide an important backstop for expertise and support,” she said. “And I think now with some of that gone, it’s important for states to make sure that they are sharing best practices and that they are coordinating, because the problems have not gone away. The health threats have not gone away.”
Other efforts have also sprung up to fill roles that the CDC performed before the ouster of a director, along with other restructuring and downsizing.
The Governors Public Health Alliance has support from GovAct, a nonprofit, nonpartisan donor-funded initiative that also has projects aimed at protecting democracy and another partisan hot-button issue, reproductive freedom.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_5123-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-10-15 17:02:58.904641

(Photo by Jeff T. Green/Getty Images)Sixteen years after the original deadline, the Hanford nuclear reservation in south-central Washington state is finally converting its worst radioactive waste into a benign glass. 
Glassification began Saturday evening, but the U.S. Department of Energy did not announce that the process was underway until Wednesday.
“As the world’s largest radioactive waste treatment facility, the plant’s successful startup represents a crucial achievement at this scale, demonstrating the ability to stabilize nuclear waste for safe, long-term disposal,” said Ray Geimer, Department of Energy’s Hanford manager.
Lawmakers in Washington’s congressional delegation applauded the milestone.
“This is just the start and we’ve still got a ways to go before we’re anywhere near done, but today’s success is worth celebrating — let’s make glass!” said Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash. 
Sen. Maria Cantwell, D-Wash., called it an “incredible technical and logistical accomplishment.”
Hanford is expected to take a year to gradually crank up the volume of waste being glassified until the first plant reaches full operation. 
Right now, the plant is processing an initial 25,000-gallon batch of waste. The waste goes through two huge melters that combine it with glass flakes and heat the mixture to 2,100 degrees. This yields melted glass that is poured into huge storage cylinders to cool and harden.
The U.S. government set up Hanford in 1943 to create plutonium for the nation’s atomic bombs. That work created billions of gallons of chemical and radioactive waste. The worst 56 million gallons of the waste were pumped into 177 underground tanks. 
About a third of those tanks leak. At least a million gallons of radioactive liquid have leaked into the ground, seeping into an aquifer 200 feet below and then into the Columbia River, roughly seven miles away.
Hanford began construction of a plant to begin treating the waste in 2002. That plant was originally legally scheduled to go online in 2009 — 16 years ago. 
This first plant is supposed to take care of 40-50% of the tanks’ low-activity wastes. The master plan has been to build two low-activity glassification plants, plus a third to handle 5 million to 6 million gallons of high-level radioactive wastes. 
The entire project’s original budget in 2002 was $4 billion, which has grown to roughly $30 billion today. The first low-activity waste plant cost slightly more than $9 billion. 
Hanford’s current legal target calls for glassifying all tank wastes by 2052. The U.S. Department of Energy has internally moved those targets back to 2069, according to a 2021 report by the Government Accountability Office. 
Last year, the feds and state agreed to look at possibly encasing some low-activity wastes in grout — a cement-like substance.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/radioactive-waste-sign-hanford-1024x605.jpg,,,2025-10-15 17:02:58.904641

High levels of PFAS have prompted the closure and health warnings for the popular hunting and fishing spot. (Courtesy of  University of New Mexico Communications and Marketing)New Mexico environment officials on Tuesday released a national survey to assess potential exposures to so-called ‘forever chemicals’ at Holloman Lake, which has some of the highest recorded levels on record of toxic PFAS contamination.
All responses to the 10-minute survey will be kept confidential, according to environment officials, who are requesting participation from people over 18 who spent time camping, fishing or boating at the lake.
“Our state’s natural beauty attracts outdoor enthusiasts from around the world and the Environment Department is committed to safeguarding outdoor recreation for campers, hikers, and hunters,” Environment Secretary James Kenney said in a statement. “This survey is one of the first of its kind, aiming to inform New Mexicans and others of potential impacts of PFAS pollution on their health.”
NMED said results from the survey, which will remain open until Nov. 30, will be made public.
Earlier this year, scientists documented record-breaking levels of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) in plant samples and studies of animal carcasses at Holloman Lake.
New Mexico wildlife, plants around Holloman lake have highest PFAS contamination on record

State officials believe the contamination at the man-made chain of wetlands near White Sands National Park stems from neighboring Holloman Air Force Base’s use from the 1970s through 2019 of firefighting foam containing PFAS. This class of chemicals doesn’t easily break down and are difficult to clean up, persisting in water and soils and accumulating in the bodies of humans and animals.
While research is still being conducted on PFAS, federal research has linked PFAS exposure to kidney and reproductive cancers, decreased fertility, fetal developmental delays, disruption of immune responses and liver functions in people.
The high levels of PFAS prompted a health advisory in January from the New Mexico Department of Health, requesting that any hunters who ate waterfowl between 2010 and 2024 from Lake Holloman speak to their doctor.
University of New Mexico Biology Professor Chris Witt published research in February 2024 that showed wild ducks had high rates of contamination and were likely unsafe to eat.
He told Source NM in an interview Tuesday that since then, his research is showing consistent high levels in waterfowl.
“That game is undoubtedly really highly contaminated, particularly with PFOS [perfluorooctane sulfonate], which is one of the worst, most persistent and pernicious PFAS substances,” Witt said. “I’m sure that there are people out there, hunters who live in Alamagordo, Otero County, other parts of New Mexico, who maybe should get their blood checked to see how much circulating PFAS they have as a result of that exposure to contaminated wildlife.”
‘Forever chemicals’ detected in Clovis-area blood tests, New Mexico environmental officials say

The site receives treated wastewater from the base, along with campsites and nature trails. The lake is not a source of drinking water for Alamogordo or surrounding communities. But the high levels of PFAS elicited warnings from health officials not to drink or swim in the lake.
The air force closed access to the lake in July, citing potential risks from PFAS exposure. New Mexico is embroiled in two lawsuits with the U.S. military over PFAS contamination on multiple air force bases and how to address clean up.
In January, lawmakers passed specific provisions allowing the state to have explicit powers to treat the chemicals as hazardous waste and require their clean-up and a new law to require explicit labels and create rules to eventually phase out the sale of everyday products containing PFAS.

Free.,Federal judge blocks Trump from carrying out thousands of layoffs during shutdown,"Jennifer Shutt, Ariana Figueroa",,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/federal-judge-blocks-trump-carrying-out-thousands-layoffs-during-shutdown,,"This report has been updated.WASHINGTON — A federal judge issued a temporary restraining order Wednesday, blocking the Trump administration from moving forward with the thousands of layoffs it initiated after the government shutdown began Oct. 1, as well as any others that officials might want to carry out.  The hearing in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California took place at the same time White House budget director Russ Vought appeared on the conservative Charlie Kirk podcast to preview his next steps.Vought warned the initial Reductions in Force, the technical term for a layoff notice, were just “a snapshot” and that as many as 10,000 federal workers would lose their jobs if the shutdown drags on.“We’re going to keep those RIFs rolling throughout this shutdown because we think it’s important to stay on offense for the American taxpayer and the American people,” Vought said. “We want to be very aggressive where we can be in shuttering the bureaucracy, not just the funding, but the bureaucracy.”Judge Susan Illston said during the hearing that she granted the temporary restraining order because Trump administration officials had “taken advantage of the lapse in government spending, government functioning to assume that all bets are off, that the laws don’t apply to them anymore and that they can impose the structures that they like on the government situation that they don’t like.” Illston said laws and regulations still apply during a shutdown and that, by all appearances, the Trump administration's actions in the case are politically motivated. “Things are being done before they’re thought through — very much ready, fire, aim,” Illston said.The ruling will put the approximately 4,000 layoffs noticed during the shutdown on hold as the court case proceeds. DOJ unprepared to speak on merits of caseElizabeth Hedges, a Justice Department attorney arguing the case on behalf of the Trump administration, said several times during the brief hearing she wasn’t prepared to speak about the merits of the case — a position that confounded the judge, who gave Hedges several chances to reverse course.  “We may be able to address the merits at the next stage,” Hedges said, after telling Illston she would need to check with others before making any statements about why the administration believes its actions are legal. Danielle Leonard, an attorney representing the labor unions that brought the lawsuit, urged the judge to grant a temporary restraining order for all the departments and agencies that make up the executive branch, not just those that have announced RIFs.Leonard said she believes Trump administration officials have decided how many additional federal employees to lay off during the shutdown, but have opted not to share that information with the court.“The decision has been made, it's just a question of implementation and timing,” Leonard said, around the same time Vought was giving his podcast interview. Illston, who was nominated by former President Bill Clinton, said at the end of the hearing she expected the attorneys to find a day in the coming weeks when they can attend a hearing on the next stage, which would be a preliminary injunction.Senate deadlocks for ninth timeOn the other side of the country, Republicans and Democrats continued to spar on Capitol Hill over the reasons for the shutdown, as the Senate failed for a ninth time to advance a short-term government spending bill. The 51-44 vote was nearly identical to the others that have taken place since mid-September, and neither side appeared inclined to make concessions or even try to negotiate. Nevada Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto and Pennsylvania Sen. John Fetterman, both Democrats, and Maine independent Sen. Angus King voted with Republicans to advance the bill. Kentucky GOP Sen. Rand Paul voted no.Democrats maintain there must be a bipartisan deal to extend the enhanced tax credits that are set to expire at the end of this year for people who get their health insurance from the Affordable Care Act Marketplace. GOP leaders said they are willing to begin negotiations on that issue, but only after Democrats vote to advance the stopgap bill that would fund government through Nov. 21. The House voted mostly along party lines to approve the legislation in mid-September, but it has remained stalled in the Senate ever since, unable to garner the 60 votes needed to advance toward final passage. Republicans control the chamber with 53 seats.Congress needs to approve the stopgap bill since it, once again, failed to approve all 12 of the full-year government funding bills by the Oct. 1 start of the new fiscal year.The only other way to end the funding lapse would be for both chambers to reach a broadly bipartisan consensus on all of those appropriations bills. Layoffs across agenciesThe layoffs initiated by the Trump administration during the shutdown were detailed further on Tuesday in court filings from the labor unions’ attorneys as well as Trump administration officials.  Stephen Billy, senior adviser at the Office of Management and Budget, wrote the number of layoff notices had changed since Friday when he outlined the Reductions in Force to the court.The numbers have fluctuated significantly for some departments, but not for all. Commerce: Approximately 600 employees, up from 315 Education: Remained at 466 employeesHealth and Human Services: 982 employees, down from a range of 1,100 to 1,200 Housing and Urban Development: Stayed at 442 employeesHomeland Security: Decreased to 54 from 176 employeesTreasury: Reduced somewhat to 1,377 employees, from 1,446 Energy, EPA layoffsFederal workers at those departments have 60 days between when the notice was sent and when they will no longer have jobs, though a different standard is in place at the Energy Department and the Environmental Protection Agency. Energy officials, the document says, “issued a general RIF notice informing 179 employees that they may receive a specific notice in the future if it is determined they will be part of any RIF. If so, that notice would provide the relevant notice period.”But a spokesperson for the Energy Department emailed States Newsroom on Tuesday evening to confirm officials had issued RIF notices to workers in the Offices of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, Clean Energy Demonstrations, State and Community Energy Programs and Minority Economic Impact.“All these offices played a major role in the Biden administration’s war on American Energy,” the spokesperson wrote. “They oversaw billions of dollars in wasteful spending and massive regulatory overreach, resulting in more expensive and less reliable energy. These offices are being realigned to reflect the Trump administration’s commitment to advancing affordable, reliable, and secure energy for the American people and a more responsible stewardship of taxpayer dollars.”Further confusing the situation at the Energy Department, a footnote in the court document filed by Billy said that particular agency isn’t actually experiencing a lapse in funding. The Billy court document said EPA officials sent 28 employees “intent to RIF” notices and will send formal RIF notices “to any affected employees at least 60 days prior to the effective date.” A separate document, filed by Thomas J. Nagy Jr., deputy assistant secretary for Human Resources at HHS, said “data discrepancies and processing errors” led to 1,760 employees receiving layoff notices instead of the intended 982.“Employees have been working since October 10, 2025, to rescind the notices that had been issued in error,” Nagy wrote. At CDC, 'eliminating entire offices'Yolanda Jacobs, president of the American Federation of Government Employees Local 2883, wrote in a brief to the court that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention “issued RIF notices to approximately 1,300 employees, eliminating entire offices at the agency. Then, within 24 hours, the CDC rescinded approximately 700 of those RIF notices.” Jacobs wrote the 600 CDC workers who received RIFs will officially lose their jobs on Dec. 8, even though they have already lost access to work email and computers. “Many Union members have told me that they are experiencing serious mental health problems and have found it very difficult to get their work done, given all of the turmoil that they have experienced this year,” Jacobs wrote, referencing previous RIF notices and reinstatements. “Members have told me that they worry on a day-to-day basis about whether they will have a job the next day. They said that they have felt like the Trump Administration has been using them as bargaining chips this year.”Jacobs wrote that the Trump administration has decided to lay off many human resources workers, which had blocked other workers who received RIFs from being able to get information about how to roll over their health insurance coverage. During past RIFs, she wrote, workers had “access to the employment records, including paystubs and performance records, that they need for processing their separations,” but cannot since they are locked out of computer systems. Layoffs hit Department of EducationRachel Gittleman, president of AFGE Local 252, which represents nearly 3,000 Education Department workers, wrote in a separate filing the layoffs will impact numerous programs, including civil rights, communications and outreach, elementary and secondary education, post secondary education, and special education and rehabilitative services.“Receiving RIF notices has caused many employees enormous stress. A father of two young boys contacted me—he just moved into a new home and relies on his job to support his family,” Gittleman wrote. “He told me (he) doesn’t know what he will do next.”Workers on maternity or disability leave also received layoff notices, “forcing them to job-hunt and face financial insecurity while managing newborns or health conditions,” she wrote. Following past RIF notices, the department provided “career transitioning and counseling, benefits and retirement training, and access to other human resources and employee assistance programs.” But Gittleman wrote that isn’t happening this time. ‘Devastated’ HUD employeesAshaki Robinson, regional vice president for AFGE Council 222, which represents nearly 5,000 HUD workers, said the layoff notices for that department will impact employees in Florida, Georgia, Kansas, Massachusetts, Puerto Rico, Texas and Washington, D.C., who manage a variety of programs. “They are devastated that the RIF is happening and are very concerned about losing their incomes, health insurance coverage for themselves and dependents, and other employment benefits in 60 days, when they will be separated from employment,” Robinson wrote. The hundreds of HUD workers who have received RIF notices, she wrote, were “targeted for termination not because of anything they did themselves, but because of decisions made by elected officials that may have been driven by politics.”",,,,2025-10-15 17:02:58.904641

“I am deeply grateful to be reunited with my family and community,” Zia, whose full name is not being used due to concerns about his safety, said in a press release. “I came to this country because I believed America would protect me and my family after I had proudly served alongside American troops in Afghanistan. I still believe in America, and I want to continue rebuilding my life here and contribute to the community that has welcomed me.”
Zia, who came to the country through legal means, was detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers on July 16 in East Hartford following a routine appointment with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. He was held at a Massachusetts detention facility in Plymouth.
Zia’s detainment was decried by lawmakers including U.S. Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., and U.S. Rep. Bill Keating of Massachusetts, who visited the detention facility where he was held in July to draw attention to the issue.
“For masked agents to snatch someone off the street with no warning, no counsel, no opportunity even to know who is doing it while it’s in process, is unAmerican,” Blumenthal said during a press conference after the July visit. “He actually worked and risked his life in Afghanistan to uphold the values and rights that are central to democracy. And for now, him to be, in effect, violated in his rights when he has fought for those rights here is completely disgraceful.”
Initially Zia was denied a bond hearing by an immigration judge, but attorney Lauren Cundick Petersen said that a different judge granted such a hearing. It took place on Tuesday, and the judge found that Zia met the criteria to be released on bond. Zia is still subject to ongoing immigration proceedings to resolve his immigration status and whether he will be allowed to remain in the U.S. permanently.
Petersen said her client was approved for humanitarian parole in 2024 due to direct Taliban threats that put his life in imminent danger. He came to the U.S. with his wife and children in October 2024. Since his arrival, Petersen said that Zia has found full-time work and continued on with the legal process of filing an application for a green card.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/zia-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-10-15 15:03:37.332541

(Photos by Dana DiFilippo/Gage Skidmore)Newark Mayor Ras Baraka this week urged a federal court to allow his false arrest and malicious prosecution lawsuit to continue in response to federal prosecutors’ arguments that federal doctrine shields acting U.S. Attorney Alina Habba from the suit.
Prosecutors’ claims that Habba and a Department of Homeland Security investigator also named in the suit are entitled to qualified and absolute immunity is “breathtaking in its presumption that these actions can escape any accountability by the third branch of government,” Yael Bromberg, Baraka’s attorney, wrote to the judge overseeing the case on Tuesday.
“The Defendants are liable for violating constitutional rights,” Bromberg’s letter reads.
New videos capture tense moments surrounding arrest of Newark mayor

Baraka, a Democrat, in June sued Habba and Ricky Patel, the investigator, alleging they violated his constitutional rights after arresting him for trespassing at a Newark immigrant detention facility on May 9, only to drop the charge less than two weeks later, earning admonishment from the federal judge overseeing his case. Baraka said he was at the jail to inspect it with city officials.
Baraka’s attorneys argue the charges were dropped because federal authorities were aware the mayor committed no crime. Patel is seen on police body camera footage taken just prior to Baraka’s arrest saying that he was detaining the mayor “per the deputy attorney general of the United States.”
“Claims of malicious prosecution must show that the proceedings were initiated ‘without probable cause’ and that the defendants ‘acted maliciously for a purpose other than bringing the plaintiff to justice,’” Bromberg wrote, citing a 2017 appeals court decision. “Those circumstances are immediately present here.”
The police body camera footage, released as part of a separate federal case against Rep. LaMonica McIver (D-10), shows a staffer from Geo Group, the migrant jail’s operator, allowing Baraka into a fenced area of the facility, where he remained for roughly 40 minutes before complying with agents’ requests to exit the premises.
McIver, who was later charged with assaulting officers during Baraka’s arrest, has said the case against her is purely political. Habba announced the charges against McIver at the same time she said she was dropping the case against Baraka.
Attorneys for Habba and Patel in a September letter signaled they would ask the judge to dismiss Baraka’s lawsuit, arguing he had failed to exhaust administrative remedies through complaints to the Departments of Justice and Homeland Security and should have filed a claim under the Federal Tort Claim Act.
Baraka’s suit does not cite that law. His claims of defamation and false light are state torts that his attorneys argue are controlled by state law, not federal. Habba in television appearances and on social media claimed Baraka stormed the facility alongside a mob of protestors (surveillance video footage shows protestors remained outside the facility’s gates).
Attorneys for Habba and Patel also argued they are protected from civil liability by the doctrines of qualified and absolute immunity, which shield officials from civil liabilities in such cases, and said the United States, which enjoys broader civil immunity under federal law, should replace Habba and Patel as Baraka’s defendant.
Habba’s tenure as U.S. attorney has been turbulent. A federal judge in August ruled she no longer has any legal authority because her temporary appointment ended in July, while the Trump administration argues that it made a series of personnel moves that will keep her in the job for roughly another six months. That case is expected to go before the U.S. 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals on Monday.

(Photo courtesy of Iowa DNR) The Iowa Department of Natural Resources is investigating roughly 5,000 gallons of hog manure spilled in Carroll County. 
The manure, from a hog confinement site, was being applied to a field Monday evening when a leak occurred in a hose and caused the manure to flow onto the field and into an unnamed tributary of Elk Run Creek. 
Kaitlynne Henriksen, an environmental specialist with DNR, said the B&B Custom Pumping team, the manure applicators, “responded very quickly” to the leak and placed dams in the creek that stopped the manure from traveling downstream.

Henriksen said the tributary was relatively dry when the spill occurred which meant the field application team was able to put dams in place before the manure traveled too far. 
Henriksen said the water downstream of the dam appeared clear and she observed swimming fish. DNR is waiting for results from the State Hygienic Laboratory to ensure samples taken below the dam don’t show signs of pollutants. As of Wednesday, Henriksen said no dead fish had been observed. 
The applicator company continues to pump water from the creek to ensure it is clean before removing any of the dams, according to Henriksen. 
She said the crew’s pump shut off automatically when it detected the leak in the hose, but the manure already in the hoses spilled onto the field. Henriksen said it was “unfortunate” that the leak occurred while the team was uphill from the creek. 
“They were really great at responding right away and they did as much as they could, given the situation,” Henriksen said. 
According to a news release from DNR, the incident remains under investigation as the department determines whether further enforcement action is needed.

In June, the event drew approximately 42,000 people to rallies across the state in opposition to President Donald Trump, coinciding with a Washington, D.C., military parade. Millions more attended across the nation. 
Now, the organizers of the No Kings protest, a movement called 50501, are calling for Vermonters to show up to protests Oct. 18 in opposition to Trump’s targeting of immigrants, the government shutdown and more, according to its website. More than 40 different protests, marches and rallies are planned.

Burlington’s June protest had an estimated 16,000 attendees — making it the largest in the state — and cost an estimated $20,000 for permits, security and more. This Saturday, Burlington organizers plan to host several different rallies scattered throughout the city, including three different marches, a bike ride, and a honk and wave. 
It’s unclear if any pro-Trump protests are planned. The Vermont Republican Party, which hosted a pro-Trump party during the June protests, has not posted any events for this Saturday on its website.

The clerks cited concerns about timeliness of the certification of elections, confusion by voters and delays to any recounts or audits in their opposition to the measure. 
“Michigan voters are used to knowing who won an election in a timely manner, so it’s incredibly important that we’re able to report accurate, unofficial results on election night,” said Kent County Clerk Lisa Posthumus Lyons in a press release from the association. “Determining a winner will take drastically longer under ranked-choice voting. Delayed results erode the public’s trust by fueling uncertainty and misinformation.”
Marquette County Clerk Linda Talsma, who chairs the association, also noted in the release that while they do not generally take positions on ballot measures, the bipartisan group of county officials felt it necessary to urge voters to reject the initiative in this case. SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
“Michigan voters already face some of the longest and most complex ballots in the nation, covering federal, state, county, city, township, school, and special district contests on a single ballot,” reads the official resolution passed by the clerks’ association. “The RankMIVote proposal would further complicate ballots by requiring voters to numerically rank candidates in certain contests while others remain unchanged, adding inconsistency, voter confusion, and voter fatigue.”
The resolution also cited a survey, conducted in June by The Glengariff Group, in which 65% of Michigan voters polled — across demographic and political lines — opposed the implementation of ranked choice voting. 
But proponents of the initiative pushed back against these criticisms. A statement from Rank MI Vote in response to the clerks’ statement cited that “upwards of 96% of voters found their ballot simple to complete,” adding that “79% of jurisdictions using RCV release results within 24 hours of an election.”
“Ranked Choice Voting has been proven to increase both the demographic diversity and diversity of ideas in the candidates who run and win elections,” said Joe Spaulding, the campaign director for Rank MI Vote, in the release.

Spaulding also criticized the timing of the announcement, which came on the same day as the U.S. Supreme Court is hearing a case that could undercut a key clause of the Voting Rights Act. 
“If we set election policy based on the misplaced notion that voters are confused by having more choices instead of the fact that voters are angry when they have fewer choices, turnout will decline,” he added. “This is an outcome we know clerks want to avoid.”
One additional concern raised by the clerks is a potential constitutional conflict with straight-party voting, which Rank MI Vote says would not be affected by the inclusion of ranked choice voting, nor would the primary system in place. 
The proposal put forth by Rank MI Vote would establish the new voting system in federal elections for President, Senate and House of Representatives, as well as state elections for Governor, Lieutenant Governor, Attorney General and Secretary of State, starting in 2029. 
Five Michigan municipalities — Ann Arbor, East Lansing, Ferndale, Kalamazoo and Royal Oak — have individually passed ranked choice voting measures. But none have been able to put them into practice due to conflicts with current Michigan election laws. 
Ranked choice voting is already being used in a number of states and cities around the United States — Maine and Alaska have both adopted the practice for certain elections including the U.S. House of Representatives and U.S. Senate, and cities like New York City, San Francisco and Minneapolis have begun to use it for some citywide elections. 
While this ballot initiative continues, Republicans in Michigan’s Legislature have also considered banning ranked choice voting in the state outright, passing a bill through the House in August along party lines that would do just that. 
As of March 2025, Ballotpedia reported that 13 states had enacted legislation banning ranked choice voting, and another five failed in 2024 to pass ballot measures that would have put the system in place.

(Photo by Lori Kersey/West Virginia Watch)The Kanawha County judge presiding over a lawsuit regarding the state’s compulsory school vaccination law and religious freedom said he’s not sure whether a Raleigh County judge has authority to certify a class made up of plaintiffs with similar cases there and around the state. 
Judge Richard Lindsay said the only context he knows for class certification are cases when plaintiffs have been injured.
“Is there a difference between that and what we have before us in these cases, wherein the issue is one of law, not of injury?” Lindsay asked Corey Palumbo, an attorney representing the Kanawha County Board of Education. “Is that a distinction that can be made between what my understanding of… certification of classes, versus what we have here?
“Effectively the plaintiff here is claiming some type of injury, but it’s not a determination of whether one party was negligent or whether or not a specific physical injury was sustained,” he said. “Here we have basically a question of law as to whether or not the compulsory vaccination law applies.”
Wednesday’s hearing was in the case of Nakesha Watson vs. the Kanawha County Board of Education. Watson filed the complaint on behalf of KJ, III, her child. According to the suit, the state Bureau for Public Health granted KJ a religious exemption to the school vaccine requirements, but the school board is not letting him attend school with the exemption. 
Watson, who is representing herself in court, was a no-show for the hearing, scheduled for 10 a.m. Wednesday. She had filed motions for a temporary injunction in the case and for emergency review of the case. Lindsay rescheduled the hearing for later this week.
By that time, Palumbo noted, Raleigh County Circuit Judge Michael Froble is expected to have entered a written order certifying a class that may include Watson in a similar case Froble is overseeing. 
In the Raleigh County case, families are suing the state and Raleigh County school boards to make them allow their students to attend school with a religious exemption to the school vaccination requirements. 
West Virginia law has allowed only medical exemptions to those requirements. Gov. Patrick Morrisey earlier this year issued an executive order requiring the state to allow religious exemptions to the law, citing a 2023 religious freedom law. He’s not rescinded the order, even though the state Legislature earlier this year rejected a bill that would have put the religious exemptions in state law. The state school board directed county school boards not to recognize religious and philosophical exemptions. 
Froble has already granted a preliminary injunction in that case. During a permanent injunction hearing last week in Beckley, Froble said he would certify a class to include anyone who has asked the state Department of Health for a religious or philosophical exemption to the state’s school vaccination requirements. As of last week, the state Department of Health had granted about 575 nonmedical exemptions. Froble is expected to make a ruling on permanent injunction in the case by the end of November.
Defendants in the Raleigh County case — the state and Raleigh school boards— opposed the class certification, Palumbo noted.
“The defendants in that case did not believe that that was proper and objected to that decision,” he said. “The judge is doing it anyway, obviously. [He] has not entered an order yet, but again, we expect that order to be entered from what the judge said by the end of this week.”
Lindsay said as he understands the state’s legal system, West Virginia circuit courts operate similarly to the federal judiciary. One federal appeals court may decide one way and another may reach a different ruling, but ultimately the federal Supreme Court decides the issue, Lindsay said.
“I would think that these cases, just without knowing anymore, and I’m more than happy to research it more, but it would follow that type of pattern,” Lindsay said. “So ultimately, the Supreme Court can decide this issue as to whether or not the [compulsory vaccination law] applies, whether or not the state has a compelling interest with regard to vaccination of children.”
The hearing in the Kanawha case is now set for 9 a.m. Friday.

(Photo by John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)Airports in multiple states, including South Dakota, are not airing a video of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem in which she blames the ongoing federal government shutdown on Democrats.
The video was promoted by the White House as being played at “every public airport in America.”
In South Dakota, a spokesperson for Rapid City Regional Airport said Wednesday it was not airing the video because the airport’s administration has not instructed staff do so. At Sioux Falls Regional Airport, Executive Director Dan Letellier said the video is not airing because the airport does not have monitors appropriate for the purpose. He said existing monitors are devoted to flight-related information.
Phoenix Sky Harbor Airport and Phoenix-Mesa Gateway Airport both confirmed to Arizona Mirror that they are not displaying the video.
Airport spokesman Ryan Smith said the video is not currently displayed at the airport due to the Mesa Gateway Airport Authority Board policy, which states that “(a)dvertising that discusses the topics or subjects of politics or religion, social society, or economics is prohibited.”

“Consistent with airport policy, Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport declined to post the video,” Jon Brodsky, a spokesman for the state’s largest airport, said. Sky Harbor also has a policy that does not permit political content.
The Michigan Advance reports that spokespeople for both the Flint Bishop International Airport and Grand Rapids’ Gerald R. Ford International Airport confirmed Monday afternoon that they have not been playing the video.
Heidi Groenboom, communications and events associate for the Gerald R. Ford International Airport Authority said that as of Monday afternoon, they had not received the video and that it was not playing at the airport.
New Jersey Monitor reports that the region’s three largest airports will not air the video, saying not only does it violate a ban on political advertising but it also violates the federal Hatch Act, which prohibits federal workers from engaging in politics on the clock.
The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, a bistate agency that oversees Newark Liberty, LaGuardia and JFK airports, said airport-controlled screens will not play Noem’s video.
The 30-second spot violates the Port Authority’s longstanding policies that “prevent airing of politically partisan messages at our facilities,” a spokesperson said in a statement.
In the video, Noem — who formerly served as governor of South Dakota — said “Democrats in Congress refuse to fund the federal government” while acknowledging the shutdown has affected operations, with many TSA employees working without pay.
“We will continue to do all that we can to avoid delays that will impact your travel. And our hope is that Democrats will soon recognize the importance of opening the government,” Noem said.

Free.,Congressional Hispanic Caucus protests GOP delay swearing in Rep.-elect Grijalva,Ariana Figueroa,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/congressional-hispanic-caucus-protests-gop-delay-swearing-rep-elect-grijalva,,"WASHINGTON — Outside the U.S. Capitol Wednesday, Rep.-elect Adelita Grijalva, who won her election last month and will become Arizona’s first elected Latina, said the House speaker's delay in swearing her in was “intentional.”“This delay is not procedural,” she said, joined by members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus. House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., has repeatedly argued that he’s holding off on swearing in the Arizona Democrat elected last month to fill the seat of her late father, Raúl Grijalva, who died earlier this year, until Senate Democrats vote to reopen the government. The shutdown now has continued for 15 days.  “She won her election after the House was out of session,” said Johnson, who has kept the House out while the shutdown extends. “That hasn't been scheduled because we haven't had that session yet. As soon as (Sen.) Chuck Schumer opens the government…we'll have that as soon as we get back to business.” Epstein petitionJohnson has previously sworn in three members when the House was not in session — two Republicans and one Democrat. But Democrats charge that Johnson is holding off on swearing in Grijalva because she would give Democrats and a handful of Republicans the final vote to compel the Department of Justice to release documents regarding the late sex offender and wealthy financier Jeffrey Epstein, who frequently socialized with the president. Republicans control the House by a slim 219-213 majority.“Speaker Johnson knows that I will be the 218th signature on the discharge petition,” Grijalva said, referring to a bipartisan petition to force a vote on the measure. “He is doing everything in his power to shield this administration from accountability.” Democrats earlier this month tried to get recognition during the House pro forma session to swear in Grijalva, but Republicans presiding over the chamber ignored those efforts. Arizona Attorney General Kris Mayes has also threatened Johnson with legal action if Grijalva is not sworn in.The chair of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, Rep. Adriano Espaillat of New York, said Democrats are “looking at all possible options.”“But we are demanding from Speaker Johnson to seat her immediately so that the folks that she represents, the people that she represents, continue to get the services that they deserve to get,” he said.Senators from Arizona speak outArizona’s Democratic Sens. Mark Kelly and Ruben Gallego said they have pressed for Johnson to swear in Grijalva and have demanded answers. Kelly, who lives in Grijalva’s district, said those constituents don’t have representation in Congress.“And that is wrong,” he said.Gallego was blunt about the reason for Grijalva’s delay.“Speaker Johnson is protecting pedophiles,” he said. “He has one more day to protect all those pedophiles, whether it's involving Donald Trump or any of his rich, elite friends.”Last month, through a subpoena, House Democrats revealed a lewd image and inscription they alleged was a birthday note that President Donald Trump provided for Epstein’s 50th-birthday book compiled by the financier’s co-conspirator Ghislaine Maxwell.The subpoena stems from records in the government’s 2019 federal sex trafficking case against Epstein, which was brought to light after a year-long investigation by the Miami Herald that tracked down more than 60 women, most of whom were underage at the time, who detailed their sexual abuse.",,,,2025-10-15 13:57:30.893703

(Stock photo by hapabapa/Getty Images)The United States Agriculture Department informed states including New Mexico that it will not pay for food stamps in November if the ongoing government shutdown continues, the state’s Health Care Authority secretary said Wednesday
The order could mean the state’s 450,000 recipients of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program won’t receive nearly $90 million in benefits next month, HCA Secretary Kari Armijo told lawmakers on the Legislative Finance Committee during a meeting Wednesday morning in Santa Fe.
In addition, Armijo said the USDA informed states it may revoke the authorization of the state’s roughly 1,700 SNAP retailers, “so folks with SNAP benefits on their cards would not be able to access those benefits starting in November,” she said.
Armijo said the USDA informed states including New Mexico about the change Friday, Oct. 10, prompting the HCA to prepare for the impact. Roughly one of every five New Mexicans receive SNAP benefits, giving it the highest rate of SNAP reliance in the country.
Five things to know about federal food assistance cuts before the special session

“We are prepared to, if the shutdown comes to an end in the next couple of weeks, really act quickly and make sure that folks get those benefits as timely as possible in November,” she said. 
“But as of right now, it’s looking like those benefits will be delayed,” she said. 
The USDA also recently announced it was transferring funds into the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children — known as WIC—to keep it running through October.
The HCA is alerting food banks about the abrupt termination of benefits, Armijo said, in anticipation of increased demand at food bank lines. The authority is also trying to expedite the delivery of roughly $8 million in funding for food banks lawmakers approved in the special legislative session earlier this month. 
The Authority is also preparing notices to SNAP recipients, she said, and it is trying to identify other sources for food and donations. 
An HCA spokesperson provided Source New Mexico with the one-page letter the USDA sent states on Oct. 10. It cites the ongoing federal government shutdown and says, “If the current lapse in appropriations continues, there will be insufficient funds to pay full November SNAP benefits for approximately 42 million individuals across the Nation.”
The letter goes on to instruct states not to submit client files to statewide SNAP vendors they’d need to approve SNAP purchases in November, “in the interest of preserving maximum flexibility.”
With SNAP cuts looming, a growing Albuquerque food line may foreshadow future need

LFC Director Charles Sallee told lawmakers earlier Wednesday that his agency heard about the change Tuesday and was seeking clarity about why administrators for SNAP, a permanent program typically unaffected in a federal shutdown, would be claiming the program has no funding. 
“We’re following up with HCA as well as other folks to verify whether food stamps is really out of money or if this is just a tactic that the administration is playing in the overall negotiation,” he said. 
The HCA is also seeking clarity from the USDA about whether funds the state receives to administer SNAP will also be cut or delayed. 
The possible revocation of SNAP retailer authorization would render other legislative funding during the Oct. 1 special session moot, Armijo said. Lawmakers approved $16.6 million to maintain SNAP benefits ahead of federal cuts in the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act.”
“So all of the investments that we’ve made in terms of those state funded supplements also would not be able to be utilized,” she said.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/snapposter-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-15 13:02:29.615761

(Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — Oklahoma’s new education chief said Wednesday he has “no plans to distribute Bibles” or a biblical curriculum in public schools, reversing course from his predecessor, Ryan Walters.
State Superintendent Lindel Fields, who was appointed to the position this month, indicated Wednesday he will not fight in court to defend Walters’ order that Oklahoma public schools teach from the Bible and keep a copy of it in every classroom. 
A lawsuit, which 32 Oklahomans filed with the state Supreme Court last year, challenged the mandate and Walters’ attempt to purchase 55,000 Bibles and a biblical curriculum through a public bidding process.
“We plan to file a motion to dismiss, and have no plans to distribute Bibles or a biblical character education curriculum in classrooms,” Fields announced in a statement Wednesday. “If resources are left to be allocated, the timing is fortunate since the team and I are currently reviewing the (Oklahoma State Department of Education) budget.”
The Oklahoma Supreme Court on Tuesday gave Fields until Oct. 28 to decide whether to resolve the lawsuit by withdrawing the Bible directives. 
Represented by local and national legal groups, 32 parents, students, educators and faith leaders sued Walters, the Education Department, the Oklahoma State Board of Education and the Office of Management and Enterprise Services, which oversees bidding and purchasing for state agencies.

Requiring biblical instruction in public schools and purchasing Bibles with taxpayer dollars violates the Oklahoma Constitution’s ban on state-established religion, they contend.
The Supreme Court acknowledged there’s been “significant turnover” of the public officials involved in the case. Walters resigned from office Sept. 30 to lead a conservative nonprofit, and Gov. Kevin Stitt has replaced every member of the state Board of Education since the lawsuit was filed in October 2024. The head of the Office of Management and Enterprise Services, Rick Rose, also recently resigned.
Fields became the lead defendant in the case when Stitt appointed him to finish Walters’ term as state superintendent.
Attorneys for the plaintiffs are working with the Education Department to determine what, if any, impact the change in public officers will have on the case, said Megan Lambert, legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Oklahoma, one of the organizations that filed the lawsuit.
Lambert declined to comment on Fields’ announcement Wednesday because nothing has been filed yet in court.
The state Supreme Court hasn’t reached a final decision in the lawsuit, but it agreed in March to block the Education Department from purchasing Bibles and a biblical curriculum while the case is pending.
Walters’ administration already purchased more than 500 Bibles to give to Advanced Placement government classes.
In a separate case, the Court temporarily barred the implementation of Walters’ new academic standards for social studies courses that would have required public schools to teach Bible stories and the teachings of Jesus.
Walters said this instruction would help contextualize the beliefs of America’s founding fathers and key historical figures. He also called the separation of church and state a myth.

Mike Kehoe, center, speaks to reporters about the Missouri redistricting plan Sept. 25 during a visit to Columbia Regional Airport (Rudi Keller/Missouri Independent).A filing in one of the many lawsuits challenging Missouri’s gerrymandered redistricting plan appears to cast uncertainty on Republican Gov. Mike Kehoe’s statements that the map was prepared by staff in his office.
A lawsuit filed by the committee seeking to force a referendum on the map states: “Governor Kehoe prepared and provided to the General Assembly the new congressional districts and accompanying map.”
In an answer filed Tuesday, Missouri Attorney General Catherine Hanaway’s office wrote: “State Defendant admits that various governmental actors participated in the State’s 2025 congressional reapportionment. To the extent further response is required, State Defendant denies the allegations…”
The lawsuit was filed by a political action committee called Politicians Not People against Republican Secretary of State Denny Hoskins after he rejected three proposed referendum petitions because they were filed before Kehoe signed the bill.  The answer also denies that Hoskins made any error and asserts that People not Politicians filed suit in the wrong court and against the wrong defendant.
Missouri Democrats have publicly questioned the governor’s public statements that his office crafted the new map, arguing instead that it most likely came from President Donald Trump’s White House.

The phrasing used by the state’s attorneys is revealing, state Sen. Maggie Nurrenbern, a Democrat from Kansas City, said in an interview with The Independent.
“I am not surprised at all to see the attorney general use this language,” she said. “Obviously now we are entering the court of law and facts matter.”
All along, Nurrenbern said, she has been convinced “this map was just a copy and paste from Washington, D.C.” 
Discovering the map’s author has been frustrating, she said, and it was never adequately answered during the special session. Lawmakers were not fully trained on mapping software, she said, and no map was produced by legislative staff.
“The day that the governor called the extraordinary session, the map was already done,” Nurrenbern said, “and so that’s why I could say with absolute certainty that this map was not drawn in the state.”
Throughout the special session and after, Kehoe’s office has been adamant that it was done by the governor’s staff without assistance from Washington.
Chuck Hatfield, an attorney representing People Not Politicians in its lawsuit, said he was surprised by the state’s response. It could mean, he said, that Kehoe didn’t personally make the map. But he said “various governmental actors” is certainly broad enough to include federal employees at the White House.
 “Why are people embarrassed about taking credit for this bill?” Hatfield said. 
Hanaway’s office did not respond immediately to requests for clarification. A spokeswoman for the governor’s office said Tuesday that the original filing “does not specifically say ‘Governor Kehoe’s office’” prepared and provided the map.
On Wednesday morning, Cole County Circuit Judge Daniel Green set the case for a trial on Nov. 4. Green is being asked to decide whether a referendum can be launched as soon as lawmakers take the final vote on a bill or if petitioners must wait until a bill is signed.
In a news release Wednesday, Hoskins said he had approved a new version of the referendum petition and that signature gathering could begin. Any signatures already gathered, Hoskins said, are not valid and gathering them before his approval of the petition form is a misdemeanor.
People Not Politicians said last week that it had collected more than 50,000 signatures from registered voters. The campaign needs at least 106,384 signatures spread over six of the state’s eight congressional districts to put it on a ballot.
The referendum campaign has until Dec. 11 to turn in signatures.
Nurrenbern said she has personally been collecting signatures to put the new map on the ballot next year. She sees Hoskins’ warning about signatures gathered before his approval as a personal threat that she may be prosecuted.
“It is incredibly frustrating that we have a secretary of state using the office to intimidate voters and threaten democracy,” Nurrenbern said.
The new Missouri map targets the Kansas-City based 5th District, held by Democratic U.S. Rep. Emanuel Cleaver, with the goal of winning seven of Missouri’s congressional seats for the GOP.
Lawmakers approved the new map after Trump started pressuring Misouri Republicans in July to redraw the districts. A special session in Texas was preparing to revise that state’s 34 districts to provide as many as five new safe GOP districts. In retaliation, California lawmakers put a new district map on that state’s ballot with the aim to shift five seats to Democrats. 
Court battle looms over KC precinct listed twice in Missouri’s new congressional map

In a lawsuit currently underway in Texas, Adam Kincaid, executive director of the National Republican Redistricting Trust, testified Oct. 7 that he prepared the map passed by the Texas legislature.
According to records obtained by The Independent, Kincaid produced a memo used by the map’s legislative sponsor in Missouri explaining the details of the new districts. In a September interview with The Independent, he insisted that is not evidence that he had a hand in creating the map.
In an interview Tuesday, Kincaid said he would not discuss whether he had a role in the Missouri map.
“I am going to defer to the governor’s office and the AG’s office on that,” he said.
Along with the lawsuit over referendum rules, there are four other lawsuits in various stages where opponents of the new map seek to have it declared unconstitutional. One, filed by the NAACP of Missouri, argues Kehoe had no authority to call lawmakers into special session and have all actions of the special session declared void.
The case was argued Sept. 15 before Cole County Circuit Judge Christopher Limbaugh, who has yet to make a ruling.
There is one other case in Cole County that directly challenges the redistricting plan and two more filed in Jackson County.
The Cole County case is set for a trial on Nov. 12, also before Limbaugh. In the lawsuit, which also has Hatfield as the lead attorney, the plaintiffs argue the Missouri Constitution only allows redistricting to occur immediately after the state receives a new census report.
“All we’ve got to do is look at the Constitution, take a look and see whether they can do redistricting,” Hatfield said. “The answer to that is no, they can’t do it at all.”
The Jackson County cases are not scheduled for trial. One includes accusations that the map approved by lawmakers is flawed and therefore not valid because it uses the same precinct in two different districts.
The other, filed the day Kehoe signed the bill, includes the argument that no authority exists in the Constitution allowing lawmakers to revise congressional districts in the absence of new census data. It also argues that the districts are not legal because they are not compact and stretch for hundreds of miles across the state.
Hatfield said he would like clarification on the statement denying Kehoe prepared the map as well as other statements in the answer that deny statements of fact, such as that the legislature passed the redistricting bill.
“It’s them being difficult,” Hatfield said, “but it’s just lawyer games.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Kehoe-Columbia-Regional-20250925-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-10-15 13:02:29.615761

(Getty Images)While New Mexico made progress in 2024 battling syphilis and congenital syphilis, the state’s primary and secondary syphilis rates remain twice the national average. As such, the state Department of Health on Wednesday announced a renewal of a 2022 public health order with “aggressive testing requirements” to sustain the state’s progress “and protect newborns from preventable deaths,” a news release said.
Syphilis, a sexually transmitted disease, becomes congenital syphilis when it passes from mother to child. Congenital syphilis can cause birth defects, along with fetal or infant death. In 2023, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ranked New Mexico second-highest in the nation for both congenital syphilis and primary/secondary syphilis. According to data in the public health order, that year New Mexico had a congenital syphilis rate of 422.9 per 100,000 live births, which represented an 874% increase from 2018.
Last year, New Mexico’s primary and secondary syphilis rates dropped 31%, while its congenital syphilis rates decreased 19.6%, NMDOH said. Those decreases represented the state’s first decline in syphilis rates since 2018. Nonetheless, the state’s primary and secondary syphilis rates remain twice the national average.
The public health order directs medical professionals to continue syphilis testing for all individuals aged 18 to 50 across New Mexico; to test pregnant individuals during the first and third trimester and at delivery; and syphilis testing for all pregnant people at correctional facilities, among other provisions.
“Congenital syphilis is entirely preventable, so our continued focus on testing and treatment is saving babies’ lives and protecting families,” Janine Waters, NMDOH sexually transmitted disease program manager, said in a statement. “This public health order targets interventions to reverse one of the most challenging public health threats.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Pregnancyultrasound-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-15 13:02:29.615761

For decades, the 59-year-old has pursued appeals across state and federal courts challenging his death sentence as well as a separate aggravated assault and rape case. As of midday Wednesday, the U.S. Supreme Court had not announced whether it would hear Crawford’s case and stay the execution. 
Crawford was convicted of capital murder in 1994 for taking 20-year-old Kristie Ray from her family’s Tippah County home to a wooden cabin where he handcuffed and raped her and stabbed her in the chest. 
As of this year, 37 executions have been carried out around the country, according to the Death Penalty Information Center. Crawford’s planned execution will be the third in the U.S. this week, following Tuesday executions in Florida and Missouri. Six more are scheduled through the end of the year. 
Ray’s mother, Mary Ray, told the Northeast Mississippi Daily Journal after years of waiting, she is glad that Crawford’s execution will happen. 
“We are not vengeful people; we just want justice for our daughter,” she said.
Over the years and the days leading up to the execution, her mother, family and friends shared pictures of Kristie on social media and set them as their Facebook profile pictures. 
On Monday, Republican Gov. Tate Reeves denied Crawford clemency because of the nature of the crime and because he had never claimed innocence. This execution will be the fourth Reeves has declined to block since he’s been in office: one in 2021, another in 2022 and the last in June of this year. 
“Mississippi is praying for Ms. Ray and her family,” Reeves said in a Monday statement. “Justice must be served on behalf of victims. In Mississippi, it will be.”
At the time of the killing, Crawford was out on bond and days away from another trial for the rape of a teenage girl and assault of another one in the same county. Members of his family and a former attorney testified how they contacted law enforcement because they feared Crawford was committing another crime, which led to his arrest in Ray’s death. 
Charles Crawford Credit: Mississippi Department of Corrections
Crawford has said he didn’t remember the killing and that he experienced blackouts. But after his arrest, he showed law enforcement where to find Ray’s body. He said he experienced similar blackouts for the earlier assault and rape. 
In a petition to the U.S. Supreme Court, Crawford’s attorneys argued his trial attorney conceded his guilt to the jury and told jurors during the closing arguments that he was “legally responsible” for the crimes and “still dangerous to the community.” 
They argued it was a Sixth Amendment violation of the accused’s right to defense because the attorneys made the concessions against Crawford’s repeated objections, according to court records. 
After the nation’s high court declined to take up his case in 2014, the Mississippi attorney general’s office asked the state Supreme Court to set an execution. But the justices did not set one because Crawford was appealing his rape conviction, which prosecutors considered an aggravating factor when pursuing the death penalty. 
In post-conviction motions, he argued that reversing the conviction would invalidate his death sentence and require him to be resentenced. 
Crawford has been part of a few lawsuits challenging the use of certain drugs in executions. The most recent and ongoing lawsuit filed in July of this year is a federal class action with four other death row inmates challenging the Mississippi Department of Correction’s three-drug lethal injection protocol. 
In a separate federal lawsuit challenging the drugs used in Mississippi, U.S. District Judge Henry Wingate allowed the executions of two of the plaintiffs to proceed: that of Richard Jordan and Thomas Loden. 
Starting Wednesday afternoon in the hour before the execution, death penalty opponents plan to stand in front of the Governor’s Mansion in Jackson and some will demonstrate outside the main gate of Parchman. 
Anti-death penalty organizations circulated petitions against Crawford’s execution that together have received over 1,000 signatures. Death Penalty Action’s petition was delivered to the governor’s office Tuesday. 
Last week, Mississippi prison reform advocate Mitzi Magleby and the Rev. Jeff Hood, a spiritual adviser to death row prisoners, spoke out in front of the Mississippi Supreme Court to call on Gov. Reeves and the state to stop pursuing executions, which they said are part of a system built on vengeance. 
They said Crawford should be held accountable for Ray’s death, but that can be done by having him serve life without parole. Both have spoken with Crawford and said they have found a changed man who works a prison job and has stayed out of trouble during his incarceration. 
“We are not God,” Magleby said about carrying out death sentences. “Mississippi is not God. We are humans who are not supposed to kill other human beings … The death of Charles Crawford will do nothing to heal anyone. It will do nothing to make the state of Missisisppi any safer than it is now.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/06081403/AP060710014048.jpg,,,2025-10-15 13:02:29.615761

Kennedy Jr. 
It’s the largest move by states to diverge from recent policy decisions under Kennedy that have alarmed medical and public health experts, from federal funding cuts for health services to changes to vaccine guidance.
The participating governors are from California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Rhode Island and Washington, as well as the U.S. territory of Guam.
Blue states hold on to public health dollars while red states lose out

“This alliance is a commitment to transparency, preparedness, and coordination so that no state faces health threats alone,” Delaware Gov. Matt Meyer said in a statement.
“By working together, governors can share data, resources, and lessons learned to strengthen our preparedness for the next public health challenge.”
The new Governors Public Health Alliance is intended to strengthen collaboration among the states in emergency preparedness and communication, to help them share data and expertise, and to improve response times to health threats. Although the participating governors are all Democrats, they’re billing the coalition as nonpartisan.
The new alliance comes on the heels of previous regional coordination efforts such as the West Coast Health Alliance between California, Oregon and Washington.
In recent months, at least 17 states have sidestepped federal guidance and promoted broader access to the COVID-19 vaccine. Those moves came in the wake of new COVID-19 vaccine guidance from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Food and Drug Administration, both under the leadership of Kennedy, a well-known vaccine skeptic.
“As extremists try to weaponize the CDC and spread misinformation, we’re stepping up to coordinate across states, protect communities and ensure decisions are driven by data, facts, and the health of the American people,” California Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom said in a statement.
Meanwhile, major professional societies such as the American Academy of Family Physicians and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists have released their own guidance that diverges from federal policy on a number of issues, from vaccines to autism.
The new Governors Public Health Alliance will be supported by the nonprofit Governors Action Alliance, or GovAct, an initiative overseen by a group of former governors that include both Republicans and Democrats.

Sept. 17, 2025 | Photo by Kyle Davidson/Michigan AdvanceMichigan’s Department of Health and Human Services was given the green light by the Court of Claims to go forward with a competitive bidding process for the state’s prepaid inpatient mental health plan providers and a plan to reduce the number of regions for those plans, which ensure access to mental health services for Medicaid beneficiaries, from 10 to three. 
In a set of two opinions issued on Tuesday, Court of Claims Judge Christopher Yates denied a preliminary injunction to a set of those service managers and providers that would have prevented the department from continuing the bidding process for the selection of those prepaid inpatient health plans in three regions across the state. 
The decision “seems unwise given the history of those existing PIHPs with the program and their strong connections with CMHSPs and providers,” Yates wrote in the first order issued. “But assessing the wisdom of such changes is a matter of policy reserved for the MDHHS, not the courts.”
That order stated that the department’s plan to restructure the prepaid unpaid health plan to a competitive system is “not only compatible with state law, but also regarded as the preferred nationwide model.”
The change had previously drawn heavy criticism from mental health advocates, who said that it would lead to increased privatization of the system. 
Former U.S. Sen. Debbie Stabenow (D-Lansing), said in September, “We’re talking about a proposal that would replace a managed care system that is transparent and cost about 2% for a private managed system that is not transparent and will cost more like 15% tell me about the math on that one, resulting in $500 million in additional [overhead] costs.”

And in August, CEO of the Community Mental Health Association of Michigan Robert Sheehan wrote in a press release praising the lawsuit, saying it “illegally eliminates the public managed care organization … entrusted with managing the care for some of the most vulnerable and resilient members of our communities.”
The Community Mental Health Association declined to comment on the recent court orders. 
The providers filing suit claimed that, because the new structure would require each provider to cover an entire region of the three — and these existing providers had previously only covered one region of 10 — it would essentially force them out of business. 
Yates did not dispute this, but wrote, “That concern has nothing to do with the legality of the competitive procurement system.”
“In other words, although plaintiffs describe their own treatment as impermissible under Michigan law, they cannot establish that the shift from a single-source procurement system to a competitive procurement system impermissibly alters the structure of PIHPs and CMHSPs,” he added.
Yates did not rule on one element of the case in his orders — the legality of the language in the Request for Proposal put forth by the Michigan Department of Technology, Management, and Budget to collect bids for these these contracts. 
In his second order denying the injunction, Yates wrote, “Only when declaratory relief has failed should the courts even begin to consider additional forms of relief in these situations.” 
Because of the remaining question about the Request for Proposal language, Yates said that that the question of injunctive relief could be reconsidered once a decision had been made on that final portion of the case.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-10-15 15:12:29+00:00,CT Mirror,Connecticut DCF launches review after remains of 12-year-old found in New Britain,Jim Haddadin | Connecticut Public,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/10/15/ct-dcf-review-new-britain-girl-remains/,Questions about DCF’s contact emerged after New Britain Mayor Erin Stewart said the agency had been involved with the girl’s family.,"Connecticut’s child welfare agency is reviewing its involvement with the family of a 12-year-old girl whose remains were found in New Britain last week.
Interim Department of Children and Families (DCF) Commissioner Susan Hamilton said in a statement Tuesday the agency is looking into its past contact with Jacqueline “Mimi” Torres Garcia and her caregivers.
“Consistent with our practice, this multidisciplinary review will include our knowledge about the family, supports provided, casework decisions, adherence to policy, as well as communication and collaboration with other system and community partners,” Hamilton said.
Questions about DCF’s contact with the family emerged after New Britain Mayor Erin Stewart said Monday that the agency had previously been involved with the girl’s family. The extent of that engagement remains unclear.
Torres Garcia attended public schools in New Britain from kindergarten through fifth grade. Her mother withdrew Torres Garcia from the school system on Aug. 26, 2024, the first day of sixth grade, and provided a new address for the family in Farmington, according to a spokesperson for the Consolidated School District of New Britain. The girl’s mother filed a notice the same day indicating Torres Garcia would receive instruction at home, according to the school system.
Authorities said Torres Garcia was never reported missing. New Britain police discovered her body Oct. 8, 2025 inside a storage bin after receiving a report of suspicious activity at an abandoned home in the city.
Investigators believe Torres Garcia likely died in fall 2024 while her family lived in Farmington. Farmington Police Chief Paul Melanson said evidence indicates she suffered prolonged physical abuse and malnourishment, and that her body was kept in a basement before being moved when the family relocated in March 2025.
The girl’s mother and her mother’s boyfriend have been charged with her murder. An aunt was also charged with unlawful restraint, risk of injury to a minor and intentional cruelty to a person under 19 years old.
The case comes several months after an arrest in Waterbury raised questions about the adequacy of Connecticut’s child protection systems. A woman there is charged with holding her 32-year-old stepson captive for more than two decades, keeping him in a small room that was locked from the outside from the time he was 11.
The case sparked an extensive review by DCF, as well as contentious public policy debates about the safeguards in place for children who are homeschooled in Connecticut.
The victim in Waterbury told investigators his family pulled him out of school in fourth grade after school officials raised concern about his wellbeing. DCF said it investigated six reports involving the alleged victim, but didn’t find sufficient evidence to substantiate allegations of neglect.
Few details have emerged regarding DCF’s involvement with the family of Torres Garcia. A Farmington police spokesperson declined to provide additional information.
“The Farmington Police Department has begun to sift through the DCF documents, and it would be unfair to all involved to comment before we had a complete understanding of the amount of involvement and timeline as it relates to this family,” he wrote.
In her statement, the acting DCF commissioner wrote that siblings of Torres Garcia are safe and have been placed together in state custody. DCF encourages anyone with information regarding the matter to contact law enforcement.
State Rep. Anne Dauphinais, R-Killingly, ranking member of the Committee on Education, said she’s reserving judgment about the case until more information is available.
“If, at the end of August, she was pulled out for homeschooling, what happened before then? What was going on that people noted? Was she being followed by DCF before that? I have a lot of questions that I want answered,” Dauphinais said.
In a letter sent Tuesday, five lawmakers who represent New Britain in the Connecticut House and Senate called on DCF to provide a full and transparent accounting of how it handled the case. They outlined several key questions, including whether DCF coordinated with law enforcement and the school district.
“We stand ready to work with your office, with local partners, and with the broader community to strengthen the safety net for children and families in New Britain and across the state,” the letter reads. “Every child deserves to grow up safe, seen, and protected.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Jacqueline-22Mimi22-Torres-Garcia-Memorial-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-15 12:04:44.769170

(Photo by AnnMarie Hilton/ Maine Morning Star)When Central Maine Power asked the Maine Public Utilities Commission for a massive rate hike last month — just three months after their previous rate increase kicked in — Mainers responded with disbelief and anger. Many already struggle to pay surging utility bills amid a flood tide of rising living expenses. Now CMP wants everyone to cough up another $420 per year on average.
CMP said it wants to make the grid more resilient in order to “provide greater financial stability and predictability for our customers.” The company argues that by increasing rates and investing in grid improvements it will boost reliability and reduce the amount of money it collects from ratepayers for “storm cost recovery” (the company wanted $228 million for 2024 storms alone).
But it’s not clear that raising rates will benefit CMP customers. As Maine’s Public Advocate Heather Sanborn put it, “while CMP claims that its plan is designed to provide ‘price stability,’ it is actually asking for greater profits and large, automatic rate increases over the next five years.” 
Even if CMP’s investments make the grid less prone to storm damage and reduce recovery costs, the net result for customers will be bigger bills that grow larger with each passing year.
The Public Utilities Commission should reject CMP’s rate hike request for two reasons. First, CMP is asking for too much profit — it wants almost 10% off the top, which is excessive for a low-risk investment in a protected monopoly. Regulated utilities are entitled to a “fair and reasonable” return but no more.
As former utility executive turned consumer advocate Mark Ellis argues, a reasonable rate of return for regulated utilities should align with the market-based cost of capital for similar low-risk investment, which is more on the order of 6%. For CMP to pocket over 60% more to further enrich shareholders and executives when many customers are struggling to pay for basic necessities is unacceptable. Why should Mainers be squeezed harder while CMP rakes in bigger profits (up 61% since 2014)?
Second, CMP hasn’t done its homework — two summers ago the Public Utilities Commission asked the company to submit a 10-year “Integrated Grid Plan” mapping out a detailed roadmap for how it will improve Maine’s grid. The plan is due in January but, as of late August, CMP was still in the “needs assessment” phase. 
Meanwhile, CMP released its own five-year “Investing in Maine’s Future” plan to justify the big rate hike. This plan is much more limited in scope than what the Public Utilities Commission asked for, mainly focused on investments like hiring line workers, replacing poles and wires, and tree work — all worthwhile improvements but hardly a comprehensive plan to modernize Maine’s grid for the 21st century.
Before the Public Utilities Commission considers burdening Mainers with such an enormous rate increase, it should insist that CMP submit the Integrated Grid Plan that was requested almost a year and a half ago. CMP needs to show it has a detailed roadmap for overhauling the grid infrastructure and, just as importantly, it needs to show it is capable of successfully undertaking the project. 
We all agree that we need to invest in Maine’s grid to make it more resilient, to support greater demand as Maine transitions from petroleum fuels to electricity, to accommodate more clean renewable generation sources, and to take advantage of more “smart grid” technology like distributed energy resources. This will require serious investment, expertise, and careful planning. There’s too much at stake here to simply allow CMP to jack rates up now before we have a clear comprehensive plan in place.
The commission should deny CMP’s rate increase request and tell the company to submit its Integrated Grid Plan first. And they should make it very clear they won’t allow CMP to profit excessively off the backs of Maine’s beleaguered ratepayers.

Caitlin Cavanagh, Michigan State University
Detroit is seeing declines in violent crime, but 33% more young people were victims of gun violence in the city so far in 2025 compared with the previous year, according to local police.
Mayor Mike Duggan and the Detroit Police Department responded by introducing the Summer Teen Safety Violence Prevention Plan in July 2025. As part of the plan, city leaders promised to increase curfew enforcement. Year-round, teens must abide by curfews of 10 p.m. or 11.p.m., depending on their age.
Also in July, the Detroit City Council voted to raise the fines parents will face if their children violate curfew to US$250 for a first offense and $500 for a second offense. Before the vote, parents were fined $75 for the first offense and $100 for the second, an amount that hadn’t been changed for decades.
I am a developmental psychologist and associate professor in the School of Criminal Justice at Michigan State University, where I study how juvenile justice policy affects children and families.
While the curfew and fines are designed to deter crime by encouraging parents to keep a closer eye on their kids, research suggests it could instead worsen economic hardship and existing inequities among vulnerable families.
I believe that understanding youth crime through the lens of adolescent development offers communities more promising ways forward.
 Parents play key role

Parents matter. Evidence shows strong parental involvement reduces youth crime. Parents who know what their children are doing, who their friends are and where they are spending their time are more likely to keep them out of criminal or dangerous situations.
At the same time, adolescence is a period when young people work to develop independent identities. Research shows that parents balance this transition most effectively not through surveillance but through showing genuine interest in their children’s lives, setting fair boundaries and staying connected.
Many people believe that teens value peers’ opinions more than their parents’. But the evidence shows that teens adopt the values and attitudes of caring parental figures, including their attitudes about the law.
The fact that parents have such a strong influence over delinquency makes the question of legal parental responsibility particularly important.
 What does the law say?

In the United States, parents may be held legally responsible for their children’s actions through civil and – in rare cases such as the Ethan Crumbley case – criminal liability. Crumbley’s parents were found guilty of involuntary manslaughter tied to a 2021 school shooting carried out by their son.
Fines like the ones imposed on Detroit parents for their children’s curfew violations are usually status offenses – behaviors that are illegal only because of a child’s status as a minor. Examples include consistently missing school, running away, underage drinking and curfew violations. The goal of curfews is to prevent delinquency late in the evening, although a systemic review of relevant research suggests that youth curfews have no effect on crime.
When minors are charged with a status offense, parents are automatically implicated. However, the role that parents play legally varies by state. Some states, including Michigan, impose purely punitive sanctions such as fines or jail time. Others, like Connecticut, combine culpability with parental support programs.
 Do parental responsibility laws work?

Despite widespread use, there’s little evidence to support the idea that parental responsibility laws deter delinquency. Instead, they may produce unintended harms.
Three challenges limit their effectiveness.
First, my own research finds that parents, particularly those from disadvantaged backgrounds, often lack knowledge of juvenile justice laws and processes. Parents cannot prevent or respond to violations they do not fully understand.
Second, fining parents for curfew violations may put extra financial pressure on families that are already struggling. These fines are based on the idea that parents aren’t supervising their children well enough. In reality, even caring and attentive parents may not be able to stop a teenager from breaking curfew if they’re working late or juggling multiple jobs. Families that can least afford these fines are hit the hardest, making their financial situation even worse. On top of that, fines can damage relationships between parents and kids, and add stress and stigma to the household.
Third, punishing parents with fines can make existing inequalities worse, since youth from disadvantaged backgrounds are more often cited for minor offenses such as curfew violations.
These penalties especially affect single mothers of color who already face poverty, heavy policing in their community and accumulated disadvantage from loss of generational wealth after decades of earning lower incomes.
 Why do kids engage in crime?

Finding appropriate solutions to youth crime necessitates understanding why youth engage in crime in the first place.
Neuropsychological research shows that teens are more prone to risk-taking because their brains are still developing. This fact was acknowledged by the U.S. Supreme Court in Roper v. Simmons and Miller v. Alabama, which protect minors from execution and mandatory life sentences.
Compared to adults, young people are less able to weigh long-term consequences, resist peer pressure, regulate emotions and control impulses. At the same time, their brains are especially sensitive to novelty and social rewards. This combination means that, in emotionally charged situations, teens may engage in risky or even harmful behavior despite potential consequences.
 What policies show promise?

Policies are most effective when they align with developmental science.
Research shows community-based programs, multisystemic therapy, risk-needs assessments and restorative justice work to reduce recidivism.
These approaches involve family and community resources, strengthen skills for adult life, and foster accountability without the added harms of punitive sanctions.
Positive parent-child relationships are critical to keep children out of crime. My research finds that high-quality parent-child relationships reduce first-offense recidivism, but the effect can erode with repeated offending.
This work highlights the need for rehabilitative interventions that strengthen – rather than burden – parent-child relationships. For example, research finds that family-focused programs that teach parenting strategies improve youth outcomes during and after court involvement.
Adolescents’ brains are still maturing, making them prone to impulsivity, sensation-seeking, and reward-driven behavior. While these tendencies can lead to harmful behavior such as crime, they can also take positive forms such as pushing limits in sports or getting on stage in the school play.
Community-based programs that offer safe, supportive spaces can redirect youths’ natural risk-taking into positive outlets. Activities that capitalize on strengths, such as the arts, sports and clubs, foster belonging and purpose while reducing isolation and reliance on antisocial peers.

The Afterschool Alliance is a nonprofit working to ensure that children have access to quality afterschool programs. Its America After 3PM survey finds that 76% of South Dakota parents with a child in an afterschool program rate it as excellent or very good, and there is broad support among South Dakota parents for public funding for the programs.
Overall in South Dakota, the parents of 64,080 children want afterschool programs while 21,645 children are enrolled, the study found. Nearly 9 in 10 South Dakota parents favor public funding for afterschool opportunities, according to the survey. A majority of parents in the state say the programs keep kids safe, build their social skills and responsible decision making, and help parents keep their jobs and boost their productivity at work.
Conducted by Edge Research, the fifth edition of America After 3PM is based on a survey of 30,515 U.S. parents with school-age children in their households, including in-depth interviews with 222 in South Dakota.

“When a customer comes in, they have to physically get out and come into the facility and go through the normal check-in process,” Hendren said. “And for some of our customers that are disabled, that’s a burden.”
According to the rule draft, customers would pay for the products online so no cash is exchanged outside the facility in the pickup location. The pickup site would need the same video camera monitoring and recording the drive-through lanes currently have. 
The dispensaries would need to post a sign, stating: “It is against the law to operate a dangerous device, motor vehicle, aircraft, or motorboat while under the influence of marijuana,” according to the draft.
The draft released Tuesday is not part of a formal rulemaking process, according to a press release by the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services, which oversees the division.
It’s “instead part of DHSS’ ongoing efforts to gather all relevant input before formally filing proposed rules and proposed changes to rules,” the press release states. 
The proposed amendment is designed to improve cannabis licensee operations by, “offering a more accessible purchasing option for medical patients, primary caregivers and consumers, particularly those with physical limitations,” it states.

Franklin County Court of Common Pleas Judge Carl Aveni granted a 14-day temporary restraining order on Gov. Mike DeWine’s executive order banning the sale of intoxicating hemp products on Oct. 14. 
DeWine announced last week a 90-day executive order that bans the sale of intoxicating hemp products that also started on Oct.14. The next hearing in this case is scheduled for Oct. 28.

Intoxicating hemp products are items that contain THC that are sold anywhere other than licensed marijuana dispensaries including gas stations, smoke shops, and CBD stores, among others. 
Marijuana is not considered an intoxicating hemp product and is legal in Ohio. This ban does not affect the marijuana law passed by voters in 2023.
“While we continue to fight in court, today’s developments underscore our continued desire to work with the General Assembly to pass permanent legislation regarding intoxicating hemp,” DeWine said in a statement.
Titan Logistic Group, Fumee Smoke and Vape and Invicta Partners — all members of the Ohio Healthy Alternatives Association — filed a lawsuit last week against the ban, arguing DeWine is breaking federal and state law by restricting access to these products. 
“Today’s decision allows thousands of hardworking Ohio entrepreneurs to continue supporting their families and serving consumers who rely on access to safe, legal, and properly regulated hemp products,” Ohio Healthy Alternatives Association said in a statement.
The 2018 Farm Bill says hemp can be grown legally if it contains less than 0.3% THC. 
“The Executive Order is overly broad in that it applies to all hemp and hemp products including those that are legal under the 2018 Farm Bill and Ohio’s current laws,” the lawsuit says. 
“It is also vague because there is no definition of ‘intoxicating hemp’ in the Ohio Revised Code or Ohio Administrative Code.”
DeWine — who has been calling on lawmakers to regulate or ban delta-8 THC products since January 2024 — spent much of last week’s press conference where he announced the ban talking about the need to protect children from these products. 
It was reported in January 2024 that there had been at least 257 reports of delta-8 poisoning in Ohio in recent years — including 102 in 2023 and 40 that involved children under six-years-old, according to the Ohio Poison Control Center.

The plaintiffs, however, disagree.
“Governor DeWine lacks a basis to use an executive order to regulate all hemp products because there is no evidence hemp products pose an imminent threat to public health,” the lawsuit reads. 
Ohio has more than 4,000 small businesses and family-owned businesses that sell hemp products, according to the lawsuit. 
The Ohio Capital Journal talked to people in the hemp industry who were worried what DeWine’s ban would mean for their businesses and customers. 
Hemp products account for all of Titan’s sales and they will be forced to close if the ban goes into effect, according to the court documents. 
Approximately 25% of Fumee’s sales are hemp products and they expect to fire half of their staff if the ban takes place, according to the court documents. 
“Governor DeWine’s order was not only unlawful — it was an abuse of executive authority that threatened to devastate an entire sector overnight,” Dakota Sawyer of American Republic Policy said in a statement. “Today’s decision restores sanity and due process.”
Jim Higdon, co-founder of Cornbread Hemp in Kentucky, which sells its products in more than 300 Ohio retail stores, said the judge’s ruling was a win for Ohio. 
“By granting the TRO, the court recognized that Governor DeWine’s reckless executive order should not take effect without proper legislative debate and due process,” Higdon said in a statement.
“This decision protects adult Ohioans’ access to federally legal hemp products and sends a clear message to the legislature that it must act.”
There are a handful of bills in the Ohio legislature that would regulate intoxicating hemp products in various ways.
At least 32 states have some regulations on intoxicating hemp products.

At the time, the cooperative had 925 people — both office personnel and linemen working 16-hour shifts — who it needed to keep safe, said CEO Gary Stooksbury.
“When you have a situation like we had, people get desperate,” Stooksbury said. “And when people get desperate, they do things that they normally would not do.”

Downed power lines were not the only hazard electric workers encountered on the job following the deadly storm that swept across much of the Southeast.
Sometimes, the danger came from the residents of 1.3 million South Carolina homes and business left in the dark by the storm a year ago.
In an effort to protect their crews and prevent similar issues in the future, the Palmetto State’s power cooperatives plan to ask legislators to enact a law to deter people who might threaten or attack linemen or other workers, such as road crews, responding at times of natural disaster.
“Our focus is to make sure anybody who is restoring critical infrastructure in a time of natural disaster is protected,” said John Frick, the cooperatives’ senior vice president for public policy. “You’re really talking about people’s lives and families out there that will be forever affected. So, you have to make sure you protect the workers that are just out there doing their job.”
This could include tougher criminal penalties for threats made during a state of emergency.
South Carolina already has laws on the books that apply in times of emergency declared by the governor, such as fines and misdemeanor penalties for business owners convicted of price gouging, as well as felony charges for looters.
“Most of the public has been extremely good to our people and first responders,” Frick said.
That included church congregations that brought meals for linemen and school children who wrote and mailed thank you cards.
“But a few people have not (been good),” Frick said. “That endangers everybody and actually slows down restoration efforts.”
Frick said cooperatives are open to measures other than criminal charges as long as it keeps people safe.

When it comes to the Aiken cooperative customer, Stooksbury said the man “just took his frustration out over the phone.” The customer never actually came armed to the office.
Still, cooperative staff had to take the threat seriously. They called the sheriff’s department, and police arrested the man without incident.
As an added precaution, the cooperative hired police officers to stand watch at its offices across three counties.
After all, Stooksbury has seen things go another way.
At the executive’s first job out of college, working in the offices of Tennessee Valley Authority, a landowner shot and killed a power company employee while the worker was out surveying property for a new power line.
“It was a tragic situation,” Stooksbury said.
“Being a lineman is a very dangerous job,” he added. “You need to be focused on what you are doing rather than worrying about somebody coming up behind you or getting threatened out on a roadway.”
While South Carolina is no stranger to hurricanes, Helene wrought severe and widespread devastation not seen since Hurricane Hugo in 1989. That coupled with more than two weeks without power took its toll.

“This was the longest outage we’ve ever had,” said Newberry Electric Cooperative CEO Keith Avery. “We literally had to rebuild lines on the opposite sides of roads because we couldn’t clear up the downed trees quick enough.”
Avery said Newberry Electric customers did not make any threats but several frustrated people showed up to the office. Two even drove past the gate into the storage yard full of spare parts and heavy machinery, disrupting crew members who were loading replacement power poles onto a work truck.
“You’ve got people out there working. They’re loading poles with forklifts. They’re focused on their job,” Avery said. “They’re not focused on you pulling in there, and that creates a whole different hazard.”
Days after employees managed to calm down one woman angry about having been without power for more than a week, a man came into the yard trying to convince crews to come to his house and get his lights back on.
On a third occasion, a woman approached a crew fixing a downed power line telling them how the workers who had been at her house that day hadn’t restored her electricity.
“When you have downed power lines, anything can happen. The work site itself is hazardous,” Avery said. “Come to find out, she wasn’t even our member.”",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_4859-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-10-15 10:56:35.681674
,Mississippi Today,2025-10-15 14:00:00+00:00,Mississippi Today,‘A game changer’: New virtual learning program addresses Mississippi’s teacher shortage,Devna Bose,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/10/15/a-game-changer-new-virtual-learning-program-addresses-mississippis-teacher-shortage/,"The REACH MS program, also called the Mississippi Virtual Synchronous Learning Initiative, funded by a $2.2 million appropriation from the Legislature, is a response to the teacher shortage afflicting swaths of Mississippi schools.","Thanks to a new partnership between the Mississippi Department of Education and Mississippi Public Broadcasting, students across the state will be getting new teachers this year. 
But those teachers won’t be in classrooms, sitting behind desks. They’ll be on the screen. 
The REACH MS program, also called the Mississippi Virtual Synchronous Learning Initiative, funded by a $2.2 million appropriation from the Legislature, is a response to the teacher shortage afflicting swaths of Mississippi schools. 
There are thousands of vacant teaching posts in Mississippi, according to a recent MDE survey. While the virtual-teacher program doesn’t replace recruitment efforts, said associate state superintendent Bryan Marshall, it’s one of the state’s latest attempts to address the teacher shortage. Those include a revamped teacher recruitment website and increased funding to pay tuition and licensure expenses for college students who commit to teaching in “critical shortage areas.” That’s a category that 56% of Mississippi school districts fall into. 
Participating districts that are struggling to staff core subjects can get a virtual teacher through the program. All they have to do is make sure special-education students are accommodated, enter grades and attendance, provide a classroom, in-person facilitators and reliable internet. 
Five districts — Hinds County, Yazoo County, Yazoo City, Claiborne and West Point — are part of the pilot program, as well as three certified teachers and three teacher assistants who are college students on the cusp of finishing their teaching degrees. 
In this way, Marshall says the initiative addresses the state’s teacher shortage in two ways: staffing hard-to-teach subject areas and strengthening the teacher pipeline.
“The idea is that we would keep the student teachers for a period, and then they would go on into the classroom, and we’d bring on a new set,” Marshall said. “We’re trying to provide resources to districts without taking teachers away from them.”
It’s clear the agency is proud of the new program and optimistic about what it can accomplish. State Superintendent Lance Evans has been publicly championing the initiative for the past year — at Capitol hearings, board meetings and press events. A powerpoint about REACH MS claims each teacher has the capacity to serve up to 450 students. 
Post-pandemic, though, it’s hard not to wonder if the program is promising more than it can deliver. Research shows that when education is online, student learning, focus and engagement suffer. 
But the agency — and students — argue that this initiative, with its classroom setting and in-person facilitators, is different.

The classroom experience
Teenagers in red-collared shirts and khaki pants peer over their laptops at their teacher, Caitlin Perkins. She’s at the front of the Yazoo City High School classroom, giving a lesson on how to write thesis statements. 
In actuality, she’s about an hour away at the Mississippi Public Broadcasting offices in Jackson, but it doesn’t seem to matter to the students.  
They’re engaged, paying rapt attention to their on-screen teacher and even answering her questions out loud. Another teacher, on what’s supposed to be her planning period break, walks around as an in-person facilitator, keeping students quiet and passing out worksheets. 
It’s pretty close to what Sametra Brown, assistant superintendent of federal programs, imagined when the agency reached out about the district’s participation in the virtual teacher program. 
“In a critical teacher shortage area, these are certified teachers,” she said. “We felt that this would be a wonderful opportunity for our students to still have a highly qualified certified educator in front of them, but give them that virtual experience.” 
Yazoo City Municipal School District has struggled for a long time, in general. 
The district was merged with Humphreys County School District in 2019, creating Mississippi’s first Achievement School District. The partnership created a single state-run district in an effort to turn the low-performing schools around. The districts divorced this summer but remain under state control. 
While the state education department reports that there are almost 3,000 open teaching jobs across Mississippi, teacher shortages disproportionately impact schools with high rates of poverty and larger minority student populations. 
More than a third of children under 18 in Yazoo County live in poverty, 2020 Census data shows. Data from the Annie E. Casey Foundation shows the 2023 median household income in Yazoo County was $42,434.
Yazoo City, which dropped from a C grade to an F in the latest district rankings, currently has 10 open teaching positions, administrators said. Three of those are at the high school, with two in core subject areas. Staffing challenges, ample national research shows, directly impact student achievement.
The program, Marshall said, was created for districts such as Yazoo City.
“Many people are not going into education now, so that’s a challenge,” Brown said, of the district’s staffing struggles. “We have to be creative in how we attract and retain teachers … Rather than our students having a substitute teacher in the classroom that has maybe no credentials, this was an opportunity for them to get live instruction.”
The virtual teacher came as a shock to Rodrianna Drain, Mikeria Brown and Devin Gibbs, three of the 14-year-olds in Perkins’ ninth-grade English class. They’re among some of the top students in the high school. School leaders chose the cream of the crop, they said, for the pilot program to better prepare them for online college classes and an increasingly virtual world. 
But now that the surprise has worn off, Brown actually prefers the virtual element over her other classes. She largely does classwork online, and typing out answers to writing prompts gives her time to think through her responses instead of immediately answering out loud. 
It makes sense that the set-up is appealing to this generation of students, who spent a chunk of their education learning at home during the pandemic. 
However, another vestige of pandemic-era learning is throwing some wrenches into the program: Technology problems. 
Perkins’ lesson buffered a little, her face momentarily frozen while her class waited patiently. The students noted that occasionally the computers are slow and the Wi-Fi sometimes goes out. 
Those issues are usually quickly resolved and the kinks are worth it, they said. The three students really like Perkins, one of the program’s student teachers, describing her as a dramatic storyteller when she reads out loud which makes it easier for them to engage with the text. 
“We’re not just writing more, but we’re actually understanding more about it,” Drain said. “She talks to us like she’s one of us.” 
Before she logs off, Perkins confirms the students don’t have any more questions. Then they wave goodbye, and the screen goes black.

Futuristic technology
Much of what makes the virtual teacher program stand out compared to pandemic virtual learning, Marshall said, are eGlass systems. 
They’re also partially what makes the program so pricey (in addition to the technology and infrastructure needs of districts and employee salaries). All of the equipment required for the futuristic contraptions, which the company describes as “illuminated transparent lightboards” that have a camera to monitor the classroom, costs about $3,000. 
Marshall said the lightboards are essential because they’re interactive and allow teachers to teach in real time. Leslie Hebert, one of the teachers in the program and the education program development specialist for K-12 literacy at MPB, said while the program is less hands-on, the lessons are more in-depth because of the technology.
“This is not your normal sit-and-get-lectured style of teaching,” Marshall said. “When the pandemic was here, it was really that the teachers talked and the kids listened and that was it … This is almost like having a real person in the classroom. When you couple it with a facilitator to keep kids on task, that’s a game changer.” 
Right now, the program uses two eGlass systems and offers English I, English III, Algebra I and Algebra II classes. About 150 students are involved across the five districts, but the program has the capacity for 5,400 students, six teachers and six assistants when it’s fully scaled up. 
They’ll be adding math and science classes to the program in the spring, Marshall said, and 12 more eGlass systems are on the way. The initiative started small because the agency’s appropriation wasn’t finalized until late in the summer due to legislators bickering over the state budget. 
And Evans is pushing for more resources. He said recently that he’s asking the Legislature to continue funding the program next year to expand it. 
The more students, the better, Hebert said. The program is helping her reach more students than she used to teach in a traditional classroom setting. The medium matters less. 
“At the end of the day, it’s about teaching children,” she said.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/16152118/3X0A7890.jpg,,,2025-10-15 10:56:35.681674

(Photo by Yereth Rosen/Alaska Beacon)The Alaska Department of Transportation and Public Facilities is planning to remove trash, waste, and the belongings of unhoused Alaskans from land near state highways, continuing an offensive that began last year.
In a public notice published last week, the department said it is seeking bids from contractors who can perform “the as needed removal of unauthorized encampments … at various locations within the state” that are managed by DOT&PF.
The department did not say how much it proposes to spend on the removal, only that “approval or continuation of a contract resulting from this (invitation to bid) is contingent upon legislative appropriation.”
Alaska’s hub cities, particularly Anchorage, have a large population of unhoused residents. 



Camps already removed by Alaska DOT&PF
Since November 2024, the Alaska Department of Transportation and Public Facilities has identified eight encampments that it has removed:

NW/SW/SE quadrants of the 36th/Seward Highway Intersection (Anch)
East Fireweed Road/Parks Highway (Mat-Su)
Minnesota/International off-ramp (Anch)
Seward Meridian/Blue Lupine (Mat-Su)
NE quadrant of the Tudor/Seward Highway intersection (Anch)
A Street – between 36th Avenue and 38th Avenue (Anch)
Seward Highway – south side, Campbell Creek Bridge (Anch)
International Airport Road & Minnesota Drive – Northeast Interchange Area (Anch)




Last year, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that it is legal for local governments to ban outdoor camping, even if no homeless shelter space is available. That move has provided the legal justification for large-scale camp removal nationwide, and since the ruling, DOT&PF has removed eight encampments in southcentral Alaska.
According to the proposed contract, the winning bidder will be available “on an on-call, as-needed, and/or urgent basis.” The contract will last for one year, but it can be renewed up to four times for additional one-year terms.
The contract is expected to be issued by Nov. 11 and would go into effect in December. 
“This is a continuation of the work the department has always undertaken and was of particular focus, in coordination with local government partners, starting last year to remove encampments within state highway (right of way),” said Shannon McCarthy, a spokesperson for the department, by email.
Under state law and federal regulations, McCarthy said, the department must ensure that rights of way — the land designated for transportation — are actually used for transportation and are clear of things that might obstruct the right of way or could cause a safety risk.
“In addition, encampments in the ROW (right of way) have increased the risk of pedestrians vs. vehicle crashes, caused traffic conflicts that result in serious injury and fatalities, prevented the public from using these rights-of-way, and severely limit the intended highway buffer zones for purposes such as safety pullouts, noise buffers, stormwater retention/filtration areas, and other transportation and functional purposes,” McCarthy wrote.
In April, DOT&PF Commissioner Ryan Anderson signed a new policy describing how DOT will remove encampments.
Under that policy, encampments underneath bridges, near utility structures or on medians are the highest priority to be removed.
The policy also requires consultation with the Alaska Department of Law “to ensure constitutional and civil rights protections are observed.”",https://alaskabeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/DSC05563-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-15 10:00:31.367801

(Win McNamee/Getty Images)TOPEKA — More Kansas families with kindergarteners attending school last year claimed state vaccine exemptions than in previous years, and the “unfortunate melding” of science and politics may cause that number to keep rising, an infectious disease doctor said.
The number of kindergarteners with vaccine exemptions increased from 2.9% in the 2023-24 school year to 3.59% in 2024-25, according to Kansas Department of Health and Environment state vaccine data, reported in September.
The percentage of kindergarteners who received the state-required vaccines to attend school remained relatively stable, rising just three-tenths of a percent, from 86.7% to 87%, data showed.
But county data breakdowns highlighted wide disparities across Kansas, with Morton County in the southwest corner of the state reporting the lowest number of kindergarteners with required vaccines at 50%. Kingman County followed with 54.1%, then Decatur County at 60%.
Twenty-two Kansas counties reported vaccination rates at less than 75%.
“I have to believe, given the current climate and the unfortunate melding of medicine and science with politics and also, just from what we’ve seen in the recent past, that, yes, there will continue to be more exemptions,” said Dana Hawkinson, medical director of infection prevention and control at the University of Kansas Health System. “This will then also open the door, unfortunately, for more disease and more consequences and complications of that disease process, whatever that might be.”
Concerns about vaccine safety are being raised at the national level as U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. expresses doubts about vaccine use, despite disagreement from all medical organizations, including the American Academy of Pediatrics and the National Institutes of Health.
Some states have changed vaccine mandates based on legislators’ concerns, with Florida completely eliminating all vaccine mandates for children.
Kansas vaccine requirements follow the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommendations, according to KDHE spokeswoman Jill Bronaugh.
“We are in the process of gathering the most current and accurate information before making any changes or issuing additional guidance or educational materials as it relates to current vaccine schedules and recommendations,” she said in an email.
Bronaugh did not answer a question about whether the state would continue to follow CDC recommendations as changes are implemented. The CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices last week recommended that the combined shot for measles, mumps, rubella and varicella (chickenpox) be separated into two shots, with chickenpox being given separately and at a different time.
Decatur County on the Nebraska border saw a drop to 60% of the number of kindergarteners with the required number of vaccinations. The small school district has around 150 students, but the decline still raises concerns for local health officials.
“We’re been working with schools to send out reminders,” said Bobbi Koerperich, health officer at the Decatur County Health Department. “I don’t think the percentage is that low.”
Koerperich said the majority of the parents that health staff talk to are open to getting vaccinations. The health department is offering influenza vaccinations at the school next week, she said.
Low vaccination rates endanger herd immunity, which occurs when enough people in a population are immune that the spread of the disease is stopped. Measles was declared eliminated in the United States in 2020, but measles cases surged in 2025, including in Kansas. 
Measles vaccine coverage dropped from 94.5% in Kansas in the 2019-20 school year to 90.6% in 2024-25, KDHE data said.
Hawkinson said the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine, commonly called the MMR, is safe.
“We know that they are safe and they are effective, but now what we are seeing is a conscious dismantling of the vaccination strategies, of the continued information to try and dissuade people from getting vaccinations,” he said. “If this continues, in my opinion, probably in the next five to 10 years, (this will be) the largest public health experiment in recent times that we have seen, because of the continued decrease in vaccination rates and increase in exemptions.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/GettyImages-1309140442-1.jpg,,,2025-10-15 10:00:31.367801

In Tuesday’s newsletter, I mentioned some of the new laws California will enact. Now let’s dig into what didn’t make it past the governor’s desk.
At the end of this year’s legislative session, Gov. Gavin Newsom vetoed 123 out of the 917 total bills lawmakers sent to him — a slightly lower veto rate of 13.4% compared to last year’s 15.7%. 
One of the bills he spiked Monday would have raised the cap car dealers can charge to process Department of Motor Vehicles’ and other paperwork from $85 to $260, writes CalMatters’ Ryan Sabalow.
In his veto message, the governor said that consumers could be charged “hundreds more for only minutes of data entry” even though there are no new state requirements and DMV processes are getting more streamlined.
Read more here.
Newsom also rejected a handful of bills intended to expand health care coverage, such as ones that would have required health insurers to cover a year’s worth of prescription hormone therapy; treatment for menopause; and behavioral health visits for wildfire victims. In his veto messages, he repeatedly said California lawmakers should avoid enacting policies that would drive up health care costs “at a time when individuals are facing double-digit rate increases in their health care premiums” nationwide.
Other notable bills Newsom vetoed:

‘Forever chemicals’ and microplastics: The governor rejected a bill that would have banned the sale of cleaning products, dental floss, cookware and other items that contain PFAS substances, which can be toxic. He also vetoed a bill that would have banned cosmetics that include plastic glitter.


Immigration raids and schools: Citing “substantial cost pressures,” Newsom vetoed a bill that would enable schools to avoid defunding due to drops in attendance from “immigration enforcement activity.” The bill was introduced in response to January’s federal immigration raids in Kern County. 


Honey bees: Newsom shot down a bill that would have established a health program for struggling managed honey bees arguing that the issue should have been considered in the state’s annual budget process instead.

The clash over CA’s antisemitism prevention measure

One bill Newsom did approve was a highly contentious measure intended to curb antisemitism in schools by restricting what teachers could mention and teach in classrooms. The bill forced many Democratic lawmakers to grapple the needs of Jewish communities, a key voting block, with the intense outrage of a growing pro-Palestinian base, report CalMatters’ Yue Stella Yu and Mikhail Zinshteyn.
After several rounds of rewriting, Assembly Bill 715 ultimately bans using professional development materials that violate the state’s anti-discrimination laws. It also requires “factually accurate” instruction that is free of “advocacy, personal opinion, bias, or partisanship.”
Issuing warnings that the measure could censor free speech, some Democratic lawmakers voted to pass the bill nonetheless. Others abstained, including Assemblymember Robert Garcia of Rancho Cucamonga, who said the bill “only reinforces broader national trends of … erasing historically relevant curriculum.”
The issue was so controversial that when the bill arrived in June before the Senate Education Committee, it still had no substantive language, said Sen. Sasha Renée Pérez. The Pasadena Democrat and chairperson of the committee added that some lawmakers told her either to leave it untouched as well, or left it up to her to “take care of it.”

Pérez: “The ball got thrown to me. And people knew that they were doing that.”

Kaiser nurses go on strike

From CalMatters health reporter Kristen Hwang:
At 7 a.m. sharp Tuesday, tens of thousands of Kaiser Permanente employees across California walked off the job, starting the largest strike in their union’s history. 
The union — United Nurse Association of California/Union of Health Care Professionals — represents 31,000 registered nurses, nurse practitioners, pharmacists and other health workers.
Many, holding umbrellas and signs saying “Fair Contract NOW,” stood outside medical centers in the pouring rain.
The strike, which Kaiser called “unnecessary and disruptive,” will end Oct. 19. 
At issue are salaries, benefits and staffing levels. The union wants a 25% raise over four years and limits on how many patients providers see in a day.

Christopher Pereida, a nurse practitioner in Lancaster: “The strike is about patient care, patient safety and having Kaiser put patients over profits.”

Kaiser argues the union’s demands would force the company to increase premiums for patients.
Twelve thousand Kaiser workers in Oregon and Hawaii are also striking.

,California,2025-10-15 12:30:00+00:00,CalMatters,Newsom vetoes car dealers’ bill to hike fees on buyers,Ryan Sabalow,,,,,https://calmatters.org/politics/2025/10/california-car-dealer-fees-veto/,Gov. Gavin Newsom vetoed one bill and signed another that could change how you purchase a vehicle in California.,"In summary
Gov. Gavin Newsom vetoed one bill and signed another that could change how you purchase a vehicle in California. 


Gov. Gavin Newsom vetoed a bill that would have allowed California’s car dealers to tack on another $175 in fees to the cost of buying a vehicle. 
On Monday, Newsom announced he wasn’t going to sign Senate Bill 791, which would have raised the fees dealers can charge to process Department of Motor Vehicles and other paperwork from $85 to up to 1% of the purchase price, capped at $260.
In his veto message, Newsom said the fee increase made little sense since a car buyer would be paying a dealership “for only minutes of data entry.”  
“At a time when Californians are already struggling with the high cost of living,” Newsom wrote, “this bill would raise the document processing fee to three times the current $85 cap – far beyond what an inflation adjustment would justify.”
Brian Maas, president of the California New Car Dealers Association, said in an emailed statement that the state’s car sellers “were extremely disappointed” by the veto.
Maas said the current $85 cap on the document-processing fee is “by far the lowest in the country.” The now-dead fee increase, he said, would still have been at “the bottom quartile of such charges across the nation.” 
Car dealers argue that the Legislature continually passes new laws that add to their costs. They say other kinds of businesses are allowed to recoup those costs through service charges, but dealers can’t because the $85 cap is set in state law.
The dealers were especially frustrated with Newsom’s veto because he also signed a measure this month that adds a number of requirements on car dealers that are intended to prevent buyers from getting suckered as they haggle over the price of a vehicle. 
Notably, that measure, Senate Bill 766, creates a first-in-the-nation policy that allows a used car buyer to return a vehicle for a full refund within three days if the purchase price was less than $50,000. Dealers can charge a restocking fee.
The new law requires dealers to disclose the full costs up front, and it prohibits dealers from charging for add-ons that have no benefits to the buyer, such as free oil changes for electric vehicles — which don’t need oil changes.
The law takes effect Oct. 1, 2026.
Maas said “the Legislature continues to place more burdens on dealers. SB 766 only added significantly to those responsibilities, which makes the veto of SB 791 all the more disappointing.”
The California New Car Dealers Association has donated at least $3 million to legislators since 2015, according to the CalMatters Digital Democracy database.
How did the fee increase easily pass?
It was perhaps surprising that the bill to hike fees made it to the governor’s desk at all, given that legislative leaders from both parties had promised to lower costs this year. 
Yet the Senate overwhelmingly passed an earlier version of the bill that was even more expensive. It proposed upping the fee to $500. 
Only one of the Legislature’s 40 senators, Calabasas-area Democratic Sen. Henry Stern, voted “no.” 
After CalMatters reported on the controversial measure passing the Senate, its author, San Jose Democratic Sen. Dave Cortese lowered the proposed fee in the Assembly first to $350 and then eventually to $260. 
Cortese said in an interview the amount the Legislature settled on would have provided the minimum dealers need to recoup their costs to pay employees who might “spend an hour and a half filling out documents” state regulations require for a single sale.
“There’s 113 different documents now that we’ve created,” he said. “Every single one of them is legislative created. …  We were trying to get fair remuneration for fair work.” 
In the Assembly, the bill passed with only three Democrats – Alex Lee of San Jose, Jacqui Irwin of Thousand Oaks and Tasha Boerner of Solana Beach – voting “no.” Seventeen other Assembly members didn’t vote at all, which counts the same as voting “no.” 
As CalMatters reported, Democrats almost never vote “no” on their colleagues’ bills. Instead, they typically don’t vote at all. In the Capitol, it’s seen as a more polite way of saying “no” and less likely to lead to retaliation from other lawmakers and lobbyists.

With so much talk of lowering costs this year, Cortese said he could understand why the governor wasn’t as receptive to his arguments about fairness to car dealers as his colleagues in the Legislature were.
“The perception was stalking us the whole way through, no question about it,” Cortese said. “And I can understand why the governor would be sensitive to that.”
Rosemary Shahan of Consumers for Auto Reliability and Safety said she was “thrilled to bits” that Newsom vetoed the would-be “junk fee” increase and signed the law protecting car buyers from “the kind of bait-and-switch that goes on” when buying a vehicle. 
She said the new three-day cooling-off period to return a vehicle will be especially helpful, allowing buyers to review their paperwork without pressure. They can also have their vehicles inspected by an independent mechanic to make sure they didn’t drive a lemon off the lot. 
She called Newsom’s actions this year “huge wins for California car buyers.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/090723_EV_Lineup_LV_CM_02.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-10-15 08:57:19.397220

(Stock.adobe.com photo by Nimur)Staying ahead of the curve is essential for any business to succeed. And to stay ahead of the growing clean energy economy in Maryland, contractors should prepare for what is quickly becoming the most popular form of heating and cooling: heat pumps.
More and more households are upgrading their homes with highly efficient heat pumps, which offer affordable, reliable and pollutant-free heating and cooling. According to the Building Decarbonization Coalition, heat pumps are 2.5 to four times more efficient than gas furnaces and nationally, the average heat pump sold uses 29% less electricity than central air conditioning.
For the second year in a row in 2024, shipments of heat pumps outpaced those of gas furnaces nationwide, and in Maryland, 54% of households are expected to adopt heat pumps by 2030. From the data, it’s clear that the market is increasingly shifting toward efficient, clean energy technology driven by rising customer demand.
In recent years, we’ve seen manufacturers release newer models of heat pumps that work efficiently in the coldest of weather, including the deep freeze that Maryland experienced this past winter. Inverter heat pump systems have revolutionized the market by being efficient and providing the necessary heating capacity to keep residents warm and comfortable in Maryland’s cold weather.
With new technologies entering the market and the growing popularity of heat pumps, Maryland’s contractors have a golden opportunity ahead of them, especially as Maryland leaders advance a suite of policies to help more households adopt heat pumps. By seizing this momentum, contractors can attract more customers, access crucial resources and skills, and position themselves — and their business — for long-term success.

In recent years, Maryland lawmakers have passed legislation doubling down on clean-energy technology. Just last year, the state passed legislation that strengthens EmPOWER, the state’s signature energy efficiency program, to ensure more households can adopt clean energy appliances. Under the new law, utilities are rolling out financial incentives this summer for efficient electric technologies, with Baltimore Gas and Electric (BGE) providing $2,500 for a heat pump water heater and up to $20,000 to upgrade homes with air source heat pumps. As part of the 2024 law, BG&E is also offering training and bonuses to contractors to help them pursue more electrification projects.
The reforms to EmPOWER highlight how Maryland contractors can meet the moment to propel their business forward. By helping homeowners access the thousands of dollars available in rebates when upgrading to a heat pump, contractors can share the value of clean-heating technologies and expand their customer base. With the electrification trainings from BGE, contractors can also access resources and learn new skills that will help millions of Maryland households lower their energy bills, breathe cleaner air, and upgrade to efficient, electric equipment.
Those skills are going to be especially important as Maryland rolls out another policy to accelerate heat pump adoption in the coming years. Last year, Gov. Wes Moore signed a groundbreaking executive order that directs the Maryland Department of the Environment to develop zero-emission heating equipment standards (ZEHES), also known as healthy air standards, and a Clean Heat Standard.
The Moore administration is already taking action on this executive order by publishing a draft reporting rule for Maryland’s heating fuel providers last month — a critical first step to understanding how many fossil fuel systems are sold every year in Maryland. This rule will require fuel providers to report the monthly amount of heating fuel they deliver to Maryland by county starting in 2026. This is the kind of forward-looking policy that will help policymakers understand how to best upgrade homes with clean, efficient heating systems and is an example of the type of new clean-heating rules for which contractors should prepare.
With the potential to fully come into effect in just a few years, healthy air standards will gradually phase in the adoption of cleaner, more efficient alternatives such as highly efficient heat pumps to replace outdated fossil-fuel burning furnaces, boilers, and water heaters, directly combating smog and health-harming air pollution in Maryland communities.
The successful launch of these healthy air standards relies on Maryland’s contractors, who will be on the frontlines guiding homeowners and modernizing our state’s homes with clean energy technology. That’s why it’s important for contractors to get in on the ground floor right now. Understanding the many rebates available through EmPOWER, accessing the electrification trainings available, and learning about new heat pump technologies can help contractors modernize their business for the clean-energy economy that is already taking off.
As summer heat scorches Maryland, HVAC professionals are going from house to house fixing air conditioners to keep people cool. Their work is a lifeline to so many in the state. Now, thanks to the leadership of the governor, Maryland is creating new business opportunities that help these professionals grow their businesses and continue their essential work.
To be a part of this transformative change, and as a result, be a part of future success, Maryland’s HVAC professionals should begin preparing now to help guide their customers toward healthier, more efficient, and more affordable solutions.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/AdobeStock_412644909-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-10-15 08:57:19.397220

Maura Healey proposed for the county law enforcement offices, in the process handing a new talking point to her GOP challengers for the corner office.","LEGISLATIVE LEADERS issued a rebuke to county sheriffs Tuesday, casting doubt on how the elected law enforcement officers are managing their own spending and teeing up a new campaign-season talking point for the gubernatorial race. 
After simmering behind the scenes for weeks, the budgetary feud between lawmakers and county sheriffs erupted into public view Tuesday when House Democrats unveiled a spending bill to close the financial books on the fiscal year that ended June 30 that withholds more than $130 million Healey proposed for sheriffs’ departments. The bill, however, would provide sheriffs’ offices with $14 million for treatment services and $12.5 million for the free communication program. 
Instead of funding the full request, which sheriffs say is necessary to cover those two programs as well as salary increases, the legislation that will receive a House vote Wednesday would task the state inspector general with investigating the sheriffs’ books. 
It’s a dramatic step at a time of heightened scrutiny for sheriffs, who are elected to manage local correctional systems. Suffolk County Sheriff Steve Tompkins faces federal extortion charges, Norfolk County Sheriff Patrick McDermott settled with state campaign finance regulators after unlawfully using taxpayer funds to cover online business courses, and Hampden County Sheriff Nick Cocchi was arrested last month for allegedly driving while intoxicated. 
“Over the past few months, serious questions and concerns have been raised about the financial and operational integrity of our sheriffs’ offices across the Commonwealth,” the Legislature’s budget chiefs, Rep. Aaron Michlewitz and Sen. Michael Rodrigues, said in a joint statement. “As we work to maintain fiscal stability, live within our means, and responsibly close the books on Fiscal Year 2025, it is clear that the Legislature must act to rein in questionable spending practices and restore public confidence in the sheriffs’ operations.” 
The $2.25 billion bill that emerged Tuesday covers a slew of spending and policy goals. After accounting for federal reimbursements, the measure would carry a net cost to the state of $750 million, according to the House Ways and Means Committee. 
Like the original closeout budget proposal Gov. Maura Healey filed in August, the House redraft seeks more than $2 billion for MassHealth (with a projected net cost to the state of nearly $540 million), $60.7 million for snow and ice removal expenses, $12 million to cover additional costs of free school meals for all students, and more. 
The sheriffs’ budget allocation for fiscal 2025 is roughly $738 million. 
The governor did not provide any explanation for the $163 million proposed additional funding injection in her letter to lawmakers, but sheriffs’ departments later told the State House News Service that they faced significant cost growth as a result of salary increases, substance use disorder care, and a mandatory “no-cost calls” program that allows incarcerated individuals to communicate with loved ones free of charge. 
But lawmakers now have pointed questions about whether the math adds up. The Massachusetts Sheriffs’ Association said it expects the free communication program, for example, to cost all sheriffs a combined $12.4 million in fiscal year 2025.  
As of March 30, the 13 county correctional facilities that had people in custody averaged a combined population of 7,048, less than half their combined capacity of nearly 15,000, according to a report the Sheriffs’ Association filed with lawmakers. (The Nantucket sheriff’s office did not have anyone in custody during the reporting period). 
It’s common for state offices and departments, including sheriffs, to spend beyond their budgeted appropriations and seek more funds at the end of the cycle. While closing the books on fiscal year 2024, Healey and the Legislature directed an extra $46 million to sheriffs’ offices. 
“We will continue to explore further steps to ensure appropriate oversight, achieve cost containment, and keep sheriffs’ offices on a more sustainable fiscal path in the months and years ahead,” Michlewitz and Rodrigues said. 
The bill would task the inspector general’s office with examining how sheriffs account for expenses, comply with state finance laws, and manage their spending over time. The IG would need to submit a report to lawmakers by the end of February 2026. 
Sheriffs so far do not appear interested in digging in for a public fight. 
A spokesperson for the Massachusetts Sheriffs’ Association said the group and the sheriffs it represents “understand and respect the Legislature’s responsibility to ensure fiscal transparency and accountability.” 
“For years, the Sheriffs have invested in evidence-based programs that make Massachusetts a national leader in corrections and rehabilitation — especially when it comes to saving lives and improving health outcomes,” the spokesperson said. “These are proven, responsible investments in public safety and community well-being. We welcome any review that strengthens public confidence and supports our continued focus on operating safe, efficient facilities that help people rebuild their lives.” 
While she was leaving an unrelated event Tuesday, Healey did not answer a question about the Legislature seeking to investigate sheriffs’ spending. A spokesperson for the governor later said only that she would review any legislation that reaches her desk. 
The Legislature’s action drew criticism from two of Healey’s Republican challengers. Both Mike Kennealy and Brian Shortsleeve issued statements Tuesday slamming the Legislature for declining to fulfill the sheriffs’ funding request. 
“Three Democratic sheriffs are accused of corruption, and now every sheriff in the state — including those who have served with integrity — must suffer the consequences,” Kennealy said, appearing to reference the different cases involving Tompkins, McDermott and Cocchi. “The problem in Massachusetts isn’t with our sheriffs offices. It’s with the elected Democrats who have controlled every lever of power for too long. When one party holds unchecked control, corruption festers.” 
“They are using the recent scandals in three Democrat sheriff offices as a pretense to strip funding from ALL sheriffs,” Shortsleeve added in his own statement. “And while they punish law enforcement and the public by cutting public safety dollars, they make an exception to keep funding for free phone calls for convicts. They have their priorities totally upside down. Maura Healey needs to denounce these cuts immediately.” 
As is often the case, Beacon Hill power-players are moving to pack a range of unrelated spending and policy goals into the so-called closeout budget. 
The bill the House plans to take up would appropriate $236 million in payments to owners of former Steward Health Care hospitals, part of the more than $480 million in aid the Healey administration pledged last year to incentivize transfer of the facilities away from the bankrupt system. 
It would also grant the state public health commissioner authority to determine routine childhood immunizations and vaccine schedules, decoupling Massachusetts from the recommendations of a Centers for Disease Control panel that has come under scrutiny after U.S Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. elevated vaccine skeptics. 
House Democrats also want to direct $8.1 million to an entity that does not often factor into midyear appropriations: the House itself, which is set to receive $49.9 million through the annual budget and in July implemented a hiring freeze. 
A spokesperson for House Speaker Ron Mariano said the additional money would cover expenses previously awarded to staff.",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Rep.-Aaron-Michlewitz-Sen.-Michael-Rodrigues.webp?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-10-15 08:57:19.397220

The group made the decision Tuesday as RSVPs flooded in faster than expected, said Jamie Carter with Salt Lake Indivisible. 
“As big as this is getting, and considering, you know, what happened at the last march in the evening, we decided that safety first should probably be our top priority,” Carter said Tuesday. 
At Salt Lake City’s No Kings protest in June, innocent bystander Afa Ah Loo was shot and killed by an armed volunteer who fired into a crowd three times, Salt Lake City police said. The volunteer also managed to shoot and wound his intended target, a man carrying a rifle, according to police. Protesters in the crowd of 10,000 ran into buildings and huddled together in the chaos.

Four months later, no one has been charged in the killing of Ah Loo, a fashion designer and father of two from West Valley City. Experts have said Utah’s permissive gun laws may offer legal protection to both the shooter and the man who carried the rifle but didn’t fire it. 
Saturday’s gathering will mark the first large-scale demonstration in Salt Lake City since the shooting. It follows other shootings at recent public or political events in Utah, including the killings of three people at a festival in West Valley City in June, and the death of Charlie Kirk at Utah Valley University in September. 
Carter said she’s spoken with people who have mixed emotions about attending the protest. 
“Some people were very hesitant, after what happened last time,” Carter said. 
Utah ‘No Kings’ organizers say governor was ‘grossly misinformed’ about peacekeeper warning

National No Kings organizers cut ties with Utah 50501, the local group behind June’s protest – which did not have a role in planning Saturday’s event, said Carter, also political director for DemCast USA. 
Safety volunteers won’t be armed and have participated in de-escalation training led by the local American Civil Liberties Union and Freedom Trainers, Carter said. Organizers are asking attendees to leave weapons at home. 
Sign-ups prior to an event typically account for just 20% of actual crowd size, Carter said, and the group received 1,700 as of Tuesday afternoon, suggesting more than 8,000 could attend the event.
That would make for about 500 protesters for every safety volunteer, Carter said, and for a march, “we did not feel that was adequate.”
“It’s a lot more of a controlled environment,” she said of the Capitol. A dance party and performances from two bands and a comedian will follow the rally, instead of a march to the City and County building.
In Washington, D.C., House Speaker Mike Johnson condemned the events scheduled for Saturday across the country as a “hate America rally.”
Carter said the Utah event’s mantra is “‘no one can steal our joy,’ and so we really want to make this a fun community experience.” She expects to see unicorn and dinosaur costumes like many have been wearing in Portland, Oregon as they have protested the presence of National Guard troops and immigration agents in the city.

Salt Lake City police are coordinating closely with event organizers, said police Sgt. Miles Southworth, “just doing what we can to have that open communication to kind of get an idea of what resources are needed and how we can help ensure this event goes safely.”
He declined to say how many officers are assigned, or whether there will be a larger law enforcement presence than at the deadly June demonstration, but said neighboring departments will be there to help. 
The Utah Highway Patrol, which provides Capitol security, will also staff the event, said spokesperson Hillary Koellner. She declined to share details, citing safety.
“Whether they are a protester or counter protester, free speech is protected,” Koellner said. “We encourage peaceful protesting.” 
Demonstrations are planned in 11 other cities across Utah, including in St. George, Moab, Kanab, Price and Fillmore.

The 2026 regular session of the Alabama Legislature begins on Jan. 13.

Alabama Arise’s seven priorities are health equity, hunger relief, adequate state budgets, inclusive democracy, justice reform, tax reform and worker power. Hyden said the priorities were decided on by its 155 members that include faith-based organizations, non-profits and civic groups across the state. Worker power is the only new priority this year. 
She said that some policies, like cutting the state’s sales tax on groceries, took years of advocacy to be addressed. The same applies, she said, to the 2026 priorities, especially to Alabama Arise’s plea to expand Medicaid coverage.
“We’re not going to shut up about it,” Hyden said. “It is still possible for our state to close the health coverage gap. What we’re now seeing is the impacts of our state’s lack of investment in rural health care infrastructure and in affordable options for families is creating all these long term health impacts. So it may not come in the form of Medicaid expansion, it may be some other proposal or program that Alabama decides to do, but we do believe this has to be a top priority for Alabama.”
Alabama is one of only ten states that has not expanded Medicaid, despite calls from hospitals and studies showing expansion could bring public health and economic benefits. While Alabama House leaders have signaled openness to a public-private hybrid approach to expansion, the Senate has been hostile, and removed a provision from a 2024 gambling bill that could have provided money for the program. 
With state lawmakers up for re-election in 2026, Hyden said the issues surrounding poverty will be “front and center” for their campaigns. Federal cuts to SNAP from the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) will be prominent, Hyden said. Without the federal government fully funding the food assistance program, the state will have to spend an estimated $208.7 million in fiscal year 2027. 
“Lawmakers may pretend like it’s not popular to fund SNAP, but when the rubber hits the road, our state is going to have to fund SNAP or risk losing a billion dollars of federal funding coming into the state,” Hyden said.
Another issue impacted by the election year is early voting, a law that Democratic lawmakers have tried to pass since at least 2016. Hyden said that early voting could improve the state’s voter turnout, which 38.6% in the 2022 midterm election and 59% in the 2024 general election, according to election data. About 300,000 Alabamians cast mail-in ballots in 2020 after the state loosened the restrictions on absentee voting amid the COVID outbreak, but the program was not continued. 
She said that increased voter turnout, and accessibility to vote, benefits all parties. 
“Democracy is better when more people participate. There’s so many citizens who could vote, and they’re not showing up to vote,” Hyden said. “That should really be something that I hope all legislators are concerned about, especially as they’re coming to ask for our vote.”
Alabama Arise will also continue to advocate for no-cost breakfast for public schools. According to the press release, one in four Alabama children face food insecurity. Hyden said that some schools are able to offer free lunches due to a significant low-income population, but there are other schools on the edge. 
“It’s not always an economic issue. Sometimes it’s just that kids need to eat and they’re running late to school,” she said. “So it’s a very cost effective program to expand breakfast. It doesn’t really add much to their bottom line.”
Hyden estimated that free breakfast and lunch would add about $90 million to the Education Trust Fund (ETF) budget. She said Arise is focusing on only free breakfast for now, which she said is currently a $7.2 million line item for schools with a large enough low-income population.
While free breakfast would impact the ETF for schools that opt-in, Alabama Arise is also advocating for a complete elimination of the state grocery tax. 
“We know that we need that money for education, but the ETF has also had surplus over the last several years. So this is the time, if ever was the time,” Hyden said.
While Alabama Arise’s priorities may seem unachievable, Hyden said it is important to make progress where they can.
“We know that these are ambitious goals, but we also believe these are very reasonable and practical goals,” Hyden said. “I don’t think those are partisan issues. We’re out talking to everybody in all communities.”",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Statehouse-0747-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-10-15 08:57:19.397220
,California,2025-10-15 12:01:00+00:00,CalMatters,Videos could tank Katie Porter’s bid to become California’s next governor,Dan Walters,,,,,https://calmatters.org/commentary/2025/10/katie-porter-california-governor-bid/,"As damage to some candidates' personal images harmed their presidential hopes, so too can two viral incidents torpedo Katie Porter's chances.","In the broadest sense, political campaigns resemble military operations with mission goals, strategic plans to achieve them, logistical support and tactical maneuvers to weaken opposing forces.
However, as Prussian Field Marshal Helmuth von Moltke observed in 1871,“No plan of operations extends with any certainty beyond the first encounter with the main enemy forces.”
In other words, once a political campaign is launched, it can be undermined by events that even the most comprehensive strategy could not anticipate. The “X factor,” as some have dubbed it, can dominate the outcome.
Notable examples abound, including Richard Nixon’s sweaty image during his 1960 television debate with a cool and telegenic John Kennedy, the revelations about Gary Hart’s swinger lifestyle that sank his 1988 presidential campaign and, just last year, Joe Biden’s disastrous debate with Donald Trump that forced him to abandon his re-election campaign.
We may be seeing another implosion in the still-embryonic campaigns over who will succeed Gavin Newsom as governor.
After former Vice President Kamala Harris opted out and three announced candidates — Lt. Gov. Eleni Kounalakis, former state Senate leader Toni Atkins and state Treasurer Fiona Ma — dropped out, former Congresswoman Katie Porter emerged as the frontrunner.
However, Porter, who lost a U.S. Senate bid last year, has just 17% in the latest polling, with rivals mired in single-digits. Meanwhile, political oddsmakers wait for two other potentials, U.S. Sen. Alex Padilla and Los Angeles businessman Rick Caruso, to declare their intentions.
Last week, Porter’s campaign suffered a double dose of notoriety that could be fatal — videos of her saying and doing things that undermine her carefully curated image of a single mom who holds the rich and powerful accountable.
The first was an interview with CBS reporter Julie Watts, who pressed her repeatedly about whether she would seek support from among the nearly 40% of California voters who backed Donald Trump last year.
Porter complained that Watts was asking multiple questions about the issue and threatened to end the interview if Watts persisted.
The three-minute excerpt of the interview exploded on YouTube and in social media postings, and Porter’s rivals immediately jumped in with criticism and suggestions that she drop out of the race.
That led to another video surfacing on Politico, a website devoted to politics, in which Porter, during a 2021 interview, snapped at one of her staffers who was trying to help her respond on an issue, “Get out of my f—— shot.”
When the staffer tried to explain, Porter shot back, “OK, you also were in my shot before that. Stay out of my shot.”
The Nixon, Hart and Biden incidents had massive effects on their presidential campaigns, not because they hinged on foreign policy, the economy or any other substantive issue, but because they damaged their personal images.
As the two Porter videos ping pong through the electronic universe — and are constantly repeated in television and internet ads by her rivals — they undermine her likeability, making her the issue, rather than the positions she takes to hopefully sway voters.
It’s a classic example of the X factor, one that could easily alter the gubernatorial campaign’s dynamics.
It might persuade Padilla, who acknowledges that he is weighing a bid for governor, that it’s a campaign he could win. Ditto for Caruso if he also believes that Porter’s self-inflicted wounds are fatal, as they may be.
The campaigns to succeed Newsom were already unusual, with so many potential candidates dropping in, dropping out or lounging somewhere in between scarcely a year before voters will have the last word. Porter’s image woes are still another contributor to the fluid battlefield of California politics.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/111723-CA-Dem-Day-01-MG-CM-25.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-10-15 08:02:37.799991

(Photo by Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images)The U.S. Supreme Court last week held oral arguments on Colorado’s prohibition of mental health practitioners trying to change the sexual orientation or gender identity of their minor patients, or what’s become known as “conversion therapy.” The high court’s conservative majority appeared sympathetic to the plaintiff challenging the law’s constitutionality on 1st Amendment grounds.
A decision overturning the ban, expected next summer, could have ramifications for Minnesota, which enacted a similar law in 2023 with bipartisan majorities.
Over 20 states have banned licensed mental health professionals from practicing conversion therapy for minor patients because it doesn’t work and contributes to increased rates of depression, suicidality and overall psychological distress, according to a a review of scientific evidence conducted by the Minnesota Department of Health, among many other researchers and major medical associations.
The court heard arguments from an evangelical counselor who says Colorado is infringing on her free speech rights because of the views she expresses during her sessions. The counselor was represented by the conservative Christian legal group Alliance Defending Freedom.
During oral arguments, Associate Justice Samuel Alito called Colorado’s conversion therapy ban “blatant viewpoint discrimination.”
Proponents of the ban cite the harmful effects on patients and argue that states are regulating the therapeutic profession, not limiting speech. Associate Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson made this point explicitly, questioning why the government could stop a doctor from prescribing medications but not stop a mental health provider from giving a discredited therapy that also promises conversion.
Minnesota lawmakers passed a conversion therapy ban in 2023. The Democratic-controlled Legislature passed a slew of protections for LGBTQ people, including making Minnesota a trans refuge state, over the objections of Republicans.
The conversion therapy ban stood out, however, for its modicum of GOP support.
Ten Republicans — eight in the House and two in the Senate — voted alongside Minnesota Democrats.
Rep. Elliott Engen, R-White Bear Township, voted for the conversion therapy ban. He said he only learned after the fact — despite two hours of debate on the bill — that it included a ban on mental health practitioners trying to change a minor’s gender identity, a provision he doesn’t support.
Still, Engen said, it’s destructive to tell a gay child that something is wrong with them.
“You’re not born broken, and if you’re gay, you’re gay,” said Engen, who is considered a rising star among Gen Z Republicans.
Rep. Roger Skraba, R-Ely, also voted for the bill in 2023. He said he didn’t feel it was right for people to tell children that who they are is wrong.
“We’re created who we are, and that’s the way it is. Just live with it. That’s who you are. To think that we can convert someone to be something else is nuts to me,” Skraba said.
Like Colorado’s law, Minnesota’s conversion therapy ban only applies to licensed mental health professionals, exempting religious groups.
Sen. Scott Dibble, who had been working to pass Minnesota’s conversion therapy ban for over 10 years prior to its 2023 passage, said the Supreme Court nullifying Minnesota’s ban would cause “extreme harm to … young people who cannot defend themselves.”
“It means we’re going to have a bunch of quacks and snake oil salesmen running around telling children that they are inherently disordered and who they are is undesirable and they should try to change themselves,” said Dibble, a Minneapolis Democrat. “When that happens, we’ll have a bunch of children living in isolation and despair and being abused by adults around them with no legal standing of their own. It’s truly horrible and very frightening.”
Dibble said he hasn’t considered a legislative response to a loss at the Supreme Court, but he said he’ll work to ensure people who practice conversion therapy aren’t taxpayer funded.
“We’re going to strenuously resist any taxpayer dollars that flow through public health plans being used to pay for it and continue to resist the ability for insurance companies to pay for this kind of torture and abuse of children,” Dibble said.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/conversion-therapy-SCOTUS.jpg,,,2025-10-15 08:02:37.799991

(Photo: April Corbin Girnus/Nevada Current)Over the past two years, upwards of 18,000 young children in the Las Vegas metro area have received free monthly books in the mail as part of an early literacy program started by country icon Dolly Parton. But that ends this month.
Storied Inc., the Clark County-based nonprofit partner for Parton’s Imagination Library, last week announced to parents and guardians that its October books would be the last until additional funding for the program is secured. The program, when funded, provides a free, age-appropriate monthly book to children 0 to 5 years old.
According to Meredith Helmick, executive director of Storied, the nonprofit sought funding from the Nevada State Legislature earlier this year to keep the program going after an initial two-years of state grant funding ended, but they came up empty handed.
Assembly Speaker Steve Yeager sponsored a bill to appropriate $3.9 million to the United Way of Northern Nevada and the Sierra, which currently runs the Imagination Library for Washoe County residents, to expand the program statewide. The bill was referred to the Assembly Committee on Ways & Means, where it languished until the end of the regular session without a hearing or even a mention, according to the legislature’s website.
Helmick also hoped the nonprofit program might be able to secure funding through Senate Bill 460, Senate Majority Leader Nicole Cannizzaro’s omnibus education legislation.
An early version of that bill appropriated $50 million for early childhood literacy readiness programs, but an amendment reduced that to $0 for the fiscal year beginning July 2025 and $12 million for the fiscal year beginning July 2026. Helmick says lawmakers chose to prioritize expansion of preschool seats, a Cannizzaro priority.
SB460 was heavily negotiated and amended to include many of Gov. Joe Lombardo’s education priorities. Those priorities included setting aside $7 million in grant funding for charter school transportation.
It appears those other priorities came at the expense of existing innovative programs that were working.
Helmick says a survey of her families last year found 62% of them had fewer than 20 children’s books in their homes before enrolling their children in the program.
“This program is such a low cost, high reward program,” she added.
Helmick is hopeful the program can return to the Las Vegas area. She says Storied is having conversations with large companies and other nonprofits, reaching out to elected officials at all levels of government, and urging their supporters to do the same.
“We’ve heard rumors of a special session,” she adds. “Can we rewrite SB460 to include the language that it took out? Are there other funds that we could add or tap into that we could fit under? Maybe that’s an avenue.”
‘It isn’t just about the books’
Meredith Helmick and her husband, Kyle, were inspired to start Storied Inc. after attempting to sign up their daughter for Imagination Library only to learn the nationwide program didn’t serve their area.

Dolly Parton launched Imagination Library in 1995 and the program has since given out more than 250 million free books to children in the United States and four other countries.
Storied Inc. is one of several partners running the program in Nevada. According to Helmick, the other partners have managed to continue their programs, either in whole or by scaling down the number of kids served.
The sheer size of Clark County’s population makes that a tougher task for Storied. According to the Imagination Library’s website, nearly 29,000 Nevada children are enrolled, the vast majority through Storied.
Helmick says that before they even had a chance to market the program or figure out stable funding, an intrepid stranger found the sign up form and shared it on a social media group for parents in Las Vegas.
“In 48 hours, we had 3,500 kids registered,” she recalls. “It was, like, ‘I guess we’re doing it now.’ But it all worked out beautifully.”
From there, the program quickly grew just by word of mouth. It was funded from June 2023 to July 2025 by a grant from the state’s Early Childhood Innovative Literacy Program. Participation fluctuates each month as kids are signed up or age out at 5 years old, but Helmick says it stays in the range of 18,000 or 19,000 thousand children spanning most of Clark County.
(Boulder City residents have a dedicated partner, Reading to Z, which currently serves fewer than 200 kids. Rural Clark County residents who live in Valley Electric Association’s service area can sign up for a program run by the energy cooperative’s charitable foundation.)
Over the summer, with the funding drying up, Storied stopped accepting new kids into the program.
“We didn’t want to disappoint families” by starting to send them books only to stop sending them a few months later, said Helmick. “One thing that sets (Imagination Library) apart is these books are sent directly to their home. I am a huge proponent of libraries. I’m there practically every week. But not everybody is able to do that. That is a barrier.”
Additionally, the books arrive addressed to the child.
“Getting it in the mail, the label with their name, it gives them ownership of the book,” says Helmick. “It makes a huge difference. I didn’t realize it until I heard it from families.”
On the inside of each book cover is a note from Imagination Library with tips for parents on conversations they can have with their child about the book, or questions they can ask to boost critical thinking and early reading skills.
“It isn’t just about the books and the words and the stories you’re reading with your kids,” said Helmick. “It’s sitting together side by side. It’s having conversations with them.”",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/grabbingdollybook-1024x764.jpg,,,2025-10-15 08:02:37.799991

A police sergeant at the time, Fails was demoted to officer in 2010, according to salary records.   
Fails, via email, said his “actions at that time were taken to prevent what I believed could become an escalating situation involving an 18-year-old male. No individuals were injured or restrained, and the case was ultimately dismissed by the court.”
The court records didn’t provide the victim’s name. However, a Moapa Valley publication reported in Feb. 2010 that Moapa Valley High School senior Cyle Durham “beat Taylor Fails of Virgin Valley,” at a match on Feb. 13, the day of the alleged battery, according to court records. Taylor Fails is Tracy Fails’ son. 
“I remember that guy,” Durham said of the elder Fails when reached by phone. He did not respond to further inquiries.
“Tracy is known to be quick tempered and has been reprimanded throughout his career for incidents where he lost his temper,” former Chief of Police MaQuade Chesley, who was fired by the Mesquite City Council earlier this year, told the Current. Chesley is suing the department for wrongful termination.
Chesley says in 2019, he “heard yelling in the hallway. I went out and witnessed Fails yelling at an officer who was in tears. I separated the two and HR conducted an investigation,” Chesley said via text, adding Fails was required to take part in remedial training.
Fails declined to discuss the allegation, and referred the Current to the city’s Human Resources department, which did not respond to inquiries.
Mesquite requires that the chief of police have a combination of law enforcement experience and education, which could include a bachelor’s degree in a related field, such as criminal justice. Fails has a two-year associate’s degree in automotive studies.
Fails, via email, notes he has extensive experience with the department, and said he intends to complete a bachelor’s degree “in the near future, and I am scheduled to attend the FBI National Academy.”
Growing pains
Mesquite, a city of about 24,000 roughly 80 miles northeast of Las Vegas, was founded by Mormon pioneers in the 1880s. The population was predominantly Mormon until a building boom in the last 15 years brought thousands of retirees to the Virgin Valley community.
Although Mesquite is now the fastest growing city in Nevada, the police department and city government, according to residents, remain in the control of a ‘good old boy’ network.
The Mesquite Police Officers Association, the police union representing Mesquite officers, “is running the police department and in some sense, the city,” says Chesley, whose termination was initially attributed by former City Manager Edward Owen Dickie to the union’s vote of no-confidence.
Dickie was terminated earlier this year, after the Current reported  that he uttered a variety of racist remarks in secretly recorded audio.
“All these bullies from high school got jobs as police officers,” says former City Councilman Wes Boger. “Everybody knows who they are, and they’re running the department through the union.”
Critics of the department point to the city’s firing and rehiring of Officer Ryan Hughes, who was found to have served without ever passing background and psychology tests.
Hughes’ text messages, obtained by residents via public record requests, revealed a number of troubling statements, as well as an admission that Hughes falsified training records for his K9. The admission opens the door for the dismissal of cases with evidence seized in searches involving Hughes’ dog.
The police department, according to Mayor Jesse Whipple, deemed Hughes, under the union contract, could not lose his job for the offenses.
At a recent meeting of the Mesquite Police Officers Association, Whipple, according to an audio recording obtained by the Current, consulted with union members about their preference for chief of police, with the conversation focused on Fails. 
“The big question is, is the devil you know better than the devil you don’t?” Whipple asked. 
“And that’s kind of gonna have to be you guys’ decision.”
Whipple goes on to say he’s “polled the council four or five times on this and I’ve got four or five different outcomes every time I got it. If this is the direction you guys want to go, I think a real strong endorsement for Tracy would go a long way.”
Polling council members, known as serial communications, is a violation of Nevada’s Open Meeting Law. Whipple did not respond to the Current’s inquiries about what he asked when repeatedly polling council members.
The union has not publicly endorsed Fails for the chief’s job.
Mesquite resident Bob Muszar thinks it’s inappropriate for Whipple to counsel the union to lobby for its chosen candidate.
“In an organized, professionally run recruitment it’s not at all unusual to provide opportunities for input from employee organizations,” Muszar said via email. “But what we are experiencing here in Mesquite is the inappropriate politicization of an administrative process.”
Whipple did not respond to requests for comment on why he advised the police union how to exert its influence on behalf of Fails.
“The City Charter is clear,” says resident Muszar. “The appointment of our next chief of police is an administrative decision to be made solely by the City Manager. Neither the Mayor nor the City Council has any legitimate role in the process until the City Manager presents a candidate for Council ratification. The Mayor’s only role is to cast a tiebreaking vote should the council vote to ratify be deadlocked.”
Some residents are calling for an outsider, who may be less likely to tolerate inappropriate behavior on the part of officers, to take over the department.
City Councilwoman Pattie Gallo says she’s doubtful Fails will prevail, given his lack of education. Gallo says Mesquite should expand its horizons and recruit a police chief from outside the department. She says she’s told Whipple “we need to go outside to stop the madness.”
Boger, the former councilman, agrees. He points to the dismantling by Fails of a volunteer program established by Chesley at local schools that could not afford school resource officers as an example of the police department’s politicization.
Boger says he and a retired police officer were terminated as volunteers by Fails “for speaking out at city council meetings.” 
Fails did not respond when asked why he terminated the program.
The police department, Boger suggests, “has shown citizens would be better off with Las Vegas Metro taking over than having any of them named chief.”",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/mesquitepolicedept-e1760463847992-1024x678.jpg,,,2025-10-15 08:02:37.799991

(Photo by Emma Davis/ Maine Morning Star)Gov. Janet Mills’ first public appearance after launching her bid for U.S. Senate on Tuesday wasn’t a campaign stop, but it underscored her argument as to why she’s best fit to beat long-time Republican Sen. Susan Collins: she knows the rule of law and has a record of defending it. 
Mills gave the opening remarks for a forum titled, “Standing up for the Rule of Law: How do we save it?” to a University of Southern Maine auditorium, filled with people, many lawyers, similarly concerned about the rule of law amid growing challenges to democratic institutions. 
The governor condemned the Trump administration for punishing law firms for pursuing cases the president dislikes, an issue that led to the founding of the nonprofit that hosted the event, Maine Lawyers for the Rule of Law. 
Mills also highlighted how she’s personally fought back, reiterating her now famous “see you in court” rallying cry after President Donald Trump threatened to withhold federal funding to Maine over the state’s transgender athlete policy, which was also a prominent part of her campaign launch video. 
Mills’ U.S. Senate campaign ignites battle between establishment and grassroots Democrats

That comment was met with enthusiastic applause. But public frustration with the shortcomings of the overall opposition to the Trump administration’s continued infringements on the rule of law became palpable as the night went on. 
The speakers — Maine Attorney General Aaron Frey, ACLU of Maine Legal Director Carol Garvan, Maine State Bar Association President Susan Faunce — spoke about the importance of courts as a backstop, though an imperfect one. 
However, the keynote speaker, Harvard Law Professor Noah Feldman, a constitutional scholar, said the ultimate defense for a free government is the test Mills now faces: the public. 
“Public action historically has been the way that the rule of law rejuvenates itself,” Feldman said in an interview with Maine Morning Star ahead of the event. “I mean, the rule of law is not magic. It’s a set of customs, practices and culture.”
Vote. Protest. Speak to elected officials. Run for office. Of the latter, Feldman added, “Sometimes that’s what it takes. Because the system rests on our common belief that it’s okay, and if something is going on and you know it’s not okay, and you say, ‘Oh, well, it’s somebody else’s job.’ Guaranteed that the thing you think is not okay will become normalized.” 










We know that the law is neither red nor blue, it is not owned by any political party, and it is not the tool of the chief executive. The law, very simply, is the greatest achievement of our society, it is the thing that protects all of us, especially the weak and the vulnerable, those who cannot stand up for themselves.


– Maine Gov. Janet Mills


The status quo will be questioned in numerous ways in the Senate race. 
Collins is facing fierce opposition from Democrats who say she’s not doing enough to push back on Trump’s actions. Meanwhile, Mills is highlighting her extensive legal experience to show voters how she plans to resist. 
“We know that the law is neither red nor blue, it is not owned by any political party, and it is not the tool of the chief executive,” Mills said Tuesday night. “The law, very simply, is the greatest achievement of our society, it is the thing that protects all of us, especially the weak and the vulnerable, those who cannot stand up for themselves. If we stop believing in that great equalizer, the Constitution, if we give up, if we lose faith, then we lose the very thing that protects every one of us, at a time when we need it most.”

The public has also been growing frustrated with the Democratic establishment, of which Mills is a part. She was scouted by and launched her campaign with the financial backing of national Democrats, instantly upending a primary field that had been leaning toward a political novice. 
Crowds across Maine have been drawn to Democratic candidate Graham Platner because of his grassroots pitch. The oysterman and military veteran who was scouted by unions and community groups has said he’s running not just to become a senator but to build out a lasting structure for grassroots politics in the Pine Tree State. 
While Feldman shied away from commenting on Maine politics when asked about Mills’ prospects, he was direct when he said, “The first check on the executive is not the judiciary. It’s not the public. It’s Congress.” 
And when asked whether Congress is currently doing enough to uphold the rule of law, he said, “it doesn’t take a genius in political science” to observe that Congress isn’t fulfilling its functions in a robust way. 
“When it passes laws, it’s not insisting that they be enforced or insisting that the president enforce them,” Feldman said. “When he doesn’t enforce the law or when he deviates from the law, Congress is largely out to lunch or silent.”
Feldman attributed this inaction largely to looming reelection prospects. He then credited Trump and his supporters for realizing that “if you mobilize people to vote, you can make fundamental change in the society.” 
Mills hammered this point too. “Whenever and however you do stand up, believe me, you will count for more than you think,” she told the crowd.
But Mainers in attendance Tuesday night questioned their power in unprecedented times. 
“How do we, the basic people, how do we confront the federal government?” one woman asked. 
David Webbert, a civil rights lawyer in Maine who moderated the forum, responded, “One quick thing is to vote.” 
The woman rebutted with concerns about gerrymandering and a referendum on the November ballot that would make significant changes to election procedures, including requiring identification to vote and adding more restrictions to absentee voting.
This back and forth continued to no clear conclusion, but Feldman said the woman was part of the solution.  
“That’s what insisting on the rule of law is all about,” he said. “It is incremental. It is everyday work.”

(Liz Banse)Driving through the Highway 99 tunnel in Seattle could be pricier during next summer’s FIFA World Cup.
With traffic expected to surge when the city hosts several matches, the Washington State Transportation Commission may temporarily hike tolls for the two-mile tunnel to defray additional costs associated with the international sporting event.
Commissioners heard Tuesday that their staff are evaluating potential increases of 50 cents and $1 that would be imposed between June 1 and July 15, 2026, the period in which six World Cup contests are scheduled at Lumen Field in downtown Seattle. 
State lawmakers directed the commission to consider a temporary increase and use the money to cover added costs of managing traffic around the stadium and throughout the Puget Sound when fans flood the region in those six weeks.
Doing nothing is an option too, said Carl See, the commission deputy director. While commissioners need to keep in mind the impact of the influx of visitors, they also need to remember any increase “may have an impact on those who have no interest” in taking part in what will be a “monumental event” for the state, he told the panel.
The Pacific Northwest will host 13 World Cup matches — six in Seattle and seven in Vancouver, B.C. Conversations have been under way for months on how to avert monumental backups at the U.S.-Canada border and assist fans moving between the host cities.
About 750,000 people are anticipated to come to Washington state in the course of six weeks. In addition to matches, teams will be practicing at the University of Washington in Seattle and Gonzaga University in Spokane. There will be training locations and fan zones in the state, too.
State lawmakers earmarked roughly $24 million in the current transportation budget for World Cup-related expenses. Additional dollars were cribbed into the operating and capital budgets for security and field upgrades.
With transportation, there’s $14 million for transit, including $5 million for expanding intercity bus service in the state, and another $8.25 million for operational improvements aimed at keeping people moving. 
There’s $2 million for maintenance in the vicinity of the tunnel. Those dollars will come out of the tunnel toll revenue account. Lawmakers assumed that sum could be covered from a temporary toll rate increase but didn’t mandate one.
Roughly 47,000 vehicles travel through the tunnel each day based on a July 2024 analysis.
Tolls vary based on time of day with higher rates in peak commute hours and lower rates on nights and weekends. They are collected in both directions as one exits the tunnel. 
Weekdays, the cost ranges from $1.25 to $1.85 per trip with a Good to Go pass. It is $1.25 on  weekends. Drivers pay an extra 25 cents per trip with the Pay By Plate option, in which they register their license plate on a Good To Go! account without a pass. There is a $2 fee tacked on if you pay by mail.
What will be studied are potential increases of 50 cents per trip and $1 per trip that would be imposed at all times, including on weekends.
In December, staff will present the commission with projections of how much money might be generated from those assessments and how many drivers might choose to use local roads and Interstate 5 to avoid higher tolls.
See cautioned that he didn’t want to “overpromise” what data would be delivered. If approved, this would be the first such temporary toll-rate hike, he said. Given the short six-week duration and uniqueness of the sporting event, it will be hard to model for every possible factor with precision, he said.
If the commission decides to proceed with a one-time temporary toll rate increase, it would conduct a rate-setting process including gathering public input on potential rate options.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/lumen-field-sounders-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-10-15 08:02:37.799991

(Getty Images)I’ve always considered myself a realist more than an optimist. At times, especially now, that outlook can be challenging. Across our nation, and particularly for disenfranchised people, we are witnessing challenge after challenge. Too many short-sighted decisions are being made, decisions that will have lasting consequences — and not in ways that serve the greater good.
It is not my nature to simply accept the current state of affairs, nor is it for our board of directors and the families and people with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD) who continue to be the core of our mission — now entering our 70th year.  
In response to this moment, The Arc of Indiana has reestablished our Blueprint for Change committee. This dedicated group, made up of people with disabilities, family members, and leaders in the disability community, is taking a hard look at the current landscape of programs and services for people with IDD. They are seeking meaningful, sustainable solutions that expand opportunities for people with IDD, even within today’s challenging climate.
One area remains a top priority: meaningful employment. People with IDD want to work. Government leaders consistently emphasize that people who can work should be working. Yet, too often, bureaucratic barriers stand in the way. We are left asking, why?



				The Arc of Indiana’s fall newsletter focuses on employment. You can read it here. 


In my 27 years with The Arc, one truth has become undeniable, never underestimate what people can do. Individuals with IDD have incredible talents and valuable skills. It is our responsibility to remove barriers and open doors, not create more barriers. 
Listening to people with IDD express their desire to work was one of the driving forces behind the creation of our Erskine Green Training Institute (EGTI). In response to a challenge from our state legislature to find a solution to employment, we built one. 
This year, we proudly celebrate EGTI’s 10th anniversary.
To date, EGTI has graduated 364 students, with 75% securing employment within eight months of graduation. Even more impressive, nearly 80% remain employed 18 months later. These numbers speak volumes about the power of quality training, real opportunities, and high expectations. Behind every statistic is a person who has gained employment, confidence, independence, and purpose.
As we mark National Disability Employment Awareness Month this October, we celebrate the value and talent people with IDD bring to the workforce. We continue to educate and empower employers to see the value of inclusive hiring, guided by the words of Randy Lewis, former Vice President of Walgreens: “Hiring people with disabilities is good business, not just good charity.”
There’s still much work ahead. We must continue building a future where people with IDD are sought out, supported, and included as valuable employees. 
As our blueprint committee continues its work, employment will remain a central focus. Because everyone deserves the chance to live, learn, work, and thrive in their community.

(Video by James Hiatt)  A Cameron Parish judge has ruled that state officials violated the Louisiana Constitution when they issued a permit for a liquified gas export terminal, which has halted construction on the facility. 
The decision, reached Friday, found that the Louisiana Department of Conservation and Energy (formerly Energy and Natural Resources) failed to consider the environmental impacts on surrounding communities when it approved a permit for the Commonwealth LNG export facility. 
The halted Commonwealth facility is one of six LNG export projects proposed, approved or operating along Cameron’s coast. Construction of the pipelines, storage tanks and shipping facilities that make up the facility would dig up or fill nearly 200 acres of wetlands and water bottoms, according to the project’s coastal use permit application.
Judge Penelope Richard cited the close vicinity of other export terminals as a factor in her decision, saying the state “failed to consider the secondary and cumulative impacts” of these facilities on climate change in the coastal zone.
“We hope this ruling shakes Louisiana to its senses,” said Anne Rolfes, director of Louisiana Bucket Brigade. “The coastal use permit needs to be revoked.”
Rolfes’s organization, the Sierra Club and the Turtle Island Restoration Network filed the suit in August 2024. 
“This is an area of the Louisiana coastline that is being devastated by LNG facilities,” said Joanie Steinhaus, ocean program director for Turtle Island Restoration Network. “These agencies have long ignored the cumulative impact to air and water quality and the health of the local community members and the environment”
There was no immediate response to attempts Tuesday to reach Commonwealth LNG about the court ruling. 
Another lawsuit in a U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit rejected the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission’s approval of the project, citing its pollution impact. The decision delayed construction for two months until a new permit reevaluated the full impact of air pollution harms. 
The state permit for Commonwealth LNG will be suspended until the Office of Coastal Management considers climate change and environmental justice concerns in its evaluation, according to Judge Richard’s ruling. The state would need to consider these additional aspects and find that impacts on the community do not outweigh the benefits of constructing another LNG export facility along Cameron’s coast in order to reissue the permit, the judge wrote in her opinion.",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Flaring_neighborhood-1024x548.png,,,2025-10-15 08:02:37.799991

Carnell. Oct. 14, 2025 | Photo by Kyle Davidson/Michigan AdvanceParents, former school employees and conservative advocates packed out the State Board of Education’s meeting room Tuesday, offering their opposition to a proposed update to the state’s health education standards framework, which they argued would marry sex education into the state’s health curriculum, despite requirements in state law for this instruction to remain optional. 
While the board was not scheduled to hold a vote on the standards, more than 40 individuals – including members of the far-right groups Moms for Liberty and Citizens Defending Freedom – arrived to offer their thoughts on the proposal, with more signing up to offer their comments online.
Though the updated standards had their supporters, the majority of commenters argued adopting the standards as-is would violate both state and federal law by preventing parents from opting their children out of the curriculum by weaving sex education into health education. 
Several commenters, including Republican Attorney General candidate Kevin Kijewski, pointed to Mahmoud v. Taylor, in which parents of various religious backgrounds successfully argued to the U.S. Supreme Court their religious and parental rights had been violated when they were not given notice or permitted to opt their children out of curriculum involving LGBTQ+-inclusive story books.

However, Michigan school districts are not required to use these standards. According to the Department of Education, school districts decide whether to offer sex ed and what to include. Content for sexual education is recommended by Sex Education Advisory Boards of which at least half of their members must be local parents, and the local school board must approve the content.
Under state law, parents must be notified if sex education is offered locally, must be allowed to review the materials and can opt their child out of instruction without penalty. 
Ahead of the meeting, the board of education issued a statement emphasizing that optional sex education standards would remain separate, as would local control over how or if schools use these standards. 
Regardless, several commenters took issue with standards for sexual health education for students in grades 6-8, which recommended schools:

Define gender identity, gender expression, and sexual orientation, and explain that they are distinct components of every individual’s identity
Explain how biological sex, gender identity, and gender expression are distinct concepts and how they interact with each other 
Explain that romantic, emotional, and/or sexual attractions can be toward an individual of the same gender and/or different gender(s), and that attractions can change over time

“These proposed standards go far beyond physical health, they cross into deeply personal and spiritual territory, normalizing behaviors that many families find harmful and contrary to their faith,” said Monica Yatooma, a Republican candidate for Secretary of State. “This is not education. It’s indoctrination. It’s an assault on family values, faith and the sacred bond between parent and child.”
State Rep. Joseph Pavlov (R-Kimball) noted that House Democrats proposed similar changes in 2024, introducing legislation to update the state’s sex ed curriculum to be “medically accurate, research-informed, inclusive and age- and developmentally appropriate.”

However, the legislation failed to receive a hearing, being introduced in the midst of a tumultuous lame duck session, with Republicans set to take control of the chamber in the new year.
Opponents of the standards repeatedly pointed to Michigan’s 44th in the nation ranking for fourth grade reading scores and 31st in the nation ranking on eighth grade math scores arguing schools should focus on improving education rather than incorporating discussions of gender and sexuality into health education. 
However, the supporters of the educational framework argued an update is long overdue, with the previous health education standards adopted in 2007. 
“This means that an entire generation of students has gone through school using outdated guidance that does not reflect what we now know about mental health, technology, vaping, healthy relationships, consent, among many other topics,” said Taryn Gal, executive director of the Michigan Organization on Adolescent Sexual Health.

Christy Gibson-Marshall, the assistant principal at Oxford High School, said Michigan communities have undergone significant changes since the previous standards were adopted, pointing to the rise of social media, mobile devices, the COVID-19 pandemic and increasing school violence as some of the many factors shaping the lives of today’s students.
Gibson-Marshall acknowledged that the standards include LGBTQ+ students in discussions, which she said fosters a sense of belonging and acceptance.
Both Gibson-Marshall and Gal similarly called out the new standards’ emphasis on critical assessment skills to help them navigate the vast amount of information and misinformation presented to them through social media, in the news and on the internet.
Gal also noted that the standards do not include education on abortion, despite concerns to the contrary.

Though members of the board did not vote on the Health Education Standards, the board did consider a resolution put forth by Nikki Snyder, one of the board’s two Republican members. 
Snyder’s resolution called attention to several items within the proposed standards centered on gender, sexuality and sexual identity, arguing their inclusion goes against the Supreme Court’s decision in Mahmoud V. Taylor, though Ellen Lipton, one of eight Democrats on the board, noted the difference between the curriculum discussed in the case and the standards in front of the board. 
“I think I might be the only attorney at the table. Although I’m not a constitutional attorney, I am pretty well versed in reading cases and extracting precedent from those cases,” Lipton said. “And Mahmoud, although a fairly consequential opinion, is still based on a certain set of facts that the Maryland School Board and the Maryland district was facing, and it does, when it talks about the interweaving, it was really based on the way that the curriculum was being delivered.”
She reiterated the difference between laying out standards for education and delivering curriculum, noting the local nature of Michigan’s curriculum selection and delivery. 
The motion to adopt Snyder’s motion was rejected, with Tom McMillin, the other Republican on the board, joining Snyder as the only other vote in support. 
According to the board’s earlier statement, Michigan Department of Education staff is reviewing the written public comments on the proposal and will recommend updated health education standards to the board at a future meeting.

Phil Murphy despite advances in solar and some other renewables during his two terms.,"Gov. Phil Murphy bet a lot on offshore wind projects that never materialized. His critics say he had no ""plan B."" (Dana DiFilippo | New Jersey Monitor)As Gov. Phil Murphy’s time in office nears its end, his renewables-heavy energy goals are receiving mixed reviews.
Though Murphy presided over a broad expansion of solar power in New Jersey, his greater plans to produce thousands of megawatts in offshore wind generation ultimately failed to create any new power, even as some existing power plants were shuttered, reducing the electricity New Jersey sends to its multi-state grid despite increasing generation within state borders.
Murphy’s energy goals were always ambitious. In successive pronouncements, the governor called for New Jersey to draw 100% of its energy from clean sources, first by 2050 and then by 2035. But most of those goals were never memorialized in law. Murphy, a Democrat, is leaving office in January after two terms while the two front-runners to replace him, Republican Jack Ciattarelli and Democrat Mikie Sherrill, pan his energy policies on the campaign trail.
Jeff Tittel is a former longtime director of the New Jersey Sierra Club who has both allied with and criticized the governor.
“He really never did the follow-through. He did the splash, everybody applauded him, and then there was very little follow-through,” Tittel said.

The state first solicited bids for offshore wind farms in September 2018, just months into Murphy’s first term. The problems began nearly two years later with the pandemic, when a series of supply chain disruptions spurred by COVID-19 restrictions ballooned project costs.
Ørsted, the Danish wind giant tapped to build more than 3,300 megawatts of offshore generation, pulled back from the projects in 2023, saying supply chain constraints, inflation, and growing borrowing costs made them unfeasible.
“He bet heavily on wind — and I’ll get some environmentalists mad at me — but the wind program got too big, too expensive, and they got too greedy, the wind companies, and it collapsed,” said Tittel. “He bet everything on wind, and he lost.”
Shell New Energies, a 50-50 partner in Atlantic Shores projects that would add 4,310 megawatts in offshore wind capacity, in January made a similar withdrawal only days after President Donald Trump retook the White House and issued an executive order pausing leasing and permitting for offshore wind projects.
The state Board of Public Utilities in August rescinded its contract with Atlantic Shores, the lone project with leases and permits in hand, at the developer’s request. The developer sought to rebid in the state’s latest round of wind solicitations to secure better financial terms, but regulators canceled the call for proposals, citing in part federal uncertainty.
The Murphy administration dismisses the idea that it focused too much on wind energy. Eric Miller, executive director of its climate action and green economy office, noted other states on and off of PJM’s grid faced similar rate increases, regardless of their energy mix. PJM Interconnection is a regional transmission organization that provides power to New Jersey and 12 other states.
“Certainly, we leaned in on offshore wind as a new industry, but I wouldn’t say all the eggs were in that basket by any means, and I don’t think there’s data that supports the position that New Jersey leaning in on offshore wind somehow led to any problems that we’re having at the moment,” Miller said.
Mammoth energy demands from AI data centers proposed along the grid have pushed electricity capacity prices to new highs, spurring large increases to ratepayer bills after years of largely static electricity demand.
Those increases have become a focal point for Murphy’s would-be successors, who have made energy policy a cornerstone of their campaign platforms. Sherrill has pledged to freeze electricity rates for a year if elected, while Ciattarelli has said he would ban offshore wind farms and pursue a more diverse energy mix.

The amount of power New Jersey supplies to the grid run by PJM fell over Murphy’s tenure despite increases to the state’s overall generation, according to a New Jersey Monitor review of state and federal energy data.
Roughly 2,914 megawatts in grid generation were retired under Murphy through the end of August. Since the start of Murphy’s first term in 2018, New Jersey has added 1,417 megawatts in grid generation, meaning the grid saw a net loss of about 1,500 megawatts from New Jersey over the governor’s time in office.
About 80% of the retired generation came from fossil plants. The shuttering of the Oyster Creek Nuclear Generating Station and termination of a handful of low-generation solar projects accounted for the rest of the losses.
Republicans have pointed to the closures in their bids to lay blame for rising electricity prices at Murphy’s feet, though his predecessor, Chris Christie, was responsible for some of them.
Oyster Creek closed 10 years early in 2018 under a deal reached by Christie’s administration that allowed Exelon Generation, its then-owner, to avoid building new cooling towers to meet state environmental standards.
BL England, a coal and petroleum plant that shuttered in April 2019, did so under an agreement reached under Christie. Doomed efforts to repower the plant using natural gas continued through the first 14 months of Murphy’s time in office.

Shuttering plants without replacement generation in hand would put upward pressure on prices, according to Matt Hale, an associate professor of political science at Seton Hall University, who said New Jersey may have been better served by pursuing natural gas conversions like those seen in Pennsylvania and, to a lesser degree, New York.
Hale last month released a study examining a decade of energy policy in New Jersey and neighboring states, one that concludes New Jersey did not create a “plan B” that would have mitigated any failures to increase its renewable and clean energy capacity.
“Instead of looking at renewables or not renewables, the better policy would’ve been ‘let’s get rid of the worst.’ Let’s get rid of coal, but in a transition period, let’s turn those coal plants into natural gas so we have that power,” Hale told the New Jersey Monitor.
Hale’s research was funded by the International Union of Operating Engineers Local 825, a supporter of natural gas projects.
A little under half of New Jersey’s grid generation retired under Murphy came from natural gas plants, though in some cases those plants were decades or even half a century old. In some cases, plants closed because their power was too costly to bid into the capacity market before the recent spate of increases.
“What happened in New Jersey with resources retiring due to economics was common in the entire PJM region, where we saw old economic resources go offline, largely due to record low capacity pricing,” Miller said.
Of the new power generation seen under Murphy, 760 megawatts came from natural gas plants that went into operation early in his tenure, while the remainder came from solar and battery storage projects. The state also has two gas plants in Bayonne and Linden whose 1622 megawatts are sent to New York’s single-state grid.
It’s not clear whether New Jersey could compel those producers to keep their power on PJM’s grid under the deregulated generation market the state created in 1999. Some legislators have raised re-regulation as an option to control rising prices.
Murphy did attempt to maintain the rest of the state’s nuclear power supply. In 2018, he signed legislation that extended roughly $300 million in subsidies, called Zero Emission Credits, to the state’s remaining nuclear plants.
New Jersey ratepayers paid for those subsidies at the cost of about $70 each year, and they were approved over objections from environmentalists — a key Murphy constituency — who said the plants did not need the money to stay operational, as their owners claimed.
State regulators sunset Zero Emission Credits in June. By that time, they had been supplanted by federal production credits approved under President Joe Biden.
Miller said it is impossible to know whether Zero Emission Credits could have sunset sooner, though he defended the administration’s support, pointing to discussions to restart generation at Three Mile Island and Oyster Creek to meet data centers’ energy demands.
“I think the important part is our subsidies led us to a point where the fleet in Salem never went down, which is very valuable, and while on the margins maybe they could have come off a year earlier or so, we’re pretty confident the right decision was made,” he said.
Nuclear plants in South Jersey still account for roughly 40% of the state’s energy generation.










In a lot of ways, the reason New Jersey is a net importer is because it is often — not always — cheaper to make electricity outside of New Jersey.


– Abe Silverman, a research scholar at Johns Hopkins University


Overall generation in New Jersey increased under Murphy, despite declines in the energy that the state sends to the grid, chiefly because of rapid growth in the solar power delivered through behind-the-meter projects that do not plug into the grid, first through rooftop solar and later through community solar projects.
The state added 3,159 megawatts in solar generation through state incentive programs under Murphy, though that electricity overwhelmingly stayed off the grid. Just 16% of New Jersey’s 5,221 megawatts of generation goes to the grid, including 531 megawatts that went in under Murphy, according to federal data.
That distribution means the economic benefits of solar have spread unevenly: Those able to install them on their roofs or to participate in a community solar program saw lower rates, but the lack of new grid generation did little to constrain growing capacity prices.
The community solar program includes a requirement that half of its members be low- or moderate-income residents.
Murphy this summer signed bills that directed regulators to secure an additional 5,000 megawatts in community solar and battery storage generation.
“Our policies have made it significantly easier to access clean energy — helping bring solar energy and electric vehicles to more families and businesses than ever before, in addition to bringing online new sources of electricity following the market-led loss of capacity in states across the region,” said Murphy spokeswoman Stella Porter.
Some critics have pointed to New Jersey’s increasing energy imports as a source of price increases. But while importing electricity from out of state may lead to marginally higher transmission costs, capacity prices that are responsible for recent increases are set along the entirety of PJM’s 13-state market.
The state’s density, combined with a comparative dearth of open space and higher labor costs, mean standing up generation in New Jersey is more expensive than in other states on the grid, and requiring New Jersey to obtain all of its energy in-state rather than opportunistically buying wherever prices are low would increase costs, said Abe Silverman, a research scholar at Johns Hopkins University who studies energy regulation.
“The beauty of electrons is they don’t care about political party, and they don’t particularly care about state borders,” Silverman said. “In a lot of ways, the reason New Jersey is a net importer is because it is often — not always — cheaper to make electricity outside of New Jersey.”

That day, Missouri lawmakers held two hearings on anti-LGBTQ+ bills (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent).When Missourians vote next year on whether to outlaw most abortions, they will also decide whether the state constitution should include a ban on gender-affirming care for minors.
Such a move — placing prohibitions on certain procedures for transgender children in the state’s constitution — would be unprecedented in the United States and likely impossible to reverse.
The debate is playing out while a lawsuit challenges the constitutionality of the state’s current ban, along with an ongoing investigation by the state attorney general into medical clinics offering gender-affirming care.
 
 

 
Missourians’ access to puberty blockers and cross-sex hormones wasn’t always so fraught.
Gender-affirming care bans were not proposed in Missouri until 2020, when two state representatives filed bills seeking to bar those under 18 from accessing medical and surgical transitions. 
The full House and Senate didn’t even debate the idea until 2023 — and only after national attention came crashing down on a St. Louis clinic.
At the start of that year, Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey, who has since left office to become co-deputy director of the FBI, launched an investigation into pediatric gender-affirming care. At the root of the probe was an affidavit from Jamie Reed, a former social worker at the Washington University Transgender Center who alleged the center was rushing children into puberty blockers and cross-sex hormones without mental health care.
Two days after signing the affidavit, Reed’s story became national news when it was published by The Free Press, a website founded by Bari Weiss, who was recently named editor-in-chief of CBS News.
The story went off like a bomb in Missouri politics, and within a week a state Senate committee was discussing it as justification to ban access to certain procedures for transgender minors. That ban quickly was passed into law, along with a ban on transgender athletes competing according to their gender identity, and signed by then-Gov. Mike Parson.  
Patients who received care at the Transgender Center are still fighting the claims made in Reed’s 2023 article. And the clinic, which saw over a thousand patients over the course of five years, stopped providing medical care to minors because of the fallout caused by Reed’s story.
The attorney general’s investigation, which includes inquiries into other gender-affirming care providers, is ongoing even as Bailey was replaced last month by Republican Catherine Hanaway. 
Prior to becoming attorney general, Hanaway served on the Washington University Board of Trustees. Upon taking office, she stepped down from the board and recused herself from the office’s investigation, her spokesperson told The Independent.
Solicitor General Lou Capozzi, who is leading the investigation alongside Deputy Attorney General Jeremiah Morgan, said in a statement that he is “committed to continuing our investigation into the center.”
“Although we are grateful the Washington University Transgender Center has shut down and is no longer performing gender transition services on minors,” he said, “there must be accountability for past actions.” 
The Transgender Center has not completely shuttered but specifies on its webpage that it only treats those 18 and older. The scope of the attorney general’s investigation is unclear, with three active lawsuits determining the amount of information that physicians are obligated to turn over.",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/020723_CaseyPick2-1-1024x640.jpg,,,2025-10-15 06:58:36.743089

The Wisconsin State Senate met for a floor session for the first time in over 90 days, advancing bills that would ban cellphones in schools, require coverage of breast cancer screenings for women at high risk and allow candidates to remove themselves from ballots. 
Ahead of the session, Senate Democrats criticized their Republican colleagues for the sparse number of floor days and for the issues they chose to take up. 
“We are feeling the effects of the big, ugly bill on our families, our farmers and our neighbors who need food assistance or who are covered by Medicaid,” Senate Minority Leader Dianne Hesselbein (D-Middleton) said at a press conference. She was referencing the federal law approved over the summer that made cuts to the SNAP and Medicaid programs to help pay for tax cuts. “So what is the Republican agenda today? Nothing that addresses any of those concerns. The fact that some Republicans are here at all in this building is pretty unusual.” 
The Democrats displayed a poster that showed the number of times the Senate has met per legislative session from 2003 to 2025. Tuesday was the first time the Senate has been on the floor since July, when lawmakers passed the current state budget.

During the current two-year session, the Senate has held seven floor sessions. In 2019, the Senate met 13 times on the floor. 
“We are on the path to become one of the least active state Senates in Wisconsin’s history. It’s irresponsible and reckless, but this is the Republican majority,” Sen. Dora Drake (D-Milwaukee) said, adding that Tuesday also marks the 14th day of the federal government shutdown.
According to WISN 12, the Wisconsin Department of Health Services (DHS) has said there is enough funding for WIC and FoodShare benefits through October, but those programs will face shortfalls if the shutdown continues into November. Wisconsin Gov. Tony Evers has said he would consider  taking executive action if the shutdown continues.
“Congressional Republicans are refusing to extend Affordable Care Act subsidies that would prevent Wisconsinites from seeing their monthly insurance premiums doubled next year,” Drake said. “There is not one item on our calendar today aimed at making health care more affordable for Wisconsinites or to lower costs for Wisconsin families.”
Senate Majority Leader Devin LeMahieu (R-Oostburg) said that compared to the Assembly, the Senate typically takes up a larger schedule of bills when it comes in. The Assembly has met three times this fall. 
“All they do is critique process and complain about things,” LeMahieu said of his Democratic colleagues. “But we’re getting bills done.” 
LeMahieu added that the Senate is going to meet in November, January, February and March before the end of the legislative session. Legislators will “keep looking at different things” to address gaps caused by the federal government shutdown, he added.
Cellphone ban bill
The Senate voted 29-4 to concur in a bill that will require school districts across the state to adopt a cellphone ban policy. The four opposing votes came from Democrats.
Under AB 2, school districts’ policies would need to ban cellphones during instructional times. School boards would be required  to implement the new policy by July 2026 and would need to include exceptions for emergencies, for educational purposes and cases involving student health care, individualized education plans (IEPs) or 504 plans (learning environment accommodations). 
“These are devices that are taking away from our kids’ learning, and folks are asking us to do something about it,” Sen. Rachael Cabral-Guevara (R-Appleton) said at a press conference ahead of the session.
A recent Marquette Law School poll found that 89% of voters support banning cellphones during class periods. The poll also found that 72% of voters support banning cellphones throughout the school day, including lunch and between classes. 
“Wisconsin wants this. Wisconsin is asking for this,” Cabral-Guevara said on the floor. 
According to NPR, at least 31 states and Washington D.C. had adopted a cellphone ban as of September. 
According to a recent Wisconsin Policy Forum report, cellphone policies vary widely across the state, though most school districts already restrict student cellphone usage to common areas. 
Sen. Melissa Ratcliff (D-Cottage Grove) listed a number of concerns about the bill, including whether the bill would impede parents’ ability to communicate with their children when there are safety concerns and would hinder local control. 
“Why are we, the state, worried about taking away kids’ cellphones before we enact legislation that prevents kids from having access to guns and prevents mass shootings?” Ratcliff asked. “While I understand the intent behind this bill, which is to reduce distraction in the classroom, we cannot ignore the profound and tragic reality of our current times. This measure, though well-meaning, would be a dangerous step backward in ensuring the immediate safety of our children, especially in the wake of recent horrific shootings.”
Cabral Guevara noted that the bill includes an exception for emergencies. 
The bill passed the Assembly in February, so it will now go to Evers’ desk.
Lawmakers also concurred in AB 5, which would implement new requirements for allowing residents to inspect textbooks, curriculum or instructional materials. 
Wisconsinites currently have the ability to submit open records requests to school districts to receive school materials. Under the bill, school districts would need to comply with requests within 14 days and textbooks would need to be listed online. 
This is the third session where lawmakers have pursued this policy. The 2023-25 version of the bill passed the Assembly, but never received a vote in the Senate. The 2021-23 version was vetoed by Evers. 
The current iteration of the bill passed the Assembly earlier this year.
Breast cancer screening coverage
Lawmaker advanced a bill that would require health insurance policies to provide coverage for diagnostic breast examinations and for supplemental breast screening examinations for an individual who has dense breast tissue. It would require that coverage include no patient cost-sharing.
The bill, SB 264, passed 32-1. Sen. Chris Kapenga (R-Delafield) was the lone opposing vote. 
According to KFF, breast cancer is the most diagnosed cancer among women in the United States and the second leading cause of cancer death. According to the American Cancer Society, women with dense breast tissue have a higher risk of breast cancer. Dense breast tissue can also make it harder for radiologists to see cancer on mammograms. 
Cabral-Guevara said she started work on the bill when a constituent of hers, Gail Zeamer, came to her about the issue. Previous versions have failed two times before. 
Zeamer was diagnosed with cancer at a late stage. She had dense breast tissue and didn’t receive additional screening. She battled cancer for eight years and passed away in June 2024 at the age of 56.
During the press conference, Cabral-Guevara said that “40% of the women in Wisconsin have dense breasts… if you’re one of those 40%, you do need a secondary screening to be truly covered to determine if you do not have breast cancer.” 
“In memory of Gail, who has passed, as well as all the other women that have been affected by breast cancer living as well as deceased,”  she added,  “this bill is a true testament that we can work together here in this Capitol building and get things done.” 
Wisconsin already requires that insurance policies provide coverage for two mammograms for women between the ages of 45 and 49 and annual screenings for women over the age of 50. Insurance companies are not required to cover additional screenings for women with dense breast tissue or at higher risk. 
Speaking in favor of the bill, LeMahieu shared that his wife was diagnosed with breast cancer and she has dense breast tissue. He said they have been on a journey to deal with the diagnosis. 
“There are people who don’t know their risk that they have dense breast tissue. They don’t know that a simple mammogram might not catch it. Fortunately, she did her research,” LeMahieu said. “My wife is the exact type of person this bill is intended to help.”
The bill is now in the Assembly where the Health, Aging, and Long-Term Care Committee is scheduled to have a public hearing on it Wednesday. 
Allowing candidates to remove their name from ballots
The Senate also concurred in AB 35 in a 19-14 vote. The bill would make it easier for candidates to remove their names from ballots in Wisconsin. Sen. Kristin Dassler-Alfheim (D-Appleton) joined Republicans in favor.
Lawmakers introduced the bill after Robert F. Kennedy Jr. was not allowed to remove himself from the Wisconsin presidential ballot in 2024 after he dropped out and endorsed President Donald Trump. Currently, candidates can only have their names removed if they are dead. 
Sens. Chris Larson (D-Milwaukee) proposed adding additional language so that the law would only apply if someone hadn’t been bribed to get out of a race. 
“There are instances in our recent past where candidates have been taken aside and promised positions if they agree to drop their candidacy, so if we want to make sure we have the integrity of free and fair elections without the interference of corrupting influence. This is one small step in that,” Larson said. 
His amendment was voted down by Republicans. 
Sen. Mark Spreitzer (D-Beloit) said he has similar concerns about someone being pressured out of a race and also concerns about how the withdrawal mechanism would practically work. 
“Once [a] primary is done and somebody has won and their name is going to be printed on the general election ballot, if you take their name off, then you have now denied voters potentially a choice between one of the two parties, and there’s no mechanism in this bill to actually replace that party’s nominee on the ballot,” Spreitzer said. “If there were such a mechanism — and other states have that — I’d be open to something like this, but here, there could be a situation where a safe Democratic seat or a safe Republican seat ends up without a name.”
Candidates withdrawing from national or statewide races would have to pay the Wisconsin Elections Commission a $1,000 fee. Non-statewide candidates would need to pay $250. Under the bill, a person would face a Class G felony with a maximum penalty of up to $25,000 and imprisonment for up to 10 years if they intentionally filed a false statement withdrawing a person’s candidacy. 
Other bills advanced by the Senate: 

SB 214, which would allow health care providers with a credential from another state to provide telehealth care services in Wisconsin. It passed 18-15 along party lines and will now go to the Assembly. 
AB 39, which would require state employees to return to in-person work for at least 80% of their time, passed 17-16 with Sen. Howard Marklein (R-Spring Green) joining Democrats against it. It passed the Assembly in September and will now go to Evers. 
AB 162, which would require state agencies to collect a series of metrics on training and workforce development programs, including the unemployment rates and median earnings of participants six months after they graduate from a program. The Senate concurred along party lines. It now goes to Evers.
AB 168, which would allow felony fraud claims related to unemployment to be prosecuted up to eight years after a crime was committed, passed along party lines. The  current statute of limitations is six years.
AB 169, which would allow an employer to report to the Department of Workforce Development an unemployment recipient who declines or fails to show up to a job interview or declines a job offer. A report could be used to determine benefits. It will now go to Evers.

(Screenshot/WisEye)During an Assembly floor session in which most of the bills passed on voice votes that were unanimous or nearly so, the chamber’s Democrats took the occasion Tuesday to make pointed arguments with amendments that were quickly quashed.
Republican lawmakers lashed back with accusations of politics and grandstanding, while Democrats retorted that they were raising issues relevant to their constituents that the GOP majority has ignored.
On a bill that includes a pilot program for enabling video communications between callers and public safety call centers, Rep. Christian Phelps (D-Eau Claire) offered an amendment to restrict the video recordings from being shared.
“My amendment tightens the guardrails on the pilot program to clarify that no real-time video could be shared with private contractors or masked federal agents with ICE or any other actors not relevant to the incident being reported,” Phelps told lawmakers.
In recent door-to-door visits with constituents, “most of them have been saying they want to protect and expand Medicaid, public schools, they’re worried about the economy,” he added. “Zero percent said that they want more government surveillance.”
The amendment was rejected 54-42.
The official theme of the day — set as always by the Republican caucus — revolved around public safety, and was cued up with the first hour set aside to honor first responders from each of the state’s 99 Assembly districts.
On the floor, the Assembly passed bills to ban gadgets that can automatically hide or swap out a driver’s license plate (SB 66); increase the penalties for impersonating police, fire fighters and other emergency service personnel (AB 136); punish people who harass search and rescue dogs (AB 239); increase the penalty for human trafficking (AB 265); and require drivers to move over for disabled vehicles on the highway just as they must already give a wide berth to a stopped emergency vehicle (AB 409).
The body also concurred — on a voice vote and without debate — with a Senate bill that split lawmakers on party lines in the 2023-24 legislative session and was vetoed by Gov. Tony Evers.
The legislation, SB 25, would shield police officers involved in the fatal shootings of civilians from judicial investigations under Wisconsin’s John Doe law if prosecutors decline to issue charges unless new evidence is produced. The bill passed a divided Senate in March.
Amendments as talking points
On Tuesday, disagreement only broke open when Democrats used the amendment process to highlight some of their policy priorities that weren’t otherwise up for discussion.
Each time, Rep. Kevin Petersen (R-Waupaca), filling in in the speaker’s chair, ruled the amendments out of order, and the Assembly Republicans agreed in party-line votes.
The first of the Democratic amendments was on SB-183, which came to the Assembly after passing the Senate earlier Tuesday.
The legislation increases the Medicaid reimbursement for emergency medical services when drivers arrive to pick up a patient but the person ends up forgoing a trip to the hospital.
Rep. Alex Joers (D-Waunakee) offered an amendment to increase the state budget by $69.2 million to offset increases in the state’s cost to run the federally funded FoodShare program.
Rule changes that Republicans enacted in the tax-cut and spending-cut megabill that President Donald Trump signed July 4 set an “impossible standard” for Wisconsin to meet, he said. “We want to prevent another multi-million dollar heist by Trump and his followers.”
When the vote came on the bill itself — which passed by a unanimous voice vote — the bill’s Assembly author, Rep. Tony Kurtz (R-Wonewoc) angrily scolded the Democrats.
“I’m a little bit taken back by the amendment that was thrown on to this bill,” Kurtz said. “I understand you want to get your political points, that’s fine. But there’s other bills you can do that with. This was a disrespect to those first responders that were here today.”
The next bill to get that treatment was SB 309, giving dispatchers and 911 call center operators immunity from any civil liability if they transfer a caller to the national 988 suicide and crisis line. That bill also passed with a unanimous voice vote.
First, however, state Rep. Joan Fitzgerald (D-Fort Atkinson) proposed an amendment to restore $25 million a year for the current two-year budget that would go to municipalities to improve or expand their EMS operations. The money was included in Gov. Tony Evers’ budget proposal but removed by the Joint Finance Committee’s Republican leaders.
“Today, you have the opportunity to change that and do the right thing and make sure municipalities get the money they need to fund these essential services,” Fitzgerald said. The Assembly voted 54-42 against the amendment. 
Raising Epstein
A few bills later came SB 76, requiring prosecutors to get a judge’s approval before dismissing or amending charges for a broad group of crimes. That bill passed on a 53-43 party-line vote, with only Republican support.
There was no discussion of that bill’s content, however. Instead, Democrats offered an amendment requiring the governor to issue a formal notice calling for the release of the federal files on deceased sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein.
Even before Epstein’s name was uttered in the chamber, Majority Leader Rep. Tyler August (R-Walworth) launched a broad verbal attack on the Democrats.
As with the other amendments, August raised a “point of order,” objecting to the amendment’s relevance to the legislation. He accused Democrats of “political gamesmanship” and pursuing “gotcha votes” to embarrass Republicans, and charged that “they just flat-out lie” in political campaigns.
“And so this is just another embarrassing moment for Assembly Democrats,” August said. “And then they wonder why they’re never going to be in charge of this place.”
Rep. Clint Anderson (D-Beloit) retorted just as sharply.
“You know what’s embarrassing is getting mad about us talking about holding a pedophile accountable,” Anderson said. “I think it is time that we send a message that we think no matter how powerful, how wealthy, and how politically connected you are, you will be held accountable if you traffic children.”
Rep. Randy Udell (D-Fitchburg) speaks in favor of amending a Wisconsin bill to include language calling for the release of the Epstein files. (Screenshot/WisEye)
Rep. Lee Snodgrass (D-Appleton) argued that the amendment was relevant because the original bill was about restricting deferred prosecution.
“We all just voted unanimously to increase penalties for human trafficking and extend the statute of limitations,” Snodgrass said. “You simply cannot vote for that and then vote down this amendment.”
When Rep. Randy Udell (D-Fitchburg) began recounting some of the names of Epstein’s reported victims, Petersen interrupted.
“How do any of these names relate to Wisconsin?” Petersen said.
Udell: “They are all victims of Epstein and these files should be released.”
Petersen: “Did they happen in Wisconsin?”
Udell (who represents the 47th Assembly District): “We don’t know. The files haven’t been released.”
Petersen: “Representative from the 47th, on the point of order — not on national politics.”

Allowing a free-ranging nonnative species to roam a massive, unfenced area that includes millions of acres of private land has led to widespread dissatisfaction and decades of litigation. Are any solutions in sight?
The post Gridlocked: In Wyoming’s Red Desert, the checkerboard has fueled a wild horse stalemate appeared first on WyoFile .","A dozen or so wild horse advocates and photographers were gathered on a ridgeline near White Mountain in August 2024 when news started spreading that federal land managers got the OK from the courts to eliminate two entire herds, and part of another, from 2.1 million acres of the Red Desert. Cheyenne resident and amateur photographer Robyn Smith was immediately bummed. “Argh, oh crap,” she said. “That’s a lot of horses.” More than 3,000 horses, U.S. District Court of Wyoming Judge Kelly Rankin had ruled, could go. 
The group of activists was gathered to oversee an unrelated horse roundup in the so-called checkerboard region of southwest Wyoming, a 40-mile-wide swath of land where one-square-mile blocks of private and Bureau of Land Management property meet at the corners. Fences are few in the region, so thousands of horses pass on and off the private land daily. These walkabouts, and the underlying land ownership pattern, have proven a land management quagmire that has been the source of a half century of conflict, despite sporadic coordination.

Rankin’s ruling in favor of horse removal was just the latest development in the debate over whether and how many mustangs should be allowed to roam the checkerboard. The back and forth involves woolgrowers and cattle ranchers who don’t want the free-roaming horses on their private land; the BLM, an agency that’s required by the Wild Free-Roaming Horses and Burros Act to maintain them on the federal property; and wild horse advocates, who want to protect the animals and health of the herds. 
Some 14 months later, however, the herds slated for elimination were still there. They’d even grown larger. The reason is litigation, which has dominated the 54 years since horses in the Red Desert became federally protected. As herd sizes continuously exceed goals, frustrations have grown. But middle-ground solutions have failed to gain traction as the camps in the checkerboard horse dispute have become gridlocked, leaving today’s land managers and horses at an impasse.
Before 1971, when the Wild and Free-Roaming Horses and Burros Act passed, ranchers in the checkerboard who run cattle and sheep as a collective under the Rock Springs Grazing Association took wild horse management into their own hands. “They removed excess numbers, and at that time they went to slaughter, for the most part,” says Christi Chapman, who’s a longtime wild horse advocate. She co-founded the all-volunteer Wyoming Wild Horse Improvement Partnership. “They did a good job, because they cared about the land and they wanted to have enough room for their livestock. But they liked the horses — they didn’t want to see them go completely away.” 

Velma Johnston, also known as Wild Horse Annie, kneels next to a horse in this undated photo. (Bureau of Land Management)
After the Wild Horse Act passed, management shifted to federal officials. The law protects free-roaming horses from “capture, branding, harassment, or death,” prohibits commercial sale for slaughter, and declares them “living symbols of the historic and pioneer spirit of the West.” It passed both chambers of Congress unanimously and was shepherded by the matriarch of wild horse advocacy, Velma Johnston, who was known as Wild Horse Annie.
At that time, wild horses and burros roamed free on roughly 54 million acres of federal land, mostly BLM property. The new federal law didn’t demand blanket protections for equines everywhere. Land managers inventoried the West, looking at factors like vegetation and water, and ultimately defined 179 “herd management areas” covering nearly 32 million acres in 10 states where the landscape was considered able to sustainably support horses. In another 20-million-plus inhabited acres, free-roaming horses weren’t thought of as practical long-term residents because of habitat constraints or resource scarcity — these were labeled “herd areas” and are not managed for horses. In southwest Wyoming’s Red Desert and Green River Basin, nine HMAs were established, some of which included hundreds of square miles of the checkerboard. 
A key provision of the Wild Horses and Burros Act instructs agencies to “remove stray wild horses from private lands as soon as practicable” when asked by landowners, who are prohibited from removing or destroying horses on their own. That made the broad swath of interchanging public and private land that forms the checkerboard tricky, and negotiations essential. Shortly after it passed, members of the Rock Springs Grazing Association met with Johnston and the BLM to discuss management for horse herds in the region. In the new era, the association had plenty of incentive to work with the BLM to keep horse numbers in check. Their livestock depended on the same rangeland and would have to compete for forage with the free-roaming horses, which can reach 1,000 pounds and face little predation. “They had a great conversation,” Chapman says. They even came to terms on population targets. 
But the horses thrived and grew in the absence of rancher management — unchecked, herds can swell by 20% annually. The association’s ranchers tried to get the BLM to step in with large roundups to no avail, and by the late 1970s, they sued. A negotiated legal settlement came out of it, and that deal was for four herds totalling no more than 1,600 animals in the Red Desert region. 
“BLM-Wyoming complied without delay, but it took from 1980 to 1985 to reduce the number of horses from almost 7,000 to 1,600,” Rock Springs Grazing Association Manager Don Schramm testified to Wyoming lawmakers in 2023. The herds had sprawled across the landscape and gathering them was difficult and costly — as was finding a home for them, because the free-roaming animals could no longer be killed.

Horse populations fluctuated in the two decades that followed. Roundups would drive numbers down to near the 1,600-animal target, but then years would go by. “They would double by the time of the next roundup,” Schramm said in his testimony. “We did our best. We had the support of the state, BLM, wild horse interest groups, the Washington office employees, administrative officers and RSGA. It was a team effort.” But it wasn’t enough, and the wild horses spent far more time above the agreed-upon population limits than near or below the threshold. 
“I will say this: I feel like it’s not the BLM’s fault,” Chapman says. She pinpointed two reasons, naming constant litigation and a lack of resources for federal land managers to carry out their horse-removal duties. Wild horse management has proven to be an extraordinary drain on BLM coffers. Roundups, which rely on helicopters and big teams of wranglers, are pricey, but most of the expense goes toward paying for the horses to live out their days. Some rounded-up mustangs are adopted and domesticated, but most end up in long-term corrals and in off-range pastures where board, feed, and veterinary bills cost more than $100 million annually. 
Finally, in 2010, frustrated ranchers revoked their consent to tolerate horses on private land in the checkerboard, asking that the herds be removed entirely. The BLM went along, citing the act, and even sought to remove herds from the public land squares interspersed throughout the checkerboard. This would have been an almost unprecedented move. While roundups eliminating horses from the “herd areas” are somewhat routine, the designated herds have remarkable staying power.
“BLM has only zeroed out a herd two times in history,” says Bill Eubanks, an attorney who has represented horse advocacy plaintiffs in the Red Desert dispute for over a decade. The Colorado and Nevada herds that were eliminated faced dire straits from a landscape that lacked enough resources for their survival. Animals were “emaciated,” Eubanks says, and federal law explicitly permits removing herds “in order to preserve and maintain a thriving natural ecological balance” in areas. “The agency ultimately documented that they could not keep a genetically viable, self-sustaining wild horse herd,” Eubanks says, “because it was just impossible.” 
The rationale for getting rid of the Red Desert herds was starkly different. It hinged on the grazing association asserting its rights to have stray wild horses removed from private lands as soon as possible, and the assumption that herd elimination was the only reasonable way to do that in the checkerboard.

The association sued BLM again three years later, generating another settlement agreement. This one called for eliminating horses in two herds and shrinking two others. Wild horse advocacy groups, represented by Eubanks, got involved with their own lawsuit, arguing violations of the Wild Horse Act, National Environmental Policy Act and other federal laws. After a federal district court defeat, the horse advocates prevailed when the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in 2016 that the federal agency broke the law by treating the entire checkerboard as if it were private property. 
Appellate Judge Monroe McKay and the court acknowledged the “practical realities of the checkerboard” and the need for BLM to find a “workable solution,” but still faulted the agency for ignoring a key provision of the act. “It seems to me that the only way the BLM can ultimately lawfully achieve its [ecological balance] duty to maintain wild herds and prevent destruction of viability caused by over grazing on public lands is to go back to step one and make appropriate judgments by redetermining the HMAs without the non-permissive use of private lands,” McKay wrote. 
While the BLM went back to the drawing board, the herds kept steadily growing. In the winter of 2022-’23, the federal agency commissioned an infrared aerial survey that found roughly 4,700 horses in the Red Desert herds. Roundups followed and a similar assessment at the end of 2024 found just shy of 3,700 animals. 
Around the West, the pace of roundups has long been inadequate to keep up with population growth, in some areas resulting in ecological harm rather than ecological balance. As of spring 2025, the number of free-roaming horses and burros nationwide was approaching 75,000 —  nearly triple the BLM’s targeted numbers. Nevada, which hosts nearly half of them, has been the poster child of feral horse overpopulation run amok, and its state biologists have reported that the equines eat more forage than all the native ungulate species, like elk and mule deer, combined. 
Impacts on wildlife have also been documented in Wyoming. A University of Wyoming-led research team examined how free-roaming horses influence sage grouse and found evidence that overpopulated Red Desert herds are hurting the imperiled birds’ survival rates by breaking up sagebrush, increasing bare ground and denuding watering holes. Wildlife managers on the Wind River Indian Reservation, which isn’t subject to the Wild Free-Roaming Horses and Burros Act, reported dramatic, almost overnight changes after rounding up nearly 8,000 horses in 2022 and 2023. “It was at an ecological crisis point,” U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Supervisory Biologist Pat Hnilicka said at the time. “If something wasn’t done, there was no turning back.”

In the Red Desert, near where her family ranches, Chapman has seen feral horses eat themselves out of a home during periods of drought and succumb to severe winters. It was especially hard to watch, she says, during the winter of 2022-’23. “We found families of horses dead within feet of each other,” Chapman says. “It was just really sad.”
Wild horse enthusiasts, however, contend that equines are being unfairly scapegoated when it comes to impacts on the land. Casper College instructor Chad Hanson, who’s an avid horse photographer and writer, says that their impacts on grasslands are “red herrings” — arguments intended to distract from more significant concerns. “The BLM’s rangeland assessments make it clear: Livestock represent the most significant threat to the health and vitality of our public lands,” says Hanson, who joined the checkerboard horse lawsuit as a plaintiff. 
But there is a distinction between how horse and livestock impacts on rangeland are handled, according to Jim Magagna, a longtime lobbyist for the Wyoming Stock Growers Association. “It’s the only major species of animals out there that isn’t managed,” he says of Red Desert horses. “We manage our livestock — we harvest our calves and lambs every fall. We manage our wildlife through hunting seasons.” Because wild horses, legally, are neither livestock nor wildlife, the BLM’s toolkit for managing them is much more constrained.

Attempting to remedy the court’s concerns after the 2016 loss, federal authorities prepared an environmental impact statement and updated their resource management plans for the Rock Springs and Rawlins areas. “We’ve been trying to come up with a solution,” says Brad Purdy, a senior advisor for the BLM’s Wyoming office. The federal agency’s analysis assessed different scenarios, in part demonstrating “adequate forage, water, cover and space” to support horses if the trimmed-down herds were confined to solid-block public land outside the checkerboard. Still, there were concerns the herds would easily drift back onto private land. 
Ideas for solutions included fencing the checkerboard and keeping horses on public ground, but that would require extensive fencing that would bisect big game migration routes and could even harm sage grouse prone to striking them. Deemed “not technically feasible,” the gargantuan task was dismissed.
The assessment also considered and dismissed a land swap to consolidate private and public property. “For a land exchange, you’ve got to have a willing partner, and I don’t think we had a willing partner,” says Purdy, the BLM-Wyoming senior advisor. “I’m not saying that in a negative way. It’s completely up to private landowners whether they want to engage in a land exchange with the Bureau of Land Management.” 
The option the agency ultimately landed on was to get rid of the Great Divide Basin and Salt Wells Creek herds, which dwell in areas that are respectively 48% and 72% checkerboarded. The northwestern portion of the Adobe Town Herd, an area that’s 42% checkerboarded, would also be lopped off and managed for zero horses. In total, the contested plans called for ridding roughly 2.1 million acres — an area about the size of Yellowstone National Park — of more than 3,000 free-roaming horses. “When you weighed it all out, this was the most informed and the best decision, I think, the BLM could have made,” Purdy says.

Initially, the courts were on board, upholding the agency’s plans. Rankin’s August 2024 opinion — the ruling that bummed out Smith and the other roundup observers — recognized the BLM’s bind of having to remove the private land horses and having no practical means of keeping others on checkerboarded public land. Represented by Eubanks, horse advocacy groups and individuals again appealed to the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals. 
By spring 2025, BLM was already setting in motion its renewed plans, but history repeated itself, and again the 10th Circuit put a stop to the roundups. Like nearly a decade prior, the court faulted BLM for not demonstrating how removing all horses from public land in the checkerboard is necessary to achieve a “thriving natural ecological balance,” referring to the Wild Free-Roaming Horses and Burros Act. “They said it’s the guiding principle of the act, as Congress wrote it, and you can’t just ignore that,” Eubanks says. 
Federal officials turned heads by announcing they were proceeding with the elimination roundups despite the appeals court ruling, sparking another lawsuit, then another — and eventually an assurance that nothing would happen before summer 2026.
So several thousand Red Desert horses remain on the landscape, and land managers, stockgrowers and horse advocates are at a stalemate. “This whole controversy, it’s been a standoff for 15 years,” Chapman says. “I’ve been here since day one, right in the middle of it.” The 10th Circuit’s summer 2025 opinion instructed BLM to go back to federal district court to resolve concerns about “ecological balance,” but BLM’s earlier plans stated there was no ecological justification for removing the Red Desert herds. There was no scarcity of forage, water, cover and space, according to its own analysis. 
Pro-horse plaintiffs say the stakes are high. Herds around the West could be at risk if BLM prevails in removing whole herds because of the checkerboard’s private land, Eubanks says. Every herd management area in the country contains private inholdings or non-federal land. “Where do you draw the line?” the attorney says. “There’s not really any coherent reason why it could not apply elsewhere. Does BLM see this [argument] as specific to these herds, or is this really something that they’re testing out? We don’t know.” 
Meanwhile, ranchers’ patience has been exhausted after decades of legal disputes and the BLM failing to achieve targeted numbers. Magagna, at the Wyoming Stock Growers Association, sees few prospects for coexisting with free-roaming horses in the long term. “At this point, the only way that the landowners could be satisfied outside of a total removal would be if they were reduced down to [agreed-upon] numbers, with a firm guarantee that the horses would be held at those numbers,” he says.

Others say the potential solution was prematurely dismissed by the BLM. “I think the right solution is for the federal government to have land swaps with the checkerboard landowners and consolidate the private lands and the public lands,” says Erik Molvar, a biologist who directs the Western Watersheds Project, an environmental group that focuses on negative impacts of livestock grazing. “Once you consolidate the private lands, then under the Wild Horse and Burro Act, the wild horses that stray can be removed back onto the public lands — and the private landowners can have wild-horse-free private lands.” 
As long as a decade ago, Eubanks was encouraging BLM to consider a land swap as a mutually palatable solution so that the Rock Springs Grazing Association would be unencumbered by horses, which would then dwell only on solid-block public lands. “​​Not one time has BLM even explored the idea — they just refuse to even consider whether it’s a viable option,” Eubanks says. “What’s especially peculiar is BLM does land exchanges of substantial size. They’re the agency that specializes in these federal/non-federal land swaps for precisely this type of purpose.” 
For now, the steady stream of litigation is keeping the Red Desert horse dispute in flux. As this story was going to press, the federal agency and Rock Springs Grazing Association have not shown their hands, declining interviews about legal next steps to satisfy the court’s concerns about “ecological balance.” 
“They could interpret the 10th Circuit opinion differently than I do,” says Eubanks. “We have very little intel on how they’re going to approach these issues. It may be that the outcome of their evaluation sparks more litigation. I’m sure that would be a surprise to no one.”

The Public Service Commission gave notice that it will challenge the ruling of a federal judge who sided with PacifiCorp in a closely watched legal battle.
The post State regulators appeal utility’s victory in Wyoming rate hike case appeared first on WyoFile .","The state panel that oversees public utilities in Wyoming has filed notice that it will appeal the ruling of a federal judge who sided last month with the Equality State’s largest energy supplier in a closely watched rate hike case.
Lawyers representing the Wyoming Public Service Commission gave notice earlier this month that they would ask the U.S. 10th Circuit Court of Appeals in Denver to weigh in on the matter. A group known as Wyoming Industrial Energy Consumers, which challenged the rate hike request proposed by PacifiCorp, also filed notice that it would appeal. 
The new court documents merely inform the court that the commission and advocacy group intend to appeal. The actual legal arguments will come later, and the case will likely stretch into next year.
PacifiCorp, which operates in Wyoming under its subsidiary Rocky Mountain Power, filed the lawsuit last year after the commission reduced what had initially been a 29.2% rate hike, which was the subject of contentious public meetings due to the historic size of the proposed increase.

The 2023 rate case ultimately resulted in a 5.5% general rate hike in January 2024, along with a pair of temporary upward fuel cost adjustments.
The lawsuit alleged that state regulators wrongly reduced the rate hike by ignoring federal requirements, costing the utility $23 million. Wyoming Industrial Energy Consumers, meanwhile, asserted the rate hike would have forced Equality State customers to subsidize out-of-state users.
Some state leaders have also suspected that PacifiCorp has attempted to shift too much of the costs of a regional power system to customers in Wyoming.
The lawsuit never made it to trial. Instead, U.S. District Judge Kelly H. Rankin granted the utility’s request to decide the case in its favor without a trial, arguing the facts in the case were not at issue.
The lawsuit named Wyoming Industrial Energy Consumers as a defendant, as well as commissioners Christopher Petrie and Michael Robinson and then-commissioner Mary Throne. Throne has since left the panel and has been replaced by Chris Boswell, who is also now listed as a defendant in the suit.

With the 250th anniversary of independence from the British monarchy approaching, Americans should reflect on Benjamin Franklin’s cautionary description of our government, writes Rod Miller.
The post ‘A republic, if you can keep it.’ appeared first on WyoFile .","Summer was hot in Philadelphia in 1787, and delegates to the Constitutional Convention were cloistered in the Pennsylvania State House since May. “Cloistered” is the right word, since the doors and windows were closed to give the convention privacy as they worked. Designing a new country is hot, sweaty work, and it must have smelled like a locker room behind those doors.

Opinion

This was the delegates’ second attempt at forming our new government. For their first try a few years prior, they designed a confederacy under the Articles of Confederation, and that didn’t work worth a damn. By September 1787, they had drafted our Constitution — a governing document new to the history of man — and stepped out into the Philly sunshine for a breath of fresh air.
As Benjamin Franklin stretched his legs and looked around for the nearest place to grab a beer, a socialite, Elizabeth Willing Powel, stopped him to ask, Doctor, what sort of government have you given us?
Franklin replied, “A republic, if you can keep it.”
Let’s break Franklin’s answer down. By “a republic,” he meant that the convention produced less of a thing than a process. Not a static consolidation of power as in a monarchy, but a dynamic experiment that puts power in the hands of the citizens. We live in this experiment today.
By “if you can keep it,” Franklin warned that the notion of self-government would be merely an elusive, fleeting ideal if the citizens didn’t shoulder their own burden to keep it alive. Absent that willingness of the citizens to actively participate in their own government, there are forces aplenty watching and waiting for their chance to take over. A republic is a very demanding form of government. Republics die from inattention.
As we approach the 250th anniversary of our independence from the British monarchy, we should take stock of how well we American citizens have heeded Franklin’s cautionary “if you can keep it.” And I’ll submit that the steps we need to take to keep our republic haven’t changed in 250 years.

Columnist Rod Miller.(Mike Vanata)
The first necessary step is to avoid mythologizing our republic. It is neither a myth nor an ideal; it is hard work. Treat it as such.
Then vote! Year in, year out, 40% of us don’t even take that elementary step. That fact makes our republic a fraction of what it can be. It is hypocritical of us to deport people who want to vote, when nearly half of us don’t take our responsibility to vote seriously.
To keep our republic, we must be both a tolerant and an intolerant nation. We must tolerate different ways of looking at things, because that is the essence of democracy. Tolerance of dissent is difficult, but our Founders, in their wisdom, didn’t want to make things too easy for us.
We must be equally intolerant of anyone or anything that wants to return us to some sort of authoritarian, monarchical rule, just because things often get messy in our republic. And by “authoritarian” I mean both political and religious authoritarianism. Just as we don’t need a king, we don’t need our republic changed into a church, synagogue or mosque. The rule of law, not of kings nor clerics, as Franklin et al intended it, works just fine for a governing principle.
We’ll have a helluva time keeping our republic if we don’t keep our eye on the prize and do the most important work first. So we need to avoid getting distracted by halftime shows, the books that our neighbors are reading, what others do in their own bedrooms and similar distractions that compete for our attention. Remember, republics die from inattention. Pay attention to our republic if you want to keep it.
Selfish citizens cannot keep a republic. To covet universal rights, and to deny, for any reason, the same rights to others that you enjoy, will kill a republic. It kills not only the republic, but the reason behind it. If we want to keep our republic, be generous with the rights it bestows.
Finally, and I think Franklin would particularly agree with this step — keeping a republic demands a healthy sense of humor and irony. People in the act of trying to govern themselves are often funny and plagued with pratfalls and false steps. A republic, viewed in that sense, is like a comedy sketch, and if you can’t laugh at yourself from time to time, you are taking yourself too seriously.
We keep our republic through individual acts of citizenship that add up to reveal our national character. If we, all of us, take Franklin’s admonition seriously, we’ll prove ourselves worthy of a form of self-government that 250 years ago made despots tremble with fear.

(Kentucky Lantern photo by Sarah Ladd)More than 20,000 times in 2024, survivors of domestic violence bravely reached out to their local Kentucky domestic violence hotlines seeking safety, support, and a chance to build a better future for themselves and their children. 
And more than 20,000 times, Kentucky’s survivor advocates picked up the phone to say, “Are you safe? I’m here for you. You matter.” Our advocates were able to offer compassion and support on the other end of the line because of generations of advocates who painstakingly built ZeroV’s coalition of domestic violence programs over the last 40-plus years.   
Now, because of the ongoing federal government shutdown and other destabilizing actions at the federal level, domestic violence service providers in Kentucky and across the nation are facing enormous uncertainty about their ability to continue providing lifesaving services to survivors. 
What remains certain is that survivors and their children depend on our services for safety and survival, and they will continue to need support regardless of what the future brings for us as providers. Friends, family, neighbors and communities have always had an essential role to play in supporting survivors, but that role may become even more critical should providers be forced to reduce their services.   
This Domestic Violence Awareness Month, we are calling on all Kentuckians to step into the ways they can help create a safer world for survivors and their children. Here are a few steps you can take to help us make sure survivors can always find someone to meet their bravery with compassion and support.  
Learn about domestic violence 
Before you can address a problem, you have to be able to identify it. Learning what domestic violence is will help you recognize when it is happening so that you can take appropriate action to address it. Domestic violence is not exclusive to physical violence;it can also include verbal abuse, emotional abuse, financial abuse, weaponization of social stigma, stalking and intimidation, sexual and reproductive coercion, and sabotage of career and education. 
Domestic violence is a pattern of violent, coercive behavior used to exert power and control over an intimate partner or family member. It is complex and takes many forms that can be easy to miss and dismiss if you don’t know what to look for. You can start learning more about what DV looks like at zerov.org/resources.   
Build your skill set for support
Supporting survivors doesn’t mean you have to be an expert on domestic violence, it just means offering survivors safety to share their story. Offering safety looks like listening to survivors without judgment, validating their feelings and respecting their boundaries. Your role isn’t to tell them what to do but to walk alongside them and help them navigate their options.
 Learn more about how you can support survivors from the National Domestic Violence Hotline and practice these skills in your everyday interactions to prepare yourself for conversations that help survivors stay safe. To take your skills to the next level, attend a Green Dot class, which teaches tactics and strategies for intervening in situations of power-based personal violence, including sexual violence, intimate partner violence, child abuse, elder abuse, bullying and stalking.  
Engage with your local domestic violence program 
The ZeroV coalition includes 15  state-designated domestic violence programs. Find your local domestic violence program and see how you can support its work, which could look like organizing a donation drive for needed supplies, volunteering for a fundraising event, filling an open position on the board, or making calls to your Congress members and legislators to advocate for continued funding for domestic violence programs.     
We all have the responsibility and the power to support survivors and end domestic violence. By broadening our understanding, strengthening our skills, and investing our time and energy in the organizations that support survivors, we can create a future where every Kentuckian is safe to live, work, play and thrive; one where every Kentuckian can find safety in one another and in their communities; and one where everyday advocates, just like you, answer the call to bring an end to domestic violence, one action, one conversation and one day at a time.",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/IMG_5866-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-10-15 06:58:36.743089

Debate was intense as Democrats said the resolution should have focused on condemning political violence, rather than honoring Kirk’s legacy. 
Senate approves without political violence condemnation
The first iteration of the resolution, offered by Sen. Andre Jacque (R-New Franken), focused on Kirk’s life, saying Kirk “dedicated his life with unwavering conviction to advancing the timeless principles of faith, liberty, and truth” through his organization Turning Point USA and that his “powerful voice, seen in his writings, broadcasts and countless speeches, challenged complacency, awakened courage, and emboldened millions to take up the cause of freedom with renewed strength and clarity.” 
“Beyond his public mission, Charlie Kirk was first and foremost a devoted husband and loving father, fiercely committed to his wife and their two young children, whom he treasured as the heart of his life,” the resolution stated. “The brutal and senseless act that claimed his life has shaken our hearts, leaving an immense void not only in his family but across our nation, which looked to him as a steadfast champion for liberty… the Wisconsin Legislature honors Charlie Kirk’s extraordinary life and legacy with deepest gratitude, recognizing his fearless devotion to God, his unshakable love of family, and his tireless service to country.” 
Democratic Senators objected to the lack of a condemnation of political violence as well as the positive light the resolution cast on Kirk’s legacy. They introduced an amendment  that would have focused the resolution on condemning the assassination and political violence wholesale. 
“Your resolution doesn’t mention political violence at all. It is just about what a great guy Charlie Kirk was,” Sen. Mark Spreitzer (D-Beloit) said. “That’s not what’s going to bring 33 senators here today together… What could have brought 33 senators here together is the universal condemnation of the assassination.” 
“The Wisconsin Legislature strongly condemns the assassination of Charlie Kirk and extends their deepest condolences to his family and loved ones,” the Democratic proposed resolution stated. “Democracy in the United States depends on the peaceful and civil debate of ideas—not intimidation, violence, or assassination.”
Republican senators rejected the proposal, saying it wasn’t relevant to the resolution at hand. 
The rejection kickstarted heated debate about Kirk’s legacy. 
“I find myself reflecting on the stark contrast between my celebration and the heartbreaking truth that today would have been Charlie Kirk’s 32nd birthday. Charlie Kirk should have had many more birthdays,” Jacque said. “Through Turning Point USA, he challenged a generation, not to surrender to cynicism or drift into apathy, but to stand firm in their beliefs… He was a voice of clarity in a time of confusion, and that voice so full of passion and purpose was silenced in unspeakable act of violence.” 
Sen. LaTonya Johnson (D-Milwaukee) started her remarks by quoting Kirk nine times. 
“Quote one,” Johnson said. ‘The American Democrat party hates this country. They wanna see it collapse. They love it when America becomes less white.’ Quote two: ‘If I’m dealing with somebody in customer service, who’s a moronic black woman, I wonder, is she there because of her excellence or is she there because of affirmative action?’’ Quote three: ‘I have a very, very radical view on this, we made a huge mistake when we passed the Civil Rights Act in the 1960s.’” 
“Tell me, which one of you is willing to stand up and publicly admit that you or your constituents support this foolishness?” Johnson asked. She then called Kirk’s comments racist. 
Johnson said that Kirk’s legacy was emboldening people with his “hatred” and turning “them loose to be open to accepting their own racism and affirming their bigotry.” 
“My heart goes out to his wife and to his babies. My heart aches for them, but the empathy that I have for his family, Charlie never spared or even thought about extending that type of empathy to people who look like me,” Johnson said. “Choosing to whitewash his legacy and death does not erase who he was or what he stood for.” 
Sen. Dora Drake (D-Milwaukee) agreed. 
“I will support any resolution condemning his assassination, political violence, because it is the right thing to do, but I will not honor any legacy that undermines the advancement and equality of all Americans,” Drake said.
Republican lawmakers, including Jacque and Sen. Chris Kapenga (R-Delafield), said that Democratic lawmakers were taking the quotes out of context.
Sen. Chris Larson (D-Milwaukee) said he thought the resolution should have focused on condemning political violence and expressed concerns about the way that Kirk’s death was being used by some to go after perceived political opponents. He started reading from an article about the Elkhorn associate principal who was targeted after conservative influencers falsely claimed she had made posts on social media about Kirk’s death. 
Senate President Mary Felzkowski (R-Tomahawk) ruled Larson out of order and shut off his microphone. 
The Senate ultimately voted 18-15 along party lines to advance the resolution.
Assembly amends resolution 
The Assembly voted 54-42 to concur in the resolution after it was amended to condemn political violence and included some of the language that Democrats had in their proposal. 
The resolution did not go as far as Assembly Democrats suggested. A proposal from them also aimed to condemn the assassinations of both Kirk and former Speaker of the Minnesota House of Representatives Melissa Hortman. 
Assembly Assistant Minority Leader Kalan Haywood (D-Milwaukee) noted that Black History Month resolutions written by the Black Legislative Caucus have often faced difficult paths in the Republican-led Legislature. He specifically mentioned the year when the inclusion of civil rights activist and former quarterback Colin Kaepernick on a resolution kept it from coming to the floor.
Haywood said Kaepernick was “demonized for taking a silent knee to protest police brutality.” 
“I have watched several times as Black History Month resolutions and other resolutions recognizing people of color from Wisconsin and their history have been put under a magnifying glass and faced the most intense scrutiny,” Haywood said. “These resolutions over the last seven years have either been left off the calendar or threatened to not be included on the calendar because of the smallest quote, post or like your members find uncomfortable… What is the bar? Is there a different bar for people of color from Wisconsin and their lives and legacies to be recognized and honored by this body?” 
Haywood read off some of the quotes that Kirk made over the course of his life, echoing Johnson.
“These are quotes from Charlie Kirk, who was not a Wisconsinite, nor [did he] have any meaningful ties to our great state or any contributions to our state, and yeah, you are using his name and his death to score political points from Fox News and your far-right donors,” Haywood said. “Your resolution doesn’t even mention condemning political violence. This is all performative theater.”
Haywood said that Republicans were dividing people.
Rep. William Penterman (R-Hustisford) clarified that his amendment did include language about the increasing threats of violence that public figures are facing. He then noted that Kirk would have turned 32 on Tuesday.  
“Most of us in this body are over 32. I myself am not yet,” Penterman said. “As a human being, he had two young kids. He was married. Just having experienced the birth of my second child between last session and this and witnessing that miracle, my heart goes out to his wife, to his kids, and his family. He was a person. He was a husband. He cared about his community. He cared about Turning Point USA… His impact has been felt here in this state and will continue to be.”

Remember watching representatives and senators in their suits, crawling behind those rows of gallery seats? We were stunned by the violence and havoc we were witnessing. 
Jim Brownlow
Jim Brownlow remembers and on Jan. 6 of this year, at 7:15 in the morning, he wrote with red, white and blue chalk on the sidewalk in front of the Muskego Post Office, “Remember January 6th every November.” When you vote, he is saying, remember the violent mayhem you witnessed with your own eyes. 
Two weeks later, two police officers came to Brownlow’s door because the property manager of the post office building complained that someone had “vandalized” the sidewalk and he had to hire a cleaning service to clean it up. When the officers asked Brownlow if he had chalked the sidewalk, he answered only that he had “exercised his constitutionally protected free speech.” He also suggested that chalk can be washed off with soapy water and a broom. The officers left. 
Two weeks later a different officer called to ask Brownlow to come to the police station to answer  more questions in order to complete a report. Brownlow said no, he was busy. The officer said OK, he’d call the next week. On Feb. 4 a new officer called and Brownlow replied he’d already said all he had to say to the first officer.
Within an hour three police officers in two squad cars showed up at his house. Brownlow and his wife invited them in because it was cold outside and normal people in Wisconsin are hospitable. One of the officers said Brownlow was charged with “Criminal Damage to Property Under $1,000” so he was now under arrest and had to go to the station to be processed. (Miranda was not mentioned.) Brownlow said he wouldn’t go without an attorney although, also, he wouldn’t resist because he’s 76 years old and he didn’t want to break anything.
The officers emptied his pockets, patted him down, double handcuffed him, escorted him out his front door to the waiting squad. They drove him to the police station where he was handcuffed to a bench and questioned. His mug shot was taken and he was fingerprinted. They then handed him a summons to appear in municipal court on March 12. 
On March 12 Brownlow said he would not plead guilty and pay a $900 fine (!) so he was given a trial date in August. He tried to enter a plea to dismiss but was told one can’t do that until the trial date.
Six months later, before Brownlow could submit his motion to dismiss, the Muskego prosecutor told the judge the criminal damage charge was dropped because it couldn’t be proven in court. Then, immediately and before Brownlow could figure out what was happening, they turned around and charged him with disorderly conduct. Same moment, same courtroom, same incident, same judge and prosecutor. At that point he was given a new court date of Nov. 7..
And here we are.
Who is Jim Brownlow? He’s us. A quiet guy retired from his career as a middle school librarian. Married to his wife who was a sixth grade teacher when they met. Together they raised their family and were active in their community. Brownlow ran and lost as the Democratic candidate for the Wisconsin Assembly four times from 2010-2016. (Wisconsin’s gerrymandering made it impossible for  Democrats to win in their area.) Brownlow is the kind of person who doesn’t dazzle but whenever you turn around he’s there, caring, helping, championing the privileges and responsibilities of citizenship. 
An assault on our constitutional rights
What are the issues here? The petty harassment of one guy in a small town or an assault on our  constitutional right to free speech? 
Brownlow says it’s the second. 
This is our First Amendment, adopted in 1791. Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the government for a redress of grievances. 
So when we are told the First Amendment is under assault, here it is. Brownlow has done research (I told you he was a librarian). This is what he has learned: 
The Muskego Municipal Code charge of disorderly conduct, adopted from Wisconsin Statute 947.01(1) says it’s unlawful to “engage in violent, abusive, indecent, profane, boisterous, unreasonably loud conduct or in any other disorderly conduct under circumstances in which the conduct tends to cause or provoke a disturbance.”
Wisconsin courts have repeatedly emphasized that:

 The statute must be applied narrowly to conduct that actually tends to cause or provoke a disturbance. Brownlow replies: Sidewalk chalking is inherently nonviolent, non-abusive and non-threatening. It does not fall into any of the categories listed in the statute.
 Disorderly conduct cannot be stretched to cover innocuous or constitutionally protected activity. Brownlow replies: Drawing with washable chalk is a common childhood and expressive activity that does not reasonably cause alarm, fear or disruption.
 The statute requires conduct that is, in context, of a nature to cause real disturbance or disruption. Brownlow replies: Chalking on a sidewalk, where it does not obstruct or endanger others, is expressive conduct entitled to constitutional protection.
 Peaceful expressive activity is not disorderly conduct. Brownlow replies: Extending ‘disorderly conduct’ to cover chalk risks renders the statute unconstitutionally overbroad, as it would criminalize ordinary, harmless activities.

Brownlow’s conclusion: Because chalking is nonviolent, harmless, and not of a nature to provoke disturbance, it cannot constitute disorderly and the citation must therefore be dismissed.
Brownlow is a thoughtful person. “The people carrying out these charges against me are ordinary Americans who do not see this as what it truly is – an assault on America’s constitutional freedom of expression. There was no damage here. I wrote on my sidewalk at home using the same chalk and it washed off in a minute with a hose and broom.” 
“We need to be vigilant and say what’s on our mind peacefully but with determination.”

Hordes of menacing people, many with weapons, stormed our Capitol and yet are now living free lives. Jim Brownlow chalked a thoughtful reminder on a public sidewalk and is, eight months later, still facing a threatening charge. There are wildly and dangerously different standards for freedom of speech here. 
On Nov. 7 Jim Brownlow goes to court. I will let you know what happens. 
In the meantime,  if you have chalk and a sidewalk, maybe it’s time to exercise YOUR constitutional right to free speech.

Bill Lee said Tuesday the crime-fighting “surge” of state and federal officers in Memphis will be a long-term effort.

Bill Lee said the Memphis Safe Task Force is “going to last months” or could last forever.(Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee said Tuesday the crime-fighting “surge” of state and federal officers in Memphis will be a long-term effort.
At a Memphis press conference, Lee said the operation’s success will be measured by the reduction of violent crime but gave no specific targets.
“We do know this is going to last for months, and we have just begun. In fact, I will tell you that it will last forever,” Lee said.
At the direction of President Donald Trump and Lee, the U.S. Marshals Service is leading a force made up of local authorities and some 700 officers from the Tennessee Highway Patrol, multiple federal agencies and the Tennessee National Guard. 
Lee said the number of officers “will diminish at some point” but that efforts between local, state and federal authorities will continue in some form in perpetuity.
“It’ll just change in its scope as we execute through the mission,” Lee said.
The Department of Justice released figures to Action News 5 in Memphis this week showing 803 total arrests from Sept. 29 through Oct. 12. More than half of those arrests were for outstanding warrants or deemed administrative, which has meant immigration violations in the past. An outstanding warrant could be for a range of legal violations, such as a missed probation appointment. 
The Department of Justice is releasing overall figures on the operation but not individual reports to allow the public to determine its effectiveness.
At the news conference Tuesday, Lee reported conflicting data compared to the DOJ, saying the task force has arrested 850 violent criminals and “known” gang members. 
Lee has said repeatedly the mission will continue until Memphis streets are safe.

Memphis Democratic state Rep. Gabby Salinas said Tuesday the governor’s comments display a lack of planning and transparency.
“They didn’t have a plan going in. They don’t have an exit strategy, and … every operation should have a clear, concise plan and goals that need to be achieved,” Salinas said.
Even as Lee touted progress, Salinas said two Memphis Police officers were arrested for drag racing and a murder took place recently, despite the buildup of state and federal authorities.
“This has not been a transparent process from the beginning,” Salinas said, “and we are seeing a lot of innocent people get caught up in the system.”
Authorities are stopping people for minor offenses and then figuring out which ones to charge, she said, displaying “disorganization within the leadership.”
Reducing poverty and improving education are proven methods for cutting crime, Salinas said, but she pointed out the governor eliminated a critical summer food program that helped Memphis families.
Memphis Mayor Paul Young expressed support for the crime-fighting effort, saying the community has been looking for solutions to crime for years.
“Our team on the city side is committed to that mission,” he said, adding police are “aligning” with federal and state authorities to cut into organized crime and gang activity.

(Photo by Westend61/Getty Images)The Black Farmers and Agriculturalists Association plans to seek a rehearing after a U.S. Court of Appeals panel upheld a ruling barring families from filing “legacy claims” on behalf of deceased relatives who suffered from farm-lending discrimination.
Percy Squire, the attorney representing the association and other plaintiffs in the case, told Tennessee Lookout they intend to seek a rehearing from the panel and a rehearing from the entire United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, “because … this is a case of that importance.”
Squire’s clients, he said, are “seeking to be able to file claims on behalf of the estates of deceased family members who, due to past discrimination, were unable to continue their farming enterprise.”
The Black Farmers association and several individual plaintiffs filed an initial lawsuit against the U.S. Department of Agriculture in August 2023, alleging that the department acted arbitrarily when it refused to accept those “legacy claims” for relief under the $2.2 billion Discrimination Financial Assistance Program. 
The lower court dismissed the lawsuit due to lack of standing, stating that the law requires the USDA to accept applications only from living farmers. The Sixth Circuit panel of judges agreed.
Appeals court says only living farmers can be ‘assisted’ 
The lawsuit’s challenge of the USDA “puts the cart before the horse,” Judge Chad A. Readler wrote in the Sixth Circuit panel’s majority opinion.
Congress, Readler stated, instructed the USDA in the Inflation Reduction Act to provide financial assistance to farmers who experienced discrimination. The panel opined that “assistance” means a form of help for ongoing tasks or needs.
“It goes without saying that a deceased farmer is not engaged in an activity that money can help complete, nor does the farmer suffer any need that money can help relieve,” the opinion states.
What the plaintiffs are searching for, the panel opined, is “compensation” to “make amends” for the past harms faced by deceased farmers.
While individuals can’t file a claim on behalf of a deceased relative, individuals who hold a debt “that resulted from alleged past discrimination” can apply to the program, the opinion states.
Judge Helene N. White, one of the three judges on the panel, disagreed in part with the majority opinion’s definition of “assistance.”
Congress’ statute measured recovery “by the ‘consequences’ flowing from past discrimination, a distinctly compensatory framing,” White wrote in her opinion. But she agreed that the statute’s use of “assistance” is limited to those “capable of being assisted; i.e., that the applicant is alive to receive the payment.”
Squire said the panel’s interpretation of “assistance” is too limited, and the statute’s history must be considered.
“The whole purpose of putting it in (the Inflation Reduction Act) from the outset was Congress’ desire to deal with past discrimination,” Squire said.
Congress first appropriated funding for “socially disadvantaged farmers” in the act in 2021, referring to a farmer’s race. The statute was repealed in 2022 due to its racial definition and replaced with the current law, which bases eligibility for assistance on past discrimination.
“But now the courts have gone the additional step to say, ‘and it must be individuals who are going to farm in the future,’” Squire said. “Well, that wasn’t the way the original statute was conceived …. They’ve come up now with an additional restriction which once again perpetuates past discrimination, and that’s the problem with it.”

It was Uma Chatterjee, a doctoral student, having a severe obsessive-compulsive disorder flare-up triggered by the pressure of disappearing research funding.

This article was produced by the nonprofit journalism publication Capital & Main. It is co-published here with permission.

Since January, core funding from the National Science Foundation and National Institutes of Health has faced deep cuts. The administration of President Donald Trump has cut more than $4 billion from the National Institutes of Health and $970 million from the National Science Foundation, affecting more than 7,000 grants, according to Grant Witness, a database tracked by scientists. Although a federal judge ordered the NIH to reinstate some funding, Scott Delaney, a co-founder of Grant Witness, said that “most grants that have been terminated are still terminated. They haven’t come back, and they likely won’t.”
Among the programs being targeted are those designed to expand access to science for underrepresented groups — including people with disabilities, who account for one in four adults in the U.S.
In 2021, President Joe Biden’s administration issued an executive order that prioritized their inclusion in the federal workforce. But the Trump administration has mounted a broad attack on diversity, equity, inclusion and accessibility initiatives, leaving some early career scientists with disabilities increasingly uncertain about their place in a field where they have long faced systemic barriers.
Chatterjee studies the biology and treatment of OCD, a neuropsychiatric disorder that affected an estimated 1.2% of U.S. adults last year, according to the National Institute of Mental Health. Her lab was awarded a five-year NIH grant expected to provide annual funding, but a few months ago the amount was reduced without explanation, according to Chatterjee. Now the lab is struggling to pay its staff, she said.
Disability researcher harmed
Chatterjee is not the only early career disabled scholar affected. Soli Guzman, a Mount Holyoke College graduate with multiple chronic and neurological conditions, had plans to continue research in protein biochemistry through a program that places underrepresented recent graduates in labs across the country — but those plans were upended by funding cuts.
In April, the NIH ended funding for the Postbaccalaureate Research Education Program, forcing colleges nationwide to halt applications. About 50 campus-based programs were affected when DEI initiatives came under political attack, according to John Shacka, an associate professor at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, who chairs a group of PREP program directors. After two lawsuits — one brought by Massachusetts and a coalition of states, the other by public health groups and others — challenged the cuts, a federal judge ordered the grants restored. But last month, the Supreme Court ruled that the lower court lacked jurisdiction, although it left in place the finding that NIH’s process was unlawful. Meanwhile, roughly half of PREP programs remain without support, according to Shacka.
When PREP was first suspended, Guzman had just finished submitting 27 applications to local programs across the country. “The ground was ripped out from under me,” they said. “I’m a planner. I always have a backup. But suddenly, Plan A and Plan B were both gone. I was devastated.”
In April, Guzman received an offer from the University of Wisconsin–Madison. Because of funding delays, the university could not place them with a principal investigator until early August. At that point, the lab required them to commit within 10 days.
They turned it down.
They also faced financial and logistical hurdles: the challenge of finding affordable housing, the difficulty of quickly finding a roommate, and the need to pay out of pocket for repairs to a car that lacked proper heating. As a person with disabilities, moving would also have meant establishing a new network of care providers. “My health is at its best since 2020, and I didn’t want to change how good my health is,” they said. “If I got sick, I was stuck.”
NSF grantmaking has also stalled. Tara Lepore, a postdoctoral researcher at Western Michigan University and a grant reviewer, said NSF had paused most review activity for months. While the agency’s grantmaking process has recently resumed, many grants that were already awarded were revoked, something they had never seen before.
Lepore, who lives with multiple disabilities, studies equity in STEM education, or science, technology, engineering and math education. The NSF proposal that they submitted would have funded undergraduate and doctoral students to build collaborations between STEM instructors and neurodiverse students. In June, they heard that while the NSF grant was deemed “highly competitive,” it would not be funded because it did not align with the  administration’s priorities.
“It has all the words that the administration doesn’t like in it,” Lepore said.
In February, NPR reported that the NSF had begun using a keyword filter, flagging terms such as “diverse” and “underrepresented” to screen applications, aligning with new restrictions on DEI content.
Lepore’s project centers on “STEM,” “education” and “equity.”
Capital & Main contacted the NSF and the NIH to ask whether the cuts will affect initiatives designed to expand disabled people’s access to the workforce, education and other areas of public life.
Cassandra Eichner, a spokesperson for the NSF, pointed Capital & Main to a statement made by Sethuraman Panchanathan, the NSF’s director, in April, in which he said that the agency’s investments “should not preference some groups at the expense of others, or directly/indirectly exclude individuals or groups.”
An email from the NIH press team said: “NIH and [the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services] are taking actions to prioritize research” that directly affects “the health of all Americans. We will leave no stone unturned in [our] mission to Make America Healthy Again.”
The New York Times reported in February that the NSF had indefinitely postponed an engineering workshop aimed at workforce inclusion for people with autism and other neurocognitive differences in the workforce.
Funding cuts worsen longstanding systematic bias
Guzman’s path to becoming a scientist has been marked by significant health challenges. In college, they developed long COVID-19 and postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome, or POTS, leaving them mostly bedridden. They were later diagnosed with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, a connective tissue disorder. Despite holding student leadership roles and completing three research projects, their chronic health issues affected their grade point average, which stood at 3.4.
“Disabled people are the only minority group anyone can join at any point in their life — but we’re treated like a problem,” they said. “I’ve even been told not to mention my disability in job applications because, in this political climate, it’s too risky. ”
Chatterjee, who studies biomedical science, shared that view. While she was in college, her health nearly derailed her studies. She graduated with a 1.83 grade point average and had to pursue a master’s degree before applying to doctoral programs. She said lab work remains one of the least accessible academic environments for disabled scientists.
“Our work is dependent on rigid protocols, timing and animal models. There’s almost no room for flexibility,” Chatterjee said. “In theory, there should be systems to help — accommodations, people to back you up — but in practice, the culture is incredibly toxic. People brag about working 80, 100 hours a week, skipping holidays, never taking time off. I fought tooth and nail to get here.”
And it’s not just about inclusion or justice. Chatterjee said she believes the Trump administration’s assault on accessibility represents a loss of potential.
Guzman, who is working in a lab focused on disability-related research, echoed this view. They pointed to the Norris Lab at the Medical University of South Carolina’s Department of Regenerative Medicine & Cell Biology in Charleston, South Carolina, which studies Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, and said that many in the lab live with the condition themselves. To Guzman, this is a clear example of how lived experience can drive empathy and innovation. “We’re often more flexible and empathetic because of our own experiences,” they said. “That makes a difference not just in what gets studied, but in how labs are run and how students are supported.”
Yet scientists who bring their perspective remain scarce. According to the National Science Foundation, only about 10% of STEM Ph.D. recipients reported having a disability.
“A lot of diversity fellowships end up going to people who are marginalized but still fit the mold of being ‘high-performing,’” Chaterjee said. “Disabled researchers who need real accommodations are often left out, because the system still measures worth by productivity instead of equity.”

(Google Maps)Littleton voters in November will decide whether the city’s land-use code should be frozen as it was at the beginning of the year, essentially locking single-family zoning into place and preventing higher density neighborhoods.

 Election 2025
Coloradans are voting on two statewide ballot measures and a variety of local issues in the off-year election. Click here for more of Newsline’s coverage.

Ballot Question 3A would amend the city charter by preserving single-family zoning as it existed on Jan. 1 and require voter approval for any city-initiated rezoning in residential districts.
The charter amendment was put on the ballot through a petition by a citizen-led group called Rooted in Littleton. Earlier this year, the group helped lead the effort to pressure the Littleton City Council to table an ordinance that allowed denser housing options, such as duplexes, in many parts of the city.
“The only way we could think to stop (land use changes), at least for a couple of years, was to get an amendment on the charter so they can’t change it,” Joe Whitney, part of Rooted in Littleton, said on the Kim Monson Show earlier this month.

Supporters of 3A argue that freezing the zoning code would help preserve the town’s “unique character, yards, trees, and open spaces,” according to the Yes on 3A website.
“It comes down to individual home rights,” Whitney said on Monson’s show. “In our particular case, all of us moved to Littleton because we wanted to get away from the crime, traffic and pressures of downtown to have a more idyllic setting to raise kids and to live. This threatens to make Littleton an extension of downtown, to really densify and double or maybe triple the population of Littleton.”
Littleton is a home rule city of about 45,000 residents in the southwest part of metro Denver.










All of us moved to Littleton because we wanted to get away from the crime, traffic and pressures of downtown to have a more idyllic setting to raise kids and to live.


– Joe Whitney, of Rooted in Littleton, on the Kim Monson Show


3A would not prevent homeowners from applying for different zoning on their own.
The proposed charter amendment comes in the wake of various land use reforms at the state level meant to allow denser development and spur construction of more attainable housing amid the state’s housing shortage. Those reforms include laws allowing more housing near public transit corridors, reducing parking minimums for new developments and allowing accessory dwelling units to be built in single-family zoning in the state’s biggest cities, including Littleton.
Cities that do not comply with those state laws around growth are at risk of losing out on state funding and grants. Littleton City Attorney Reid Betzing said during a recent City Council meeting that 3A could create a potential conflict with Littleton’s ADU ordinance, which was updated earlier this year to comply with state law.
City Council opposition
Opponents of 3A, led by the group Vibrant Littleton, say it would restrict future housing options and limit who can move to the city.
“Most voters understand that 3A is a reaction to proposed housing policy. But here’s the hidden danger: 3A affects far more than housing.

The Littleton City Council voted 5-1 on Oct. 7 to oppose the ballot measure.
“Land use does not belong in the charter. Look at the charter — land use and zoning aren’t in it,” Mayor Kyle Schlachter said during the meeting. “Second, it’s ambiguous … and ambiguous legislative language leads to lawsuits.”
“When the state says that we have to allow ADUs, but our charter and code conflict with that, that’s a problem,” he said.
The city asked an Arapahoe County judge to review the ballot measure last month but dropped the judicial review Monday.

(Photo by Jane Norman/States Newsroom)When I think about troops coming to New Orleans, I get anxious about the potential impacts on our young people because I know what it’s like to be a kid who is seen as “trouble” in the eyes of authority.

I grew up in the 7th Ward of New Orleans, and I was repeatedly pushed out of school instead of supported — treated as a threat instead of a child with potential. So I know firsthand what could happen if the National Guard is deployed into Louisiana communities under the guise of public safety. There is a deeply misguided narrative about young Black men that criminalizes them instead of recognizing what they need.

Our young people don’t need soldiers. They need systems of care. Louisiana should be investing in mental health care, housing, education, and jobs — not more criminalization and over-policing. Yet year after year, the state pours resources into law enforcement and prisons, as if locking up or intimidating kids will somehow solve the challenges our communities face.












it’s frustrating to see our state double down time and time again on the same failed strategies that criminalize kids instead of caring for them.




I work with youth every day. Through my program Black Man Rising, a mentorship and healing space for young Black men, we talk about trauma, emotions, and accountability — topics many of us were never taught to handle. I see brilliance, creativity, and resilience when these young men are given the tools to lead and the space to be themselves. I see that what they need is systems and people who give them love, consistency, and opportunity — not troops patrolling their blocks.

When I was in school, I was suspended for things like “willful disobedience.” I was patted down every morning and surrounded by guards instead of counselors. Nobody asked why I was acting out. Nobody saw that I was living with trauma from Hurricane Katrina, poverty, and growing up without a father. I was on the path to becoming another statistic — until I found a community that truly valued me: Families and Friends of Louisiana’s Incarcerated Children.

FFLIC was able to fill the gaps in the system, by teaching me that my voice mattered. I began to see that the system was designed to fail kids like me. Most importantly, I learned that I could be a leader in my community and give back to other kids. It was a community that believed in me and my dream for Black Man Rising.

That’s what is missing from our public conversation today. Instead of asking why young people are hurting and how we can show up as a village to help them fulfill their potential, Louisiana keeps turning to punishment. That’s why it’s frustrating to see our state double down time and time again on the same failed strategies that criminalize kids instead of caring for them.

Flooding neighborhoods with armed troops will not stop violence. It will only create more fear and mistrust. It tells Black and brown youth that they are enemies of the state, not valued members of a community.

That is not safety — that is control.

We’ve seen this play out before: in cities like Minneapolis and Los Angeles, when troops were deployed during periods of unrest, young people—especially Black and brown youth—were the first to be stopped, searched, or swept up in curfew arrests.

Real safety is about care and making sure every child has access to high-quality schools, safe housing, health care, mental health supports, and job opportunities. And it means ensuring that when a young person shows signs of distress, there’s a counselor or mentor— not a police officer—ready to help.

If Louisiana truly wants safer communities, it’s time to hold policymakers accountable to the same standards they use to judge our youth. We can’t keep blaming children for the failures of systems that were never designed to help them thrive.

I believe in a Louisiana where every young person is seen, heard, and valued — a Louisiana that uplifts healing instead of harm. We can build that future through targeted investments into our communities. But we can’t do it by meeting our children with soldiers instead of support.",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/nationalguardthree_0-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-10-15 06:58:36.743089

(Andrew Harnik/Getty Images)LINCOLN — Nebraska’s all-Republican congressional delegation continues its messaging effort about the ongoing shutdown of the federal government, which the GOP controls but needs Democratic votes to fund. 
Neither side sees an end in sight, because people in both parties feel they are winning the messaging battle by trading blame. 
Congress failed to fund the federal government this month. The Senate has been deadlocked, as neither the House-passed Republican stopgap spending bill nor a competing Democratic proposal has garnered the 60 votes needed to advance.

The main point of contention: Democrats seek to extend the enhanced tax credits set to expire by year’s end for individuals who obtain health insurance through the Affordable Care Act Marketplace. Republican congressional leadership has expressed no interest in negotiating on the health care subsidies during the shutdown. This shutdown, the roles are reversed, as Republicans when they were in the minority sought policy changes to approve temporary funding or end a shutdown. 
The federal government has been shut down since early October. House Speaker Mike Johnson has designated this week as another in-district work period, making it the fourth week the House has been in recess.
The Trump administration began its promised mass layoffs of federal workers Friday. The White House is gearing up for a long shutdown and has found several new funding streams for critical programs, including paying troops using tariff revenues, according to Punchbowl News. 
“The whole thing’s frustrating,” Nebraska GOP U.S. Rep. Mike Flood told the Examiner about the shutdown.
Flood said “nobody should be surprised” by the president’s layoffs. The president telegraphed them, and Flood thought they might happen sooner. 
“When Congress fails to do its job by simply funding the government, the government doesn’t have the money to run. It has to reduce the force of our federal workforce,” Flood said.

When asked about the layoffs, Flood hinted at concerns over the White House eliminating the Community Development Financial Institutions fund, saying he would make a case to the Trump administration to keep staff in place. 
The Community Development Financial Institutions Fund, part of the Treasury Department, is tasked with supporting community financial institutions that provide financial services to low-income communities and areas often overlooked by larger traditional banks, such as rural areas. 
“I’m certainly going to share with my contacts at the White House how important it is to make sure that staff stays in place, because we definitely need the help right now as it relates to affordable housing,” Flood told the Examiner. 
The White House is set to abolish the fund by Dec. 13.  The Treasury Department, where the fund is housed, is just one of the federal agencies facing layoffs during the shutdown. The Department of Education and the Environmental Protection Agency are some of the others being affected. A federal employees union has filed a lawsuit over the shutdown layoffs. 
This wouldn’t be the first time Flood has pushed back federal layoffs. He played a part in reversing a cut that would have halted the deployment of weather balloons in Omaha and other Great Plains offices.
California Rep. Maxine Waters, a Democrat, has expressed similar concerns over the firing of Community Development Financial Institutions Fund staff, calling it “unprecedented and unconstitutional.” 
“Donald Trump and his Budget Director Russell Vought are using the government shutdown … as a cover to advance the radical Project 2025 agenda and undermine hard-working American families and the programs they rely on,” Waters said. 
Like many fellow congressional Republicans, Flood has been on local and national media trying to make the case that Democrats caused the shutdown. At a press conference Sunday, Flood said they had not come to the table to do the “right thing” and described being forced to deal with a shutdown as being “held hostage.”
Nebraska GOP U.S. Sens. Pete Ricketts and Deb Fischer have called the shutdown a “Schumer shutdown” after Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer. Schumer told Punchbowl News that he feels that Democrats are gaining political momentum during the shutdown. 
Shutdown messaging from Democrats has varied. Some, like Pennsylvania U.S.  Sen. John Fetterman said Democrats are sending “the wrong message.” Others, including New York Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Vermont progressive independent Sen. Bernie Sanders argue that they are “standing up” for people and their health care.  
Nebraska Democratic Party chair Jane Kleeb said Trump and congressional Republicans “own” the government shutdown. 
Flood and retiring Nebraska U.S. Rep. Don Bacon, R-Neb., have alluded to being open to extending the COVID-era health insurance subsidies with some tweaks, and say the shutdown might be about more than that. 
“If you really listen to the Democrats, it’s not about the ACA tax credits … it’s anger at the president,” Bacon said. “They’re trying to show their base that they’re fighting back … and that’s what this is about.”

,Mississippi Today,2025-10-15 10:00:00+00:00,Mississippi Today,"Coast moved toward resilience since Katrina, but insurance is a lingering ‘disaster’",Alex Rozier,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/10/15/mississippi-coast-resilience-but-insurance-a-lingering-disaster/,People on the Coast fear rising insurance premiums are already pushing lower- and middle-income families away from what used to be blue-collar communities.,"KILN – In the days leading up to the 20th anniversary of Hurricane Katrina, Hancock County emergency director Brian “Hooty” Adam recalled an eerie moment, one he fully recognizes sounds made up. 
Trudging through a pile of debris in the woods, Adam stumbled upon an opened book. Staring up at him, he said, were pages from the Book of Genesis telling the story of Noah’s Ark, in which God forewarns of a catastrophic flood. 
“If I hadn’t witnessed it, people would probably have never believed it,” said Adam, who took over as director two years before Katrina flooded his county with a nearly 30-foot storm surge. 
In 2005, he rode out the storm of biblical proportions in the county’s old emergency office, a defunct bowling alley near the shore in Bay St. Louis. Adam, sporting a full mustache and a red polo, now works in a state-of-the-art, bunkered operations center in Kiln, about 10 miles north.

Proudly walking through the new stronghold, he explained the progress Hancock County and the rest of the Mississippi Gulf Coast made over the last 20 years, such as adopting modern building codes, updating their emergency plans and elevating construction in flood prone areas. 
But while the Coast is spearheading resilience in Mississippi, it also exemplifies an economic dilemma creeping into all corners of the region and country as a whole.
“The biggest remnant of Katrina that is still causing a disaster is the insurance,” said Rhonda Rhodes, president of the Hancock Resource Center.
Coast life’s rising cost
Vandy Mitchell, a retired state employee in Biloxi, said he could throw a dart at the city’s map and find someone with home insurance problems, whether they’re worried about their policy being renewed or their premiums skyrocketing. 
Katrina was a major turning point in the insurance market. Before the storm, Mitchell said the premium for his 1,400-square-foot home was about $900 a year. Now, he said, he pays $4,200 a year, a 360% increase over 20 years. That’s more than he pays for the mortgage on his house, Mitchell added.
“That’s not the way it’s supposed to work,” he said. “It’s getting harder and harder to justify living in this area.”

Home insurance is the primary way homeowners can secure their shelters and belongings in case of a natural disaster. Those with little or no insurance have to rely on donations or hope the disaster is large enough to secure a federal declaration, something that is difficult in small, rural areas such as those throughout Mississippi. 
Even if a declaration does come, the Federal Emergency Management Agency as of 2023 capped housing assistance payments at $42,500 – far below most homes’ value. Moreover, as The Associated Press reported, the government is taking longer than before to issue declarations, extending the limbo for uninsured storm victims.
In Mississippi, nearly a quarter of homeowners pay less than $100 a year in home insurance, which, as experts told NBC News last year, means they have such scant coverage they’re essentially uninsured. Only two states, West Virginia and New Mexico, had a higher percentage. 

Within Mississippi, though, several counties have much higher rates. In Jefferson County, where more than 1 in 4 lives below the poverty line, 48% of homeowners lack meaningful insurance. 
Across the country in places with increasing disaster risk, insurance companies are both hiking premiums and pulling out altogether. David Krenning, an insurance agent in Ocean Springs, said large carriers such as Allstate and Progressive have stopped writing wind and hail policies on the Coast in Mississippi. 
Coast residents often are left with policies from either the “wind pool” – a state-funded program – or an “unadmitted carrier.” The Mississippi Insurance Department allows unadmitted, or unregulated, carriers to work in the state to bridge the gap left by larger companies. But those options come with higher costs for the homeowner and less regulation by the state. 
Living on the Coast, Krenning said, is becoming tougher for blue-collar families who have been there for years. He said it’s common to see houses for $250,000 – just over the area’s median value – to have $5,000-$6,000 annual premiums just for wind and hail policies. 
“It’s tough for folks who lived here their entire life, they paid off their home,” said Krenning, who grew up around his family’s insurance business. “For a long time, people were coming here because the cost of living was so cheap. But the continually rising insurance costs could really hinder some areas of the Coast.”

Rhodes, of the Hancock Resource Center, said rising premiums are preventing homeowners from making improvements to better storm-proof their houses. The effect, she said, is translating to renters, too.
“We have apartment complexes that were built after Katrina, and they’re having issues because they have capital improvement needs.” Rhodes said. “But they can’t keep the housing affordable and make those improvements with the cost of insurance looming over their head.
“The frustrating thing is, it’s been 20 years (since Katrina), and we’re still paying for insurance like it was last year.”
Couches on blocks
After hurricanes Zeta and Ida – in 2020 and 2021, respectively – Jackson County received about $18 million in federal disaster grants, and is now developing what officials there say is the state’s first resilience plan. Part of the plan includes improving drainage in the low-lying, flood-prone city of Moss Point. 
Moss Point Mayor Billy Knight said flooding has become so common in the city that during a heavy rain, residents elevate couches and beds inside their homes onto blocks to keep them dry. 
“It’s just become a normal thing,” he said. 
Like other parts of the Coast, Moss Point sits in a swampy, wet ecosystem, and early developers didn’t always consider drainage when planning new housing, Knight said. Now, increasing rainfall is overwhelming the city’s aging stormwater system. 
Most of East Moss Point sits in a “high-risk” flood zone, which means mortgage lenders require homeowners there to have flood insurance. Residents in the city pay on average about $1,300 a year in flood insurance premiums and fees, federal data show. 
But East Moss Point, where the median household income is $26,000, is also the poorest part of the city. Many of the city’s low-income families settled there, Knight explained, because that’s where the cheapest property is.
“People have to go to where they can afford,” Knight said. “Sometimes they don’t realize why the houses are not as much as on the other side of town. They’re cheaper because you’re in a flood zone.”

‘Long overdue’ solutions
Insurance experts agree that as climate volatility continues to trend upward, the cost of protecting disaster-prone homes will only grow. 
“It’s really strange to say, but the insurance industry was one of the first industries talking about the impact of climate change,” said Chip Merlin, an attorney who specializes in insurance claims and who worked with Katrina survivors in Mississippi. “If you go back 20, 30 years ago, it was some of the largest multinational insurance companies saying, this is going to be a problem, and it seems to be getting worse.” 
Those on the Coast, such as Krenning and Rhodes, fear rising premiums are already pushing lower- and middle-income families away from what used to be blue-collar communities. 
In Alabama and Louisiana, lawmakers fund incentives encouraging homeowners to mitigate their roofs using “FORTIFIED” standards, a program through the Insurance Institute for Business & Home Safety. The grants provide up to $10,000 per house. 
A study this year by the University of Alabama found, during Hurricane Sally in 2020, FORTIFIED homeowners in the state filed fewer than half as many claims as everyone else. Upgrading the roofs for every home, the research said, would have slashed total damage costs by about two-thirds.

Policy and planning experts point to mitigation grants and statewide, uniform building codes as key avenues towards climate resilience at the local level. Mississippi lacks both. 
“The only way we’re going to lower (insurance) rates on the Gulf Coast is through mitigation, building a stronger home,” said Mississippi Insurance Commissioner Mike Chaney.
Mitchell, the Biloxi resident, said he would love to upgrade his roof, especially if it means chopping down his insurance bill. But doing so costs thousands of dollars – close to $20,000 for a 2,000 square-foot home, according to Habitat for Humanity. It’s so expensive that he joked it’d almost be easier if a storm came and blew his roof off for him. 
“I think we’re long overdue for that in Mississippi,” Krenning said of a state-funded mitigation grant.

Rhodes, whose nonprofit has worked to improve housing in Hancock County since Katrina, said outside of insurance issues, the Hancock County community has “bounced back beautifully.” Waveland was decimated by the hurricane and is finally starting to see new development arrive, she said, although businesses there now have to navigate costs to elevate their buildings. 
“They’re going to get there, it’s just a little slower,” Rhodes said. “The people who live here, the ones who were here during Katrina, it’s enough of a memory in their mind now that we can appreciate all the good that’s come from it. I do think the people’s spirit and attitude is resilient.”
Getting ready to retire after 22 years as the Hancock County emergency director, Adam recognized not everyone wants to relive the horrifying events of Hurricane Katrina that took 238 lives in Mississippi. But for him, he said, it’s a duty to impart whatever knowledge will help others learn, calling those lessons a “blessing in tragedy.”
“Here’s the thing: People are not going to want change,” Adam said, describing stricter regulations on the Coast. “They didn’t want change when (Katrina) happened. But it’s inevitable. As long as I’ve been in this, if I don’t change and I don’t learn, I shouldn’t be in this job.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/20062909/Hancock-Emergency-Mgt-7.jpg,,,2025-10-15 06:58:36.743089

It’s a natural question if one has never been to a large protest. I’ve seen many of my friends on the right, especially after the first No Kings protests in June, wonder why people choose to do so. Let me offer a view.
I was at the first Boise No Kings rally in June and will be at the next on Saturday … which would surprise some people given my long Republican past.
Thousands participate in ‘No Kings Day’ protest at Idaho State Capitol in Boise

I spent decades being active and working in GOP politics, at the local, state, and federal levels, including working for a Republican U.S. senator and President George W. Bush. 
And I want nothing to do with the presidency of Donald Trump.
Some critics of No Kings question the value of peaceful protests. Gandhi, Martin Luther King, et. al. disagree. Critics also get hung up on the “No Kings” name and argue we don’t have a monarch, so what’s the point?
We don’t have a king, but we do have a hot mess in this country thanks to a chaotic and impulsive president and his administration. 
We have an unlawful and economically damaging tariff regime that both changes on a whim and has sent us into a jobs recession while stoking more inflation.
We have publicly ordered, flimsy prosecutions of political enemies, even as veteran U.S. prosecutors and Justice Department officials are being fired and resigning rather than follow unlawful and unethical orders.
We have equally unlawful firings of federal employees during a government shutdown, happening because a Republican president and GOP majorities in both houses of Congress can’t govern. Ironic firings since many similar layoffs during the failed DOGE experiment (remember that?) were reversed in court because – and I believe we have a pattern here – they were unlawful.
But not just unlawful, incompetent too. The Trump administration’s war on public health continued last Friday with mass layoffs at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. But mirroring the failures of DOGE, hundreds of those firings were rescinded within hours. Maybe someone figured out laying off people with important jobs working on epidemics and infectious diseases is a bad idea?
Proving the point of the incompetence, one CDC employee currently working on measles outbreaks (caused by the anti-vaccine thinking now touted by the secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services) was one of the recent, quickly rescinded layoffs, even after she experienced the same, “now-you’re fired, now-you’re not” whipsaw under DOGE while working on Ebola earlier this year. 
All of which gets to part of what is driving protests like No Kings: These are not just protests about policy disputes, they are protests about the very nature of how our government is being run.
And there is no clearer example of that right now than the conduct of ICE and other federal agents, lawlessly detaining and abusing U.S. citizens and others legally in our country because of how they look, not because of probable cause that such persons have committed a crime. 
I remember from my decades in Republican politics that the right used to object to the idea of masked, unidentified agents of the federal government roaming the streets of America in unmarked vehicles going after people they think don’t look like real Americans.
That’s as good a reason to protest as any if you believe in the Constitution and our Bill of Rights. 
Some on the right will claim No Kings is just “antifa” or that such protests are riots. That’s laughably false. I’ve spent enough time in politics in the Northwest, especially around Seattle, to know what is called “antifa” is a tiny, motley collection of anarchists and far left activists who think Bernie Sanders is a bit too conservative. 
I’ve also been to enough protests and have friends around the country who have done likewise to know the No Kings protests are legal, permitted events in public spaces to exercise the right of free speech. There were millions of Americans at those protests in June. There will be millions more at hundreds of protests around the country on Saturday.
Some may disagree with the anti-Trump motive for these protests, but that is their purpose, and as U.S. Sen. Brian Schatz, D-Hawaii, encouraged to: “Be peaceful, patriotic, and joyful.”

(Photo by Markus Schmidt/Virginia Mercury)When Virginia’s two attorney general candidates are set to meet Thursday at the University of Richmond for what is expected to be their only debate before Election Day, the focus will almost certainly fall on one thing — the scandal over Democrat Jay Jones’s recently leaked text messages to Republican Del. Carrie Coyner that sent shockwaves through Virginia’s 2025 election cycle.
Jones, a former state delegate from Norfolk, has apologized for sending messages that referenced shooting former House Speaker Todd Gilbert, R-Shenandoah — comments that have upended the race and now threaten to define it.
‘Beyond disqualifying’: Jay Jones controversy jolts Virginia’s pivotal 2025 elections

In the August 2022 exchange, Jones told Coyner that if given a choice between Adolf Hitler, Cambodian dictator Pol Pot and Gilbert, “then Gilbert gets two bullets.” He later elaborated in a phone call that “it would take Gilbert’s wife holding their dying children in her arms” for him to act on gun safety legislation.
When the texts surfaced earlier this month, Jones did not deny writing them, but refused to follow widespread calls to drop out of the race.
The controversy has rippled beyond the attorney general contest, dominating all three statewide races. Republicans have seized on the episode to boost Attorney General Jason Miyares and GOP gubernatorial nominee Winsome Earle-Sears. The Republican Governors Association poured an additional $1.5 million into attack ads aimed at Jones.
Cook Political Report analyst Matthew Klein said the violent rhetoric is “uniquely potent” in a year already marked by political violence — from the assassination attempt on President Donald Trump and the fatal shooting of conservative influencer Charlie Kirk, to recent attacks on Democratic lawmakers in Minnesota.
In Virginia, multiple politicians, including Del. Geary Higgins, R-Loudoun, and Del. Kim Taylor, R-Petersburg, have reported receiving death threats. Former Democratic House candidate Susanna Gibson also said she was targeted in 2023, with a SWAT team called to her home.
In the Jones scandal, Coyner further alleged that the Democrat had suggested in 2020 that police officers would need to die before they would stop killing others, but he denied the claim.
Klein said the recent events underscore how partisan polarization has hardened voter attitudes. 
“It’s possible,” he said, that some Democratic voters could support their party up and down the ticket in the weeks leading up to the Nov. 4 election while still leaving Jones’ box on the ballot blank. Others, he added, may “hold their nose” and vote for him anyway. 
“I absolutely think this is a very competitive race right now,” Klein said. “Miyares has a decent chance to win another term, which was not something that I would have said even a couple of weeks ago.”
With early voting underway and calls for Jones to withdraw coming from both parties — including Trump and some national Republicans — Thursday’s debate is expected to be a critical moment.
The controversy has become a test of political loyalty, forcing Democrats to decide whether to stand by a wounded nominee or risk conceding the race altogether.
 Local and national significance

Political analyst Bob Holsworth noted that gubernatorial candidates often capture most of voters’ attention during statewide elections, but he, too, emphasized the significance of the contest between Jones and Miyares.
“This is the most important attorney general race since Massive Resistance,” he said, referring to the campaign of opposition led by conservative state lawmakers in the 1950s to block the desegregation of public schools following the U.S. Supreme Court’s Brown v. Board of Education decision. “That’s because of the impact that the attorney general role has with the Trump administration.”
He pointed to Miyares’ influence over hiring and firing legal counsel at public universities. Attorneys general also serve as counsel to governors, and Youngkin has stacked university boards of visitors with his appointees. 
One such institution, the University of Virginia, has been embroiled in controversies this year over complaints about lack of transparency, pressure from the Trump administration to roll back Diversity, Equity and Inclusion policies, and the resignation of its president following pushback from the White House. 
Immigration is another area where Miyares could remain a Trump ally while Jones stands to be his counterweight in Virginia. 
As detentions and deportations of undocumented immigrants have ramped up since Trump’s second term began earlier this year, Miyares has supported claims that the thousands of people rounded up were violent criminals. 
He and Youngkin could not substantiate that claim this summer, and records as of October show that a majority of those detained so far do not have prior criminal histories.
Miyares offers no proof that 2,500 immigrants arrested by Va. task force were violent offenders

Klein emphasized that Democratic attorneys general remain one of a few checks on power against Republican majorities in Congress and the White House. 
While Virginia is in the process of potentially enshrining abortion protections into its state constitution, other states with bans have sought the extradition of people who travel for the procedure —  an area where attorneys general play a key role. 
Though the attorney general is a state-level position, it can wield national influence both politically and within the country’s legal system. From joining multistate consumer protection lawsuits that transcend state borders to serving as an ally or adversary to presidents, the office’s impact extends well beyond Virginia. 
Where Miyares has routinely supported Trump, Jones has campaigned on serving as a defender against the president. In recent months, Democratic attorneys general have joined forces on measures to prevent Trump from deploying the National Guard in their states and to block proposed changes to the Affordable Care Act marketplace. 
While attorneys general are not lawmakers, they can exert influence in the state legislature by endorsing or opposing key bills. Miyares has repeatedly used his office to oppose legislation allowing certain offenders who have demonstrated rehabilitation to shorten their sentences. In 2024, his office threatened to withhold state-appropriated funding from a victims’ assistance organization because it supported a bill that he opposed. 
Although Jones has not yet served as the state’s top lawyer, he has outlined priorities for the laws he would champion if elected. For instance, he plans to join multistate coalitions pushing back against abortion restrictions or bans and supports Virginia’s ongoing constitutional amendment process to enshrine abortion protections. 
Where Miyares could continue to act as an ally to Trump, Jones has presented himself as someone who would sign onto lawsuits challenging what he views as instances of federal overreach by the Trump administration. 
 Up and down the tickets

Though Trump has loomed large over American politics at every level for the past decade, Miyares and Jones appear on the ballot this year beneath their respective running mates: Earle-Sears and Abigail Spanberger, the Democratic gubernatorial nominee. 
While it would be rare for Virginia to see a split-ticket result, Klein isn’t ruling out the possibility. 
Beyond the state’s history of electing governors and executive tickets opposite the party that won the White House the prior year, Klein said he still believes Spanberger holds an edge for several reasons. 
While she has focused her campaign on outlining policy proposals, Klein said Earle-Sears’ fixation on issues such as transgender bathroom access and participation on sports teams isn’t widely appealing. Her “downright toxic” stances on same-sex marriage and workplace protections, he added, risk alienating voters and put her at odds with Republican lieutenant governor nomineeJohn Reid — a gay man who admits that the two don’t agree on his identity and who he loves. 
Klein added that the economic fallout from federal actions, including workforce cuts, has also become a pressing issue both candidates have had to address. Virginia, along with Maryland and Texas, has the largest concentration of federal workers in the country. 
“The cake was kind of baked there from the beginning with the DOGE firings,” he said, referring to Trump’s Department of Government Efficiency. 
And downplaying the state’s economic hit, Klein warned, could cost candidates votes.

Spanberger, meanwhile, has had to navigate GOP efforts to tie Jones’ text messages to her campaign. 
Holsworth said it’s a new strategy he’s seeing — one that suggests Republicans may spend the rest of the election cycle “trying to use the bottom of the ticket to influence the top.”
During last week’s gubernatorial debate, Earle-Sears frequently interrupted  Spanberger, lambasting her for sharing a ticket with Jones and repeatedly calling  for him to drop out. 
“Jay Jones advocated the murder of a man, a former speaker, as well as his children,” Earle-Sears told the moderators at one point. “What if he said it about your three children?” she asked  Spanberger directly. “I’m asking my opponent to please ask Jay Jones to get out of the race.”
When moderators pressed Spanberger on when she learned about Jones’ texts and if she endorsed him, the Democrat did not say explicitly whether or not he had her support. 
However, Spanberger called the messages “abhorrent” and suggested  she first learned of them when the story broke,  reiterating that  she had denounced them at the time. 
Signaling her intent to run her own campaign, Spanberger added, “It is up to voters to make an individual choice based on this information.”
With the controversy over Jones’s texts still reverberating across the campaign trail, Thursday’s attorney general debate will likely offer voters their clearest look yet at how both men defend their records — and how they define the office in a sharply divided Virginia.

The two candidates spoke to more than 400 attendees from business, education and policy backgrounds about the challenges and their respective plans during Tuesday’s conference at the Greater Richmond Convention Center, which focused on building a more skilled and competitive workforce. The event was co-hosted by the Virginia Chamber Foundation, Virginia Business Higher Education Council, VCF Workforce and Education Center and Virginia Talent + Opportunity Partnership. 
Spanberger, the Democratic nominee, addressed improving Virginia’s rating for the Best State to do Business by CNBC. The commonwealth, consistently ranked a top-three finisher in the past five years, dropped from the top spot to fourth this summer due to the federal job cuts by President Donald Trump’s administration that have disproportionately affected Virginia, home to 147,000 civilian federal employees. The state did maintain its top rating for education for the second straight year. 
“We must do everything we can to get Virginia back to number one in the CNBC rankings and that means strategic investments in workforce training, affordable childcare and housing, streamlining permanent shovel-ready sites and reliable infrastructure,” said Spanberger during her remarks Tuesday morning.
Earle-Sears, the current lieutenant governor and the GOP challenger for governor, did not mention the ranking, but instead explained how collaboration has played a big role in education and workforce development in the commonwealth, and applauded the Virginia Chamber, which she said “brought together the people who make Virginia’s story possible.”
“(But) this is not a moment for complacency,” Earle-Sears said. “It is a call to strengthen our resolve and sharpen our edge and continue to lead; and under my leadership, Virginia will rise to that challenge. We will maintain not just our domestic competitive advantage, but our international life as well.”
She spoke about how Virginia’s education system shaped her career, urging stakeholders to continue working together to ensure that Virginia has a “phenomenal” workforce across all sectors. She also touted the success of the current administration, led by Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin, by investing in businesses and teacher training, as well as expanding laboratory schools that offer tuition-free specialized instruction in high-demand careers such as teaching, computer science, and technology.
Earle-Sears said artificial intelligence poses a rising challenge for Virginia as it competes with countries outside of the United States, and supports workforce reentry for groups like veterans and military families. 
As governor, Earle-Sears said she would continue the current administration’s priorities of strengthening the workforce and empowering students through rigorous academics and different pathways.
Spanberger noted the cost of living as a sizable challenge, with Virginians navigating rising expenses for health care, housing, and energy, and facing uncertainty amid the federal government’s job cuts and shutdown.
The state could do more to support working people by establishing family medical leave, increasing affordable housing supply and childcare access and raising the minimum wage, Spanberger suggested.
As for displaced workers, the Democrat proposed ways the state could help identify adjacent job opportunities and expand career mentoring. She also shared plans to strengthen workforce development from early childhood through career training, increasing funding for community colleges, expanding dual enrollment classes and ensuring flexibility in the education system to prepare students for emerging technologies. 
“I know there are those who think you can be pro-business or pro-worker, and I wouldn’t be surprised if there’s some people in this room that hold that opinion, but I reject that idea. We can do both,” Spanberger said. “Virginia’s economic success has always come from balancing those forces, and under the right leadership, with the right coalition, we can keep that balance for decades into the future.”
Both candidates also defended their stances of support for Virginia’s right-to-work law, which prohibits employees from being required to join a union or pay union dues as a condition of employment.
Keith Martin, interim president and CEO of the Virginia Chamber of Commerce, told reporters that the conference is a way for stakeholders from all industries and the candidates for governor to collaborate, as it follows the Blueprint Virginia 2035, which serves as a guide to ensure the commonwealth remains a top state for business. Historically, the chamber has not endorsed any candidate.
“We’re working with both candidates for governor,” Martin said. “We’re optimistic in our partnership that we’ll have with the next governor, and the collaboration we have with the business community and higher education moving forward.” 
The deadline to register to vote, update registration or apply for a ballot to be mailed is on Oct. 24. In-person early voting ends Nov. 1. Election Day is Nov. 4.

More than a decade ago, residents of Loudoun County, Virginia, banded together to buy up treasured open space before it became a strip mall and housing development, donating the land to the Piedmont Environmental Council instead. The nonprofit has maintained it as a unique blend of cattle pasture, a nature preserve, and a community farm that donates its yield to a local food pantry.


Now, a small corner of the farm has become what organizers say is a first for the state: a crop-based agrivoltaics demonstration project. They hope the combination of solar panels and vegetable farming will showcase how much-needed renewable energy can complement, not harm, agricultural lands, at a time when data centers are demanding more and more electricity.


The Virginia Clean Economy Act requires the state’s largest utility, Dominion Energy, to stop burning fossil fuels by 2045and to develop 16,100 megawatts of land-based renewable energy by 2035 — mostly in the form of solar.


Virginia has more than enough room to meet that target without threatening great swaths of farmland. Using a conservative metric that 10 acres of land can host 1 megawatt of solar capacity, a Nature Conservancy analysis found that the state has 40 times more suitable land area than needed for solar fields, even after ruling out over 2 million acres of ​“prime conservation lands” including farmland.


Researchers from Virginia Commonwealth University determined that large-scale solar today is erected on less than 1% of the state’s cropland. Under a ​“high-growth scenario,” that figure could rise to 3.1% by 2035, including 1.2% of the state’s federally designated prime farmland. Yet low-density residential development may pose a far greater threat to those spaces, according to research by the nonprofit American Farmland Trust, which advocates for ​“smart solar” that doesn’t jeopardize agricultural land.


In fact, many landowners find that renting a portion of their land to solar companies can help their farming enterprise pencil out financially, reducing pressure to sell their property to developers. An acre of land, after all, may yield hundreds of dollars if devoted to crops but thousands if leased for panels.


And yet there’s no doubt that solar has grown exponentially in the state in the last decade, and that it has disproportionately displaced farmland. Cropland makes up 5% of Virginia’s total acreage but 28% of the land area now used for large-scale solar, the Virginia Commonwealth University researchers found.


Especially in the early years of renewable-energy construction, some companies set a poor example for responsible development, said Ashish Kapoor, senior energy and climate advisor with the Piedmont Environmental Council. ​“It was a little bit ​‘Wild West,’” he said. ​“Those early projects in 2018, 2019 — there were a lot of significant runoff issues.”


As solar fields have gone up at a breakneck pace — replacing plots of forests as well as farmland — opposition to them has also grown. Virginia localities approved 100% of solar projects in 2016, according to reporting from Inside Climate News. By 2024, the approval rate had fallen to under 50%.


The increasing number of rejections stems from a ​“a mix of disinformation and resentment,” Kapoor said. But the tension between solar and farmland is real. ​“That’s a national thing,” he added. ​“It’s everywhere.”


Agrivoltaics — the awkward portmanteau of agriculture and solar photovoltaics — has emerged as a potential solution, wherein farmland is kept in production even while it hosts solar arrays. The most common application is sheep: They graze on vegetation beneath the panels and prevent the need for expensive and polluting mowers. Planting flowers in and around panels to supply honeybees and other pollinators is also popular.


Still, the Piedmont Environmental Council team wanted to experiment with a crop-based model because it fits better with what most farmers in the area are doing now: raising vegetables.
“You want to change as little as possible for the farmer,” said Teddy Pitsiokos, who manages the organization’s community farm.

Occupying a quarter-acre section of the nonprofit’s 8-acre community vegetable farm in Loudoun County, the agrivoltaics project is small by design. It features 42 ground-mounted solar panels with a total capacity of 17 kilowatts, two batteries for backup power during outages, and about 2,000 square feet of growing area.


The array will supply more than enough power to meet the farm’s needs, with additional headroom for a planned EVcharger and a greenhouse that organizers want to electrify eventually. But the Piedmont Environmental Council isn’t trying to demonstrate scale. Rather, it hopes to carefully measure impact.


With the shade and protection from rainwater that they provide, how do the solar panels affect soil moisture and temperature? What’s the resulting crop yield? What do vegetables grown beneath and near solar panels look like, and how will consumers react? Do any contents from the panels make their way into the crops, posing health problems?


Most research has found that the answer to the last question is no. But the team still plans to test for contaminants in response to public concern as a show of good faith and transparency, and in an effort to address any potential barriers to agrivoltaics from the get-go.


While most crop-based agrivoltaics projects involve growing produce in the ground, the Piedmont Environmental Council’s farm also includes raised beds, which enable educational tours and widen the demonstration project’s relevance.


The beds do increase costs, said Pitsiokos. But the rationale for them, he said, ​“is so we can create data for people who might be doing this in an urban setting, a parking lot, or on some other nonpermeable surface,” he said. ​“We have productive agricultural soil; not everybody does.”


The experiment could also help inform compliance with new state rules designed to mitigate land loss from solar: Certain developers have to conserve land on a one-to-one basis for projects on prime farmland, but their burden is less if the array is used for agrivoltaics.


Pitsiokos also wants the data to reach educators, policymakers, and cohorts he hasn’t anticipated yet. ​“We want to share it with everybody,” he said, ​“because we know that we can’t predict who might benefit from it exactly.”


Perhaps most of all, the Piedmont Environmental Council hopes the project will reach farmers. Plenty are outspoken on solar, both for and against. But a 2024 survey from the American Farmland Trust found that most Virginia farmers and farmland owners hold nuanced views. Over half would consider solar if they could continue farming under and around the panels, according to the survey, but nearly two-thirds agree that solar developers should be responsible for returning land to a farmable state after an array is decommissioned.


With the project’s first crops of kale getting harvested this month, the Piedmont Environmental Council plans to make real-time data available as soon as this winter, for all to see. But grand conclusions won’t be forthcoming for another two or so years.


“Like with all scientific experiments,” Pitsiokos said, ​“slow is actually good.”

(Photos courtesy of campaigns)Republican state Del. Ian Lovejoy wants to continue his work in the Virginia House of Delegates representing voters in part of Prince William County, and is facing a challenge from Democrat and former state lawmaker Elizabeth Guzman. Both have different views on how to address data centers, reproductive rights and the increased cost of living, issues which loom large in Northern Virginia’s House District 22.
With all 140 House seats up for grabs, the two candidates are contending for a seat that could help Democrats maintain control of the House for an additional two years or give Republicans control again as a new governor takes office.
The candidates are also campaigning on shared challenges for voters including traffic and commuting burdens, school quality, community safety, and environmental and development pressures due to the demand for data centers and their high energy needs. 


Key races: 2025 Virginia House of Delegates elections
• Familiar foes, new stakes: Coyner–Dougherty rematch tests Va.’s suburban swing in House District 75
• Democrat Mehta aims to unseat Republican Earley in Chesterfield-based House District 73 race
• Growth, tourism and turnout collide in House District 71 rematch
• House District 97, anchored in Virginia Beach, could determine party majority in House of Delegates
• Big money, tight margins define Obenshain–Franklin rematch in House District 41


 Data centers and rising energy demands

Both candidates weighed in on data centers, one of the state’s fastest-growing industries, with dozens of the facilities located in their district.
“We’re in a real bind, because this industry has outpaced our regulatory schemes,” said Lovejoy, a small business leader and entrepreneur. “Historically, power infrastructure is socialized and paid for by everybody, but the data centers are the sole cause of this massive increase of power infrastructure need, and so we have to work on legislation that ensures data centers aren’t getting that power infrastructure on the back of your average rate payer.” 
Lovejoy said he intends to reintroduce proposals to address the issue by adding clarity to data center siting rules, ensuring they are not built too close to residential areas, forests and historic assets. He’ll also continue to support legislation that helps prevent taxpayers from paying too much for the power-thirsty data centers.
Guzman — who attacked her opponent on receiving donations from utility companies, as reported by the Virginia Public Access Project (VPAP) — emphasized the need for community input on decisions about data centers and other public projects, and said the centers should be located in industrial areas, and not next to homes and schools.
“As someone who has refused utility company money, I will always put families before corporate interest,” Guzman said. “I’ll push for stricter regulations, environmental safeguards and public hearings so residents have a real voice before projects move forward. Unlike my opponent, I’ve never taken money from utility companies.”
Lovejoy’s campaign said his opponent is “grasping at straws” when claiming he is compromised and is “hypocritical” considering the donations she’s received from organizations that have lobbied against data center proposals.
Guzman’s campaign has financially outperformed her opponent’s, raising over $946,000 compared to Lovejoy’s roughly $537,000 as of Oct. 5, according to VPAP.
 Reproductive rights 

In the upcoming General Assembly session, lawmakers will vote again on a bill to enshrine abortion protections in the state’s constitution, which successfully passed the legislature earlier this year.
Guzman, a social worker who supports abortion access, is likely to vote yes on the measure that advances other reproductive freedoms, unlike Lovejoy, who supports a 15-week abortion limit with exceptions and voted against the amendment.
“I would happily support that constitutional amendment because abortion rights are human rights, and that no legislator should be involved in a personal medical decision that only belongs to a woman and her doctor,” Guzman said.
Guzman also criticized her opponent for voting against the abortion protection bill.
Lovejoy’s campaign did not respond to requests for comment on Guzman’s claims about the reproductive rights amendment. Instead, he publicly questioned her silence on texts by Jay Jones, the Democratic attorney general nominee, in which he talked about a hypothetical scenario where a former Republican Virginia lawmaker and his children would be killed in 2022. 
“I call on Elizabeth Guzman to join me and denounce this rhetoric and call for Jay Jones to withdraw from his race for Attorney General,” Lovejoy posted on X, as reported by the Prince William Times.
Broadly, Lovejoy’s Republican colleagues have said that the legislation is too extreme, overrides parental rights and fails to protect the unborn.
Guzman’s campaign declined to comment regarding the text messages.
 Cost of living

On lowering the cost of living, Lovejoy supports cutting taxes and reducing government size. Guzman supports targeted tax relief on cars and groceries, while also backing investments in public programs, which may necessitate revenue increases.
“The number one way we can keep money in people’s pockets is how we manage the commonwealth tax scheme,” Lovejoy said, adding that maintaining a strict tax regimen that doesn’t increase the burden on taxpayers can help to make life more affordable for Virginians, including housing.
“There’s a lot of pressure to raise taxes in different parts of our current tax code, and that’s been kept largely at bay because of the governor’s veto pen. So I worry, should we lose that ability, where the tax scheme is going to go.”
Guzman supports increasing the minimum wage and expanding worker protections. Lovejoy has not spoken on wage laws, but has focused on economic growth through deregulation and tax relief during his time in the House.
 Diverse needs

Guzman stated if elected to serve the competitive 22nd House District, she will continue to work across party lines and achieve results for her constituents, who represent a range of ethnicities, occupations and political persuasions. She emphasized that she has a proven track record of serving voters with different views than hers in parts of Fauquier and Prince William counties during her six years in the General Assembly, before her previous District 31 was redrawn by the Virginia Supreme Court.
“I represented Prince William and Fauquier County, which was red and rural, and just being the only Democrat in the room when we were having conversations about decisions of how to make life better for residents, never intimidated me,” Guzman said. “I was there to work with Republicans to deliver for my district.”
In 2023, Lovejoy won by nearly five percentage points in the newly drawn House District 22, the same district that favored Democratic nominee Kamala Harris by nearly two percentage points over elected Republican President Donald Trump last November. He said if reelected to his second term, he and his office will continue to support his Northern Virginia constituents and that civility will remain a central goal of his work as a legislator.
“I’ve been very conscientious of realizing that I represent a very split district, and we are responsive to everyone’s complaints, concerns (and) constituent services, equally,” Lovejoy said. “The tone of our campaign is not to vilify an entire political party or people, and I think that’s important and leading in the future.”

Because the General Assembly didn’t adopt a congressional district map before the end of September, the state constitution dictates the next deadline is Oct. 31.
That deadline lies with the ORC, who have until then to hold public meetings and come up with a map that has bipartisan support.
The legislature is required to redraw the congressional map, which establishes the boundaries of Ohio’s U.S. House and Senate districts, to be used in the next election and beyond.
The redraw is constitutionally required because lawmakers weren’t able to garner bipartisan support for the last set of maps, adopted by Republicans on the redistricting commission in March 2022.
The Ohio Supreme Court deemed the current map unconstitutional, but a federal court didn’t intervene in the congressional map challenges.
A separate court challenge to the map was dropped by anti-gerrymandering advocates as a ballot initiative to reform redistricting and the next round of map-drawing seemed set to happen before the case could be resolved.
Legislators who led a joint committee on congressional redistricting last month fought back against calls that a map proposal was required before the constitutional deadline in September.
State Rep. Adam Bird, R-New Richmond, insisted the September deadline was one of many in the constitution, therefore did not legally bind the legislature to a certain date.
“Sept. 30th is in there, and yet, the constitution provides for a process if we don’t meet that,” Bird said at the first meeting of the joint committee on Sept. 22.
At the second and final meeting of the committee before the first deadline passed, Bird maintained the message that “we’ve still got a couple of months and we’ve still got time to keep talking.”
Legislative Democrats proposed a map in September, with eight Republican-leaning districts and seven Democratic-leaning districts.
Minority party leaders said the proposal was meant as a jumping-off point for discussions about redistricting, in hopes it would spur more urgency in the process.
The current map is made up of 10 Republican districts and three Democratic districts.
While the joint committee heard hours of support for the Democratic proposal, with only one person speaking out against it in the public hearings, no vote was held on the Democratic map.
When asked about the progress on a Republican proposal, Bird said he didn’t know of a map as of Sept. 30.
Staff for the Ohio House GOP and the Ohio Senate GOP both said they didn’t have updates on the redistricting process as yet, nor did House and Senate minority staff members.
House Minority Communications Director David Meyers said “nothing firm” had been communicated when it came to a date for the commission to begin, and Casey Rife, communications director for Senate Democrats, said the caucus was “hoping to get to work as soon as possible.”
If the Ohio Redistricting Commission can’t come to agreement on a map, the process moves back to the legislature with a Nov. 30 deadline.
Different rules apply if the process returns to the General Assembly, and a map would only need a simple majority for passage.

(File photo courtesy of Centers for Disease Control and Prevention)Public health experts in Georgia are speaking out against furloughs at the Atlanta-based Centers for Disease Control and Prevention they say have left hundreds of employees at the agency unemployed as the federal government shutdown enters its third week.
Federal employees began receiving reduction-in-force notices, the technical name for layoffs, on Friday. Initially, about 1,300 CDC employees received notices, but many of the firings were reversed the next day. According to the National Public Health Coalition, a group of terminated CDC workers and their allies, about 600 layoffs are expected to be permanent.
The cuts initially impacted a wide range of departments, including the CDC’s flagship publication, known as the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, the agency’s Washington office, the National Center for Health Statistics, and leaders working to contain infectious diseases like measles and Ebola. At least some of the employees in those departments have since been reinstated.
Andrew Nixon, who serves as director of communications at the HHS, said some employees “received incorrect notifications due to a system glitch.” 
HHS employees who received notices, he added, “were designated non-essential by their respective divisions.”
But Abby Tighe, a former CDC employee who serves as executive director of the National Public Health Coalition, questioned the department’s explanation for the firings. 
“These terminations were not a glitch,” she said. “It was not an innocent error made. This round of firings, as with all the others experienced at CDC in the last 10 months, was an intentional attack on the American people and the public’s health.”
Tighe’s organization, formerly known as Fired But Fighting, has repeatedly called for Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to resign.
“We need an HHS Secretary who is ready to work with Congress and is ready to listen to the needs of constituents in the United States and who is ready to actually lead the department, and right now, we do not have that,” she said. “We would love to see Congress step in and really force HHS to have a stronger sense of leadership that is based in science and in public health expertise.”
Dr. John Brooks, a retired infectious disease specialist who once served as Chief Medical Officer for the CDC’s Division of HIV Prevention, also expressed worries that cuts to the agency will leave the U.S. vulnerable to future public health emergencies.
“Many experts, including myself, are concerned that we are no longer well-prepared for the next big outbreak or disaster because of the Trump administration’s continued erosion of our nation’s ability to respond to public health emergencies,” he said.
The American Federation of Government Employees, a union which represents over 820,000 federal employees across the U.S., estimates that 3,000 workers — or nearly a quarter of the CDC’s total workforce — have left the agency since January. Yolanda Jacobs, who serves as president of AFGE Local 2883, also criticized the federal government’s firing of CDC workers.
“These reckless actions are disrupting and destroying the lives of everyday working people who are constantly being used as bargaining chips,” she said. “They deserve the same opportunity any other American deserves: The ability to put food on the table for their families, pay their rent or mortgage and not have to wake up each day wondering if they’ll be fired because they are federal employees.”
Along with the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, the AFGE filed a lawsuit last month challenging the mass firing of government employees during the shutdown.
“We’re going to speak up,” Jacobs said. “We’re not going to let this whole thing unfold in silence.”

Rick Ladd, a Haverhill Republican and chairman of the House Education Funding Committee, hears a presentation from representatives of the Claremont School District about a $5 million budget deficit the district is facing, on Oct. 14, 2025. (Photo by Ethan DeWitt/New Hampshire Bulletin)As the Claremont School District reels from a $5 million budget deficit, reducing staff, shutting schools, and fighting to get through the school year, Republicans in Concord are split over how much they should help out. 
On one side are those who say the state should provide some temporary financial assistance to give the school board breathing room as it digs its way out of its fiscal hole. On the other are those who say that would set a bad precedent for future financial crises in other districts. At a key meeting of the Senate Education Committee Tuesday, lawmakers ultimately pushed off a vote on a bailout in order to discuss the matter further.
But whatever they decide for Claremont, Republicans agree on one takeaway from the city’s crisis: The state should impose more oversight over school districts and their budgets. And some say they will propose legislation next year to do so.
Sen. Victoria Sullivan, a Manchester Republican, says she has filed legislation to allow for the possibility of receivership over struggling school districts. In an interview, Sullivan said her bill would allow the State Board of Education to investigate problems in public school districts and assume some management responsibilities over those schools during crises. 
“Kudos to Claremont: The community are stepping in to make sure the kids still have their extracurriculars and doing what they’re doing,” Sullivan said. “But we should never get to this point.”
Some Republicans say the state’s Department of Education should impose more oversight. Rep. Jim Kofalt, a Wilton Republican, said the department should conduct regular audits of school district budgets to catch any irregularities before they balloon. 
Others have raised the possibility of legislation that would enable recall elections against school boards if residents feel they have caused a crisis and want new leadership. 
“Voters who feel that they need new boards don’t have a mechanism to do so,” said Rep. Daniel Popovici-Muller, a Windham Republican. 
Rep. Rick Ladd, a Haverhill Republican and the chairman of the House Education Funding Committee, noted a number of bills submitted ahead of next year’s session that would enhance the Department of Education’s authority, including one of his labeled “relative to the intervention of the department of education into a school or school district during a financial emergency.”
“There has to be some kind of a hammer or accountability oversight that the Department of Education and the state treasurer have here,” he said.
The proposals have emerged as Claremont’s woes have entered the statewide spotlight. In August, the city’s school board reviewed an audit and discovered that mismanagement of the budget meant the district had fallen $5 million behind in payments, with virtually no cash on hand to pay those debts and keep the school operating.
That shortfall caused an immediate catastrophe for the board, which faced questions about whether classes could even resume in September. After around 40 layoffs, the closure of an elementary school, and a $4 million loan from the Claremont Savings Bank that is due in April, the district has managed to continue classes this school year, explained James O’Shaughnessy, the attorney for the school board, on Tuesday. 
The board has hired an interim business administrator, Matt Angel, to oversee a series of aggressive cuts to services to pay off debts while any mismanagement is addressed. That process could take about two years, aided by the district’s regular allotment of state “adequacy funds” every quarter as well as city property tax revenue, O’Shaughnessy said.
But because of its limited cash flow — and the need to pay back the $4 million loan in April — Claremont will likely have no funds from April to September to continue paying for operations without more financial support, O’Shaughnessy said. That means even with a proactive debt relief plan, and even with its regular quarterly adequacy payments, the district would likely not be able to reopen for the 2026-2027 school year if it cannot access more loans, he added.
This month, two Republican lawmakers — Ladd and Sen. Ruth Ward, a Stoddard Republican and the chairwoman of the Senate Education Committee — have proposed a state-backed solution: a “temporary, targeted” revolving loan fund to help the district access cash quickly.
The two have both proposed an amendment to an existing bill that will be taken up by the House and Senate in early January. 
The proposal would direct the state treasurer to create a non-lapsing fund separate from all other funds. The fund would include no more than 75% of the total amount that the state already sends the district in annual adequacy aid. The district would be required to pay any money it withdrew from that fund back to the state with interest, and each withdrawal would need to be made with an agreement among the school board, the Department of Education, and the state treasurer. 
For Ladd and Ward, the legislation is an unusual but necessary fix. The preamble of the bill states that Claremont “faces immediate and extraordinary fiscal challenges that may impact its ability to provide an adequate education to its students.”
“We’ve got to keep it narrow in scope. We need to help those kids in Claremont,” Ladd said. “…That school has to stay open for the rest of this year. This is one way of doing it.”
But others said the precedent could inspire more mismanagement from other school districts, or allow school boards to evade difficult decisions when facing a funding gap.
“Many of us are concerned,” said Kofalt. “We’re concerned with making sure that the people of Claremont are ultimately able to continue with our schools open, but we are also concerned that this should never happen again in other districts”
And some, like Popovici-Muller, said that lawmakers should come up with a more permanent financial aid approach that is not specific to Claremont. 
“This is not something that we’ll be lingering on, but please consider that (it’s) a complicated mess that’s still unraveling. We’re still trying to understand what happened. We need a more thorough solution.”
Democrats said lawmakers should take more time. Sen. Debra Altschiller, a Stratham Democrat, argued the state should help the district before it begins diving into bigger solutions.
“There’s a leak in their boat, so we have to plug up the leak, and then we can review why there was a leak in the boat at a later date,” she said. “But we can’t let this boat, the Claremont boat, sink with children in the boat, because we want to look at the structure of how the boat was built or the maintenance of the boat.”
O’Shaughnessy echoed that point.
“This is an extraordinary, extraordinary thing that we’re all doing today to ask you to adopt special legislation,” he said. “We wouldn’t be here if there were good alternatives.”
Still, soon after the Senate committee meeting concluded, House Majority Leader Jason Osborne, an Auburn Republican, issued a statement underscoring the political difficulty of a quick decision that could earn the support of the House and Senate. 
“House Republicans will fight to protect the taxpayers from bailing out the incompetence of Claremont schools,” he said. “I appreciate the efforts of Claremont’s state senator and look forward to working on a solution that will solve the issue in the long term, not a short-term fix that throws money at the problem and hopes it goes away.”",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/PA144703-Rick-Ladd-1024x712.jpg,,,2025-10-15 05:56:42.614715

(Photo by Shalina Chatlani/ Stateline)NEW YORK — On a busy street in Queens, New York, just around the corner from a halal hot chicken sandwich restaurant and a barber shop, the Long Island City Health Center welcomes its patients into a brightly lit waiting room, painted baby blue and filled with soft white and gray seats.
A woman working behind the desk on a recent weekday answered one patient’s questions in Spanish. Other patients came dressed in hijabs, kurtas or other traditional clothing from countries around the globe. A caseworker assigned to the center rolled one woman, wheelchair-bound because of a stroke, toward an examination room.
The Long Island City Health Center is part of a national network of more than 1,300 community health centers, safety-net clinics that served more than 31 million patients in 2023, according to KFF, a health research nonprofit. The clinics are located in areas where there aren’t many doctors or hospitals, and they provide care to all patients, regardless of their ability to pay.
Thanks largely to their broad reach, the centers have long enjoyed bipartisan support. But the federal government shutdown, freezes to federal grants, looming cuts to Medicaid and new Trump administration policies barring some immigrants from receiving care at the centers have put them under financial stress.
Community health centers disproportionately serve low-income people, people of color and rural residents. In 2023, 90% of patients had incomes at or below 200% of the federal poverty level, according to KFF. Forty percent of patients were Hispanic, 17% were Black and 31% were rural residents.
More than 80% of patients were insured, and about half of all patients were covered by Medicaid.
The health centers are funded by the payments they get from Medicaid, Medicare and private insurers, plus federal and state grants. Money is always tight, but between 2010 and 2023, average operating margins remained in the black. That changed last year, as the average margin dipped to -2.1%, according to an audit conducted by the National Association of Community Health Centers.
Half of community health centers have fewer than 90 days of cash on hand, and one-quarter operate with margins below -4%, according to the audit.
1.4M lawfully present immigrants could lose subsidized health coverage

When the Trump administration froze some federal grants in February, it forced some clinics, particularly in rural areas, to reduce hours or shut down. The broad domestic policy law President Donald Trump signed July 4 is projected to increase the number of uninsured patients seeking care at the health centers. And the ranks of the uninsured would grow further if Affordable Care Act insurance plans get much more expensive at the end of this year, as would happen if Congress fails to extend tax credits that have kept prices down.
Meanwhile, the government shutdown has prevented Congress from renewing the Community Health Center Fund, which expired on Sept. 30 and provides about 70% of the centers’ federal funding. And the centers worry that a new Trump administration policy barring them from providing care to some immigrants would force them to dedicate scarce resources to verifying patients’ legal status. A federal judge has temporarily blocked the change.
Andrew G. Nixon, director of communications for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, told Stateline that the administration is “fully committed to protecting America’s community health centers, which play a vital role in serving millions of families nationwide.”
“The Trump Administration is working to reopen the government and restore full funding, while also ensuring that federal resources are prioritized for American citizens and lawful residents in accordance with the law,” Nixon said in an emailed statement.
This year, some states — including Connecticut, Illinois and Minnesota — approved more money for community health centers. But Illinois and Minnesota also have scaled back or ended health care programs that served low-income people regardless of their immigration status, which might prompt more of those patients to seek care at the centers. And California Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom in June signed a state budget that bars immigrants who are here illegally from enrolling in the state’s Medicaid program.
“Historically, health centers have had bipartisan support, but we’re operating in a very different world now,” Feygele Jacobs, a professor of health policy and management at George Washington University, told Stateline.
Jacobs said health centers are a target for the Trump administration because they serve people of color, low-income residents, immigrants and the uninsured.
“It’s those very communities that are really being challenged right now by the administration,” Jacobs said. “So I don’t know that the focus is so much on health centers as entities, but really more on an administration whose views are antithetical to many of the people that health centers have historically cared for.”
States scramble to shield hospitals from GOP Medicaid cuts

But Chris Pope, a senior fellow at the conservative-leaning Manhattan Institute, questioned whether the Medicaid changes included in Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act would lead to a significant increase in the number of people without insurance or a dramatic reduction in the program’s finances.
Pope also noted that the law doesn’t take direct aim at the federal funding of community health centers.
“There’s no direct cut in terms of reimbursement for community centers,” Pope said. “It’s not the intent of the bill to slash and attack health center revenues.”
Welcoming culture
The first community health centers were created in 1965 in Mississippi and Massachusetts as federal demonstration projects under President Lyndon Johnson’s War on Poverty. The program became permanent in 1975.
Doctors at the Long Island City Health Center describe it as a one-stop shop for patients. In addition to providing primary care and mental health services, the center has an in-house pharmacy and provides laboratory tests, vaccinations, drug treatment, HIV/AIDS treatment, and support for transgender patients and their families. Including its dozen medical residents, the center has doctors who can speak French, Tamil, Kru, Ibo, Yoruba, Spanish, Hindi, Nepali, Russian and Tagalog, among other languages.
Dr. Libby Brubaker, an attending physician at the Long Island City Health Center, told Stateline that providing a welcoming atmosphere for everybody is at the core of the center’s mission.
“Our social workers go to bat for our patients and help them get access to housing. … We write letters to allow our patients with asthma to be able to have air conditioners inside their apartments,” Brubaker said.
“Really what we’re providing for our patients is all encompassing, and that sets us apart,” she added. “Hospitals don’t do all of those things. They do some, but being able to offer that breadth of services in an outpatient setting is invaluable.”

Sandra Tapía, a Long Island City resident from Bogotá, Colombia, walked into the clinic on a Friday to see her nutritionist for the first time. She’s been in the U.S. for seven years, is a green card holder and has Medicaid. She said she likes the center because “it’s close and it’s safe.”
Tapía said she can’t imagine not being able to have access to health care, and values being able to speak to her provider in her native Spanish.
“Here, they offer really great services,” Tapía said. “I don’t want people without as many resources, like me, to be punished.”
The idea of cuts frightens patients such as Olga Scott, 65, who said she has been coming to Long Island City Health Center for years. Scott lives in the Bronx, but takes an hourlong subway ride to the center so she can see her favorite doctor.
“These community health services around the whole community of these five boroughs are needed — it’s really needed,” she said. “I just hope that they don’t do too much cutbacks, because we need every service we can get.”
Dr. Sindhura Manubolu, director of the family medicine program at the center, said she’s sensing “a lot of anxiety” from her patients, especially those who rely on Medicaid.
“Most of the questions from our patients have been around, ‘Oh, will we lose coverage?’” said Manubolu, who is an immigrant from India. “For someone to be here in an advanced country like America, and then not being able to access the health care that probably is even available to a person in a less developed country is not acceptable.”

Bipartisan support
On Capitol Hill, community health centers are an increasingly rare example of bipartisan agreement.
In May, Republican U.S. Sen. Roger Wicker of Mississippi and Democratic U.S. Sen. Jack Reed of Rhode Island wrote a joint letter to the chairperson and ranking member of the Senate health appropriations subcommittee, urging them “to provide robust funding” for community health centers, describing them as “a bipartisan solution to keeping Americans healthy and saving taxpayer dollars.”
Wicker and Reed argued in the letter that the centers save the overall health care system billions of dollars by reducing the burden of chronic disease through prevention and early intervention, and lower long-term Medicaid and Medicare spending by curbing expensive emergency department visits, hospital admissions and invasive procedures. The senators also noted that the centers employ more than 310,000 people and generate more than $118 billion in economic activity.
Medicaid cuts could be devastating for the Delta and the rest of rural America

“Republicans in particular have always argued that one of the reasons for not pushing for more insurance coverage was the fact that we have these centers,” said Dr. Georges Benjamin, executive director of the American Public Health Association, which advocates for broader health care access.
Benjamin noted that the centers’ importance to rural, mostly Republican communities has heightened their broad-based appeal. He said draining money from them “is not a rational decision.”
“The administration has a nonsensical and uncoordinated health policy overall,” Benjamin said. “These important things that keep people alive and keep them healthy are getting caught in this very bad public policy time we’re having.”
But Robert Hayes, president and CEO of the Community Healthcare Network, the largest network of community health centers in New York City, said the centers there are determined to do what they have always done, regardless of the current challenges.
“We are secure. We’re obeying the law. We’re doing the right thing,” Hayes said. “I don’t mean to dismiss the anxiety that is around health care for the vulnerable these days, but our job is to not let it distract us from what we have to do, which is important and very hard to do: [provide] the most fundamental and primary and preventative health care for people who are basically excluded from the health care system.”

(Photo by Graham Stokes for Ohio Capital Journal. Republish photo only with original story.)Ohio Republicans have yet to share a proposed congressional map with the public as the second deadline to pass a bipartisan map approaches. Why? They say they want to hear from citizens first. But Democrats say they are purposely going slow to skirt guidelines.
The clock continues to tick for Ohio to pass a new congressional map. After lawmakers failed the first step in the process, which would have been to pass a bipartisan map by the end of September, the Ohio Redistricting Commission (ORC) takes over.
Now, everyone is waiting on Gov. Mike DeWine to convene the group, which he said on Friday would be “soon.”
“When is soon?” we asked the governor.
“Soon,” he said, smiling.
“I feel like we do the ‘soon’ conversation a lot,” this reporter added, referencing how whenever he doesn’t want to share details with reporters, he says “soon.”
“Well, we know what the law is,” DeWine responded. “It’s going to have to occur this month.”
The ORC’s five Republicans and two Democrats will debate how to draw the state’s 15 U.S. House districts. The group is made up of two Republicans and two Democrats in the Statehouse. The three remaining seats include the governor, secretary of state, and auditor — all of which are currently held by Republican officeholders.
Ohio’s congressional districts are currently composed of 10 Republicans and five Democrats. They were declared unconstitutionally gerrymandered twice, but Ohio voters were nevertheless forced to vote under them in 2022 and 2024.
On average, Republicans win 55% to 45% of the vote over Democrats in Ohio. With that breakdown, Democrats proposed a map with eight seats leaning red and seven leaning blue.
The Republicans still haven’t introduced their map yet — more than a month after the Dems did.
“I don’t think it does any good to just introduce a map so everybody has something to talk about,” House Speaker Matt Huffman, R-Lima, said after we asked for his response to citizens who are upset that the GOP hasn’t given them a map yet.
Republican legislative leaders say no map has been designed yet, and they have not talked to the White House about the process.
Huffman said that the public needs to weigh in before a map is made. This sentiment was echoed by a dozen other party members.
“We shouldn’t do it the old way, which is, ‘Here’s the map, pass it, see you later,'” he said.
But Democrats such as Senate Minority Leader Nickie Antonio, D-Lakewood, say that is exactly what the Republicans are doing.
“(The way the process works) really has upended the opportunity, I think, for a bipartisan map, and a process that would get us to the table because they can just run out the clock,” Antonio said.
If the ORC doesn’t pass a bipartisan map by the end of October, lawmakers get a second chance to pass one — and it doesn’t have to be bipartisan. It would only need simple majority approval.
House Minority Leader Dani Isaacsohn, D-Cincinnati, is concerned. GOP leaders say they want at least 12 or 13 of the 15 districts to lean Republican.
“They’re worried about losing next November because they’ve broken their promises, so they want to try and steal three congressional districts,” Isaacsohn said.
DeWine is asking for patience.
“These things, if they get worked out — if they get worked out — they don’t usually get worked out in a public meeting,” the governor said.
But as of now, the Democrats, and the public, are left in the dark.
Deadlines and process
FAILED: Sept. 30: The lawmakers needed to pass a map with at least 60% in each chamber, with at least 50% support of Democrats.
Oct. 31: To meet this deadline, at least four members of the ORC, including two Republicans and two Democrats, must approve. They must have two public meetings if they intend to pass a map.
If that fails, it goes back to the legislature.
Nov. 30: This map can also pass with a simple majority, and it must be replaced after six years.

I have lived, worked, and played in the state for more than three decades. As a member of the board of directors of the New Hampshire Association of Conservation Commissions, I recently saw a newly published report, “The Benefits of New Hampshire’s Open Space,” by the Primrose Research Group. This report uses facts and figures to quantify the importance of our natural areas. Our open spaces, including forests, farms, and surface waters, not only serve as places to recreate, renew, and find enjoyment, they also provide important economic benefits to our state.
The N.H. Association of Conservation Commissions, collaborating with its member commissions, is working alongside other state environmental organizations, such as N.H. Audubon, the Forest Society, the Nature Conservancy, N.H. Land Trust Coalition, and others, to assure that the benefits of open spaces are protected and will serve future generations. 
A common goal for these groups is to protect and preserve open space, town forests, and fields through easement and current use programs, allowing for sustainable timber harvests, as well as the preservation of parks for pedestrian recreation. The same is being done for the protection of towns’ aquifers and waterways, so the next generation has the drinking water it will need. 
This work benefits towns by preserving open space for businesses, recreation — including hunting and fishing — and improving environmental quality, which helps to maintain property values.  In addition, the report notes that green infrastructure, including urban parks and forests, can reduce the energy demand of nearby buildings by 10%.
New Hampshire has been experiencing intense floods, droughts, heat waves, and less snow. These factors cause damage to the built infrastructure, the economy, and to human health. Warmer weather results in more ticks, excessive pollens, and an increase in invasive species, which affects human health and the health of the environment.
It is incumbent upon all of us, as individuals and as members of the environmental community, to prepare for these extremes by using sound scientific practices to make adaptations, including crop rotation, installing road and culvert structures, and monitoring, data collection, and mitigation activities, such as restoring natural habitats, sustainable land management, reducing waste, and using alternative energy sources. 
It is imperative we work to preserve and protect our wetlands, shorelands, streams, and aquifers, and protect forests and habitat diversity. Taking action not only protects the natural environment and human health, but also our state’s economy.
The respective missions and programs of the organizations, those which helped to commission the report, have also helped to sustain open spaces, described in the report, which are essential to New Hampshire’s infrastructure and economy. Open space provides opportunities to support industry, provide employment, connect individuals and communities, improve health, provide food, and build resilience against flooding and excessive heat, as well as contribute to the tax base.
All the important benefits of open space described in the report need to be balanced with the ever-growing demand for affordable housing. As the report notes, almost 5,000 acres of forest land in New Hampshire is used for development purposes every year. Adequate housing is critically important for our future economy. How we balance the benefits of open space and the revenue it generates, estimated to total almost $3.9 billion from recreation alone and more than $500 million in economic value from the agricultural industry, with the need for housing, will determine how we continue to build our New Hampshire competitive advantage, attracting talent and keeping it here. To get to the best solutions that both preserve the economic benefits of open space and meet the need for housing, the decision-making process must involve all stakeholders.  
Social science and land use policy researchers have identified a number of strategies for achieving balance between economic development and land preservation, which New Hampshire municipalities might consider putting into practice. Conservation commissions, town zoning and planning boards, private developers, and interested community members are just a few stakeholders who could review the principles, identify best practices, and come to an agreement that can benefit the entire community.
Towns can support resource efficiency, create jobs by investing in renewable energy, boost economic growth, and reduce environmental impact. Communities can promote reuse, recycling, and remanufacturing to reduce waste and conserve resources. Planners can encourage the design and create incentives for conservation developments, which focus homes and buildings on the least sensitive areas of land, preserving the ecologically sensitive ones. 
Those involved must recognize the interconnectedness of economic development, housing, and land preservation. By implementing sustainable practices and policies, they can create a future that is both economically prosperous and environmentally sustainable. 
We can have both — the economic gains associated with development and a sustainable environment — if we work together and think creatively. That is how we do things in New Hampshire.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/openspace-1024x708.jpg,,,2025-10-15 04:57:36.885522

Government agencies have been closed since the start of October, with congressional Republicans lacking the votes to fund operations.
As expiration of tax credits loom, Ohio insurers ask for big increases

Democrats are holding out, in part, for an extension of subsidies for individual health insurance that would keep premiums from doubling for hundreds of thousands of Ohioans at the start of next year.
Federal employees are starting to receive partial paychecks as a result of the shutdown.
In addition, President Donald Trump is deploying troops to cities in Democratic states on false claims that they’re war zones. 
A federal judge he appointed ruled that his claim about Portland “was simply untethered to the facts.“
After taking controversial actions in places like Chicago, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement upset people in Mount Vernon in Knox County.
About 120 protested Sunday in the town square over an ICE raid last week of a beloved Mexican restaurant, the news organization Knox Pages reported.
Further protests are coming on Saturday. 
Dozens of No Kings protests are scheduled across Ohio as part of more than 2,500 that will take place nationally. 
“Building on the momentum of the June 14 day of action, which drew more than five million people across all 50 states, the October 18 mobilization is the next chapter in this growing movement,” organizers said in a written statement.
 “Together, millions will send a clear and unmistakable message: we are a nation of equals, and our country will not be ruled by fear or force.”

The events are being sponsored by more than 100 organizations, including the American Civil Liberties Union, the League of Women Voters, Physicians for Social Responsibility, Common Cause, and Indivisible.
Mia Lewis is assistant director of Common Cause Ohio and a volunteer with Indivisible Central Ohio. She said 23 protests are planned for the area. 
Rallies will take place in communities such as Newark, Reynoldsburg, Marysville, and Grove City earlier Saturday afternoon. 
Then things will culminate with a 4 p.m. rally at the Ohio Statehouse in Columbus.
Lewis said she hoped people would attend both.
“I think it’s really important that there are protests in people’s neighborhoods,” she said. 
“It’s not just about the number of people who come out. It’s about the number of people who are passing by and see that their neighbors and their friends and fellow citizens are out taking a stand. I think that’s a really important message.”
In an era when the reach of traditional news organizations is diminishing, Lewis said it’s also vital for people to peacefully take to the streets in an attempt to highlight what’s happening. 
For example, many might not know that a big part of the shutdown battle is over health care subsidies.
“It’s hard because there are these pockets of information that people are in,” Lewis said. 
“But when people realize that their subsidy for their health care is going to go away and it’s going to be really hard to afford health care; when they see cities having masked troops attacking non-violent people… and the shutdown is scary for a lot of people… I think this will bring a lot of people out.”

[…]","Missouri officials falsely accused Denton Loudermill Jr. in a fatal 2024 shooting at the Kansas City Chiefs Super Bowl parade. Gossip haunted his last days. (Submitted)There is a scene in the 2008 film “Doubt,” set in a 1964 Catholic grade school, where the priest told a story about a woman gossiping about a man she hardly knew — a situation Denton Loudermill Jr. understood when he was falsely accused in the 2024 shooting at the Kansas City Chiefs celebratory parade.
In the movie, the woman dreamed that night of a great hand appearing that pointed down at her. Seized with an overwhelming sense of guilt, she went to confession the next day with the parish priest, Father O’Rourke.
“Is gossiping a sin?” she asked. “Was that the hand of God almighty pointing a finger at me? Should I be asking your absolution, Father? Tell me, have I done something wrong?”
“Yes,” the priest said. “You’ve borne false witness against your neighbor. You played fast and loose with his reputation, and you should be heartily ashamed.”
Gossip haunted Loudermill in his last days with technologically supercharged rumor traveling at light speed, leading to death threats and slander from which he, and his family, could not escape.
People may not remember his name, but his family will never forget how people falsely accused him in a shooting that claimed one life and injured 22, including children.
He’d stood dazed in the chaos.
People screamed. Fight or flight hormones activated. Panicked parents scooped up little ones as best they could and sought safety, not knowing if they were running at or away from danger.
Unlike those who ran, Loudermill froze, said LaRonna Lassiter Saunders, part of the legal team representing Loudermill’s family.
“He saw a woman shot and bleeding out,” she said. “The shooting began near him. He was in shock. Everyone started running, but he asked himself, ‘Where should I run?’ He was waiting for his ride to pick him up.”
Public torment for this intensely private man began here.
Police cuffed him and sat him on a curb where people began photographing him, perhaps assuming police had collared one of the shooters. Police stopped Loudermill, Lassiter Saunders said, because he moved slowly.
Hard to blame the police in this context. This doesn’t seem malicious. Still, Loudermill sat helpless as photos of him traversed the internet like a lit fuse about to detonate and destroy his carefully guarded world. It did.
Someone at an undisclosed website posted the picture and labeled him a “terrorist,” and as an illegal immigrant. Those images and that narrative spread like a virus. Two Missouri officials used the photo in posts urging the president to “close the border.”
U.S. Chief Magistrate Judge Willie J. Epps Jr. on Oct. 7 allowed Loudermill’s defamation case against Missouri Secretary of State Denny Hoskins and state Sen. Rick Brattin to proceed.
Emails sent to the offices of Hoskins and Brattin were not answered.
Given the appetite in wide swaths of society to allow masked law enforcement to tackle and shackle foreign-looking people, imagine the impact on Loudermill and his family.
Death threats rose like a flood.
“I’m just a light-skinned Black dude,” Lassiter Saunders recalled Loudermill saying. “Why are they lying on me? I was born and raised in Olathe. I’ve been here all my life.”
This digital mob predictably but painfully took its toll.
His counselor diagnosed him with post-traumatic stress disorder. In conversations with Lassiter Saunders, he wondered if he’d survive. His weight crashed, leaving him unrecognizable.
“This happened often, usually at the beginning of our conversations,” she said. “The first part of my representation, I was like a counselor.”
Loudermill, she said, would see references to the parade shooting on television. He rarely ventured into social media, but his children would see threats and accusations about him.
Once, at work, he told her he saw someone staring at him. He said they punched keys on their phone. It seemed as though they were pulling up his photo and when it appeared, it registered on their faces.
Once the digital mob poured the illegal alien and terrorist narrative into a mold, it quickly hardened into a truth-resistant bulwark of gossip and stupidity.
“This cost him his life,” Lassiter Saunders said. “The process has outlived him.”
His family found him dead on April 11.
There seems no remedy sufficient for what happened to him. To date, she said, the officials who wrongfully posted his photo have not apologized.
In “Doubt,” the gossiping woman did say she was sorry and asked for forgiveness.
“Not so fast,” Father O’Rourke said.
He ordered her to go home, take a pillow from her bed, climb to her roof, and cut it open.
The woman did as the priest asked and returned.
“What was the result?” he asked.
“Feathers,” she said. “Feathers everywhere, father.”
“Now, I want you to go back and gather up every last feather that flew out on the wind,” he said.
“It can’t be done,” she said. “I don’t know where they went. The wind took them all over.”
“And that,” O’Rourke said sharply, “is gossip.”
And for many, the image of this innocent man as some immigrant terrorist still floats on the digital four winds, impervious to truth.

(Photo by Graham Stokes for Ohio Capital Journal. Republish photo only with original article.)Try as they did to mislead and deceive Ohio voters about the horror of protecting abortion access and other forms of reproductive care in the state constitution, Ohio Republicans — from the governor on down — failed to fool 57% of the electorate in 2023. 
Voters from across the political spectrum saw through the preposterous propaganda meant to dissuade Ohioans from enshrining the right of every individual “to make and carry out one’s own reproductive decisions” in the Ohio Constitution. 
The decisive passage of Ohio’s Issue 1 amendment to preserve the right to make those decisions, including abortion, was essentially people telling politicians to butt out of personal medical choices they had no business meddling in.
Ohio voters pass Issue 1 constitutional amendment to protect abortion and reproductive rights

Despite the deliberately loaded ballot wording, inserted by Republican Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose to subvert the referendum, voters channeled their Midwest sensibility of justice. 
After the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022, eliminating the federal constitutional right to abortion, it was up to states to either restore that half-century right or repeal it. 
Ohio voters chose a rational middle ground to restore a woman’s reproductive autonomy on private medical options that included, but were not limited to “contraception, fertility treatment, continuing one’s own pregnancy, miscarriage care and abortion.”  
It was not unreasonable, a voting majority concluded on Nov. 7, 2023, that the state be barred from directly or indirectly burdening, penalizing, prohibiting, interfering with or discriminating against this constitutional right to reproductive freedom — unless it demonstrates “that it is using the least restrictive means to advance the individual’s health in accordance with widely accepted and evidence-based standards of care.” 
Put a pin in that caveat.
Voters agreed that abortion may be banned after fetal viability, but no procedure could be prohibited “if in the professional judgment of the pregnant patient’s treating physician it is necessary to protect the pregnant patient’s life or health.”  
Contrary to claims made during the Issue 1 campaign, late-term abortions are extremely rare, representing less than 1% of all abortions in the U.S.  
Despite the fear-mongering and falsehoods thrown at Ohio voters weighing the abortion rights amendment, despite the ton of money dumped to defeat the measure by the Catholic Church, the citizen’s initiative is now Article I, Section 22 of the Ohio Constitution. 
The people spoke. Resoundingly.
Yet, ever since, a clear majority of the statewide constituency secured the constitutionally protected right to make reproductive decisions without government interference, the government has interfered. 
Ohio Republicans signaled their intent from the beginning not to respect the will of voters on self-determination, but to override it.
The day after the amendment passed, more than two dozen GOP lawmakers in the legislature signed a statement to “do everything in [their] power” to maintain restrictive abortion laws on the books in Ohio.
A handful of anti-abortion zealots even tried to seize “exclusive authority over implementing” the constitutional amendment from the judiciary “to prevent mischief by pro-abortion courts.” 
 “This isn’t the end,” huffed then-Ohio Senate President Matt Huffman (and current Ohio House Speaker) who promised “a revolving door of ballot campaigns to repeal or replace” the reproductive rights amendment. 
Former Speaker Jason Stephens warned “the legislature has multiple paths that we will explore” to undercut the people’s wishes. 
Ohio’s Republican attorney general is still soaking taxpayers with endless litigation to preserve parts of the state’s six-week abortion ban that multiple courts have ruled unconstitutional. 
Meanwhile, Ohio Statehouse Republicans can’t stop coming up with new legislation in 2025 to burden or impede individuals from accessing their constitutional right to abortion. 
Ohio House Bill 347 would reinstate a 24-hour waiting period for abortions (along with state-mandated information and in-person visits) unrequired in other medical procedures.

Never mind that the existing law, blocked by an Ohio judge as unconstitutional, is still in court. 
Two other anti-abortion bills in the Ohio House could potentially limit access to medication abortion (used safely in the U.S. for 20 years) and threaten non-abortion healthcare for low-income Ohioans by banning Medicaid reimbursements to clinics that provide abortions.
But the real topper by Republican lawmakers — less than two years after voters approved a constitutional amendment guaranteeing the right to abortion — is Ohio House Bill 370, sweeping legislation that would impose a near-total ban on the procedure. 
The proposal would redefine legal personhood to begin at conception, effectively granting fertilized eggs full legal protection under Ohio law. 
After their setback in 2023, the Republican supermajority in the legislature has attempted to regulate, restrict or outlaw abortion as if nothing changed. 
Pending bills that would undermine legalized abortion in the state are designed to overturn the popular vote of Ohioans. 
GOP lawmakers in other red states are following similar playbooks with voters who approve progressive measures Republicans oppose. 
The unaccountable autocrats, who erode the power of direct democracy, do not answer to the gerrymandered constituents they take for granted or feel any obligation to adhere to the letter of any law they dislike. 
Ohio’s Republican overlords openly defy the state constitution on redistricting and abortion rights to get their way no matter what a majority of folks in their state wants.
Question is, will voters cede self-governance for team loyalty at the ballot box, or will they demand due respect from the elected representatives who work for them and loyalty to the rule of law over party?

(Photo by AnnMarie Hilton/ Maine Morning Star)Concerns that increased electricity rates could force seniors and other Mainers living on fixed incomes to choose between heating their homes, buying sufficient food or filling their prescriptions drove more than a dozen people to come out Tuesday evening to oppose a new proposal from Central Maine Power.
At the Freeport Hilton Garden Inn, the Public Utilities Commission held the first of two public hearings on the private utility’s new five-year rate proposal, which included investments meant to improve reliability and resiliency, as well as improvements to customer experience. The plan, which was officially submitted in mid-September, is projected to increase the company’s revenue by more than $430 million. 
If approved, the plan could increase rates for the average customer by $35 per month or $420 per year by 2030. About half of that increase ($17) would be felt as soon as October 2026. 
In its request, CMP listed expanded customer service operations, tree-trimming and changes to storm cost recovery as the main drivers of the cost increase. 
“The last thing working Mainers need is executives in expensive suits telling them that $35 a [month] is no big deal,” said Troy Jackson, a Democratic candidate for governor and former Maine State Senate president, who testified at the hearing. 
During the hour of public testimony, no one voiced support for the proposal.
David Bilski, a CMP customer who lives in Bristol, said he and his wife estimated that their annual costs could increase by more than $800 because their electricity usage is double that of the average customer due to their high-efficiency heat pumps.
While they are happy with their choice to replace their oil-fired boiler, that increase would be “crazy” for them on a fixed income. 
Gov. Mills opposes CMP plan that could raise average annual electricity costs by more than $400

John Glowa, another gubernatorial candidate who is running as an independent, said he has a wood stove that heats half of his house and he’s lucky that at 71 years old he can still work when he needs to. But, he wondered, if the rate hike goes forward, “How many are going to shiver in cold homes because they are trying to save money for rent, food or medicine?”
Commission Chair Phil Bartlett told the crowd Tuesday night that it could take a year to work through this case, so a decision as to whether the proposal will be approved or not isn’t expected until late next summer. After a second public hearing in Hallowell Wednesday evening, the commission plans to hold a series of technical meetings to gather more details. 
The proposed rate hike comes as Mainers are already seeing a significant uptick in their power bills.
The average CMP residential customer paid roughly $155 in August, up from $140 this time last year. Customers in Versant’s Bangor Hydro District saw their bills go up just over $20 this past year, from $148 to $169, while the average Versant Maine Public District consumer saw their bill increase from about $144 to $162.
Earlier in the day, Jackson held a press conference in Portland to voice his opposition to CMP’s proposal. He said he was floored when he saw the rate increase it would place on Mainers, like sisters Mary Tardiff and Kathy Davis, who live in Lewiston. 
Tardiff, who also spoke at the press conference, shared how she bought her dream home in Lewiston about six years ago but has since faced a series of unexpected expenses — such as having to replace her roof after the winter storms in 2023 and 2024 — and cost increases that have caused her to question whether she can afford to stay. 
In an effort to keep their grocery bills down, Tardiff tripled the size of her garden this year so she would have extra to can and share with Davis, who lives nearby.
The women are worried that a proposed rate increase will only exacerbate the strain they have felt on their fixed incomes in recent years.
Gov. Janet Mills has also publicly opposed the rate hike, calling the request “massive and unacceptable.”
She said the proposal undermines legislation that she signed in 2022, which requires utility companies to file a 10-year plan to determine what upgrades will be needed to improve grid reliability and resilience while taking into account the state’s climate policy goals and cost-effectiveness for ratepayers. 
CMP has said its plan is designed to build a “smarter, stronger, more resilient grid,” so it can better serve customers by reducing associated costs from potential storms and supporting a switch to clean energy.

(Aaron Sanderford/Nebraska Examiner)It’s always stirring to watch Interstate 80 swell with fans on a Saturday. But this fall, the university that the Big Red faithful pass on their way to Memorial Stadium teeters on a slope to academic devastation.
UNL Chancellor Rodney Bennett’s proposal to eliminate six academic programs —including the entire Earth and Atmospheric Sciences Department — is no routine budget balancing. It signals the potential collapse of Nebraska’s claim to having a flagship university worthy of the name.
Think about it.
As Nebraskans, we’re proud of the land, the water and the skies overhead. We’re proud of the crops that grow on the land. Are we going to sit back and watch our university eliminate its meteorology and geology programs in an agricultural state increasingly battered by climate extremes? Are we going to watch it downsize entomology and plant pathology while insects and viruses attack crops?
The proposed $27.5 million in cuts would save money in the short term while costing Nebraska immeasurably in the long run. UNL’s Earth and Atmospheric Sciences Department has led groundbreaking research in Antarctic climate studies. Its faculty and graduates contribute directly to understanding the weather patterns that affect every farmer, every insurance company, every utility and every planner in our state.
And that’s just one facet. Eliminating this department would not just cost us 12 faculty positions, it would cost us institutional knowledge, talent and research capacity that took decades to build and would take decades to rebuild.
The same logic applies to statistics, educational administration, science teaching, landscape architecture and other targeted programs. In an age when data science drives innovation and educational leadership shapes the workforce of tomorrow, these cuts would leave Nebraska less competitive, not more efficient.
It’s late in the game. But rather than accepting these destructive cuts as inevitable, let’s band together and be creative. We can preserve these vital programs until lawmakers reconsider their priorities. The University of Nebraska Foundation, with its substantial endowment and fundraising capacity, could establish an emergency academic preservation fund to bridge the current funding gap. Donors small and large could come to the rescue. I would be among them. Others, too.
Consider the math: The six academic programs targeted for elimination would save $7.7 million annually. A $15.4 million emergency fund could preserve all of them for two years and represents less than 4% of the $389 million the foundation raised last year from over 50,000 donors. If it were sports at stake, you know we’d do it. Don’t academics deserve the same?
This emergency fund would maintain threatened academic programs for two years while the Nebraska Legislature reassesses its commitment to invest in the state’s land-grant university mission. It would give NU President Dr. Jeffrey Gold and his team a chance to better make the evident case that, far from being bloated or overly “woke,” our university is underfunded yet productive for all Nebraskans.
If we allow these cuts to proceed, we will join the ranks of states that have hollowed out their flagship universities in the name of fiscal responsibility, only to discover that they’ve undermined their economic competitiveness. We’ll watch other, savvier states recruit the best of the faculty and grad students we’re dismissing, develop the research partnerships we’re abandoning and attract the businesses that need the expertise we’re eliminating.
An emergency preservation fund wouldn’t just save academic programs, it would send a powerful message about Nebraska’s values and ambitions. It would avoid a fumble in our ambition to rejoin the American Association of Universities. It would demonstrate that we understand the connection between research universities, innovation and economic development, between academic excellence and the talent retention that keeps our brightest young people in state. It would make Go Big Red mean the whole state wins.

We don’t lack ideas. We lack moral clarity and resolve.,"This past summer, Gov. Ned Lamont vetoed a major housing bill that would have helped build more homes across Connecticut. His message? Local voices matter. Towns should take the lead.
And I wondered – which voices, exactly? And lead in what direction?

Melvin Medina
It’s now been months since that veto. No special session has been called. And while lawmakers are still working to tweak and refine HB 5002, one truth remains: we can adjust a bill’s language, but unless we’re willing to fight for belonging, we’ll never change the outcome.
I live in Woodbridge, a town held hostage by what I call the No-Growth, No-Opportunity Coalition. If local voices matter to the governor, then I want him to hear this: we aren’t just fighting over buildings, we’re fighting over belonging.
At least, that’s what my dad taught me.
My father was a janitor. He worked in a school, mopping floors, cleaning bathrooms, and keeping the grounds. He loved what he did. As a child, I didn’t understand why.
Some summers, I tagged along – his quiet way of instilling in me a pride in work. One day I asked why he cared so much about mopping floors and replacing urinal cakes. He smiled, saw through my question, and gave me a lesson I’ll never forget:
“I’m not just taking care of floors or bathrooms,” he said. “I’m caring for what happens inside that building – the teachers, the students, the lives being shaped every day. The future. That’s what’s within these walls. That’s what I’m nurturing. Potential.”
That’s how I think about housing. The buildings matter, yes – but what matters most is who gets to live inside them: families, children, futures shaped by access. When opponents block housing, they’re not rejecting walls or blueprints. They’re rejecting people – and their potential.
That’s why housing debates are so charged. I’ve seen it firsthand in Woodbridge, during a recent town meeting where Democrats and Republicans, usually divided, stood united in one effort: blocking a proposed 96-unit apartment building through procedural delay.
It was another reminder that some towns aren’t leading. They’re being held hostage by fear, by a coalition that thrives on saying no.
On my drive home that night, beneath the black oaks reaching toward the stars, something painful settled in. Long before my family arrived, this town had already said no to my child.
The objections I’d heard that night weren’t new. They followed a familiar playbook: process complaints. Traffic fears. Appeals to “neighborhood character.” Invocations of conservation and the environment. And finally, the hardest one to hear: the claim that there would be too many children.
Some concerns — like traffic, environmental impact, or school capacity — can and should be addressed. But appeals to “character” and “aesthetics” are different. They’re vague by design, impossible to measure, and often used to preserve exclusion without saying so outright.
This is the intersection where policy meets bad faith and the result is stalling and stagnation. We don’t lack ideas. We lack moral clarity and resolve.
Consider the scale: Connecticut needs more than 100,000 affordable housing units to meet demand – most of it from lifelong residents priced out of their own communities. Yet in 2024, the state completed just 1,335 state-financed homes — a 33% drop from the previous year, and reportedly the lowest total in more than a decade. That’s not progress. That’s failure by delay.
HB 5002 was a step in reversing that trajectory — not by stripping local control, but by incentivizing towns to take action, offering tools and resources to those willing to build.
We must ask: Can a town truly lead if it’s captive to curators of “taste” — neighbors who cloak exclusion in the language of character, aesthetics, and tradition?
Governor Lamont says local voices matter. I’m asking which ones. The tastemakers? Or the families priced out of opportunity?
Too often, the loudest voices in the room aren’t speaking in good faith. And the people who most need housing? They’re not in the room at all.
Some towns aren’t planning for growth — they’re planning for delay, cloaked in the language of process. And delay, repeated enough, becomes policy by default.
I think often of my dad, who passed during the pandemic. His lesson still guides me: see past the brick and mortar, and focus on the people, the possibility, the futures inside.
That’s what we should be fighting for. That’s what belonging looks like.
But I worry we’re not having the right conversation. Too often, even local Democrats mistake process for progress. They speak the language of inclusion while quietly backing efforts to stall or kill projects. They don’t see that by opposing density, they’ve become part of the very problem we claim to be solving.
We’re not short on ideas or policy tools. What we’re missing is moral clarity.
Because belonging isn’t neutral or static. It must be an active political value — one that both parties can champion.
If we believe in opportunity, in fairness, in a future where working families can thrive, then access to homes people can afford must be central. Some would say: build where it’s easiest. I say: build also where it matters, in communities that offer working families a promise of opportunity.
Yes, HB 5002 may be amended. But the final bill must do more than change words — it must be a step toward changing outcomes. It must free communities held hostage to bad-faith obstruction and performative processes.
Because when we block homes, we’re not preserving our towns. We’re narrowing their future.
Leadership isn’t about letting towns say no — it’s about helping them say yes.
Call the special session, Governor. Moderate exclusion, not opportunity.
That’s how you fight for belonging. That’s how we create more homes people can afford.

High storm surge and hurricane force winds, in some areas up to 107 mph, slammed the western coastal region – particularly Kuskokwim Delta communities – and villages along the Bering Sea, only accessible by road and small plane.

“Several houses floated miles inland – some with people still inside. There are a few houses still intact on higher ground on one side of the village. Everyone else has lost their homes or are facing extensive damage,” Jacqui Lang of Kipnuk wrote on Facebook. 
Residents posted photos and updates on Facebook, sharing prayers and connecting with family and friends. Some had minimal battery power, as utilities were knocked out by the storm.
Some filmed U.S. Coast Guard helicopters rescuing residents from homes floating away in nearby waters – 51 residents were rescued from the hardest-hit communities of Kwigillingok and Kipnuk on Sunday and Monday.
“WE MADE IT OUT OF KIPNUK! Everyone’s good and at the school. The Coast Guard just picked us up and just landed into Bethel,” wrote Kristy Fox of Kipnuk, along with videos of helicopter rescues. “Kipnuk isn’t Kipnuk anymore. I pray they evacuate safely.”
The storm killed one woman in Kwigillingok, left two missing and displaced over 1,000 people. 
Hundreds took shelter in local schools as vast flooding and winds had damaged homes, structures, boats roads, and boardwalks. 
Damage is still being assessed. Emergency crews were deployed to assist with repairing damaged runways, power and sewer infrastructure and begin evacuating and airlifting residents to shelter in Bethel as of Tuesday.

(Provided by the Montana Department of Corrections)The Department of Corrections announced late Tuesday it had identified three water leaks at the prison.
The Department of Corrections discovered a “water pipe break” at 6 a.m. on Friday, and an inmate and family members have said conditions have grown dire since, with a lack of drinking water and unsanitary conditions.
An inmate at the Montana State Prison and family members of people who are incarcerated said Tuesday there has been no heat in some parts of the facility and at least one unit flooded.
Late Tuesday, however, the DOC said it was making progress on the fix. To test the system for additional leaks, the DOC said its maintenance team is repressurizing and monitoring the system.
“We took a step forward today by confirming where several leaks were located,” DOC Director Brian Gootkin said in the news release late Tuesday. “Even though we found these leaks, we are still working to repair them and resolve the situation for inmates. We’re going to continue evaluating the system and sourcing water and resources for the facility.” 
Tuesday, the morning forecast called for a low of 27 degrees in Deer Lodge, and an inmate, Josh McKnight, estimated the temperature inside at about 50 degrees.

“The heat systems run water through the walls, and the heaters are on the walls,” McKnight said in a phone call Tuesday with the Daily Montanan. “And without water, there’s nothing there.”
A DOC spokesperson said Tuesday she had received questions from the Daily Montanan about the lack of heat and flooding but had not responded to them by press time.
But in the news release Tuesday, the DOC said to ensure services for inmates and staff, 133 portable toilets are on site at MSP along with 43 mobile shower units. The DOC said toilets and showers are pumped and cleaned continuously throughout the day. 
“Staff are working to keep normal inmate services running and are prioritizing the delivery of resources where they are needed most critically,” the news release said. “To assist with security efforts, Probation and Parole officers and correctional officers from the Montana Women’s Prison are on site.”
In a Monday afternoon update, the state agency said a second “leak detection consultant” had arrived at the facility from Bozeman. The Department of Corrections also said a second National Guard team had been called to help out with water delivery. 
The National Guard tankers will begin running a 24-hour service to help refill the main water tank at the prison, the press release said. More than 200,000 gallons have been delivered, the state press release stated.
An inmate and family members earlier said they were concerned about the lack of water for drinking and cleaning themselves and their inability to shower. Tuesday, however, McKnight said hand sanitizer had been made available.
“We know this is a challenging situation and recognize the urgency felt by inmates and their families to resolve this as soon as possible. We share that sense of urgency,” Gootkin said in the Monday news release. 
McKnight is in a medical unit at the prison and while he’s not as worried about himself, there are older and frail inmates he’s concerned about, including one who is, “completely paralyzed, and he can’t do anything.” 
Josh McKnight’s wife, Amanda, has spent the last couple of days glued to her screen trying to get help for those currently incarcerated and helping organize a tightly knit group of family members with loved ones in prison to advocate for those dealing with the water pipe issue.
Amanda McKnight, who also runs a Facebook page called 406 Revolutionized, said food has been a concern, as inmates are worried about whether it is being cooked with water that is safe. 
Kenzie Lincoln, whose husband, Bryce Baltezar, is currently at the Deer Lodge facility, said fights have caused lockdowns, which prevent people from going to the bathroom – the portable toilets are in the yard. 
On Monday night, Baltezar’s unit flooded, and it took over an hour to get a response from guards, said Lincoln, who has been in regular communication with her husband. The prisoners had no idea if the water was safe to be in or around, she added. One flooded unit was the Special Housing Unit, and the other was the Administrative Segregation Unit, she said.
“He’s spent five years in and out of prison, and he sees that, you know, a lot of times, issues don’t get fixed, even small issues,” Lincoln said. “ … He said (last night,) ‘I wish that God would just take me in my sleep. I can’t do this anymore.’.”
Portable showers have been delivered to the prison. The showers quickly broke, McKnight said, and she has gone so far as to reach out to a company that could bring in showers for the prison.

Tuesday afternoon, Josh McKnight said he was told by prison staff that they were in the process of setting up shower tents outside. The DOC said in the late afternoon news release it had 43 mobile shower units.
“There’s 160 men living that haven’t showered in six days,” McKnight said. “Not a good smell.”
He and family members also report that portable toilets have been vandalized, and they have had health and sanitation concerns about dirty facilities inside the prison.
The Department of Corrections reported the leak to prisoners early on Oct. 10, with inmates and families describing a “crisis” on the ground in the prison.
The water pipe break has drawn a large response from various state agencies, and on Monday, a County Assist Team (CAT) from Disaster Emergency Services and Department of Natural Resources and Conservation is now helping to plan, logistics, and incident follow-up. That team is often used on wildfires across the state.
Additional personnel from the Montana State Women’s Prison arrived on Tuesday, according to the Department of Corrections. They join probation and parole officers from the surrounding area, which included some from Missoula and Helena.
On Tuesday, Brigadier General Trenton Gibson, who is Adjutant General for the State of Montana and serves as Commander of the Montana National Guard and the Director of the Department of Military Affairs, visited National Guard troops at MSP, the DOC said. He also met with Gootkin and MSP Warden Jim Salmonsen.

(Courtesy of Brad Johnson)It’s harvest time in South Dakota and for nearly 140,000 pheasant hunters, it is an opportunity to wander fields of grass, edges of wetlands and pockets of overgrown weeds.
All across the state, farmers are growing and selling corn, wheat, soybeans, cattle and other products, contributing billions of dollars to the state’s economy. 
Hunters this fall will likely harvest more than 1.3 million pheasants, 47,000 deer, 220,000 ducks, and 300,000 geese in South Dakota, along with antelope, elk, grouse, turkey, rabbits and other wildlife. Our beautiful landscape and abundant wildlife provide a huge boon to local communities as hunters fill hotel rooms and restaurants. 
These twin economic pillars — farming and tourism — both benefit greatly from the federal farm bill and its voluntary, incentive-based conservation programs. These programs provide farmers with funds and advice needed to put in place much-needed systems that conserve our soil, water and wildlife. 
Thune files bipartisan bill to strengthen federal conservation program

In South Dakota, about 80% of the land is privately owned, which means the vast majority of sportsmen and women are hunting in habitat on private lands.
Most landowners want to be good stewards, but many do not have resources to create or restore wildlife habitat. Through the farm bill, the U.S. Department of Agriculture can help provide those resources.
In July, Congress extended four major farm bill conservation programs, and in a big win for wildlife, increased the long-term funding for the programs by about 50%. 
Congress also extended some smaller programs like the Voluntary Public Access & Habitat Incentives Program that has supported our state’s Walk-in Area Program, which provides hunting access on more than 1.25 million acres. 
Unfortunately, the Conservation Reserve Program — which turns 40 years old this year — was the one major farm bill conservation program that did not get extended in July. It and many other farm bill programs expired on Sept. 30. 
Until Congress finishes the work to write a new farm bill or extends the current one, USDA will be unable to enroll any new acres in CRP contracts. CRP is a popular and effective tool that helps farmers protect existing grassland or plant marginal cropland with grasses, shrubs and trees. The program has three major purposes: soil conservation, wildlife habitat and water quality.
According to a March 2024 report on pheasant management by the state Department of Game, Fish and Parks, “the CRP represents one of the most successful conservation programs ever implemented in the United States.”
To complicate matters, when Congress failed to pass a funding bill before Oct. 1 and the government shut down, USDA sent 96% of its conservation employees home and closed offices around the country.
USDA even stopped issuing checks, like the annual CRP payments to landowners that were supposed to go out Oct. 1. USDA has already lost nearly one-quarter of its conservation staff since the new administration took over in January, and the government shutdown will put USDA employees even further behind and make life more difficult for farmers. 
South Dakota’s hunters, anglers, farmers and ranchers are some of the top beneficiaries of CRP in the country, with over 2.6 million acres enrolled in the program. CRP contracts bring over $145 million annually to more than 14,000 South Dakota landowners. That doesn’t include the myriad other benefits from the program, like the boost in the outdoor economy that comes from the wildlife produced on those lands.
Over 542,000 acres of CRP contracts in South Dakota are wetlands, providing nesting and migratory habitat for ducks, geese and other waterfowl. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service estimates CRP acres in the northern Great Plains add about 2 million ducks to the fall flight every year.
Despite the popularity and success of CRP, Congress is considering proposals that would reduce the program’s benefits for producers, outdoors enthusiasts and wildlife. The program doesn’t need a major overhaul. It just needs a few common-sense improvements.


Let us know what you think...


 

Thankfully, Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-South Dakota, and Senators Amy Klobuchar, D-Minnesota, Jerry Moran, R-Kansas, and Tina Smith, D-Minnesota, recognize the benefits of the program and its value. They introduced the Conservation Reserve Improvement and Flexibility Act, which would add to the program’s ability to meet producer needs. 
The bill would streamline the application process for CRP State Acres for Wildlife Enhancement, an increasingly popular option in South Dakota where over 235,000 acres are planted to grass species that benefit pheasants and other grassland birds. 
Their bill would provide federal payments for fencing and water facilities to encourage sounder grazing of CRP acres and would increase the annual limit on CRP payments that has not been raised since CRP was created in 1985.
The CRP Transition Incentives Program has already helped more than 2,900 farmers acquire over 400,000 acres of expiring CRP land nationwide, but the program could do even more to help new and beginning farmers if Congress would prioritize them in awarding new CRP contracts as it now does for other USDA conservation programs. With some minor changes, CRP could also be a stronger tool for establishing and maintaining migratory corridors for wildlife. 
As members of Congress consider these and other changes to the program, they should ensure there are no cuts. We need more CRP acres, not less.",https://southdakotasearchlight.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_20251007_164618-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-14 21:56:47.581291

(Juan Salinas II/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — A nonprofit group behind a handful of Nebraska ballot initiatives announced a campaign Tuesday to gather signatures for two new ones aimed at conservative election goals. 
One would alter how the state awards Electoral College votes for president, giving all five to the winner of the popular vote statewide. The other would require elections in the state to be conducted exclusively using paper ballots counted by hand.
The group, Advocates for All Nebraskans, is now collecting signatures for five ballot initiatives. The group, headlined by former leaders of the Nebraska Republican Party, argues that the initiatives are about reclaiming the state’s voice and promoting government accountability.
“This is not a partisan movement … This is a populist movement,” said Eric Underwood, the former chair of the Nebraska GOP who helped lead a populist takeover of the party in 2022. “We exist because many of us grew tired of waiting for solutions from the traditional status quo elected officials or political consultants.” 
Underwood, along with State Board of Education member Kirk Penner, former Nebraska State Patrol Superintendent Tom Nesbitt and former Lincoln talk radio host Doug Fitzgerald, are behind efforts to get the measures and constitutional amendments on the ballot in 2026. Group leaders say each proposal has grassroots support.
The winner-take-all constitutional amendment is identical to State Sen. Myron Dorn of Adams’ legislative resolution this year on letting voters decide whether to shift the state to winner-take-all, which did not get scheduled for a vote. A separate proposal to make the change in statute from State Sen. Loren Lippincott, Legislative Bill 3, fell to a filibuster.

Nebraska is one of just two states — Maine is the other — that parse out some electoral votes by the winner in each congressional district. Winner-take-all has been on local conservative wish lists for decades, as Democrats have grown increasingly competitive in the Omaha-based 2nd Congressional District. It has seen a resurgence as Nebraska Gov. Jim Pillen tried and failed to get it passed. 
Pillen did a full-court press for a winner-take-all ahead of the 2024 presidential election — with President Donald Trump getting personally involved in calling and lobbying lawmakers, but the effort died after former Democratic State Sen. Mike McDonnell of Omaha, who had joined the GOP, opposed the change.
Nebraska Democratic Party chair Jane Kleeb said, “Nebraskans made it clear last year they support our fair electoral system.” Kleeb and the Democrats have argued that Republicans only want to change the rules because the GOP keeps losing in the 2nd District, where Democrats have won three out of the last five presidential elections.
“Our elected officials should instead be training other states to follow Nebraska and Maine — the only two states in the nation that give all voters a voice and a fair shot,” Kleeb said. 
Civic Nebraska, a voting rights advocacy group, called both ballot initiatives “reckless, unnecessary, and fundamentally un-Nebraskan.”

“We are confident that Nebraskans will see these proposals for what they are: partisan schemes that would make our elections less secure, less fair and less reflective of the people,” said Steve Smith, a spokesperson for Civic Nebraska.
The proposed constitutional amendment for paper ballots and hand counting would ban many voting machines from being used. Voting machines that produce voter-verifiable paper records like Nebraska’s would be exempt. It would require all elections to be done by paper ballot by July 2027. 
The effort echoes the push by Trump and some Republicans over election integrity since the 2020 presidential election — an election former President Joe Biden won over Trump. Trump announced plans to “lead a movement” to get rid of mail-in ballots and voting machines ahead of next year’s midterm elections. 
Trump and his allies have sued multiple states alleging election fraud in 2020; all but one of the cases have not survived judicial scrutiny. 
“This petition simply codifies the most secure and publicly verifiable method of counting votes by prioritizing the manual counting of every ballot,”  Penner said. “We are setting a strong precedent that can be a trend setter for other states looking to restore public confidence in their election system.” 
Most voting experts agree that hand counting is less reliable, costlier and more time-consuming than counting by machine. The Texas Tribune and VoteBeat reported that a hand count of ballots in a rural central Texas county during the 2024 Republican primary took nearly 24 hours with 200 people involved. The hand-counting process cost taxpayers about twice the wages paid for the 2020 Republican primary and required fixing several errors. 
 Charles Herbster, who is flirting with another GOP bid for governor, criticized Pillen’s effort, saying that the change should have happened before the 2024 presidential election. He backs both ballot measures. 
“Governor Pillen and his team led people to believe he would get it done. They failed. Now, it’s up to the people,” Herbster said. 
Herbster lost to Pillen and then-State Sen. Brett Lindstrom of Omaha in a three-way Republican primary in 2022 and is a major Trump donor.

Local political observers are mixed on whether a winner-take-all ballot initiative would pass. Some rural Republicans have shared concerns about one day losing “their voice” under winner-take-all as the state becomes more urban and suburban.
Underwood said it’s unlikely there would ever be enough urban and suburban votes to overtake Nebraska’s more conservative rural voters. 
“We have and are fully prepared to have those discussions with our colleagues in the Republican Party who have questions or concerns about it,” Underwood said. 
The group would need to gather the signatures of 10 percent of the state’s registered voters for the winner-take-all initiative that would change the state constitution. The hand-counting ballot initiative would need 7 percent of the state’s registered voters, since that one is changing state law. Both have until July to get on the November 2026 ballot. Over the past decade, gathering signatures and campaigning for a successful petition effort in Nebraska has typically cost $1.5 million or more. 
“Now that all five of the petitions have been introduced, we are ready to mobilize,” Danna Seevers, a co-sponsor of the two ballot initiatives and Seward County GOP chair, said. “Let’s take to the streets to complete the mission to shape Nebraska’s future.”
Editor’s note: This story has been updated to clarify that the proposal from State Sen. Myron Dorn never reached the legislative floor.

Lisa Murkowski and Dan Sullivan (Alaska Beacon file photos)Alaska’s two U.S. senators are split on whether or not it is appropriate for the U.S. military to kill suspected drug smugglers without trial or a declaration of war.
On Tuesday, the federal government said it had killed another six people aboard a boat in international waters of the Caribbean Sea, with President Trump claiming on social media that they were drug smugglers.
Since Sept. 2, the U.S. military has killed 27 people in the Caribbean Sea without a declaration of war or criminal trial, according to statistics kept by the New York Times. 
In each case, the federal government has asserted without evidence that all the people killed aboard the boats were smuggling drugs.
Last week, Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, voted to have the Senate vote on a resolution that would have ended the Caribbean Sea bombings unless approved by Congress.
Sixty votes were needed to call a vote. Only 48 senators — all Democrats, plus Murkowski and Sen. Rand Paul, R-Kentucky — voted in favor of bringing the issue to a vote. 
“While I commend the administration’s concerted efforts to address the devastation of drug trafficking on communities across the country, I do not believe the information I have received justifies this interpretation of the President’s Article II powers,” Murkowski said, referring to the section of the Constitution that names the president the commander in chief of the military.
“I take very seriously my Article I responsibility when it comes to Congress’s power to declare war. I don’t think that full information on the legal and factual justification for armed attacks on suspected drug traffickers is too much to ask,” Murkowski said.
Sen. Dan Sullivan, R-Alaska, joined the rest of the Senate’s Republicans and Democratic Sen. John Fetterman of Pennsylvania in voting to support the bombings.
Afterward, he offered a written statement explaining his vote.
“Days ago, I was briefed by Secretary of State Rubio on Venezuelan narcoterrorist cartels flooding our country with deadly drugs. Nicolás Maduro — the illegitimate leader of Venezuela and a criminal indicted by U.S. prosecutors — refuses to cooperate with the U.S. and is clearly aiding these vicious drug traffickers who are responsible for killing tens of thousands of Americans. President Trump’s lawful strikes against these cartels are saving lives and, importantly, establishing deterrence. Under Article II, he has the authority to defend our homeland, just as President George H.W. Bush did when he ordered the invasion of Panama in 1989 to remove the drug-trafficking dictator Manuel Noriega,” the statement said.
“Senate Democrats’ resolution was another attempt to restrict the President’s ability to act — emboldening cartels and putting American lives at risk. These senators would never tolerate ISIS or al-Qaeda operating freely near our shores: eliminating a terrorist organization like Tren de Aragua that is literally killing thousands of Americans is no different. More Americans have died from drug overdoses in the past seven years than in both World Wars and the Vietnam War combined.

(Screenshot of SCETV legislative livestream)COLUMBIA — Investigators could find no evidence former Rep. RJ May paid taxes for himself or his campaign consulting business during at least three of the years he spent in the House of Representatives, an attorney told the House Ethics Committee on Tuesday.
The committee began investigating the West Columbia Republican’s conduct in July, several weeks after his arrest on charges of sending videos of children being sexually abused. An investigation is usually the first step toward expelling a member from the House.
May resigned his House seat in August, while the investigation was ongoing. He pleaded guilty to five charges of distributing child sexual abuse material last month and is awaiting sentencing in the Edgefield County Detention Center.
Former Rep. RJ May pleads guilty to sending ‘disgusting and depraved’ child sex abuse videos

The complaint, first requested by House Majority Leader Davey Hiott, R-Pickens, went beyond May’s criminal charges.
Hiott asked the committee to look into his financials as well, which was what led a hired investigator to discover years of missing tax filings, said Mark Moore, an attorney with Maynard Nexsen, the law firm hired to look into the matter.
When attorneys requested May’s personal income tax filings and tax filings for his political consulting business, Ivory Tusk Consulting, the Department of Revenue came back with nothing, Moore said.
Ivory Tusk Consulting was not registered with the Secretary of State, suggesting May might have been operating it as a sole proprietorship, a business model that would require him to report his business’ income alongside his personal income on his tax returns. However, May seemed to have filed neither for tax years 2022 to 2024, Moore said.
“I think the conclusion is easy to draw there, and you don’t need me to draw it,” Moore said.
It’s unclear why the investigation didn’t include 2021, May’s first year in office. But it was 2022 when May helped launch the hardline-conservative Freedom Caucus in the House — as a chapter of the Washington, D.C.-based State Freedom Caucus Network — ran primary campaigns to oust his fellow Republicans, and drove an increasingly public schism with the GOP majority caucus.
The investigators did not try to get May’s federal tax returns, since the federal treasurer’s office wouldn’t have to comply with a state investigation in the same way as a state agency, he said.
The law firm’s investigator also raised concerns that May didn’t disclose all he should have on a financial statement he submitted to a federal judge asking for a public defender to represent him in court.
May claimed he had no assets other than his pickup truck, leading federal Magistrate Shiva Hodges to appoint him a team of two taxpayer-funded attorneys. May later fired his attorneys and opted to represent himself, though his public defenders will take over the case again for his sentencing hearing.
In calls and messages from his jail cell, however, May claimed candidates whose campaigns he ran, including sitting members of the Freedom Caucus, owed him tens of thousands of dollars. May didn’t specify exactly how much he felt was missing, but the amount was at least $50,000, according to jail communication records provided to the SC Daily Gazette.
May should have reported that money to the judge as an asset, but the attorneys investigating him determined he did not, Moore said.
“Obviously, courts expect people when they seek appointed counsel to be truthful with them in financial affidavits,” Moore told the committee. “As our investigation revealed, that did not happen here.”
Providing false information to a judge could be a felony, Moore said.
The committee found May “acted in a manner unbecoming of the House of Representatives,” Rep. Robby Robbins, R-Summerville, said. The eight committee members present agreed unanimously to issue a public reprimand against May for sending the videos.
“The whole thing is a sad and dark moment in that I served, as we served, with an individual who is engaging in some of the most reprehensible conduct imaginable,” said Ethics Chairman Jay Jordan, R-Florence.
May did not respond to the complaint or notices of meetings sent to him in jail, Jordan said. No attorney appeared at the meeting Tuesday to speak on May’s behalf.
Although May resigned his seat before the investigation reached a conclusion, the investigation was important in considering a then-sitting member’s activities, Jordan said.
A public reprimand will do little to May, who faces as many as 100 years in prison, but it allowed the committee to document its findings, Jordan said.
“Had we been able to kick him out, we would have, but we couldn’t because he had removed that opportunity from us,” Jordan said.
The committee voted unanimously to refer any possible criminal violations to a state agency equipped to handle them. Jordan declined to say what agency that might be, saying it will be up to another agency to decide whether to pursue charges.
The committee also voted to refer complaints about two people to the State Ethics Commission for review as to whether they violated ethics law. Jordan declined to say who those people are or what charges they face.
Other members of the Freedom Caucus, of which May was a founding member, came under scrutiny during the investigation, Moore said. While looking into May’s consulting business, attorneys wanted to interview some of the biggest contributors to his business, including current caucus members, he said.
Some agreed to cooperate, including voluntarily handing over financial reports and bank statements. Others declined to participate in the investigation, even when attorneys issued subpoenas, Moore said.
Three Freedom Caucus members — Chairman Jordan Pace, R-Goose Creek; Rep. Jay Kilmartin, R-Irmo; and Rep. Stephen Frank, R-Greenville — either did not respond to requests for interviews with attorneys or failed to follow through with scheduled meetings, Moore said.
When reached by the SC Daily Gazette, Frank, Kilmartin and Pace all asked if they could respond later.
When attorneys sat down with the members’ attorneys, they refused to answer questions, saying they did not believe their clients had to respond to hired counsel, an assertion the hired lawyers did not believe to be correct, Moore said.
The refusal to cooperate likely postponed the investigation’s results by at least a month, coming at what Moore said was a “significant” cost to taxpayers, though he didn’t say how much.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-14-at-7.25.45-PM.png,,,2025-10-14 20:57:50.817594

(Photo by Mary Steurer/North Dakota Monitor)A committee of North Dakota lawmakers this week began sifting through an ocean of recommendations for how to spend a $500 million federal rural health care grant as the state races to meet a Nov. 5 application deadline.
The state will have a number of complex decisions to make — including how to weigh the public’s priorities against the kinds of initiatives encouraged by the federal government, a top human services official told legislators Tuesday.
Congress created the $50 billion Rural Health Transformation Program this summer as part of its 10-year budget reconciliation law. Members of Congress pitched the program as a means to offset losses rural states will suffer from federal cuts to Medicaid approved elsewhere in the bill.
The money can be used for areas including behavioral health, workforce, infrastructure development and disease prevention.
North Dakota must submit budgets for how it plans to use its share of the funds to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services by Nov. 5.

While every state will get at least $500 million from the program, they’re eligible for more money, too.
The federal government will award supplemental funding based on certain state demographics, like the size of North Dakota’s rural population and the percentage of health services that go uncompensated because no payment is received by a patient or insurer, said Sarah Aker, executive director of medical services for the Department of Health and Human Services. She said North Dakota doesn’t score very high under this criteria compared to other states, though.
“Going into the scoring for supplemental funding, we’re starting from behind,” Aker told lawmakers on Tuesday.
The federal government is also awarding additional money based on the quality of states’ proposals. For example, if North Dakota demonstrates in its application that the initiatives it starts through the grant are sustainable and will continue even after federal funding runs out, the state may get more funding, Aker said.
Some complicating factors are that the state can’t use the money to build or purchase buildings, or to replace funding for programs already approved by the Legislature, among other restrictions. 
The North Dakota Department of Health and Human Services has spent the last few months working on the state’s application, including by gathering public input and by researching how the state can maximize its funding award. Those efforts included issuing a survey, conducting public listening sessions and consulting with tribal leaders, Aker said.

The public’s top priorities are expanding workforce recruitment and retention, health care access and chronic disease prevention, said Aker.
Many North Dakotans said they lack basic emergency services or health care facilities in their towns.
 “Lost my father when he was 57 due to heart attack and it took the ambulance 45 minutes to arrive to assist, but it was too late,” said one survey response highlighted by the agency.
One way the grant could address this is by funding a program to put at least one first responder in all 1,800 townships in the state, Aker said.
North Dakota lawmakers eye special session in January or February for federal rural health funding

Rep. Jayme Davis, a Rolette Democrat and member of the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa, said the state has no shortage of good recommendations for how to use the money. She highlighted expanding opportunities for health care education at North Dakota’s tribal colleges and investing in mobile health clinics and medical detox centers as particularly of interest.
It will be hard to decide how to divvy up the funds, Davis noted.
“The more we add, the thinner the money stretches,” she said.
The federal government has also indicated it will award more money to states with certain policies, like those that restrict the use of food stamps for non-nutritious foods. Aker said Health and Human Services is working on putting such a restriction in place.
The federal funding is expected to be awarded to states by the end of the year. Lawmakers anticipate convening in January or February for a special session to authorize the state to spend the grant money.
Because the Department of Health and Human Services already hosted listening sessions, the committee did not take public comment on Tuesday.
The 33-member committee will meet Wednesday to continue discussing the application. 
Chair Sen. Brad Bekkedahl, R-Williston, said on Wednesday the committee will consider whether or not to ask Legislative Council to draft policy bills that could improve the state’s application score.
He said another potential action item is considering a motion to submit formal application recommendations to the Department of Health and Human Services. The committee has set aside Oct. 21 for an additional meeting if needed.

(Alixel Cabrera/Utah News Dispatch)Gov. Spencer Cox announced his new Utah Supreme Court Justice pick to replace outgoing Associate Chief Justice John Peace on the bench. Third District Judge John Nielsen now awaits confirmation from the Utah Senate to join the high court. 
Cox said that after reviewing dozens of applications, hours of interviews exploring the candidates’ judicial philosophy and temperament, and examining many of their arguments and decisions, he’s confident in his choice.

The governor appointed Nielsen to the 3rd District Court in September 2024 after his work in different private ventures — including a joint firm with former Utah Associate Chief Justice Thomas Lee, Sen. Mike Lee’s brother. Nielsen also worked 11 years as solicitor general in the Utah Attorney General’s Office, and years as an adjunct associate professor at the University of Utah.

Before taking the district court judgeship, Nielsen and Lee’s law firm was hired by then-Utah Attorney General Sean Reyes to represent the state against a lawsuit challenging Utah’s transgender students sports ban, according to KUTV, a contract that became effective hours after Lee retired from the Utah Supreme Court and days after Nielsen resigned from the Attorney General’s Office.
“When you read anything written by Judge Nielsen, whether as a judge or as an attorney in the private sector, what we will soon find is that he is absolutely brilliant,” Cox said in a news conference at the state Capitol. “He’s one of the smartest people that I’ve ever interviewed.”
Chief Justice Matthew Durrant praised the state’s rigorous selection process, arguing that Pearce, who’s retiring on Dec. 1, is evidence of how good the system is. Nielsen is also “a strong testament” to the strength of the judicial selection process, Durrant added.

“I have been on the Supreme Court for 25 years now. For a good chunk of those years, I had a chance to see John Nielsen regularly argue before our court,” Durrant said. “And in those 25 years, I have never seen a better oral and written advocate. His writing has always been impeccable, honest, to the point.”
Nielsen said his judicial philosophy is “textualist” and “originalist,” saying that essentially means “trying to ensure that your interpretation fits with the intent of the law. In the case of statute, textualism, the will of the Legislature. In the case of the Constitution, the will of the people.”
That was an important factor in Cox’s selection, he said. 
“There’s a right way and a less appropriate way to decide cases and to interpret those laws,” Cox said. “And I feel very strongly that a textualist and originalist approach is the only way to anchor our system in a way that doesn’t lead to eventual chaos. Judges are not supposed to write laws or make up laws. That is the role of the legislative branch.”
Also, Cox said, now that the state is growing, district judges have had to take on larger workloads with little time. It’s something that Nielsen has proven to be able to do, Cox said.
During the 2025 legislative session, some lawmakers criticized the Utah Supreme Court as “woefully unproductive,” pointing to the number of opinions issued in 2023 and 2022 in comparison to other states. A director of communications for the Utah State Courts disputed that representation, arguing that “comparing volumes of published opinions between states is not an apples-to-apples comparison. Different courts have different structures and publish different things.”
Former Utah House Majority Leader Jefferson Moss said he was looking to expand the five-member Utah Supreme Court over “growing caseloads, delays, and evolving legal complexities in Utah’s highest court.”
Moss opened a bill file but, with little time left in the session, the proposal ultimately was never discussed
Cox said that’s something he has been thinking about lately because of the growing caseload in the state courts. 
“It’s not because of our court members. It’s just because of the sheer caseload,” Cox said. “And so I think it’s worth exploring how we get them additional resources that they might need.”

Green resigned this week after those indictments, the office's first, were tossed out. (Screenshot from Attorney General's Office video)The Maryland attorney general’s office is looking for a new leader for its police oversight unit, after its top two staffers resigned, the office confirmed Tuesday.
The office posted a job opening Tuesday for a new division chief at the Independent Investigations Division, the unit that handles all deaths involving law enforcement in Maryland — and which recently gained the authority to prosecute police officers.
The staffing changes come after the division’s first set of officer indictments were tossed out last month by an Anne Arundel County Circuit Court judge.
IID Chief Allison Green and deputy chief Renee Martel Joy “have resigned and will remain with the Office through the end of this week,” according to a statement from Jennifer Donelan, a spokesman for the attorney general’s office. She said Jonathan Smith, chief of the office’s Civil Rights Division, will serve as IID interim leader “while a robust search for new leadership is underway.”
Asked whether the outcome of the Anne Arundel County case contributed to the staff shakeup, Donelan said the office “does not comment on personnel matters.”
The job posting says the attorney general is “seeking an exceptional attorney to lead one of its most consequential and high-profile divisions: the Independent Investigations Division.”
“This is a rare opportunity to shape the future of public safety and accountability in Maryland,” it says. The posting seeks candidates with at least 10 years of experience in criminal prosecutions or defense, and offers a salary range of $135,418 to $191,453.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
“The role requires a skilled criminal trial lawyer and leader who brings vision and integrity to the work — someone who can implement and refine best practices in the handling of these complex and sensitive cases,” the posting states.
The new director will oversee an office that was created by the General Assembly in 2021 to evaluate and publish reports about all instances in which a person dies during an interaction with Maryland law enforcement officers.
But the Independent Investigations Division only gained the authority to prosecute officers it investigated in 2023; before that, it was up to local jurisdictions whether or not to charge officers involved in a death.
The first charges filed by IID with that new authority came in December 2024, when Anne Arundel County Police Cpl. Eddie Vasquez and Cpl. Kieran Schnell were indicted for a high-speed chase a year earlier that ended in a fatal crash.
In December 2023, Vasquez and Schnell, in separate cruisers, chased a vehicle with its headlights off traveling 92 mph on Fort Smallwood Road, which has a 35 mph speed limit. The chase went on for 2 miles and reached speeds of 109 mph before Meziah Johnson’s car hit a utility pole, killing his passenger, Damione Gardner, 22.
Johnson survived. Now 25, he has since pleaded guilty to negligent manslaughter, drug possession and theft up to $25,000.
According to the indictment, neither Vasquez nor Schnell activated emergency lights or sirens, or their body-worn cameras, or contacted a supervisor. The pair “made factual misrepresentations and material omissions to [their] supervisors about the circumstances of the crash and concealed the occurrence,” prosecutors said. Vasquez and Schnell, who respectively had five and six years of service with the department, were charged with misconduct in office.
But during a hearing in September, Anne Arundel County Circuit Judge Stacy McCormack said the state failed to reach the burden of proof necessary for the charges against the two officers to move forward.
McCormack also said that the state failed to prove it followed procedures to keep “compelled statements” — made by the officers during an internal affairs investigation — separate from the attorneys prosecuting the case. Under the law, prosecutors cannot see those “compelled statements” or use them in trial, due to officers’ rights protecting them from self-incrimination during questioning by their employer.
“The burden is an affirmative one,” McCormack said. “The AG must demonstrate that its evidence is not tainted by any direct or indirect exposures to the compelled testimony.”
“I think it’s very important to note that I understand that this is a serious case involving an accident where an individual lost his life,” McCormack said, before dismissing the charges.
At the time of the officers’ indictment, Anne Arundel County Police Chief Amal E. Awad said her department had investigated the incident and was “not aware of any conduct demonstrated by our officers that rises to the level of a violation of criminal law.” Once the charges were dismissed by McCormack, the department said that both Vasquez and Schnell were reinstated “to full-duty status” on the force.
“These are good officers,” Vasquez’s attorney Andrew Jezic said after the ruling. “Their main focus was getting these two guys out of the car and into the hands of the emergency personnel. This ruling could not have benefited finer, more dedicated officers and extremely nice young men.”

(Photo by William J. Ford/Maryland Matters)Annapolis mayoral candidates Jared Littmann and Bob O’Shea agreed that the city should ensure equal opportunities are provided for all Annapolitans — at a forum focused strictly on questions about the city’s LGBTQ+ community, that was the easy part.
It was when they talked about how to get there that the answers got interesting.
While Littman, the Democrat, was quick to agree with about any question, O’Shea, the Republican, occasionally framed his answers in terms of the city budget, since a main theme of his campaign has been the need to reduce city spending.
The hourlong debate was sponsored by the Caucus of African American Leaders exactly three weeks before Election Day, at the Wiley H. Bates Legacy Center. The winner of the Nov. 4 general election will succeed current Mayor Gavin Buckley (D), who has served two terms and is prohibited from running again.
A question on whether either candidate would commit to appointing an LGBTQ+ liaison in the mayor’s office was typical of the evening. O’Shea, citing the budget, said he would “need to look into it.”
“I will 100% meet with the community to discuss it,” O’Shea said. “Would I support having somebody that can be a touchstone in regards to where the community is? Yes, I do. But what I do need to do is figure out a way it’s efficient for the city and also is acceptable to the community, if that makes sense.”
Littmann said there should be a liaison, and if there is not one now, he would bring one on board.
“To be clear, this isn’t necessarily a full-time person that is doing this exclusively. Lots of people in the mayor’s office wear multiple hats, and that would continue,” Littmann said.

“But we absolutely should have someone designated in the mayor’s office, so that any employee feels like they have an issue to raise, they know who to go to in a safe space where they won’t have any penalty or harm brought against them for raising these issues,” he said.
Part of the question is based on a Human Rights Campaign Foundation municipal equality index scorecard last year that knocked the city for its failure to have a liaison in the mayor’s office. The city also got a zero on the scorecard for not providing “Transgender-Inclusive Healthcare Benefits” for transgender employees. However, the city did establish a LGBTQ liaison program in 2018 in the police department.
Overall, the city wound up getting a score of 95 out of 100 on the report.  Littmann said the fact that the annual Pride Parade — which is coming up this Saturday — is the city’s biggest parade is evidence of its acceptance of the LGBTQ+ community.
Another question asked which position the candidates “would not be willing to compromise” to support LGBTQ+ residents against a federal executive order. One of the first orders President Donald Trump (R) issued on Jan. 20, the first day of second term in office, limited federal policy to two sexes, male and female, as a step toward doing away with “gender ideology extremism.”
“Executive orders that violate those [city] laws will be challenged in court,” Littmann said. “My job as mayor is to protect Annapolitans to enforce the laws that exist. Executive orders that violate those laws are not lawful orders.”
O’Shea said the laws coming from the federal government are hard to interpret, but “are laws that have to be abided by.”
“So what do we need to do? We need to enlighten them [residents] to make them understand is what you’re talking about correct,” he said.
“I will totally support the citizens and the residents of Annapolis, and I will do everything I can to make it so the people that are here know what the laws are and that we can figure out ways to help them,” O’Shea said.

(Danielle Prokop / Source NM)In the wake of recent bomb threats against New Mexico lawmakers, two Democratic state legislators asked state ethics officials to weigh in on whether lawmakers and political candidates are allowed to use campaign funds for “security expenses.”
The short answer, according to the New Mexico Ethics Commission, is yes. In an advisory opinion released Tuesday, the agency said candidates seeking public office can use campaign funds on security and, once elected, state legislators can as well, as long as in both cases the expenses were incurred as a direct result of campaign activity or holding public office.
New Mexico state Sen. Heather Berghmans (Albuquerque) and House Majority Leader Reena Szczepanski of Santa Fe—the latter one of the targets of the recent bomb threats—sought the opinion jointly.
“We wanted the extra clarification to know that if a legislator does feel the need to enhance security for their own houses or their personal situations, or if we need security at any events we’re holding, that we have the funds to pay for that type of enhancement in today’s political climate,” Berghmans told Source NM in a phone interview.
Szczepanski, who did not return messages to Source, was unavailable Tuesday to speak about the opinion, according to a spokesperson for New Mexico House Democrats.
The nine-page State Ethics Commission opinion rests on an analysis that began by considering state campaign laws and Secretary of State’s campaign regulations “to determine whether certain expenditures are expressly permitted or prohibited,” a statement provided to Source by the agency notes.
“Here, as with other expenditures the Commission has considered, ‘security expenses’ are not identified specifically as either. The Commission determined therefore that a candidate or legislator is not prohibited from using campaign funds for security expenses in the circumstances where the expenses are reasonably attributable to a campaign or, for legislators, to the performance of legislative duties, provided that the candidate or legislator would not have otherwise incurred the same security expenses even in the absence of the campaign or legislative office.”
The statement notes that the Commission also considered “comparable federal provisions that distinguish between legitimate campaign or legislative expenses and personal use” in its analysis.
As such, the opinion concludes that under those criteria, candidates and state lawmakers can use campaign funds for security purposes—ranging from hardware such as alarm systems to cybersecurity software to professional security personnel.
If candidates or lawmakers already have a security system in place prior to the campaign or holding office, paying for those with campaign funds would not be allowed, according to the opinion.
The opinion only applies to candidates and elected state legislators and not other public officials, which follows the same criteria as the state Campaign Reporting Act, which permits the use of campaign funds for “expenditures of the campaign” and “expenditures of legislators that are reasonably related to performing the duties of the office held.” The opinion notes that “this distinction is a policy decision made by the Legislature and arises perhaps because legislators receive no compensation beyond per diem and mileage whereas other public officeholders receive salaries.”
Berghmans said the inquiry about whether security costs were permissible was driven in part by recent threats against Szczepanski and Senate Majority Leader Peter Wirth of Santa Fe, both of whom received emailed bomb threats on Sept. 11. While no explosives were found, the threats remain under investigation by local and national authorities.
The bomb threats, two of which came from an email account called “maga_terrorist,” followed a spate of political violence this year, including the shooting of conservative activist Charlie Kirk and the assassination Melissa Hortman, a Minnesota Democratic lawmaker, and her husband.
Berghmans said that despite recent political violence, she believes New Mexico’s senators cultivate an atmosphere of “disagreeing without being super disagreeable,” pointing to recent bipartisan efforts to diffuse tension during the October two-day special session.
“I have never felt afraid to be running for public office or to be serving in it, but I know that’s changing for people, which is really unfortunate, in the United States,” Berghmans said. “Every step we can take additionally to make sure people feel safe and supported is what’s important.”
The Vote Mama Lobby, a national political action committee seeking to put more Democratic women with children into office, noted New Mexico is the 15th state to approve using campaign funds for security expenses. The PAC has previously endorsed both Berghmans and Szczepanski.
Vote Mama Lobby officials celebrated the opinion, calling it a “bipartisan acknowledgement of rising threats against public officials,” in a statement.
“Political violence is a direct threat to our democracy, and campaign funds for security is an important tool to counteract this growing problem. No one should ever have to choose between their safety and running for office,” CEO Liuba Grechen Shirley said in a statement.

(Photo by Michael Achterling/North Dakota Monitor)Some foods such as soda and candy may soon be prohibited purchases in North Dakota through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, officials said Tuesday.
The North Dakota Department of Health and Human Services plans to seek permission from the federal government to prohibit certain foods from being purchased with SNAP benefits. The proposal was mentioned Tuesday to a legislative committee but details are still being developed.
The move is part of an effort to secure more federal funding through the $50 billion Rural Health Transformation Program. While states are guaranteed at least $500 million from the program, they can get more money if they enact certain policies the federal government favors.
States with pending or approved SNAP waivers that limit non-nutritious food purchases will be considered more competitive applicants, Sarah Aker, executive director of medical services for the North Dakota Department of Health and Human Services, told lawmakers. 
The agency plans to apply for the waiver from the U.S. Department of Agriculture ahead of the Nov. 5 application deadline for the rural health funding.
“We’re working out the definitions so that the retail community can have a smooth transition, but we’re eliminating things that cause chronic disease, so candy and soda,” said Pat Traynor, interim Health and Human Services commissioner.
North Dakota legislative leaders expect special session for federal rural health care dollars

Traynor said the earliest the changes could affect North Dakota SNAP recipients is next year, and the new changes would take months to implement.
North Dakota had about 57,000 SNAP recipients in May, according to USDA data.
At least 12 states have received federal approval to restrict SNAP recipients from using their benefits to buy foods such as soda and candy, Stateline reported. Some states have restricted only soda, while others have included energy drinks, prepared desserts and other sugary drinks. The trend is related to U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s push to “make America healthy again.”
Sen. Jeff Magrum, R-Hazelton, remarked during Tuesday’s legislative committee meeting that the government’s definition of what food is and isn’t healthy seems to differ over time.
“What if they ever classified beef as non-nutritious, or something to that effect?” he asked. “When they base the money on non-nutritious, that’s kind of a moving target.”
Aker said the state has control over how it defines non-nutritious food under the waiver.
A dozen states win approval to restrict soda, candy for SNAP recipients

Emily O’Brien, deputy commissioner for Health and Human Services, said the department is still working out which soda and candy products will be included in the waiver.
“We’re fine-tuning what the definitions look like,” O’Brien said. “We want to have buy-in, too, from our partners on implementation.”
John Dyste, president of the North Dakota Grocers Association, said he’s been in contact with state officials about the SNAP waiver and plans to meet with the department.
Dyste said he does not think prohibiting candy and soda from SNAP purchases would be difficult for grocery stores to implement, though may be more challenging for smaller stores without a point-of-sale system.
Senate Minority Leader Kathy Hogan, D-Fargo, said eliminating soda and candy from the SNAP program is a “fine idea,” and hoped it would give North Dakota’s application for the Rural Health Transformation Program a boost.
She also said she wants to be certain the state’s rural grocery stores are able to make the changes effectively without burdening their businesses.
“If the points of sale all have to be changed and it’s going to change the operations of the benefits, then they’ll get pushback for doing it,” Hogan said.

(Micah Drew/Daily Montanan)Attorney General Austin Knudsen has approved a second ballot initiative seeking to enshrine nonpartisan judicial elections into the Montana Constitution but has rewritten the language of the initiative, despite a lawsuit challenging a similar rewrite just weeks ago. 
Montanans for Nonpartisan Courts is one of two committees bringing ballot initiatives forward for the 2026 election related to judicial elections, submitting two propositions to voters. 
Both groups seek to keep judicial races in the state nonpartisan, as they have been required by state law since 1935. During the 2025 Legislature, Republican lawmakers made multiple attempts to make the state’s judicial elections into a partisan affair, saying they believe courts are already politicized and they want judges to disclose any affiliations. However, those attempts saw bipartisan opposition on nearly every proposed bill, except one allowing political parties to donate to judicial campaigns. 
Two initiatives, CI-132, by Montanans for Nonpartisan Courts, and CI-131, brought by Montanans for Fair and Impartial Judges, are close to identical, but MFIJ’s applies to district and state supreme court judges, while the MNC initiative broadly applies to all judicial races in the state, including future courts. 
When MFIJ’s initiative was approved by the Attorney General’s office in late September, it was also rewritten. 
The two groups filed a joint lawsuit with the Montana Supreme Court alleging that the rewritten statement is “misleading and prejudicial” and violates Montana statute.
Last week, Knudsen approved MNC’s petition as legally sufficient, but also rewrote the initiative to include the same language challenged in the lawsuit.  
“The Attorney General rewrote a simple, straightforward ballot statement simply because he doesn’t like the policy, attempting to prevent Montanans from having a fair chance to weigh in on how they want their judges elected,” Caitie Butler, spokesperson for Montanans for Nonpartisan Courts, said when the first lawsuit was filed. “The rewritten statement is deceptive and misleading to voters and a dangerous precedent to set for the ballot measure process in Montana.”
Butler told the Daily Montanan the same sentiment applies here, as the altered initiatives contain the same language. 
Representatives from Knudsen’s office did not respond to questions about the rewritten ballot initiatives on Tuesday. 
The original ballot statement submitted by Montanans for Nonpartisan Courts states the following: 
“(The initiative) amends the Montana constitution to require that judicial elections remain nonpartisan.”
The rewrite changes the wording and adds the following: 
“(The initiative…) amends Article VII of the Montana Constitution to create a new Section 12 that mandates all judicial elections be nonpartisan. A nonpartisan election prohibits labeling candidates on the ballot according to the political party the candidate aligns with including labels like Independent.”
The line explaining a nonpartisan election was also inserted into CI-131, from the Fair and Impartial Judges committee. 
“We felt that they flipped the language on its head,” Butler said. “Whereas our initiative exists to protect the status quo, the current state of nonpartisanship, which we feel is the most transparent and right way to run an election, the new language is making it seem like the initiative exists to conceal bias, which is not our intent.”
In the lawsuit, attorneys for both committees said that Knudsen’s office is intentionally meddling with the wording in order to create confusion among voters. 
“The rewritten statement prejudicially and falsely tells voters to presume that judicial candidates are partisan actors aligned with a political party, and that voting for the initiative will have the effect of concealing this information,” the lawsuit said. “This is exactly the kind of argument — not description — that belongs in the ‘opponent arguments’ section of the Voter Information Pamphlet, not the ballot statement itself.”
The second initiative submitted by MNC, would require that judicial elections in Montana remain nonpartisan and includes additional language to extend that requirement to new courts created by the legislature. However, this proposal did not pass muster by Knudsen and was denied as legally insufficient last week. 
Butler said that Montanans for Nonpartisan Courts will file lawsuits with the Supreme Court in both cases, challenging the ballot rewrite of CI-132, and the attorney general’s finding of legal insufficiency on the other proposed initiative.
Butler said there is a precedent for the latter suit. 
Knudsen’s decision was based on a rule that ballot initiatives must involve a “single subject,” but Butler said extending a nonpartisan requirement in judicial elections to future courts falls within the single subject bounds. 
“We’re confident both of our initiatives are constitutionally sound,” Butler said.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Old_Supco2-1024x717.jpg,,,2025-10-14 19:57:58.883072

(Illustration by Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — The chairman and vice chairman of the Kansas Young Republicans took part in encrypted chats with political peers laced with violent, racist and antisemitic rhetoric and blended with references to white supremacy and suppression of the Jeffrey Epstein files.
On Tuesday, the chairman of the Kansas Republican Party said the Politico article disclosing the commentary prompted immediate deactivation of the Kansas Young Republicans organization.
Politico, a digital news company specializing in coverage of U.S. politics, reported Kansas Young Republicans chair Alex Dwyer and vice chair William Hendrix took part in the Telegram group chat.
In 2,900 pages of chat text, Hendrix praised the Missouri Young Republicans because leaders in that state didn’t like LGBTQ+ people. He repeatedly used racial slurs to refer to Black people, including words such as “n–ga” and “n–guh.” In a July conversation in the thread about African-Americans, he said, “Bro is at a chicken restaurant ordering his food. Would he like some watermelon and Kool-Aid with that?”
He was fired from a communications job in the office of Attorney General Kris Kobach as Politico prepared its report on Hendrix’s role in the chat.
“The comments in the chat are inexcusable,” Kobach said. “As soon as the office learned of those messages, Will Hendrix’s employment was terminated.”
In the chat threads, Dwyer and others delved into discussions of how GOP operatives could tarnish a political candidate by linking the individual to white supremacists. The idea was dismissed, Politico said, because the plan could backfire in a place such as Kansas where “Young Republicans could end up becoming attracted to that opponent.” Subsequently, a person in the chat asked others to guess what room number they had a hotel.
Dwyer responded: “1488.” That figure is a form of shorthand among white supremacists when making reference to their beliefs. It refers to the 14 words of text in the slogan, “We must secure the existence of our people and a future for white children.” The “88” stands for “Heil Hitler,” with the H marking the eighth letter of the alphabet.
At another juncture, Dwyer touched on controversy involving release of government files on Epstein, the convicted sex offender. Republicans and Democrats in Congress have sought public release of files to either exonerate or incriminate President Donald Trump or other prominent individuals.
“Trumps too busy burning the Epstein files,” Dwyer wrote on Telegram.
Before Politico’s disclosure of the Young Republicans’ commentary, Dwyer and Hendrix were photographed at a campaign event with Senate President Ty Masterson, the Andover Republican who is a 2026 candidate for governor. A social media post of the picture, taken at Masterson’s campaign announcement event, shows both of them holding signs touting Masterson’s campaign for governor.

Politico reports Dwyer and Hendrix took part in a private Telegram chat with other state GOP leaders touting racist, violent and antisemitic ideas such as “I love Hitler” and “They love the watermelon people.” (Submitted)
The Masterson campaign released a statement after the Senate president landed in Washington, D.C., for meetings Wednesday with White House officials. In that statement, Masterson blamed political opponents for “shopping around a photo, with deceitful intentions, in efforts to disparage” him.
“I categorically deny any association with William Hendrix or Alex Dwyer, as neither is current, nor has ever been, on staff or volunteered for my campaign for governor,” Masterson said. “Anyone suggesting otherwise is either lying or misinformed.”
In addition, Masterson said, he was guided by deep Christian faith and possessed a record of condemning hateful and violent rhetoric.
“I am personally disgusted by the comments attributed to individuals in the article, as such behavior is utterly counter to Christ’s message that life is valuable and we are all equal in God’s eyes, and my unwavering commitment to these values has not changed,” the statement said.
A collection of Kansas Republicans and a Democratic candidate for governor denounced contents of this trove of Telegram messages logged under “RESTOREYR WAR ROOM,” or Restore Young Republicans.
The communications chronicled by Politico covered a period between January and August, and involved state Republican leaders in Kansas, Vermont, Arizona and New York. Included in the thousands of comments was this insight: “If we ever had a leak on this chat, we will be cooked.”
“The viewpoints expressed in this chat are not representative of Kansans. Period,” said former Kansas Gov. Jeff Colyer, who is seeking the GOP nomination for governor. “Our state was founded on the belief that all of us are created equal under God — and anyone who mocks those principles dishonors the very spirit of Kansas.”
Vicki Schmidt, the state’s insurance commissioner and a Republican candidate for governor, said Dwyer and Hendrix should formally resign from their Young Republicans positions because “their actions are disgusting and disgraceful and they tarnish the reputation of Kansas nationally.”
Sen. Cindy Holscher, a Johnson County Democrat also running for governor, said she was disgusted by messages shared by Kansas GOP political operatives that promoted overt racism, extremism, antisemitism and sexual violence. She said the extremist language was encouraged from the top down by politicians who seek to divide voters rather than bring them together.
“Let’s be clear: These aren’t kids joking around,” Holscher said. “These are 20- and 30-something adults with leadership roles in the Republican Party. The chair of the Kansas Young Republicans, who participated in these messages, is nearly 30 years old. Unfortunately, this type of rhetoric is not isolated. For too long in Kansas, the Republican Party has been dominated by extremists who see no room for moderation or bipartisanship, let alone unity or mutual respect.”
Danedri Herbert, chair of the Kansas Republican Party, said the organization’s leadership was disgusted by comments by young Kansas Republicans contained in the Politico story. In March, Herbert was elected state party chair. She is Black.
“Their comments do not reflect the beliefs of Republicans and certainly not of Kansas Republicans at large,” she said. “Republicans believe that all people are created in the image of God.”
She said the state party platform stated: “We welcome Kansans of every ethnicity into our party as we work together to preserve our heritage of political equality, religious freedom and strong moral values. We strive to eliminate racism and we condemn all racist acts and groups.”
Michael Austin, chief executive of the Kansas Black Republican Council, said the organization unequivocally rebuked the behavior and language revealed in Politico’s report.
“Such conduct is not merely offensive. It is a betrayal of the very principles upon which our party was founded: the defense of liberty, the abolition of slavery and the belief in the inherent worth and dignity of every human being,” Austin said. “Let there be no confusion. These few individuals do not represent Kansas, nor do they reflect the values of Kansas Republicans.”
He said all Republicans should in this moment “uphold the standard of integrity, moral courage and respect that has long defined our party’s proud history.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/PA140850-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-10-14 19:57:58.883072

(Photo via Getty Images)An Iowa State University professor’s research, born from tragedies witnessed during Hurricane Katrina, has opened up possibilities as to how the mind captures and stores memories of trauma, especially at a young age.
Carl Weems, an ISU professor of human development and family studies, has published a report detailing a new developmental theory relating to traumatic childhood memories. It states that just because someone’s reporting on a traumatic event might change over time, it doesn’t mean the memories themselves are false.
“I think the model kind of opens up our point of view to really try to dig at it,” Weems said.

Studying tragedy and trauma
Weems has spent his career studying emotional development, traumatic stress and the relationship between the two. He said what brought him to the topic of memory and the supposed liabilities that come with it was a natural disaster he and thousands of other New Orleans residents faced in 2005 — Hurricane Katrina.
The researcher said he spoke with kids more than a year after the hurricane swept through about what they went through and any symptoms of post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Their responses matched up fairly well with ones given in follow-up interviews six months later. However, when he spoke with those same kids after Hurricane Gustav hit the city in 2008, Weems found that their PTSD symptoms had actually decreased after the second hurricane came through.
“The most surprising thing happened, because I thought the prevailing thing is, if you have multiple bad things happen to you, you get worse, right? But we found that for the sample, their PTSD symptoms went down,” Weems said. “I was dumbfounded for almost a year trying to figure out how to explain this.”

What he found was that participants who had “relatively good” experiences with Gustav reported less negatively about what they went through during Katrina, and those who had a harder time with the second hurricane were more steady in their reports of the first.
Another study was also an influence on his work, Weems said. That research showed that more than 100 out of around 600 people who had experienced “court-identified maltreatment” around the age of 6 did not report having such experiences as adults around the age of 29 when asked.
Bringing together the main ideas from his own and others’ research, Weems said his paper is a “meta review” of these interesting findings that presents a theory of how they could occur.
The continuum of memory
The “prevailing notion” of traumatic memories assumes that if something traumatic happened to someone when they were young, such as sexual abuse, they will either remember it or not. Weems said that is a more black-and-white theory than the one he proposed in his paper.
Weems’s theory maintains that while there can be a simple yes-or-no answer to whether someone has experienced a traumatic event, the memories and perception of that event can exist on a continuum, with multiple factors able to impact it.
How much time has passed since the initial report, other events occurring between the two reports, and how strong the memory was at the time it was first reported can all change how someone perceives their memories of trauma, the report stated. These different factors can lead to some people reporting consistently, others first reporting trauma then later perceiving the event as not traumatic, or reporting trauma then not remembering it at all. Someone could also initially report not having experienced trauma, but report trauma later on.
Weems said he tries to lay out in the paper the possibility of someone recovering a memory after a long time, as the current thought is that if something like sexual abuse happened to someone, “you’re not just going to forget that and then suddenly remember it 20 years later.”
In addition to opening up possibilities for how memory can operate, Weems said there is also an important message in the paper to the professionals who work with traumatized individuals to follow up on the questions they asked when first assessing a client and to not just focus on the symptoms.
“It’s something that evolves over time, and depending on the context, someone might reveal an important — clinically important or therapeutically important — piece of information, depending on when you ask them,” Weems said. “It’s something that if you’re going to ask people about because you’re wanting to help those kinds of people, then you shouldn’t just assess them once.”

He said the Trump administration’s many legal assaults on immigrants have led to widespread fear. (Patrick Lohmann/Source NM)
Over the last few months, Albuquerque-based immigration attorney Mark Moreno has seen the impact of President Donald Trump administration’s immigration crackdown up close: 
Two of his clients deported themselves to Chile after 23 years in America. Two others from Venezuela no longer take their child to school. The rest of his 100 or so clients constantly ask him whether they should continue to show up to immigration appointments or go out in public. 
“Interrupting a child’s education because of all of the increased immigration enforcement —it’s inhumane,” he said during a recent interview at his Albuquerque office.  “It’s a sad thing that we’re seeing, that people are just afraid.”
In the last 10 months, he said, Trump’s mass deportation push has greatly disrupted the course of daily life. For example, seemingly minor federal immigration form changes caused cascading impacts on clients’ cases; the federal Homeland Security agency rendered long-standing protections for young people void; and Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents are detaining and deporting immigrants after their cases are dismissed.
Immigrant advocates: NM ICE detention ban should have been on special session agenda

All that change represents a paradigm shift, Moreno said, one that underscores the state’s need to take action at the upcoming legislative session.
 Namely, he called on lawmakers to pass laws banning immigrant detention here and requiring local law enforcement to review U Visa applications from immigrants who are victims of or witness to crime. 
The new landscape also coincides with a new name last month for Moreno’s employer, previously known as the Santa Fe Dreamers Project and now doing business as Contigo Immigrant Justice. 
Moreno told Source New Mexico in a recent interview that the name change better reflects the group’s mission, which is no longer confined to Santa Fe or advocacy for Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, known as “Dreamers.”
“I feel like as an organization, we completely outgrew that, because we have clients in Texas, clients in Oklahoma,” he said. “I think the mission has pretty much remained the same: It’s providing care for our immigrant community and just helping them with any form of legal status that they can obtain.”
Changes to laws for younger immigrants have hit particularly hard, he said. Before Trump’s second term, people aged 21 and younger could expect deferred deportation action as a court evaluated their claims of abuse and neglect to receive Special Immigrant Juvenile status.
These days, some of his clients who allege abuse or neglect by one or both parents no longer receive deferred deportation so their cases are being considered at the same time that the federal government is initiating deportation proceedings against them, he said. 
“There’s this misconception that ICE enforcement is basically going after people who have committed crimes,” he said. “People aren’t really seeing that they’re not just targeting people who have committed crimes. They’re going after children as young as, you name it, whatever age, and the impact that it’s having on people, like, we don’t know.”
The federal chaos is all the more reason why the group is pressuring New Mexico state lawmakers to fight back.

The upcoming legislative session
Miles Tokunow, the group’s executive director, told Source, that he is trying to build support for the upcoming 30-day session for bills that could counteract the federal uncertainty.
He said he was disappointed lawmakers didn’t include a ban on immigration detention on the agenda for the special session. He will urge lawmakers come January to pass the bill, which would prohibit counties or other local governments from contracting with ICE to hold detainees here. Three ICE detention centers exist in the state. 
And he said he is organizing support for a bill like  Senate Bill 177 for the upcoming 30-day session 
That bill, sponsored by Sen. Antoinette Sedillo Lopez (D-Albuquerque), would require state law enforcement agencies to act on applications for U Visas, which provide deportation protection to crime victims and witnesses who provide material support to prosecutors. 
Currently, if local law enforcement officials certify through specific forms an immigrant has been helpful to law enforcement or government officials in investigating or prosecuting a crime, the immigrant can receive a U Visa that provides some deportation protections while they help prosecutors. But no state law exists to require local law enforcement to act on those applications, and there is no standardized way they are supposed to evaluate applications, Tokunow said.
Emails provide new details on how NM lawmakers’ ICE lockup visit went off the rails

A bill like SB177 would create a “standard operating procedure for local law enforcement to be able to follow to make sure that survivors of violent crimes, who come to law enforcement agencies for support, that they do get the certifying part of being able to qualify for a U Visa,” Tokunow said. 
The bill only passed a single Senate committee during the legislative session earlier this year. 
Moreno said, as recently as last month, Santa Fe police refused to act on a U Visa application he submitted on a client’s behalf. He sought a meeting with officials and never heard back, he said, until a week later:
“I got a letter in the mail from the police department, basically saying, ‘Hey, we saw this. We’re not signing. Have a great day,’ he said. “And that’s basically all that we can do at this moment, because it’s discretionary as to whether they sign or not.”
Santa Fe Police Chief Paul Joye did not respond to Source’s request for more information Tuesday about the case. Moreno declined to say much about it, too, on behalf of his client, though he did say the client was a crime victim and that he attached a police report that should have made the case cut and dry. 
Tokunow said cases like Moreno’s client show why standards are needed across New Mexico. 
“I know that public safety is a really big issue right now, and this is really one of the ways that we can support an agenda towards a safer community,” he said. “If there’s a large swath of folks who feel like they can’t go to law enforcement, that’s a big problem, right?”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_1000-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-14 18:57:31.436809

(Photo: Wes Muller/Louisiana Illuminator)Louisiana has launched an online portal for businesses that generate waste tires and collect fees for the state to recycle them.
Auto dealers, tire shops and others who sell cars or tires can now submit their monthly reports and fee payments through a secure digital portal on the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality website, according to a news release the agency released Tuesday.
Whenever someone buys new tires or a new vehicle with tires, a charge is added in the form of a waste tire cleanup and recycling fee. The fee ranges from $2.25 per tire for standard sized wheels on passenger vehicles and pickup trucks, $5 for medium truck tires and $10 for off-road tires.  All tire dealers and new car dealers in Louisiana are required by law to collect the fees from their customers at the point of sale and then forward them to the state Treasury at the end of every month. 
Using the portal carries its own convenience fee of $2.50 per payment, and credit card transactions carry an additional 2.5% fee. 
LDEQ officials said the portal saw strong participation in September, its first full month in use. Of 2,060 notices successfully sent to waste tire generators, 483 users submitted their reports through the portal, the agency said.
“The response from users in the first month has been extremely positive,” LDEQ Undersecretary Theresa Delafosse said in the release. “This system is secure, efficient and user-friendly — exactly the kind of innovation that helps both our stakeholders and our staff work smarter.” 
For fiscal year 2024-25, the state collected $13.3 million in waste tire fees. The state uses the money to recycle used tires, an effort that poses technological and environmental challenges because of the complex designs of modern tires with layers of rubber, plastic, fabric and metal. Shredding tires releases chemicals and microplastics that are harmful to the environment and pose health risks to humans, according to LDEQ. Additionally, the presence of steel belts in tires complicates the recycling process, requiring specialized equipment to separate the layers. 
Earlier this year, LDEQ began offering $20,000 grants to local governments to help with tire recycling and tackling the widespread problem of illegal tire dumping. In September, the pilot program awarded the grants to six local governments: the parishes of Iberville, Lafourche, Ouachita and Terrebonne and the cities of Gretna and West Monroe.

The judge overseeing that case scheduled a Wednesday hearing to listen to arguments before deciding whether to grant a temporary restraining order. Back pay in questionThe Trump administration has made several moves during the shutdown that are not typically taken during prolonged funding lapses.Trump and Office of Management and Budget Director Russ Vought have indicated they may not provide back pay to furloughed federal workers after the shutdown ends, which is required by a 2019 law. And they have sought to cancel funding approved by Congress for projects in sections of the country that vote for Democrats. The Pentagon is also reprogramming money to provide pay for active duty military members this week, despite Congress not taking action on that issue.The Trump administration’s efforts to reduce the size of government during the shutdown are widely seen as an effort to pressure Democrats to vote for the stopgap spending bill, but they haven’t had any measurable effect so far. Another failed Senate voteThe Senate deadlocked for an eighth time Tuesday evening on the House-passed funding bill that would last through Nov. 21. The vote was 49-45. The bill needs at least 60 senators to advance under the chamber’s rules. Nevada Democratic Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto and Maine independent Sen. Angus King voted with Republicans to advance their bill. Pennsylvania Democratic Sen. John Fetterman, who has been voting to advance the bill, didn’t vote. Kentucky GOP Sen.

It shouldn’t even be an argument. They’ve signed it many times before.”No strategyDuring a morning press conference, House Speaker Mike Johnson said he would not change his approach or negotiate with Democrats on a stopgap measure. “I don’t have any strategy,” the Louisiana Republican said. “The strategy is to do the right and obvious thing and keep the government moving for the people.”Johnson has kept the House out of session since late September but has been holding daily press conferences with members of his leadership team to criticize Democrats and press them to advance the short-term funding bill. GOP Rep. Virginia Foxx of North Carolina, the chairwoman of the House Rules Committee, said starting Tuesday an additional 400,000 civilian federal workers would receive partial paychecks due to the government shutdown. Those federal employees work at the departments of Education and Interior, as well as the National Science Foundation. “This will be the last paycheck that these federal workers receive until Democrats grow a spine and reopen the federal government,” she said. Last week, 700,000 civilian federal workers received about 70% of their usual paycheck, due to the shutdown. Those employees work for the Executive Office of the President, Health and Human Services, Department of Veterans Affairs, civilians at the Defense Department, NASA, General Services Administration and the Office of Personnel Management, among others.Active duty military members were set to miss their first paycheck Wednesday until the Pentagon shifted $8 billion in research funds to pay the troops on time. U.S. Capitol Police Labor Committee Chairman Gus Papathanasiou released a statement Tuesday that the thousands of officers who protect members of Congress missed a full paycheck Friday. “The longer the shutdown drags on, the harder it becomes for my officers,” Papathanasiou wrote. “Banks and landlords do not give my officers a pass because we are in a shutdown — they still expect to be paid. “Unfortunately, Congress and the Administration are not in active negotiations, and everyone is waiting for the other side to blink.

(Courtesy of Cathy Brechtelsbauer)Protesters put 4,321 paper dolls on display Tuesday at the South Dakota Capitol in Pierre, representing the number of children affected by the state’s funding reduction for a program benefiting low-income families.
Beth Davis, one of 264 people who helped decorate the paper dolls, put herself through college in the 1980s as a young, single mother raising her daughter with the help of Aid for Dependent Children, a precursor to Temporary Assistance for Needy Families. She completed her degree and led a statewide nonprofit, Dakota Resources, for years.
“I was a good investment, and most of the women who are taking care of these kids and doing the best they can are a good investment,” Davis said.
The Department of Social Services reduced TANF benefits by 10% during the summer, affecting families’ September benefits and beyond. Recipients were expected to lose anywhere from $32 to $136 a month in benefits, depending on the size of their family. The average household was expected to lose $51 a month. The department has not yet released a monthly TANF data report since the benefit reduction took effect.
The state will save about $1.5 million annually. It distributed $15.3 million in TANF benefits last fiscal year.

The move is part of a larger plan to gradually reduce benefits each year to the minimum state contribution needed to receive federal funding. That’s about a 35% reduction, or $180 less per month for the average household, according to department officials. The average household’s monthly benefit payment last year was $518.06.
TANF is a federal-state program most commonly used to provide financial assistance to low-income families with children, on the condition that the caregiver searches or trains for a job. 
The protest group got permission from the Bureau of Human Resources and Administration to place the paper doll display around part of the Capitol building. Some paper dolls were decorated with Halloween costumes — like tigers or mummies — while others wore NFL team shirts, colored by children and adults.
Organizer Cathy Brechtelsbauer wants lawmakers to reinstate the funding and set a cost of living adjustment going forward. The display caught the attention of out-of-state visitors to the building, but Brechtelsbauer said she doesn’t know if it caught Republican Gov. Larry Rhoden’s attention. 
“We’re hoping the governor’s response will be, ‘That shouldn’t have happened. I’ll make sure these kids get the assistance for their basic needs they deserve and need,’” Brechtelsbauer said.
Rhoden was at a rural health care conference Tuesday in Sioux Falls. He told the media that the cuts are “sacrifices” caused in part by federal cuts to address the country’s “deficit problem.”
“We’re being as vigilant as we can at making these cuts, as appropriate as possible, and we’re always open to input as far as how we can do better,” Rhoden said. “But this is the hand we’re dealt and we’re doing the best we can to make sure that we’re acting in the most appropriate way, making the most appropriate cuts.”

While some federal funding for the state is being reduced, Sioux Falls Democratic Rep. Erik Muckey said the TANF cuts made by Rhoden’s administration “had nothing to do with the feds.” The One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which made cuts to programs such as Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, did not impact TANF.
“The decision made by the Department of Social Services went against the will of the Legislature with what we budgeted,” Muckey said.
Muckey tried unsuccessfully to persuade lawmakers on the legislative Rules Review Committee to reject the cuts. Muckey said he and other legislators on the budget committee believed a $5.3 million state funding cut would be replaced with unspent TANF funds from previous years. 
Davis, who helped color the paper dolls but wasn’t able to attend the event on Tuesday, said that although there might be cuts to address state budget needs — due to federal changes or tight revenues — the state should find that money in other places rather than taking it away from low-income families.
“If the state Legislature can’t figure out another place, then we’re in deep trouble,” Davis said. “We don’t balance a budget on the backs of poor women and children.”
The display was up for Tuesday only, but Brechtelsbauer said a few paper dolls were left at the Capitol for Rhoden.

Pieciak, a Democrat, is widely rumored to be mulling a bid for governor, though was mum on his future plans Tuesday.

Becca Balint.","Vermont State Treasurer Mike Pieciak chats before a groundbreaking ceremony marking the beginning of construction of 40 affordable apartments at the Cambrian Way housing complex in Burlington on Thursday, Aug. 7. Photo by Glenn Russell/VTDigger
Vermont’s Democratic state treasurer, Mike Pieciak, announced Tuesday he was hiring a top staffer from U.S. Rep. Becca Balint, D-Vt., to serve as the treasurer’s office’s No. 2. It’s the third hire with ties to Balint that Pieciak has made since the start of the last election cycle — and comes as he is widely rumored to be mulling a run for governor.
David Scherr, who has served as Balint’s state director, will take a new job as deputy state treasurer on Nov. 3, according to a press release from Pieciak’s office. Gavin Boyles, the previous deputy treasurer, has already stepped down from the role.
Scherr has served as Balint’s state director since Balint first won office in 2022. In the role, he leads the congressional office’s outreach and constituent services. Before that, he served as general counsel for the state Cannabis Control Board and worked in the Vermont Attorney General’s Office. He also ran twice, unsuccessfully, for state Senate.
The other former Balint staffers have been with Pieciak since at least last year. 
Peter Trombley, who worked on Balint’s 2022 campaign and in her office in 2023, later ran Pieciak’s 2024 campaign and is now a “special advisor” to the treasurer.
Meanwhile, Pieciak has been working with Natalie Silver — one of the state’s best known Democratic strategists and Balint’s 2022 campaign manager — since 2023, he said in an interview Tuesday. Silver took on a more formal role as Pieciak’s political adviser, overseeing his campaign work, following his 2024 win, the treasurer said. 
Pieciak said Scherr’s hiring was not related to his future plans for office. He declined to say Tuesday whether he would seek the treasurer’s job, or a different office, in 2026.
“He’s just a really strong leader, really strong strategic advisor. I think he is the person that can best serve our office,” the treasurer said, adding that by hiring Scherr, he is “just focused on, how do we build a good team and serve Vermonters the best?”
“Right now, that’s my focus — on the treasurer’s office and the work that we’re doing as an elected leader to stand up against this administration,” Pieciak said, referring to President Donald Trump.
Republican Gov. Phil Scott has not said publicly, either, whether he will seek another term in office in 2026. Scott has made a habit in years past of not announcing his reelection plans until the state Legislature adjourns for the summer — typically in May — during an election year, so any such announcement is likely months away.
At the same time, Vermont Attorney General Charity Clark said in August that she plans to run in next year’s election, though has “not officially decided what office I’m running for.” She declined to say at the time which offices she was considering. 
Vermont’s other statewide Democratic leaders — Secretary of State Sarah Copeland Hanzas and Auditor Doug Hoffer — have said they aren’t seeking higher office next year, as has Republican Lt. Gov. John Rodgers, who plans to run for his post again.
Both Pieciak and Clark are sitting on substantial campaign cash, according to their latest filings with the state, which detail fundraising and spending through the end of June. Pieciak had about $184,000 on hand, the filings show, while Clark had about $98,000. Copeland Hanzas, by comparison, had about $12,000 on hand as of late June.
As attorney general, Clark has filed more than two dozen lawsuits, together with other states, against the Trump administration since the start of his second term. She has perhaps a more natural avenue, in the courts, to push back against many of Trump’s actions — but Pieciak, for his part, has made public pushes against Trump, too. The president remains deeply unpopular in Vermont, with 72% of respondents to a University of New Hampshire poll in August saying they disapprove of his handling of the job. 
Earlier this month, Pieciak joined his counterparts in five other states challenging the inclusion of Trump’s media company in a major stock index. He also pointed Tuesday to how, earlier this year, he helped start a legal defense fund — outside of his official capacity — for noncitizen Vermonters targeted for removal proceedings by federal immigration authorities.Meanwhile, the treasurer has also taken aim at Trump in recent campaign fundraising emails, branded with “Mike Pieciak” and “Treasurer” at the top. Last month, for instance, he used one message to decry the pressure the Trump administration put on ABC to temporarily kick the late night comedian Jimmy Kimmel off the airwaves. 
Since January, Gov. Scott has, broadly, urged state leaders to be less confrontational in what he’s said is an effort to protect Vermont’s existing federal funding and benefits. While Scott has rejected two requests from the White House to deploy Vermont’s national guard, he also faced sharp criticism — including from Pieciak — over a decision to share sensitive data with the Trump administration on thousands of people who receive federal nutritional benefits.
Pieciak seemed to take aim at the idea of a cautious approach in a campaign email last week, comparing leaders who have “given in” to pressure from Trump to those who haven’t. 
“People like Minnesota Governor Tim Walz — and even Vermont’s own, Senator Bernie Sanders — have modeled the kind of resistance we need in this moment. And what has happened to them? Nothing,” Pieciak wrote. “It’s clear: The only response right now to this administration is to fight back tooth and nail at every opportunity. There’s no other choice.”
“That’s the exact kind of leadership we need in Vermont right now,” he added. “If you’re with me, will you pitch in any amount to fuel my work?”

The latest victim is Cayus Stevens, who died as a result of wounds he suffered in Heidelberg, the third fatality from that shooting. Friends and community members on social media identified him as a graduate from the Heidelberg High School Class of 2018. 
A Friday shooting in the Delta city of Leland claimed the lives of six people in what is the deadliest mass shooting in the country this year. Shootings were also reported after a South Delta High School football game in Anguilla in Sharkey County on Friday and at two university homecomings on Saturday, resulting in one death at Alcorn State University. 
“This kind of senseless violence has no place in Heidelberg or anywhere in Mississippi,” Heidelberg Police Chief Cornell White said in a statement.
The other victims killed in the Heidelberg shooting were another graduate, Mikea McCray, 28, of Laurel, and Chris Newell, 35, of Laurel.
White extended his condolences to the families of the victims and asked the public to keep them in their thoughts and prayers. He also thanked a coordinated response and assistance from local and state law enforcement. 
Four have been arrested and charged in the Heidelberg shooting.
Tylar Goodloe, 18, is charged with two counts of capital murder and possession of a weapon on educational property. A judge set his bond at $2 million cash.  
The others arrested are Damarin Starks, 19, charged with accessory after the fact and tampering with physical evidence; Jadarius Quartez Page, 19, charged with accessory after the fact; and Jabari Deshaun Collins, 19, charged with possession of a deadly weapon on educational property.
White said the investigation continues and the police department will do everything in its power to receive justice for the victims and their families. 
This week, the FBI Jackson office announced five people are in custody and charged in the Leland shooting: Morgan Lattimore, 25, capital murder; Teviyon L. Powell, 29, capital murder; William Bryant, 29, capital murder; Terrogernal S. Martin, 33, capital murder; and Latoya A. Powell, 44, attempted murder. 
It was not immediately clear if those arrested have attorneys. An FBI spokesperson said additional arrests are pending. 
The suspects arrested Monday had first appearance hearings in Washington County, the justice court clerk’s office confirmed, but bond information was not immediately available. 
Martin’s bond was set at $1 million cash, the FBI confirmed, but a spokesperson did not immediately confirm in which court they appeared. 
The Washington County coroner identified the Leland victims as Oreshama Johnson, 41; Calvin Plant, 19; Shelbyona Powell, 25; Kaslyn Johnson, 18; Amos Brantley Jr., 18; and JaMichael Jones, 34.
Less than an hour away, another shooting happened Friday night outside a football game in Anguilla. In a statement, Sharkey County Sheriff Herbert Ceaser said one person was shot and taken to a local hospital. 
Ceaser said two people have been arrested in the shooting but did not identify them. The sheriff said violence will not be tolerated. 
“Our thoughts and prayers are with the victim’s family during this incredibly difficult time,” Ceasar said in the statement. “We ask the community to come together in support and remain positive as the investigation continues.”

(Photo courtesy Micah 6:8 Mission)SULPHUR – When Cindy Robertson bought her home in the Portie Town neighborhood, the first thing she did was put a box out front and stock it with free food for those in need. The box was the genesis of her organization Micah 6:8 Mission, a reference to a scriptural exhortation to “serve justice, love mercy, walk humbly.”
After Hurricane Laura, her mission expanded.
“We all talk about, ‘it was before the storm.’ We know what storm we’re talking about. It was for Southwest Louisiana what Katrina was for New Orleans. Fifty percent of our buildings or homes were either lost or damaged,” she explains. A blue tarp is still on her neighbor’s roof.
Robertson began working for the Episcopal Diocese of Western Louisiana as a disaster coordinator, which is how she connected to the newly formed Disaster Justice Network. DJN is a volunteer network formed in response to the overwhelming need for recovery after the string of storms that walloped Southwest Louisiana in 2020 and 2021, including Hurricane Laura.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
It began with grassroots weekly meetings of disaster response specialists, community organizers, faith leaders, researchers and academics working on recovery as a way to share resources and maximize impact.
They set up community water testing, air quality testing and small-house alternative housing, all after Laura.
“People who are in academia are beginning to realize that there’s a wealth of knowledge that is available from community organizers and community organizations and community members. We have knowledge, you know. We may be poor, but we’re not ignorant,” she says.
Her own ministry grew to include environmental justice, and used resources from the Disaster Justice Network to increase disaster recovery aid in the area.
She also began connecting to communities outside of metropolitan Lake Charles.
That’s how she met the Rev. James Harris of Evergreen Baptist Church in DeQuincy. Together, they set up a tool library, shared DJN pamphlets on technical disaster preparedness (think, taping roof seams, resilient rebuilding and mold removal), and connected the dots between his congregation’s resources and those in need in the area.
Working from the ground up, she found disaster victims who fell through the cracks of the federal disaster response system, often getting less aid.
For instance, many residents lack clear title to their inherited family homes. Without that documentation, they can’t qualify for FEMA aid. Roberston connected one such woman, who lived near Harris’ church in DeQuincy, with the minister’s team, who put on a new, more resilient roof — a repair she couldn’t otherwise afford.
“There are so many people in our communities that fall just below the income limits or don’t have this one piece of paper,” says Robertson. “Every time we have a climate disaster the least of the least have less and less. And that shouldn’t be. We should step up as church, as community, and help the least of the least.”
Roberston points to how incredibly well positioned churches are to lead us through the environmental challenges of our area.
“Churches should be a place where people can come after a disaster. Every church should have a solar panel set up on its roofs so they can provide comfort, light, cooling, or heat,” she says. “Every denomination has a mission fund. There’s mission work right in your own backyard.”
Robertson’s food box is now surrounded by a garden for neighbors to harvest from. She also hosts regular meetings for community members and teens, so her community can withstand and recover from future environmental and economic challenges.
“And there’s still disaster work that needs to be done,” she says, looking at the blue tarp across the street.

Gov. Phil Scott called for state Sen. Sam Douglass to resign on Tuesday after reporting by Politico revealed remarks he made in a leaked national Young Republicans group chat. Scott, a Republican, said the comments in the group chat  — which reportedly included derogatory language and slurs — were “disgusting and unacceptable.”
Republican leaders of both chambers of the Vermont Legislature also swiftly echoed Scott’s statement, calling the comments “unacceptable and deeply disturbing.” The statement signed by Senate Minority Leader Scott Beck, R-Caledonia, and House Minority Leader Rep. Pattie McCoy, R-Poultney, and the two assistant leaders, Sen. Brian Collamore, R-Rutland, and Rep. Casey Toof, R-St. Albans Town, concluded saying, “It is time for Sen. Douglass to step away from his position as a Vermont Senator and resign.”
In a June exchange between former New York State Young Republicans co-chair Bobby Walker and chair Peter Giunta, Walker mentioned a mutual friend who had dated an “obese Indian woman,” according to the report. Giunta replied that the woman was not Indian, to which Douglass responded: “She just didn’t bathe often.”
After Douglass made a comment about a Jewish colleague potentially making a procedural mistake, his wife and national Young Republicans committee member Brianna Douglass responded, stating, “you’re giving nationals to (sic) much credit and expecting the Jew to be honest.”
Samuel and Brianna Douglass did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Following the release of the chats, Vermont political leaders on both sides of the aisle have swiftly moved to denounce Douglass’ remarks and call for his resignation.
“The vile, racist, bigoted, and antisemitic dialogue that has been reported is deeply disturbing,” Scott wrote in a Tuesday statement. “Those involved should resign from their roles immediately and leave the Republican party — including Vermont State Senator Sam Douglass.”

The Republican legislative leaders also wrote that the remarks reported by Politico “cannot be excused and are inconsistent with Vermont values and what Vermont Republicans stand for.”
Lt. Gov. John Rodgers said Tuesday that the reported language used by Douglass and other Young Republicans members was disturbing, and “would lead any decent person to either call them out or at least leave the chat.” Rodgers said Douglass’ resignation would be a good start to address the situation.
“It is unfortunate that national politics seems to have normalized this type of aggressive discourse,” Rodgers said. “It’s not OK — coming from either party, coming from any person — and we need to figure out how to get past it and get back to dialogue.”
Democrats and advocates add their voices
Senate President Pro Tempore Phil Baruth, D/P-Chittenden Central, echoed the call for Douglass to resign in a statement. Baruth wrote that the reported racist and antisemitic comments from Samuel Douglass and Young Republicans group leaders is reflective of the “ugliness and the hateful bigotry of Trumpism.”
“It’s also critical to note that a single resignation will not eliminate the disturbing rhetoric permeating this country,” Baruth wrote. “The Vermont GOP must address and reject the largely covert network of hatred that binds them to racist and white nationalist elements nationwide.”
Hudson Ranney, communications director for the Vermont Young Democrats, said the group would also like to see Douglass to step down and apologize for the “deeply offensive and prejudiced comments, including derogatory stereotypes about Indigenous women and antisemitic remarks about his Jewish colleagues.”
Ranney wrote that every citizen deserves respect from their representatives, which Douglass failed to uphold. 
“Baseless hatred is not a problem for others to deal with. As this incident shows, bigotry is inside our own house. It is a stain that we all must confront,” Ranney wrote.
The Vermont Young Republicans Vice Chair and Deputy Vice Chair did not immediately respond to a request to comment.
Paul Burns, executive director of the Vermont Public Interest Research Group, wrote in a statement Tuesday that Douglass owes an explanation and more to his constituents and questioned whether Douglass could be trusted to serve in public office. 
“To know that an elected official from Vermont took part in this long-running chat that included the repeated use of incredibly violent, racist, and antisemitic rhetoric is sickening,” Burns wrote.
Mia Schultz, a commissioner of the Vermont Truth and Reconciliation Commission and Rutland Area NAACP president, said the state needs leaders not to perpetuate prejudice but instead display integrity, empathy and accountability, even in close circles. 
“It’s a moment to remember that racism and antisemitism are not relics of the past,” Schultz said. “They’re living in our reality right now, and they appear in whispers and jokes and these digital faces as we find time and time again. And the harm is real, and it’s the responsibility of all of us to confront it, that includes the people in power.”

It's a rare event in California history in part because sheriffs are elected officials.,"In summary
The San Mateo County Board of Supervisors voted to remove Sheriff Christina Corpus after allegations of nepotism in her office. It’s a rare event in California history in part because sheriffs are elected officials.


For the first time in California history, a county sheriff has been removed from office. 
The San Mateo County Board of Supervisors voted unanimously to remove Sheriff Christina Corpus from office today, nearly a year after a damning report from a retired county judge found that she likely violated the county’s policy on nepotism and conflicting relationships. 
Removing her wasn’t as simple as firing someone. It took a successful San Mateo County ballot measure that asked voters to choose whether to amend the county charter to grant the board that power.
“Today is the end of a tragic, destructive and grossly expensive chapter in San Mateo County history,” said Supervisor Jackie Speier, a former member of Congress. “I had high hopes for Sheriff Corpus. I voted for her, I held a town hall with her on crime prevention. She had great ideas to modernize the office. 
“So it’s tragic to see her time as sheriff come down to this.”
Corpus still has 14 days to appeal her removal. San Mateo County Attorney John Nibbelin said the county’s undersheriff will serve as sheriff. 
Corpus, appearing in a blue suit at the board meeting, argued adamantly against her removal. She said she was elected as a reformer, and the changes she tried to push through the sheriff’s office were met with first resistance, then outright hostility, when the old guard in power in San Mateo County began working to undermine her.  
“I have sacrificed my peace, my marriage, for this job,” Corpus said. “If I lose my position today, I will walk out with my head held very high. I never bowed to intimidation. 
“You may remove me from office but you will not erase the truth.” 
Corpus’ legal team, which now includes a one-time member of President Barack Obama’s cabinet, made a half-hour presentation arguing against the legality of her removal. 
“Culture change is hard,” said Tom Perez, who was labor secretary under Obama and former chair of the Democratic National Committee. “From Day One, there were folks who didn’t want her to succeed.” 
The county of San Mateo, one of the wealthiest in the country, has been paying Corpus’ legal bills. If she is removed in two weeks, she will be responsible for her legal costs from that point. 
Last week, retired Superior Court Judge James Emerson found cause to remove Corpus after a two-week trial that included a cascade of allegations portraying a chaotic picture of her two-plus years in office. 
Emerson found that Corpus had “a close personal relationship outside the boundaries of a professional working relationship” with a subordinate, unlawfully ordered the arrest of the president of the sheriff’s deputies’ union and retaliated against a captain who refused to conduct the union president’s arrest because he believed it violated state law.
If Corpus is not removed, she will return to a unique six-year term afforded to elected members of law enforcement in 2022 when the state moved county sheriff and district attorney races to the presidential election year calendar. 
About 25 people spoke during the board’s public comment period. Some came to praise Corpus, others to bury her, none more so than the daughter of the sheriff’s deputies’ union president, whom Corpus ordered arrested last year – something Judge Emerson found was retaliatory. 
The sheriff’s office alleged that the union president, Carlos Tapia, was doing union business on company time and falsified the record of his working hours. But an investigation by the San Mateo County District Attorney’s Office found no reason to charge Tapia, determining that the errors on his time cards were clerical and concluding that Tapia “should not have been arrested.
A captain in the sheriff’s office resigned rather than arrest Tapia, and Tapia alleged in a lawsuit filed against the county that Corpus demanded his arrest as retaliation against him for complaining about her leadership.  
Vanessa Lemus-Tapia, Tapia’s daughter, said at the meeting that Corpus was incorrectly claiming credit for reducing crime in San Mateo County when the rate for most major crimes statewide has fallen. 
“That was not her doing,” Lemus-Tapia said, before addressing Corpus directly. “Stop fighting this. Restore trust, dignity and integrity to this department.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/012323-Christina-Corpus-San-Mateo-GETTY-CM-01.jpg?fit=1024%2C679&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-10-14 18:57:31.436809

(Photo by Alex Edelman/Getty Images)COLUMBIA — Hate crime ordinances in municipalities across South Carolina would likely be struck down as overstepping their legal authority, according to an analysis by the state attorney general’s office, which on Tuesday appeared unlikely to affect lawmakers’ debate over a state crime.
The nonbinding legal opinion concludes the ordinances may violate both the state constitution’s ban on local governments creating criminal law and — depending on what they criminalize — the U.S. Constitution’s free speech rights under the First Amendment.
“The use of hatred to intimidate others is repulsive and has no place in society,” Solicitor General Robert Cook wrote, stressing he doesn’t want to undermine local governments’ ability to “condemn racial, religious, or other forms of hatred. We condemn these as well and fully support Home Rule.”
However, he continued, “criminal hate crime ordinances have been rendered ‘off limits’ by our State Constitution and this form of criminal behavior may be addressed only by the General Assembly.”
Regardless, he notes, the existing local rules remain fully in place “unless and until a court decides otherwise.”
The opinion, dated Oct. 10, was sought by Greenwood’s city attorney, after a resident called on City Council during a public meeting in June to pass its own ordinance. Attorney James Padgett’s concerns were largely confirmed in the opinion.
“Whether we can do something or not, this is really an issue that needs to be taken up by our Legislature,” Mayor Brandon Smith, a former state Municipal Association board member, told the SC Daily Gazette.
South Carolina is among just two states without a specific hate crime law. (Wyoming is the other.)
As attempts to pass a law repeatedly failed in the Legislature, two dozen towns and cities, as well as two counties, have passed local rules making it unlawful to intimidate someone because of who they are, to include their race, religion, gender identity or disability. Penalties vary. Possibilities include community service, participation in an anti-bigotry education program, a $500 fine, and up to 30 days in jail.
Such a “patchwork” statewide is what the state constitution sought to avoid, Cook wrote.
House Minority Leader Todd Rutherford disagreed with that analysis.
“He’s saying cities and counties can’t come up with their own crimes because they can’t exceed state law. Well, there’s no state law on it,” said the Columbia Democrat.
Both the capital city and surrounding Richland County have passed hate crime ordinances. Rutherford, an attorney, said local governments could respond to a legal challenge by simply removing the criminal penalty.
“Cities should look to address as much as possible hate in South Carolina and take a stand,” he told the SC Daily Gazette. “It needs to be punished when people act on their hate.”
Violence motivated by hate is unfortunately becoming increasingly common, he said, and government should step in to tell people that won’t be tolerated.
“We can’t allow that because when people feel they can do that, that’s when society goes off the rails,” Rutherford said.
His caucus will push again for legislation next year, he said, while acknowledging approval hinges on the Senate.
Since 2021, the House has twice passed legislation that would add penalties for people convicted of committing a crime due to their victim’s race, gender or sexual orientation. But those proposals never got a vote on the Senate floor, with GOP opponents saying proving hate involves prosecuting thoughts, and violent crimes already carry stiff penalties.
Senate Majority Leader Shane Massey said Tuesday he agrees that only the Legislature can set criminal law. He also agrees there’s been an alarming increase in violence fueled by anger and hatred. But he still opposes creating a state hate crime.
The answer, he said, should be criminal laws that punish severely regardless of the victim’s identity.
“It shouldn’t depend on what city you live in. If the law’s insufficient, let’s address the law,” said the Edgefield Republican. “I think it’s culturally destructive policy to enshrine in the law that some people are more important than others, and we’re going to treat people differently.”
He’s not budged by criticism that South Carolina is nearly alone in its lack of a hate crime, he said, noting the existence of a hate crime in other states clearly isn’t dissuading violent, hate-fueled crime.
“Look at how well they’ve worked,” he said about other states’ laws. “It hasn’t done anything to protect those victims that it’s designed to protect.”
He contends the punishment for violent crime is often already more severe in South Carolina than in Democrat-led states with a hate crime statute. In cases of murder, punishment can include life without the possibility of parole or death: “We don’t need a hate crime to get you there,” he said of death row.
Senate rules allow a single senator to block legislation, at least temporarily. While opposed to hate crime bills, Massey has not been among GOP senators to officially object to them and block debate. An objection can be overridden by a vote that puts a bill on special debate status. But so far, hate crime proposals have lacked majority support among the Senate’s dominating Republicans for Massey to call for a public vote.
Sen. Tom Davis, who supports hate crime legislation, said he’ll try again next year to persuade his GOP colleagues. He points to the state’s death penalty statute in hopes of changing their mind.
In South Carolina, killers can be sentenced to death only after they’re convicted of murder, and the crime must involve at least one factor on a list of “aggravating circumstances,” such as happening during a burglary or kidnapping, or the victim being a child.
Davis, R-Beaufort, likens that list to the enhanced penalties allowed by a hate crime law.
The bill last passed by the House in 2023 would have added up to five years in prison and a $10,000 fine to the sentence of a hate-motivated violent crime.
“We’re not talking about making thoughts a crime or speech a crime or making a new felony,” he told the Gazette. “Certain crimes are more heinous than others, and we already recognize that.”
While he understands local officials’ frustration in passing their own hate crime ordinances, Davis said he nonetheless agrees with the attorney general’s opinion.
“I think it’s a matter that needs some debate,” Gov. Henry McMaster told reporters at the Statehouse on Tuesday.
His concern is that passing a hate crime law would give law enforcement the power to conduct expansive searches of people’s homes and possessions to prove their motivation came from a place of hate, he said.
“We have so many laws now that cover A to Z, with penalties that can be very severe,” McMaster said. “The judges and magistrates, I believe, are the answer. If they use those laws that we already have and implement them fully and carefully, then that would be the way to keep the lid on things.”
The governor stopped short of saying existing local ordinances should be challenged in court. If someone wants a ruling to throw them out, they’re welcome to try, he said.
“It’s a free country,” McMaster said.

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch) Environmental groups penned a letter to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency urging the federal agency to maintain its previously rescinded ruling that seven segments of Iowa rivers were impaired due to nitrate concentrations. 
The environmental groups said EPA’s decision to delist these segments was “inconsistent” with the law, failed to hold polluters accountable and would lead to increased regulatory costs for water treatment in Iowa. 
The decision from EPA followed a summer with near-record high nitrate levels in the Des Moines and Raccoon rivers near Des Moines and the first-ever lawn watering ban from Central Iowa Water Works on account of the high nitrate concentrations, coupled with summer water demand. 
Dani Replogle, staff attorney for the environmental group Food & Water Watch, called the EPA decision “baseless” and said it “does not inspire confidence in the federal agency meant to safeguard clean water and protect our health.” 
“The data is clearer than ever that Iowa waterways are overwhelmed with persistent, toxic nitrate contamination,” Replogle said in a statement. “Iowans need more clean water protections — not less.”

Background 
EPA ruled in January that the Iowa Department of Natural Resources needed to add seven river segments to its 2024 list of impaired water segments. This decision, which EPA said was due to the high levels of nitrate and “nitrate plus nitrite,” another form of combined nitrogen similar to nitrate, in the segments, was rescinded by EPA in July.
EPA said in their letter changing the decision that it is seeking additional information from DNR to determine “whether  ‘good cause’ exists to not include the seven referenced waters.”
The original decision was opposed by DNR, with DNR’s executive director Kayla Lyon arguing the agency was holding Iowa’s department to “a very high standard.” DNR argued the designation would yield higher costs and greater regulatory oversight associated with the designation. 
The impaired segments, on the Cedar, Des Moines, Raccoon, Iowa and South Skunk rivers, serve as drinking water sources for several municipalities including Des Moines, Iowa City and Cedar Rapids. 
EPA holds that concentrations of nitrate and nitrite above 10 milligrams per liter in drinking water can lead to shortness of breath, blue-baby syndrome or even death in infants under the age of 6 months. Other research indicates long-term exposure to nitrate in drinking water is linked to certain types of cancer. 
According to the EPA’s letter from July, announcing the recission of the impaired water segments, DNR did not list the segments in its impaired list because it applied standards for nitrate that “solely protect against chronic effects” while EPA applied standards that apply to both chronic and acute effects of nitrate. 
Per EPA’s letter, this information was made clear in May 2025 when DNR submitted additional information to EPA explaining why the segments do not need an impairment listing. 
Iowa Environmental Council, Environmental Law & Policy Center and Food & Water Watch, the groups that penned the letter to EPA, also obtained records, via a public information request, on communications between DNR and EPA. Per the records request, the documents submitted were DNR’s 2001 water quality standards document and EPA’s subsequent approval of the standards. 
The groups allege these documents, being more than 20 years old, were already submitted to EPA. The environmental groups allege any additional information, including explanation from DNR, occurred in an “undocumented oral conversation” which was referenced in an obtained email. 
The environmental groups, in their letter, argue these actions were “outside the process contemplated” in the Clean Water Act, which allows for a change to impaired water lists when EPA requests additional documents, and for public comment. 
Michael Schmidt, general counsel for Iowa Environmental Council said the decision “lacks transparency” and was “based on outdated” information. 
“EPA’s action undermines the public process defined in federal regulations and limits public transparency,” Schmidt said in a statement.
An EPA spokesperson said in a statement that DNR’s impaired waters list for 2024 made use of data from 2020-2022.
“IDNR is in the process of compiling and assessing water quality data from 2022-2024 and is expected to public notice its draft 2026 list early next year, which will include an assessment of these same seven water segments,” the spokesperson said in an emailed statement. “Concurrently, EPA will be working with IDNR to understand and resolve the issues forming the basis for EPA’s reconsideration of its 2024 decision.”
The spokesperson said it is working with DNR in the “spirit of cooperative federalism” and using “the latest information” to ensure water quality standards are “followed and upheld.”
“EPA has been tracking the levels of nitrate and is ensuring that all of the information and data collected by the cities, universities, and other groups is provided to the Iowa Department of Natural Resources (IDNR) for evaluation,” the spokesperson said.
Acute vs chronic
DNR argued its application of nitrate parameters pertained to chronic effects, which is why the department chose not to list the seven segments. The environmental groups argued the nitrate standard used does not apply solely to chronic effects. 
The letter from environmental groups argued a symptom like blue-baby syndrome is an acute, rather than chronic, health outcome and is prevented by the EPA via the maximum contaminant levels, or MCLs, adopted under the Safe Drinking Water Act. The letter alleges the cited 2001 water quality standards from DNR incorporated these MCLs “as the water quality standard.” 
A spokesperson for DNR declined to comment on the environmental groups’ letter and their position against the department’s reasoning.
In public comments to EPA’s original action, DNR director Lyon said the federal agency’s decision was incorrect because nitrate is not a “toxic pollutant.” The letter countered this argument by saying EPA’s toxic pollutant list outdated. 
The letter said “overlooking the acute consequences” of high nitrate is inconsistent with the Safe Drinking Water Act. 
Environmental groups also cited Iowa Code for water quality standards and argued the “narrative” standards for surface water prohibit “toxic pollutants in toxic amounts.” 
The referenced state standards note that substances toxic to humans, or “detrimental to treatment process” must have limited concentrations in surface water. 
Water treatment facilities are responsible for keeping contaminants, like nitrate, within legal limits for drinking water. In Des Moines, where the Des Moines and Raccoon rivers were both elevated above 10 mg/L for nearly 70 days this summer, water treatment facilities were forced to run costly nitrate removal systems for more than 110 days this summer. 
Environmental groups via the letter, said removing the segments from the impaired list “fails to address the causes” of pollution and “unfairly burdens” water treatment facilities. 
Leadership from Des Moines Water Works echoed this sentiment following EPA’s delisting decision. They said in a news release that the decision did not align with financial and operational realities the utility faced in providing clean drinking water to the city. 
Once a water segment is listed as impaired, EPA and DNR develop water quality improvement plans, known as a Total Maximum Daily Load or TMDLs, that require reductions to the known pollutant. 
“Drinking water issues across the state, from western Iowa to the waters removed from the list by EPA, demonstrate the necessity for further action to address pollution in drinking water sources,” the letter said. 
Iowa Environmental Council Water Program Director Colleen Fowle said EPA’s decision holds that the waterways in question meet safe drinking water standards, which she said is an “unjustified and dangerous” claim. 
“Removing the impairment at the same time Central Iowa had to implement unprecedented water use restrictions made no sense,” Fowle said in the statement. “EPA’s action fails to put the onus on the polluters to adopt practices that will actually fix the problem.”

This story by Liz Sauchelli was first published in The Valley News on Oct. 14, 2025.
BRADFORD — A recent string of gasoline thefts have hit residents and businesses in the Upper Valley.
In mid-September, employees at Route 5 Auto in Bradford discovered holes drilled into the plastic gas tanks of four vehicles and their fuel stolen, owner Mike Gherardi said.
When employees arrived at the shop on Lower Plain the morning of Sept. 15, “we could smell gas,” Gherardi said. At first, an employee suspected the fumes were coming from a Chevrolet El Camino that he was working on.
“After I was outside for a while, I was like, ‘It’s way too pungent’,” Gherardi recounted. He started crawling under vehicles parked in the lot and “saw the holes drilled in the gas tanks.” Three of the vehicles that were targeted were pickup trucks and one was a car.

“Luckily some of the vehicles were old enough that I didn’t have to replace the tank, I was able to repair them,” Gherardi said. If he had to replace them entirely, the cost could rise to a couple thousand dollars, he added.
Gherardi contacted the Bradford Police Department, which is investigating the incident, according to a police news release issued Sept. 18. Police Chief Russell Robinson could not be reached by deadline.
Gherardi’s business wasn’t the only one hit.
Wells River Chevrolet, located on Railroad Street, also had gas stolen from vehicles parked on its lot in September.
The Hartford Police Department had one report of possible gasoline theft within the last month at the Wilder Park and Ride, Lt. William Furnari said.
On Oct. 6, a Topsham resident reported that gas was stolen from a vehicle on Powder Spring Road. Vermont State Police’s St. Johnsbury Barracks are investigating the incident.

Ted Cooper, senior sales consultant at Wells River Chevrolet, said the fuel thefts have been happening on and off for a couple of years. He could not recall similar thefts previously taking place during his more than 12 years working at the dealership.
“Now we try to put everything inside we can, but obviously we can’t put our entire inventory inside,” Cooper said. Over the past couple of years, Wells River Chevrolet has spent about $15,000 replacing fuel systems of vehicles with damaged tanks, he said.
The most recent thefts, which affected a few pickup trucks, occurred in mid-September. Employees discovered them after noticing a large puddle of gas spreading over the pavement under a truck, Cooper said.
A security camera picked up footage of a suspicious vehicle at the business in the early morning hours, but it was too blurry to make out an exact vehicle model or license plate number.
“We are in the process of greatly enhancing our video surveillance equipment and it’s going to be much harder to evade because there are cameras now mounted in relatively invisible places and at lower angles in order to be able to see things like plate numbers, faces, etc.,” Cooper said.
In the nine years he has owned Route 5 Auto, Gherardi said he has had vehicles broken into and even stolen, but gas thefts are new.
“It’s dangerous,” Gherardi said about the thefts, adding that gasoline had run out of the vehicles and into the road. “What if someone is driving down the road and decides to toss a cigarette out?”
Even though the gas tanks are plastic, the drill used to get the gas could still have created a spark, Gherardi said. “It wouldn’t take much for it to blow up.”
He is also puzzled by the crime in general because of the cost of gas. The average cost of a gallon of gas in Orange County is $3.17 per gallon, according to AAA.
“I think it’s crazy,” Gherardi said. “I just wouldn’t think it’s worth it.”

Donny Lambeth (R-Forsyth), co-chair of the Joint Legislative Oversight Committee on Medicaid. “They have the power to hold off on those rate cut[...]","Rep. Donny Lambeth (R- Forsyth) speaks at the Joint Legislative Meeting on Medicaid Tuesday October 14, 2025. (Photo by Galen Bacharier)North Carolina Republican lawmakers on Tuesday criticized state health officials for moving ahead with Medicaid provider rate cuts lawmakers say were unnecessary.
“I’m still very upset about the rate cut,” said Sen. Donny Lambeth (R-Forsyth), co-chair of the Joint Legislative Oversight Committee on Medicaid. “They have the power to hold off on those rate cuts, and in the 12 years I’ve been here, we have never cut rates. If we were short on Medicaid, we filled that with new money later in the year.”
The comments came during an oversight meeting where state officials defended 3% to 10% provider payment cuts that took effect Oct. 1. The reductions are intended to offset a $368 million budget shortfall caused by rising costs. 
Medicaid spending is growing faster than the state economy, driven by increasing behavioral health needs and rising prescription drug prices. Pharmacy spending alone has climbed 8.6% annually, DHHS Chief Strategy Officer Julia Lerche told lawmakers.
“This is not the direction the department wanted to go,” Jay Ludlam, deputy secretary for NC Medicaid told the Committee. “If the General Assembly appropriates the funding needed to run the program, we have designed our response to be reversible, and we are committed to reversing those provider rate cuts as soon as practically possible.”
Lambeth said DHHS should have consulted legislators before implementing the reductions. “We shouldn’t be sitting here in October getting the answer from them on how they decided to make those cuts,” he said. “We should have had that discussion back in July or August.”
“Unfortunately, we don’t operate with the budget we wish we had,” Ludlam responded. “We operate with the budget we do have, and we’ve had to act like a business and reduce costs in order to manage the budget that was appropriated.”
Lambeth also criticized how the cuts were distributed, saying smaller programs such as autism therapy providers were hit harder than large hospital systems. “To decide they’re going to cut a little group like autism by $70,000, when big hospitals could probably absorb that, is just not fair and equitable in my opinion,” Lambeth said.
Rep. Donna White (R-Johnston) called the move “very shocking and very hurtful,” warning that agencies serving people with disabilities and chronic illnesses might be forced to turn patients away or close.
“We can do better than this, and we can start today,” White said. “When we look at agencies possibly having to close down, or having to not admit the sickest and most fragile in our communities — this is very hurtful.”
Democratic Gov. Josh Stein has blamed Republican legislators for not allocating enough money to maintain Medicaid rates. The stopgap budget passed in July fell about $319 million short of what the program needed to cover its costs, according to the administration. DHHS warned lawmakers in August that the cuts would be made unless the legislature approved additional funding.
The Senate and House passed their respective Medicaid funding bills last month, but they remain at odds. Senate leaders wanted to include money for a new children’s hospital and money for rural hospitals, while House Republicans were pushing for a “clean bill” without the extra money. So, to date, no additional money has been appropriated to the program. 
Medicaid leaders said they waited as long as they could for more funding, but had to move ahead with cuts October 1.
Since Medicaid expansion launched, about 685,000 additional residents have enrolled. The program now covers one in four North Carolinians and two in five children, funded mostly by federal dollars.
Meanwhile the cuts are rippling across providers. Agencies serving people with developmental disabilities are absorbing 8% reductions, while some dental practices say Medicaid now reimburses only about 35% of actual costs. A survey by the North Carolina Academy of Family Physicians and the Pediatric Society found 44% of practices may limit Medicaid patients and nearly 10% may stop accepting them altogether, NC Newsline has reported.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_3900-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-14 18:57:31.436809

Florida has more to lose than any other state if Congress doesn’t extend enhanced premium tax credits for so-called Obamacare coverage.
That was the message a trio of Democratic members of Congress delivered Tuesday on Day 14 of the government shutdown. At the center of the shutdown is a partisan battle over extending the tax credits to lower the costs of health care coverage. 
The credits expire at the end of the year. Democrats are holding up government funding to pressure Republicans into extending them. While Republicans have said they are open to talks, they insist Democrats vote to continue government operations until late November.

“If Trump and Republicans continue to refuse to negotiate our way out of this health care coverage crisis, it’s going to be absolutely brutal, disproportionately for Florida,” said U.S. Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, a Democrat from Weston.
Florida leads the nation in the number of people who purchase insurance through the federal exchange (healthcare.gov), which was established under the Affordable Care Act (ACA), sometimes called Obamacare. 
U.S. Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services data from March show that of the 4.7 million Florida residents with an Obamacare plan in 2025, 4.6 million receive the tax credits.
Obamacare enrollment for 2026, meanwhile, is set to begin next month.
“If these credits expire, millions of people will — and thousands of people that we represent,  really, hundreds of  thousands — will face double, triple, or quadruple price hikes in their [health insurance] premiums. That’s not exaggeration or hyperbole. We’ve seen the notices,” said Wasserman Schultz, whose district includes 209,000 Obamacare enrollees, 203,000 of whom receive the tax credits. 
“We’ve talked to insurance companies and we know that that’s what’s coming,” she added. “And you all know what that really means. Families will be forced to drop coverage, chronic diseases will go undiagnosed, ERs will be flooded.”
Joining Wasserman Schultz in a Zoom meeting were U.S. Reps. Darren Soto and Maxwell Frost, who said the loss of the enhanced premiums plus Florida’s decision to not expand Medicaid to low-income childless adults will prove devastating.
Soto said his congressional district has the second highest Obamacare enrollment (271,000) in the nation.

“And there’s a good reason for that. We have a lot of folks working for small businesses. We have a lot of folks who are independent contractors, and they don’t have access to affordable, employer-based health care, so they’ve gone on the exchange, and the fact that Florida didn’t expand Medicaid only made it more desperate for folks to have to use the ACA exchange,” Soto said.
He added: “Remember when Donald Trump ran on lowering costs? Well, now he’s running away from lowering costs with this key negotiation.”
Advanced premium tax credits have been available since passage of the Affordable Care Act. During COVID, Congress agreed to make the premium tax credits more generous. Those enhanced credits lower out-of-pocket costs for the coverage and allow people who earn more money to qualify for the subsidies.
Only Alabama, Mississippi, and Texas (all of which have lower Obamacare enrollment) have lower average monthly premiums.

While the battle over the tax credits has been partisan, conservatives including Associated Industries of Florida President and CEO Brewster Bevis, Florida Hospital Association President and CEO Mary Mayhew, President and CEO of Florida Association of Community Health Centers Jonathan Chapman, and President and CEO of the Florida Hispanic Chamber of Commerce Julio Fuentes aligned under the Florida Conservatives for Affordable Health Care moniker and came out in support of their continuation over the summer.
“I have been around this debate over health care coverage for decades and, while the politics of the ACA have been heated over the years, there should be a unified political voice in support of the federal marketplace and the premiums assistance in Florida,”  Mayhew said during a press conference this summer.
U.S. Sens. Rick Scott and Ashley Moody both oppose extending the tax credits. Moody’s position could hurt her election bid next year, a public opinion survey conducted by the Tyson Group shows.

Scott, the multimillionaire former health care executive who launched his political career opposing Obamacare, doubled down on his opposition to the longstanding federal health care law last week on Fox News’ The Sunday Briefing.
Working class hero
For his part, Frost said the argument is an extension of the battle this summer over the GOP’s “One Big Beautiful Bill” and that he was “proud” that Democrats are “standing strong” on the issue.
“We are the party of the working class, we’re the party of working people, and we don’t want people’s health care costs to go up anywhere from 50% to 300%. We don’t want millions of people in this country losing their health care, because we believe health care is a human right for every single person in this country, and that’s what we’re fighting for,” he said.
Frost said his office has asked constituents to share videos of themselves talking about the looming health insurance premium increases they face. His office, he said, has been posting them online.
One “heartbreaking” story he described involved a woman who said her monthly premiums were about to double.
Maxwell Frost via U.S. House
“She’s having to cut from her grocery trips. She had to cancel a trip to go see her parents that she hasn’t seen in a long, long time. And a lot of people are considering having to change their housing situation because the rent is too damn high,” Frost said. 
“We have to remember that Donald Trump is throwing us into this healthcare crisis while he’s also thrown us into a grocery store crisis, while he’s also thrown us into a housing crisis, even worse than it ever was before. Everything is so much more expensive.”
With wages stagnant and costs of living increasing, Frost said, “working people just need a break, and taking away their health care — it’s one of the most inhumane things a person can do.”










He spent a bunch of our government money to campaign against Amendment 4 last year. Why is he spending no government money to make sure people know that their health care is about to go up by an insane amount because of Donald Trump and Republicans in Congress?”

Silence
Meanwhile, state political leaders to date have been silent on the issue.
The three Democrats were critical of Insurance Commissioner Michael Yaworski and Gov. Ron DeSantis for not warning state residents about the increases.
“Absolutely,” Soto said when asked whether the governor and insurance commissioner should be making people aware.
“They can’t hide these numbers. Obviously, people want to know, and they should know, and there’s a duty to tell them ahead of time.”
Frost said DeSantis and Yaworski are motivated by political considerations.
“The governor knows that in about a year, he’s going to become pretty irrelevant on the national stage, and he’s trying to find relevancy. He doesn’t want to rub Trump the wrong way. And so instead of looking out for Floridians and what’s best for the people he’s supposed to lead and represent, he’s going to keep his mouth shut and continue to play partisan games,” Frost said. 
OIR presentation
Meanwhile, OIR Deputy Commissioner for Life and Health Alexis Bakofsy updated the House Health Health Care Facilities & Systems Subcommittee Tuesday afternoon, including news that a statewide average 34% increase in premiums will take effect Jan. 1.
An OIR slide presentation shows the state expects Obamacare enrollment to “drop significantly during 2026 Open Enrollment with the expiration of enhanced subsidies & Federal Rule implementation.” OIR has a demographic breakout but Bakofsy said she didn’t have the information available with her.
She did tell committee members that 95% of Obamacare enrollees live in a county with at least four carriers. Monroe County is the only area in the state with only one health insurer offering a Obamacare plan through the exchange, the result of Aetna exiting the market (in Florida and nationally.)
Bakofsy repeatedly said Florida consumers should shop, given the changes that are occurring.
“When I say ‘shop’ I mean understand how you’re going to be impacted both on the exchange but also what are your options off exchange. Every consumer is going to be different to the extent that we can provide you with resources so that they can go. I would hate for someone to come to Dec. 15 and realize that the plan that they had, the plan they want to keep, is no longer available.”
Bakofsy also told members that the OIR plans to collect data on enrollment and claims starting next year to ensure the office can effectively track participation in the market.
The OIR had not publicized the steep rate increases, a fact that Bakofsy acknowledged and which irked committee member and state Rep. Robin Bartleman, a Democrat from Weston.
Bartleman said many residents haven’t even received notice from insurance companies warning them of the rate increases (Florida law requires the notice to go out 45 day in advance. Bakofsy said that gives the carriers until mid-November to send the notices).
“So, what? What is your plan? Because everyone this committee, we’re going to be left holding that ball, and we had nothing to do with this. But you work for the state. You work for the governor. What are you going to do, because it’s not just low-income people or minority people. I can give you the numbers of every person in this community and how many people in your district aren’t going to be able to afford health care insurance. What can you do to help us, help Floridians get this information out?”

(Photo by Janine L. Weisman/Rhode Island Current)The Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management (DEM) has lined up a popular Providence-based clamshack and seafood wholesaler as the anchor tenant for the former Chase Marina beneath the Sakonnet River Bridge in Tiverton.
The State Properties Committee on Tuesday unanimously gave preliminary approval for a 10-year lease for Dune Brothers LLC to occupy the building at 169 Riverside Drive. A copy of the agreement was not immediately made available. The building is two stories on its west end and one story on the east end.
The DEM acquired the building from the Rhode Island Department of Transportation in 2021 in order to redevelop the property as part of a “once-in-a-lifetime opportunity” to grow the state’s blue economy. The building previously served as a privately owned marina and kayak shop.
Established in 2017 by spouses Nicholas and Monica Gillespie, Dune Brothers originally operated seasonal clam shacks near downtown Providence and across the Seekonk River in East Providence. The business has since expanded to a sit down location and market in Providence’s Fox Point neighborhood, along with a wholesale market in Warwick.
The Gillespies did not immediately respond to request for comment Tuesday.
Dan Costa, DEM’s port manager, told the State Properties Committee the redeveloped marina site would be home to a new market and restaurant.
The 0.26-acre site on which the building sits includes an attached marina with room for up to 19 berths for commercial fishing vessels, Costa said. Docking space is still being engineered, he added.
“This land lease is going to be a complement to that marina facility,” Costa said. “I believe this is a wonderful opportunity for the DEM to preserve our working waterfront and further the state’s mission in supporting the commercial fishing community.”
In addition to Dune Brothers, the DEM would have a satellite office within the building for the agency’s divisions of Coastal Resources, Emerging Fisheries, and Law Enforcement.
“We have no presence in the East Bay to continue furthering our missions,” Costa said. “It’s going to be a great benefit.”
The state solicited bids from prospective tenants between April and July of 2025, DEM spokesperson Kim Keough said. Dune Brothers submitted one of only two responses.
Troy Langknecht, the chief of program development for DEM’s Natural Resources Bureau, told the committee that the proposed deal calls on Dune Brothers to pay $14.50 per square foot — totaling $82,230 per year.
But just when the business can start occupying the space is unclear. Langknecht told officials that the 5,671 square-foot former seafood processing facility still requires “significant improvements.”
As of Tuesday, a few desks, a filing cabinet, and a sign left over from the building’s time as a staging ground during the 2018 demolition of the old Sakonnet River Bridge were visible inside the one-story portion of the building fronting Riverside Drive.
“It is in pretty good shape, but definitely not ready for any kind of business,” Langknecht said.
The state will offer Dune Brothers a rent abatement of approximately $58,710 each year over the 10-year term, she said. The total of $587,096 is the estimated cost to correct deferred maintenance of the building. After the capital improvement deduction, the annual rental fee will be $23,520.
DEM officials hope to have a lease in place early 2026, Keough said in an email to Rhode Island Current.

Hanscom Field located between Bedford, Lexington and Concord by adding 17 new hangars. The publicly-owned airfield holds the most private jets in New England.""","ACTIVISTS OPPOSING the Hanscom Airfield expansion proposal are calling recent recommendations to utilize sustainable aviation fuels “a disingenuous greenwashing campaign” as lawmakers leading on the issue maintained that the governor and Massport must put a stop to the plan. 
The Massachusetts Port Authority proposal, which has faced years of opposition, would expand the Lawrence G. Hanscom Field located between Bedford, Lexington and Concord by adding 17 new hangars. The publicly-owned airfield holds the most private jets in New England, and an October 2023 report found private jets from the field accounted for an estimated 106,676 tons of carbon emissions over an 18-month period. 
Activists on Tuesday aired concerns about increased carbon emissions from private jets that serve the wealthy. They drew attention to a Massachusetts Sustainable Aviation Fuel Workgroup report, which recommended that the state advance the implementation of SAF, a type of jet fuel made from renewable sources. 
The working group report suggests that SAF has “the potential to dramatically reduce life cycle aviation emissions … and avoid indirect impacts on forests and croplands.” It also recommends creating a Massachusetts and New England Regional SAF Hub “to secure buy-in from key stakeholders, facilitate information sharing, and identify priority short- and long-term initiatives that build SAF momentum.”
But a new report from the D.C.-based think tank Institute for Policy Studies claims that utilizing SAF in this project or others will not help Massachusetts reduce greenhouse gas emissions and is not a “feasible” way to reduce emissions at scale. 
“SAF won’t help the Commonwealth reduce emissions. Period. It will not scale at the pace of climate change. It is a diversion of money and attention in this moment,” Chuck Collins, co-author of the think tank’s report, said Tuesday.
“Hypothetical future use of SAF should not serve as a green light for expanding aviation. We find that SAF solutions provide minimal or negative greenhouse gas reductions,” the report says. It calls studying SAF “logical” but suggests “proposals to drive production or consumption of SAF through economic policy or subsidies do not make financial sense, as SAF currently and for the foreseeable future increases GHG emissions.”
Massport maintains that the renewable fuel “represents one of the most immediate and effective tools available today to reduce aviation’s climate impact and enable emission reductions without compromising reliability or safety.”
The agency is “committed to reducing aviation-related emissions and promoting more sustainable practices across all our facilities, including Hanscom Field,” Massport said in a statement to the News Service. “We understand there are a range of opinions, and we’re committed to continuing the conversation with our neighbors to find the right balance between environmental goals, airport operations, and economic growth.”
Lincoln resident Alex Chatfield criticized the focus on SAF in the midst of opposition to the Hanscom project. 
“If Massport thinks that we will be distracted by the supposedly bright, shiny object of SAFs and accept the North Airfield project, because someday, a few decades from now, some highly expensive and still environmentally damaging but differently produced fuel is being sold there, they have badly underestimated our determination to stop this project,” Chatfield said.
Secretary of Environmental Affairs Rebecca Tepper in 2024 rejected a draft environmental impact report filed by Runway Realty Ventures and North Airfield Ventures to expand the Hanscom airfield. The developers are expected to submit a supplemental draft environmental impact report to address environmental and community impacts and concerns by the end of the year, Chatfield said. 
“There is no way you can put in a whole bunch of essentially garages for private jets and still claim ever again, at least in the living memory of those of us in the room, to be concerned about climate. This is it. This is the inflection point for Massport,” Sen. Michael Barrett said during a State House briefing. 
“The same in some ways is true for the Legislature and executive branch, also. It is going to be very, very difficult for your elected officials to make the case that we prioritize fighting climate [change] if this particular deal goes down,” Barrett continued. 
Activists on Tuesday delivered another letter to Healey calling on her to put a stop to the project, after conservation and historic preservation groups delivered a different letter and petition to her in April.
Barrett recalled the decision of former Gov. Frank Sargent in the 1970s to reject the Inner Belt project, which Barrett said would have decimated neighborhoods in Somerville, Cambridge and Boston.
“Sargent took a look at that seeming inevitability and said, ‘Not on my watch – that is a bad decision. I’m thinking about the future, and I can see that this would get it wrong,'” Barrett said. “So we’re asking our current governor, who’s done so much good work on other issues, to appreciate that there is a precedent for her saying just, ‘No, not on my watch.'”
A petition created by the Stop Private Jet Expansion at Hanscom or Anywhere group, which calls on Healey to stop the expansion plans, has more than 14,500 signatures. 
“It’s a matter of political will,” Rep. Carmine Gentile said. “Massachusetts has pledged to reach net zero emissions by 2050. How can we take that goal seriously if we greenlight projects like this? We can’t,” Gentile said. “How can we tell working families to switch to electric cars, to insulate their homes, take the T while letting the ultra rich burn jet fuel to [take] quick flights to the Caribbean? That would be a moral failure.”",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Barrett-Michael-2.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-10-14 17:57:31.064755

Justices plan to hear the case starting at 9:30 a.m. on Wednesday, Nov. 5. The court also plans to hear oral arguments in six unrelated cases.
In Attorney General v. Eli Lilly and Company, Nessel sought to investigate the drug manufacturer to determine if its pricing practices for insulin violated the Michigan Consumer Protection Act.
‘You can’t win a case you never file’ 

Nessel petitioned the Ingham Circuit Court for civil investigative subpoenas under the act, but, in a separate complaint filed with the court, she also filed a motion for a declaratory judgment. The motion asked a judge to preliminarily hold that her investigation was not barred by the act’s exemptions for conduct already authorized by a regulatory agency, the state or federal government.
The attorney general noted in her motion that the state viewed Nessel’s interpretation of the act as out of step with the Michigan Supreme Court’s decisions in Smith v. Globe Life Insurance Company and Liss v. Lewiston-Richards Inc. Nessel asserted that both of those cases were wrongly decided.
Eli Lilly said that was a poor read of the act, and asked the circuit court to dismiss the case. The court agreed with Eli Lilly, a decision that Nessel appealed to the Michigan Court of Appeals.
Michigan AG argues for reversal of rulings that prevent insulin pricing investigation

Nessel also attempted to bypass the appellate court and take the case straight to the high court. Justices rejected that attempt and placed the case back before the Court of Appeals.
The appellate court affirmed the circuit court’s decision to dismiss the case in an unpublished opinion, which means the opinion was not binding on the lower courts or necessarily instructive to the Michigan Supreme Court.
Back before the high court, Nessel is asking the justices to determine whether she has a claim that can be adjudicated in state court, and whether she needs to do so under the auspices of the Michigan Consumer Protection Act for the case to move forward.
The court has also been asked to determine whether the precedential cases in Smith and Liss were correctly decided, and if not, whether they should be retained under the doctrine of stare decisis, a maxim holding that decisions in precedential cases are settled law and are the guidestar for similar unsettled cases.

When the Boston Foundation’s Latino Equity Fund released “The ROI of ESOL,” documenting the economic returns of English for speakers of other languages (ESOL) education for immigrant workers, the plan was to catalyze immediate policy action. Unfortunately, we released it in February 2020, just weeks before COVID shut down the world and policymakers shifted to a different set of emergency priorities. 
But when we revisited workforce development for immigrant workers alongside a powerful coalition of organizations last fall, the timing couldn’t have been better. Labor shortages across industries had employers desperately seeking skilled workers. The state’s Fair Share Amendment had created new revenue streams for transportation and education. 
Federal threats to immigrant services inspired advocates and lawmakers to step up at the state level. Gov. Healey’s signature on the $10 million vocational ESOL appropriation this June demonstrated how strategic coalitions can capitalize on policy windows when they finally open. For policymakers nationwide grappling with immigrant workforce integration, the Massachusetts experience offers crucial lessons about both patience and preparation. 
The Commonwealth’s demographics have long illustrated the need for ESOL investments. For decades, Massachusetts has experienced an increase in its foreign-born workforce, but despite a proud history, an abundance of trusted ESOL providers, and a deeper commitment to state funding than many other states, our ESOL efforts have not matched the scale of the need. Waitlists continue to grow, job trainers have struggled to provide proper English curricula, and available ESOL training hasn’t always met the needs of foreign language-speaking job seekers.  
That’s not to say there haven’t been wins. The economic disruptions of the pandemic triggered interest in new investments in programs to reskill workers. Working in partnership with the Workforce Solutions Group and JVS Boston, we successfully persuaded the Baker administration to invest millions in ARPA funding to expand ESOL programs in colleges and workplaces.  
More recently, we collaborated with the Jewish Alliance for Law and Social Action (JALSA) and others on advocating for improved services for immigrants in state shelters, while other partners, such as MIRA and the African Bridge Network, have successfully advocated for legislation that makes it easier for foreign-trained physicians to practice in Massachusetts, providing warranted opportunities for professionals who can help meet the local need for health care providers. 
Meanwhile, a broader coalition was forming. Beginning in the fall of 2023, at the urging of groups including Caribbean Youth Club and English for New Bostonians, SkillWorks and the Boston Foundation began convening representatives from more than 40 immigrant support groups and job training programs to find common ground on an immigrant worker agenda. Conversations quickly centered on the need for better coordination and funding across state systems supporting immigrants, with a particular focus on ESOL for employment. 
Under the banner of the English for a Strong Economy (ESE) coalition, we developed a sophisticated policy framework connecting vocational English training directly to career pathway programming. Through numerous meetings, we developed proposed legislation to enhance system coordination and agreed to advocate for necessary increases in ESOL funding.  
Coalition members combined rigorous research with strategic advocacy. Research published by the Massachusetts Business Roundtable, Eastern Bank Foundation, Massachusetts Taxpayers Foundation, and MassINC built upon the original “ROI of ESOL” report to make a macro-level case for change. We then rallied around the MassINC report to frame our requests. New qualitative research from the African Bridge Network and the Latino Equity Fund added depth, capturing stories of the barriers that block skilled workers from career advancement.  
Partners are continuing to lean in, recently highlighted by Eastern Bank Foundation’s $10 million commitment to workforce ESOL, and the attention on the issue is increasing private donor interest in supporting ESOL providers. 
In short, rigorous research combined with strategic advocacy created a virtuous cycle, sparking government investment that in turn catalyzed philanthropic resources and increased interest in ongoing advocacy.  
Continuing that cycle is vital. Currently, even with expanded funding, workers face a maze of disconnected programs across community colleges, workforce agencies, and community organizations. Employers struggle to identify which programs align with their industry needs. Our advocacy wins won’t provide full value until we create more seamless pathways that enable workers to transition from basic ESOL to vocational English through industry-specific training and employer-connected job placement. 
This means developing shared best practices for vocational ESOL curricula, creating common assessments and measurements that support progress in language and job training, expanding access to wrap-around support for participants, and recognizing that the path to a job will look different for different immigrants. It will require technology infrastructure that allows workers to access services across multiple agencies, organizations, and data systems and enables employers to easily identify workers with both English language proficiency and job-relevant skills. 
Bringing these pieces together may well be more challenging than finding funding. It requires policy frameworks that incentivize collaboration over competition, funding mechanisms that reward system-wide outcomes rather than individual organizational metrics, and regulatory approaches that standardize quality while allowing programmatic flexibility. 
We have the interest, but we need the will. The question for fiscal year 2026 and beyond isn’t whether to invest more in ESOL—it’s whether Massachusetts will seize this moment to build the comprehensive system that can truly serve workers and employers at scale. The foundation is built. The system design work begins now.

The request from the university comes on the heels of the General Assembly passing a law earlier this year to allow public universities to offer more professional and advanced degree programs. That legislation, which had bipartisan support, allows public universities to seek approval to start professional programs such as medicine or architecture and to offer doctor of philosophy degrees. 
KSU is asking to begin offering Ph.D. programs in agroecology and sustainability and aquaculture/aquatic science under the university’s land grant umbrella. KSU, located in Frankfort, is the state’s only public historically Black college or university. 
University officials appearing before the Interim Joint Committee on Education on Tuesday reiterated throughout their presentation that offering the programs would be at no cost to the state and the university plans to generate revenue for the programs from federal and other funding sources. 
Among questions asked by lawmakers during the meeting, Republican Senate Floor Leader Max Wise, of Campbellsville, asked the KSU officials how many of the university’s graduate students would be retained by the new doctoral programs and if students could be recruited from other universities. 
KSU President Koffi Akakpo said the graduate aquaculture program has around 25 students who are about to graduate and most of them could be retained by KSU if it had a Ph.D. program. The university had more than 40 students graduating from graduate programs in agriculture in the spring. 
Rep. Rachel Roarx, D-Louisville, asked how the programs could help improve the financial stability of KSU moving forward. In recent years, and before Akakpo was named president, the university has dealt with a number of controversies, including misused funds under a former administration. The legislature in 2022 put the university under a management improvement plan and provided $23 million to help it recover from a budget hole.
“It’s going to generate more revenue to the university,” Akakpo said. “As I said, we have the scholarship, but we have to give it to students to bring that money, to keep that money. If we don’t give it to students, we cannot keep that money.”
Marcus Bernard, the dean of the College of Agriculture, Health, and Natural Resources at KSU, told lawmakers that the creation of the two Ph.D. programs would provide a path for the university to reach “R2 status,” or a high research activity classification from the Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education.
Andrew Ray, the chair of the School of Aquaculture and Aquatic Science, said the programs would “lead to a much higher skilled workforce in these two critical areas” and allow the university to retain students. Maheteme Gebremedhin, the chair of the School of Agriculture and Natural Resources, echoed that in his remarks, saying that year after year, KSU trains master’s level students and they leave Kentucky to apply to doctoral programs elsewhere. 
“There is a compelling case to make in terms of the economic viability of the program. Highly skilled workforces are the cornerstone of Kentucky agriculture, and we want to capitalize on that,” Gebremedhin said. 
Federal officials are also interested in this topic. Ray noted that Republican President Donald Trump signed an executive order earlier this year calling for the United States to be more competitive in the seafood market. The executive order directs Trump administration officials to “develop and implement an America First Seafood Strategy” that increases production and exports of U.S. fishery and aquaculture products and domestic processing capacity. 
Ray said “wild fisheries simply cannot supply” the demand for such products, but it’s something academics want to work on.
“I think we have a really unique opportunity here to work on this and to address this issue. We have an amazing program here,” he said. “It’s got the roots, it’s got the bones already built, and I’m ready to lead it, and the Ph.D. program will really help establish our leadership in this area.”

Officials with the Nampa and Meridian Irrigation District are replacing and upgrading the Ridenbaugh Diversion Dam, which is located just east of Barber Park – a popular destination where thousands of people begin their float of the Boise River each summer. 
Little called the dam “a powerhouse in the Treasure Valley” and said the dam project will ensure farmers will continue to receive irrigation water they depend on.
“This project in particular will be a modernization into the 21st century, but it also has a safety and a fish aspect to it,” Little said. “So this is not just a pure irrigation project. It really checks all the boxes for what’s important in Idaho.”
Some of the funding for the $20 million dam project comes from $30 million that Little and the Idaho Legislature set aside during the 2025 legislative session for water infrastructure projects. 
To help pay for the project, the Nampa and Meridian Irrigation District received approximately $10.7 million in funding from the Idaho Water Resource Board, which was part of the $30 million for water infrastructure projects. The Nampa and Meridian Irrigation District also received an approximately $4.7 million Bureau of Reclamation Watersmart Grant for the Ridenbaugh Diversion Dam project. 
 Dam project aims to distribute irrigation water throughout the Treasure Valley

The purpose of the Ridenbaugh Diversion Dam is to raise the water level, allowing water to be diverted from the Boise River into the Ridenbaugh Canal, where it is delivered to farms and lawns across the Treasure Valley for irrigation.

The existing Ridenbaugh Diversion Dam, which dates to the 1930s, has reached the end of its life, officials said. 
“We’re hopeful that our new facility will enable us to distribute irrigation water through the valley for another 100 years,” Donald Barksdale, president of the Nampa and Meridian Irrigation District, said at the groundbreaking ceremony. 
Operating the existing dam and raising the water level requires a crew of three people to install and remove a series of 20-foot long boards by hand, even in stormy weather or when the dam’s walkway is iced over. 
Crews will replace that dam structure with a new automated system that includes gates and an 80-foot weir that will extend from the crest gate to the north river bank.

Crews will also install a screen to prevent adult fish from entering the Ridenbaugh Canal, officials said. 
During a press conference Tuesday, Greg Curtis, water superintendent for the Nampa and Meridian Irrigation District, said the cost of the project will not exceed $20.7 million and crews hope to finish it by spring of 2027. 
Construction work will be performed in the winter months to avoid the busy summer river floating season at Barber Park, Curtis said. Work begins on one side of the river immediately, and will continue until March or April, when work will stop before the floating season and the old boards will be put back in the dam. 
Construction work will then resume on the other side of the river next October, after river floating ends, and continue until completion, which is expected before the summer of 2027.

Ford/Maryland Matters)Jessica Weinberg enjoyed her job as a social scientist with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, helping communicate to the public the importance of medical devices such as pacemakers, brain implants and contact lenses.
But then Weinberg and her colleagues got word on April 1 they would be fired, the day she and her colleagues call “the April Fool’s Day public health massacre.”
“What has happened is a travesty, not just for me, my family and my community, but for the public health of the nation,” Weinberg said Tuesday.
“I am here speaking out, despite being taught for my entire 14-year career as a fed never to speak publicly,” she said. “I’m here balancing the need to spend time searching for jobs and providing for my family with the need to speak out about the travesty that has occurred and continues to unfold in this country.”
Weinberg, a wife and mother of two children ages 2 and 6, who lives in Montgomery County, was standing across the street from the Office of Management and Budget in Washington, D.C., joined by several dozen other affected federal workers and Democratic lawmakers from Maryland and Virginia. In an hourlong news conference, the Trump administration and House Republicans, who have stayed away from Washington for the two weeks since the shutdown began Oct. 1.

Speakers had particularly harsh words for OMB Director Russell Vought, who ordered the job cuts, as well as a fresh round of layoffs that began Friday, 10 days into the shutdown.
While several at the rally held up signs supporting workers, others held signs targeting Vought, including one with his face and the phrase, “Put them in trauma” — a reference to comments Vought reportedly made to describe his goal for the treatment of federal workers.
“Mr. Vought, you just heard about the trauma you are causing. Shame!” said Rep. Steny Hoyer (D-5th), as he pointed toward OMB, as others started to chant, “Shame!”
Hoyer was one of seven Maryland legislators joined by four Virginia colleagues, including Sen. Mark Warner, who came to show their support for federal workers and criticize the administration.
“These experts [federal workers], the ones to ensure that America’s exceptionalism in so many cases, depends on our powers and research and science and medicine. These are the people who have been targeted by this administration and targeted by the very sinister Russell Vought,” said Sen. Angela Alsobrooks (D-Md.).
“We are not here by accident,” Alsobrooks said. “It was completely foreseeable that we would be here in this moment because it was always the plan of the Republican Party and the plan of Russell Vought.”
The White House referred questions Tuesday to OMB, which did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
But while Democratic lawmakers have blamed the government shutdown on the Republicans who control Congress and the White House, Vice President J.D. Vance said Sunday on “Meet the Press” that the shutdown — and the subsequent layoffs — are the fault of Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) and other congressional Democrats. He said the administration has been forced to “lay off some federal workers in the midst of this shutdown to preserve the essential benefits to the American people that the government does provide.”
“We don’t want to be laying off federal workers, but the Democrats have shut down the government. They have forced us to choose between American citizens and federal bureaucrats. We are choosing the critical services that benefit our American citizens.”

Vance’s comments come even though President Donald Trump campaigned on a promise to slash the size of government and the Office of Personnel Management issued a memo on Trump’s first day in office directing agengy heads to identify probationary workers who “can be terminiated … without triggering appeal rights.”
Meanwhile, Trump this weekend directed the Pentagon to redirect research funds to pay active-duty troops during the government shutdown. The troops would have missed their first paycheck Wednesday, but the Defense Department said it would use $8 billion in “unobligated” research funds to make payroll.
House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.), who is keeping the House out until the Senate passes a budget, praised the president for “again showing strong leadership, has stepped up to ensure that our troops are going to be paid on Oct. 15.”
It remains unclear if the Trump administration has the legal authority to transfer the funds without congressional approval. Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-8th) said Tuesday that it does not, that federal law states money appropriated for a certain agency must go directly to that agency.
“If it’s mandatory for a particular purpose, it’s got to serve that purpose,” Raskin said. “So they [the administration] shouldn’t start impounding, redirecting, rechanneling money in order to cover up for their own negligence. They should come back to work and reopen the federal government with us.”

The Wisconsin Examiner’s Criminal Justice Reporting Project shines a light on incarceration, law enforcement and criminal justice issues with support from the Public Welfare Foundation.
“I want to keep sending a message to legislators that this violence is an epidemic, and something has to be done,” said Blanks, who volunteers with the advocacy group Moms Demand Action. “It’s not acceptable that we keep having so many lives cut short by gun violence.”
Firearms claimed the lives of 762 Wisconsinites in 2023, according to a report from the Wisconsin Anti-Violence Effort (WAVE) Educational Fund and the Violence Policy Center. This included suicides, homicides and other firearm deaths. 
The total number marks a decline from the 830 deaths reported for 2022 and the 793 deaths reported for 2021. The report also says that rates of overall suicide and firearm suicide in Wisconsin are similar to national rates, while homicide and firearm homicide rates are lower in Wisconsin than in the nation. 
However, overall rates of firearm suicides and firearm homicides have increased in Wisconsin since 2002. Since 2020, firearm deaths have reportedly outpaced motor vehicle deaths in Wisconsin. 
“One death from gun violence is too many,” Nick Matuszewski, associate executive director of the WAVE Educational Fund, said in a statement. “But 762 deaths is a disgrace and an urgent call to take the kind of actions that have been proven to save lives.” 
The 762 deaths include 502 firearm suicides and 236 firearm homicides. The report includes findings related to sex, age, race and ethnicity and rural and urban areas. 
WAVE reports that in 2023, suicides took up a larger percentage of firearms deaths in rural Wisconsin (88.5%) than in urban Wisconsin (58.2%). 
According to the report, guns were used in 54.6% of suicides and 83.1% of homicides in Wisconsin.
Black residents of Wisconsin were 40 times more likely to die by firearm homicide than white residents. The report states that an annual study by the Violence Policy Center found that Wisconsin had the fourth highest rate of Black homicide victimization in the nation in 2023. 
In 2023, 8,441 firearms were recovered in Wisconsin and traced, according to WAVE, most of which were handguns. The report found that 84.9% of firearms recovered in Wisconsin originated in the state.
The study was released the day before the Emergency Gun Violence Summit, which will take place Wednesday in Milwaukee.

According to communications obtained this week by The Connecticut Mirror, the debt would be added to the “UConn 2000” bonding package, the state’s financing program for capital projects at its flagship university. 
The $390 million in borrowed funds would cover the $13 million acquisition of Waterbury Hospital from Prospect Medical Holdings, a now-bankrupt hospital operator that was formerly backed by private equity investment. The funding would also pay for “other future clinical partnerships,” according to the communication.
Last month, CT Mirror confirmed that UConn Health is also in talks to purchase Bristol Hospital and Day Kimball Hospital in Putnam. It is not clear from the communications whether any of the additional funding would be used to pay for the acquisition of those two hospitals.
A significant portion of the funding would go toward investments in “IT, equipment, deferred maintenance and working capital,” the communication said. Waterbury Hospital, in particular, would need a major influx of capital funding to upgrade its systems, which are still recovering from a crippling cyberattack in 2023.
Gov. Ned Lamont’s office did not respond to a request for comment, nor did Prospect Medical Holdings.
UConn Health spokesperson Jennifer Walker deferred comment to the governor’s office. 
The nearly $400 million proposal does not address the hospital provider taxes Prospect owes the state, or its unpaid municipal taxes in Manchester and Waterbury.
As of last month, the Lamont administration was considering forgiving Prospect’s tax liabilities to the state as part of the deal for UConn Health to acquire Waterbury Hospital, according to several legislators who were briefed on the potential deal.
Prospect and its subsidiaries owe the Connecticut Department of Revenue Services as much as $100 million in “taxes or penalties,” according to court filings. However, state officials declined multiple requests to confirm Prospect’s total tax liability to the state.
The legislature would have to approve both the bonding and the tax forgiveness, House Speaker Matt Ritter, D-Hartford, confirmed. Ritter said the legislature would likely approve waiving Prospect’s tax bill.
“If we want to support UConn Health’s taking over the hospital then we will have to if it’s part of the deal,” Ritter said. “Otherwise you have to consider the alternatives — that the hospital could potentially close or some other private equity firm could come in and buy it.”
State Sen. Saud Anwar, D-South Windsor, a physician at one of Prospect’s Connecticut hospitals and a fervent critic of private equity in health care, said he agreed it would be the right move for the state, even though he doesn’t want to see Prospect “make money off the taxpayers.”
“I do think providing high-quality care to the people of Waterbury and beyond is absolutely essential,” said Anwar, who serves as co-chair of the legislature’s Public Health Committee.
During a meeting in September, members of Gov. Lamont’s administration and leadership from the University of Connecticut presented a plan to legislators regarding UConn Health’s acquisition of Waterbury, Day Kimball and Bristol hospitals. Part of that plan included forgiving Prospect’s outstanding taxes to the state. However, several legislators in attendance said they have not heard an update regarding tax forgiveness since then.
The UConn expansion is part of a broader strategy to make the institution more competitive with other academic medical centers in the market. State officials also hope it will improve the financial stability of the institution, which has generated cash flow losses averaging $140 million per year between 2020 and 2023, according to a report released last year.
Prospect isn’t the only health system with unpaid taxes. Day Kimball owes the state roughly $41 million, according to a Sept. 4 DRS report, which means the state may have to grapple with that debt as well. Bristol Health owes less than $14,000 in taxes, according to the same report. 
In reference to the outstanding taxes, Day Kimball CEO Kyle Kramer said the hospital is “working together” with state officials toward “a long-term solution” and has been making payments.
Prospect Medical Holdings filed for bankruptcy protection in January, and the sale of its hospitals around the country is being overseen by the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Northern Texas.
In September, Hartford HealthCare bid $86.1 million to purchase the other two Prospect-owned hospitals in Connecticut — Manchester Memorial and Rockville General. Additional bidders may submit offers through Oct. 16. A sale hearing, where the bankruptcy court judge will approve the preferred offer, is scheduled for Oct. 24. 
Yale New Haven Health was originally slated to purchase all three facilities in a $435 million deal reached in 2022. But the transaction became mired in legal disputes, with both health systems suing each other over the true value of the hospitals. The parties recently settled, with Yale New Haven agreeing to pay Prospect $45 million to exit the deal and end all pending litigation.
On Oct. 3, the University of Connecticut’s Board of Trustees and the UConn Health Board of Directors voted to approve a $13 million bid to acquire Waterbury Hospital. In a statement the same day, UConn Health CEO Andrew Agwunobi said UConn Health would submit the bid “in the coming week.” However, the health system had not submitted an offer as of Oct. 14.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/IMG_20180220_103221.jpg,,,2025-10-14 17:57:31.064755
,Connecticut Mirror,2025-10-14 21:25:11+00:00,CT Mirror,Witness testifies he gave Kosta Diamantis thousands in cash,Andrew Brown,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/10/14/witness-testifies-he-gave-kosta-diamantis-thousands-in-cash/,Sal Monarca testified that he handed over cash bribes to Kosta Diamantis at a Dunkin' Donuts and in the Capital Grille's bathroom.,"Jurors listened to a third construction contractor testify on Tuesday about how he paid multiple bribes to Konstantinos Diamantis, a former state deputy budget director, in order to secure work on Connecticut school construction projects.
Sal Monarca, the former president of Acranom Masonry, was one of the first people on the witness stand during the second week of Diamantis’ ongoing criminal trial.
He explained to the jury in detail how he paid cash bribes to Diamantis in order to gain the former public official’s help in securing several school building contracts in Hartford and Tolland.
Federal prosecutors had Monarca explain to the jury how he wrote checks to himself out of his company’s bank account and how he would immediately cash those checks in order to secretly give tens of thousands of dollars to Diamantis.
Prosecutors also pushed Monarca to describe the various meeting locations where the two men would exchange the money.
Monarca told the jurors that he slipped Diamantis some of the bribes in a newspaper at a Dunkin’ Donuts. He said he handed over other envelopes of cash at Diamantis’ home in Farmington. And, as prosecutors alluded in their opening arguments, he described one exchange that took place in the bathroom of the Capital Grille in Hartford.
Prosecutors also showed Monarca several texts in which he, Diamantis and Acranom’s Vice President John Duffy discussed some of the encounters in Hartford. And they asked what it meant when the messages said that Diamantis wanted to meet up. 
“You had to pay,” Monarca said. 
“John would tell me where to meet him, and I’d go pay him,” he added. 
Norm Pattis, Diamantis’ attorney, attempted to pick apart pieces of Monarca’s testimony, as he did with the other witnesses in the trial last week.
Pattis suggested during questioning that the payments Monarca made to Diamantis might be for legal work, since Diamantis is an attorney. He also asked whether the payments were compensation for Diamantis introducing Monarca to D’Amato Construction, which is one of the largest construction firms in the state.
Meanwhile, prosecutors leaned heavily on the mountain of direct evidence that has been introduced during the trial to show that Monarca paid Diamantis so that Acranom would win multimillion-dollar construction contracts.
On one such project in Tolland, Monarca said, he and Duffy added $70,000 to their offer to build part of the Birch Grove Elementary school in order to factor in the expected payments for Diamantis.
And he explained how a feud broke out when he didn’t immediately pay that amount to Diamantis, who oversaw the budgets for school construction projects all over the state.
To drive home the point, prosecutors replayed a voicemail in which Diamantis referenced the Birch Grove project and complained Monarca had not held up his end of the deal. 
Diamantis sat motionless at the defense table as the voicemail was played for the second time during the trial. 

(Contains graphic language)
Pattis questioned Monarca about why he lied to federal investigators about the payments to Diamantis when he was first questioned. He also asked Monarca about about whether he could recall the exact dates that he delivered money to Diamantis.
All of it was meant to raise jurors’ doubts about Monarca’s testimony.
But Monarca repeatedly told Pattis and the prosecutors that he paid Diamantis in cash.
“I don’t know the dates, but if the texts said that, I paid him,” Monarca said. “I know I went to the bank multiple times and delivered it myself.”
Prosecutors used the next witness to shore up Monarca’s testimony.
Eric Wethje, a federal agent with the Internal Revenue Service, testified about the alleged lies that Diamantis told to federal investigators when he was interviewed in 2023.
He also walked the jury through the bank records that prosecutors say trace the money that flowed from Acranom to Diamantis.
During the investigation, Wethje created a list of occasions in which Monarca took cash out of Acranom’s account, and he detailed the times that Diamantis deposited cash into his private checking account shortly afterward.
Pattis pointed out issues with the summary of those transactions, however.
In several instances, Pattis noted, Diamantis actually deposited more cash into his account than Monarca allegedly paid him. 
Wethje agreed and said that Pattis’ math was correct. But he said that is because Diamantis’ frequently deposited large sums of cash into his bank account between 2018 and 2021 when he was running the school construction program. 
He said those types of transactions were “voluminous.” And he told Pattis that Diamantis was depositing that type of money despite only claiming his salary from the state of Connecticut on his taxes.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/monarca-1024x784.jpg,,,2025-10-14 17:57:31.064755

(Photo by Andrew Harnik/Getty Images)Several of Idaho’s top officials have stayed quiet on the announcement Friday of a training facility for Qatari troops at the Mountain Home Air Force Base. 
U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth announced the agreement with the Middle Eastern country on Friday for a facility to host Qatari troops at the base located just under 50 miles southeast of Boise. The plan had been in the works for years, including an agreement with Qatar to purchase F-15QA aircraft from the U.S. made in 2017, the Associated Press reported. 
Friday’s announcement received mixed responses from Idaho elected officials. 
A group of ultra-conservative Republicans in the Idaho Legislature, who call themselves the Gang of Eight, wrote a letter to Idaho’s congressional delegation on Sunday with concerns about the announcement and several questions about its implementation.

The group, including state Sen. Christy Zito, a Republican who lives in and represents Mountain Home, expressed concern about “Islamic terrorism” and the “lack of consultation with Idaho’s state leadership.” 
“In the interest of informing our constituents, promoting government transparency, and collaboration between federal and state legislators, we respectfully request answers to the following questions,” the letter said.  
The questions included those about funding, screening and vetting of trainees, and similar agreements with other nations, such as the existing training program with Singapore at the Mountain Home base. 
State Rep. Faye Thompson of McCall also represents the legislative district that houses the Mountain Home base and signed the letter. Joining Zito and Thompson were state Sens. Glenneda Zuiderveld of Twin Falls and Josh Kohl of Twin Falls, as well as state Reps. Lucas Cayler of Caldwell, Kent Marmon of Caldwell, Clint Hostetler of Twin Falls, and David Leavitt of Twin Falls.

  Idaho governor, chairman of the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee haven’t publicly commented on agreement

Republican U.S. Senator for Idaho Jim Risch, who chairs the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, had not publicly commented on the decision as of Tuesday afternoon. Idaho Gov. Brad Little also had not released a statement or response to the announcement. 
Risch and Little’s office did not respond to multiple requests for comment for this story.
Idaho U.S. Rep. Mike Simpson wrote on the social media platform X that he supported the deal. 
“Fantastic news for Mountain Home Air Force Base as (Hegseth) just announced the Pentagon has agreed to host Qatari F-15 fighter jets and pilots here in Idaho,” Simpson wrote Friday. “This development is beneficial for training, enhances our partnership with America’s allies, and strengthens national security.”

Idaho U.S. Sen. Mike Crapo said in an emailed statement to the Sun, “As I await further details about the agreement, I will continue working with Air Force and Mountain Home base leadership to ensure they have the support necessary to fulfill goals of global military readiness that keep Idahoans and Americans safe and protect our long-term national security interests.”
Idaho U.S. Rep. Russ Fulcher also could not be reached for comment.
 Idaho Democrats, Risch challenger push back on Mountain Home Air Force Base agreement 

Democrats in Idaho criticized the announcement. 
“Trump accepted a $400 million luxury jet from Qatar, then his regime quietly approved building a Qatari military installation right here in Idaho,” the Idaho Democratic Party posted Friday on X.  “He sold out our security and used our state as part of the payoff.” 
The plans for the training facility and sale of the fighter jets to Qatar predated Qatar’s gift of the jumbo jet to President Donald Trump. The Air Force announced the agreement for training in 2020. 
Idaho Democratic gubernatorial candidate Terri Pickens called on Little to pause the deal in an emailed statement. 
“This isn’t just a foreign-relations issue — it’s a direct threat to Idaho’s sovereignty, our security, and the rights of Idahoans,” Pickens wrote. “Letting outsiders use our military infrastructure poses serious security and intelligence risks. Governor Little must tell the president to put a pause on this deal before it goes any further.”
Todd Achilles, an independent candidate challenging Risch for his U.S. Senate seat, wrote in a statement to the press, “I have one question for Senator Risch…Were you in on this?”

(Photo by Ashley Murray/States Newsroom)A website created Tuesday ties Senate Leader Phil Berger’s son Kevin Berger to a candidacy for Congress — but the potential candidate is mum on whether he has plans to run.
The domain “kevinbergerforcongress.com” was created Tuesday, drawing online attention from the North Carolina political world as Berger and the General Assembly prepare for a mid-decade redistricting push. The identity of the person who registered the site is not available to the public.
The domain change was first flagged by Carolina Forward, a left-leaning group, on social media; a cross-check of the domain name on ICANN, a nonprofit tool that tracks online registration data, confirms that it was created Tuesday.

Kevin Berger serves as a Rockingham County commissioner. His father, Phil, has been the N.C. Senate President Pro Tem since 2011. Kevin’s brother, Phil Jr., serves on the N.C. Supreme Court. Phil Jr. ran for Congress in 2014, losing a primary to former U.S. Rep. Mark Walker.
NC Newsline contacted Kevin Berger Tuesday to ask if he had registered the domain and whether he was planning to run for Congress. Berger said he was unaware of the domain name registration, but did not provide a direct answer about a potential candidacy.
“I am not familiar with what you are talking about,” Berger said by text message. “I would encourage you to reach out to whomever contacted you to find out about the domain name.”
When asked again whether he would run for Congress, he responded, “I support Virginia Foxx.”

Foxx, 82, currently represents the county in Washington. But with another round of redistricting on the horizon, Rockingham County could fall within the bounds of a new or significantly altered district.
Asked whether his answer would change if he found himself residing in a new district with an open seat, Berger responded, “I have no reason to believe that would occur.”
Berger, who chairs the county board, won one of three open seats on the board in November, earning 24.2% of the vote.
He was one of several defendants in a defamation lawsuit tied to the November election and the ongoing efforts to build a casino in the county in 2023.

(Photo by Leslie Bonilla Muñiz/Indiana Capital Chronicle)White House Border Czar Tom Homan visited Indiana on Tuesday to tout successes under President Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown — and urge Hoosier lawmakers to pass a bill they killed earlier this year.
“We’re going to send a message to the whole world. It’s not okay to enter this country illegally. It’s a crime,” he said. He spoke as part of a “Fairness for Hoosiers” event at the Statehouse.
Republican lawmakers and other attendees cheered and clapped throughout Homan’s 20-minute speech, while a small group of Westside Indianapolis residents protested the visit.
“Hoosier hospitality for every nationality!” they called from across the Statehouse, on the other side of a security line that only attendees, state employees and reporters could cross. Initially the event was set to be held in the public atrium but it was moved at the last minute to the House Chamber, and public and media weren’t allowed inside. It was livestreamed for Hoosiers.

Homan, who was acting director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement during Trump’s first administration, said the president gave him three tasks after winning back the White House.
“One, secure the border. Two, run the largest deportation operation this country’s seen. Three, find over 300,000 missing children,” Homan recounted.
Border crossings have dropped from more than 10,000 daily to less than 100 last Friday, he said — and all were detained or deported.
Deportations have ticked up to nearly 550,000 since Trump re-took office in late January, per Homan. Another 1.6 million people have self-deported.
The search for unaccompanied child migrants is ongoing.

Homan accused former President Joe Biden’s administration of “allow(ing) half a million children to be trafficked” across the border and of “releas(ing) them to unvetted sponsors.”
Republicans have claimed that upwards of 300,000 children were “lost” beginning last summer, after the U.S. Department of Homeland Security released a report showing that ICE didn’t serve notices to appear in court to 291,000 children and that another 32,000 were notified but failed to show up for immigration court hearings. The data is from October 2018 to September 2023.
“I told the president, out of the three things you gave me, this is the hardest,” Homan said. “And why is that? Because we can find you. We can find me. We have a digital footprint. You own a home, you got a car, you got credit cards, you pay utility bills.
“How do we find a child? Well, we have to count on the paperwork of the sponsor. If that paperwork wasn’t vetted and done right, that’s almost useless too. So we’re out there every day looking for these children,” he continued.
Homan said almost 24,000 have been “rescued,” adding, “We’re not going to stop until we run every lead down.”
Immigration bill revived
Homan was the final — and highest-profile — speaker to push lawmakers into passing a controversial, previously unsuccessful immigration bill.
Attorney General Todd Rokita and Gov. Mike Braun — along with lobbyist and former acting DHS Secretary Chad Wolf — also plugged it.
“The FAIRNESS Act is the next step to protecting Hoosiers communities. It will further strengthen immigration enforcement and give (Rokita) the tools to protect our citizens. Indiana is not a sanctuary state,” Braun posted on social media.
House Bill 1531 would have required all levels of Hoosier government to comply with federal detainer requests. ICE often asks local police and others to keep “potentially dangerous aliens” behind bars for 48 hours longer so it can take them into custody.
If Rokita had labeled a government entity as noncompliant, Braun could’ve withheld state funding and grants for up to a year.

“The fact of the matter is, there is no country, and therefore no Indiana, if we don’t have a defined border, one language and a common culture,” Rokita said. 
The legislation also would’ve banned employers from “knowingly or intentionally” recruiting, hiring or employing people not allowed to work in the U.S. Violators could’ve had their operating authorizations suspended.
“This is critical to protect our workers and end the magnet that draws illegal immigration to our factories and communities,” Rokita said. “It’s pro-business, it’s pro-worker, and it’s pro-Hoosier legislation.”
The bill passed the House on a 64-26 vote, but died after the Senate Judiciary Committee declined to hold a hearing. Sen. Liz Brown, R-Fort Wayne, leads the committee.
Rokita called her out by name, telling the audience, “That decision set us back at least a full year. We can’t afford further delays.”
Author Rep. J.D. Prescott, R-Union City, plans to reintroduce the legislation, now named the FAIRNESS Act: Fostering and Advancing Immigration Reforms Necessary to Ensure Safety and Security. The next regular legislative session begins in January.
“Hopefully that becomes law, folks,” Homan said.
“If you would, please help President Trump,” he added. “I think it’s a great bill.”

(Via Liv Caputo/Florida Phoenix)The Florida Senate on Tuesday unanimously chose Jim Boyd to serve as Senate president for the 2026-28 term.
Boyd, a Bradenton Republican, will take over from Senate President Ben Albritton at the end of Albritton’s term following 2026 elections, presuming the GOP retains control. His fellow Republicans selected him unanimously, lauding him as “Diamond Jim,” although these public announcements are purely ceremonial — future House speakers and Senate presidents are chosen years ahead of time.
“This moment is not about me. It is about the institution we serve, the legacy we inherit, and the future we are called to build together,” Boyd said from the rostrum. “My vision is a Florida that remains the beacon of freedom and opportunity for our nation.”
He continued, listing his priorities as future Senate President.
“We will defend the taxpayer and ensure every dollar is used wisely. We will break down barriers for job creators and innovators. We will protect the rights of parents and strengthen our schools. We will stand firmly with law enforcement to keep our communities safe. We will conserve Florida’s natural beauty so that it endures for generations,” he said. “These are not just policies, they are commitments.”
The celebration came one week after the Florida House announced that Rep. Sam Garrison, a Fleming Island Republican, would be its next speaker. Garrison will take over from sitting Speaker Danny Perez, who’s dominated headlines for asserting the House’s independence from the executive branch.
Boyd, who works in insurance and investment, was elected to the Senate in 2020 after serving in the House from 2010 to 2018. He is Florida State University graduate whose grandfather and uncle served in the Legislature as representatives of Manatee County. Unlike Boyd, they both served as Democrats.
During his time in the Legislature, Boyd sponsored a strict crackdown on retail theft — heartily signed into law by Gov. Ron DeSantis in 2022 — and tougher penalties for Floridians who falsely report crime. He’s sponsored multiple bills dealing with property insurance.

(Photo courtesy of University of Northern Iowa)A University of Northern Iowa professor is suing the university, alleging administrators waged a coordinated campaign to falsely “frame” her for disability discrimination while subjecting her to gender-based discrimination.
In a newly filed federal lawsuit filed against UNI, Mary Catherine DeSoto, an author and a tenured professor at the school, states that her “life and career have been defined by sustained political activism and public advocacy, including raising concerns about administrative spending, resource allocation, and institutional waste.”
She alleges those positions have, at various times during her 24 years at the school, placed her “in sharp conflict with university administration.”
The lawsuit alleges that after “disturbing incidents in 2012,” regarded by some as “severe retaliation” her for activism, DeSoto felt compelled to enter an informal agreement with the university and curtail her criticism of wasteful spending.
In 2023, she resumed her advocacy when she agreed to serve on UNI’s budget committee and gave a presentation addressing what the lawsuit characterizes as “administrative bloat and threats to course offerings,” the lawsuit states.
According to the lawsuit, UNI officials responded to the presentation by initiating a “renewed campaign of retaliation marked not only by defamatory attacks on her professionalism but also by grave procedural violations — including denial of her right to appeal, undisclosed ex parte communications with decision-makers, and the deliberate exclusion of exculpatory evidence from investigative reports.”
The lawsuit claims these “procedural abuses” were compounded by UNI’s “longstanding failure to address DeSoto’s Title IX complaints of discriminatory harassment by an administrator” at the school. The school then showed “unwavering institutional support” for the accused harasser, adding that this “entrenched pattern of institutional misconduct” inflicted profound harm on DeSoto’s career and well-being.
In addition to UNI itself, the lawsuit names as defendants UNI President Mark Nook; Provost and Executive President for Academic Affairs Jose Herrera; Dean of the College of Social & Behavioral Science Brenda Bass; Associate Provost Amy Nielsen; Adam Butler, the head of the Department of Psychology and DeSoto’s supervisor; Ann Bilder, legal counsel for UNI; Title IX Officer Leah Gutknecht; Assistant Dean of Students Tiffany Dodd; Deputy Title IX Coordinator Kaylee Michelsen; Brenda White, an investigator for UNI; and Kara Hughes, a senior “solutions specialist” at Grand River Solutions.
The university has yet to file a response to the allegations, and a university spokesperson on Tuesday declined to comment on the matter.
Lawsuit alleges ‘yelling rants’ by department head
DeSoto alleges that from 2010 through 2013, while serving as president of UNI’s United Faculty organization, she regularly voiced concerns that budget cuts were necessitated by excessive spending on administration and were degrading course offerings and damaging the overall education experience of UNI students.
According to the lawsuit, her activism led to news coverage and presentations to the Iowa Legislature on “wasteful spending,” after which UNI’s faculty issued a vote of no confidence against the school’s then-president, Benjamin Allen.
The lawsuit claims Allen then issued a public statement falsely accusing DeSoto of being anti-military, which led to her receiving hundreds of hate emails and fielding death threats. “For a period, DeSoto required university-provided security escorts to and from classes for her personal safety,” the lawsuit alleges. “Her car was vandalized, and the words ‘USA’ carved into the paint.”
In 2013, DeSoto advised the UNI administration she was formally backing away from her activism and criticism of the budget and she opted not to seek reelection as president of the United Faculty, according to the lawsuit.
Beginning in December 2016 and continuing through September of 2024, the lawsuit claims, DeSoto repeatedly sought assistance from the school’s Office of Civil Rights Compliance regarding Butler, her supervisor.
The lawsuit claims Butler openly criticized DeSoto for her then-recent marital separation and lectured her about her personal life, asserting that her place was at home with her husband who also worked at the school. “Butler’s harassment and lecturing continued after DeSoto eventually got divorced,” the lawsuit claims, adding that Butler typically “saved his yelling rants for female employees of the Psychology Department. On the rare occasion that he raised his voice at a male employee he would always quickly apologize.”
In 2017, DeSoto allegedly asked that her concerns about Butler be handled by UNI through a formal complaint process, but the school redirected her to a more informal process that didn’t involve a UNI investigation. According to the lawsuit, no formal investigation occurred until November 2024.
In 2023, the lawsuit claims, the school was facing potential budget shortfalls that would sharply reduce class offerings for students and so DeSoto provided a presentation on UNI’s budget to the faculty leadership.
“This presentation pointed out that UNI had cut faculty numbers by 34% since 2012 while the number of administration employees had actually increased by 6%,” the lawsuit alleges, adding that UNI leaders, who were monitoring her activity, then embarked on a “campaign of illegal conduct, all designed to drive DeSoto out of the university.”
DeSoto accused of discrimination
The lawsuit alleges the school’s leaders hatched a plan “to falsely frame DeSoto for disability discrimination with the intent to ultimately have DeSoto removed from the university.” According to the lawsuit, the discrimination allegation was based on a false assertion that DeSoto disliked students with disabilities and did not want to accommodate their needs with regard to testing.
The defendants, the lawsuit alleges, manipulated and misled a student “into thinking that a disability discrimination complaint was her only avenue to improve her grade” in DeSoto’s class.
The lawsuit alleges that while some of the specific allegations related to the charge of discrimination were either dismissed or resolved with a finding of “not guilty,” the evidence presented by the school disregarded facts in DeSoto’s favor.
After DeSoto complained about what she perceived as the “biased” nature of the investigation, the university hired Grand River Solutions to act as the decision-maker on the discrimination complaint.
In November 2024, UNI issued a decision finding DeSoto discriminated against the student. DeSoto appealed, and in January 2025, the school’s hired appeal officer vacated the decision and remanded the case back to Hughes, the decision-maker. The lawsuit claims Hughes then “made essentially same decision” as she had in November 2024.
In August 2025, with DeSoto’s second appeal still pending, UNI allegedly issued her “a letter of reprimand with major sanctions” that included a fine of $6,230, a requirement for mandatory training, a ban on serving on student committees, and restrictions on her internal communications.
The lawsuit claims the cumulative effect of UNI’s handling of the discrimination case and DeSoto’s complaints about Butler was “to shield Butler from scrutiny while subjecting DeSoto to a procedurally rigged process — harassing her, chilling her protected activity, and weaponizing the very procedures meant to ensure impartiality.”
According to the lawsuit, DeSoto is currently on medical leave due to severe work-related stress and her attempts to return to the workplace “have triggered overwhelming feelings of dread, avoidance, and physiological panic reactions.”
The lawsuit, originally filed in state court and moved this week to federal court, seeks damages for alleged violations of the federal Civil Rights Act, the Iowa Civil Rights Act, DeSoto’s First Amendment rights, and Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972. The lawsuit also seeks damages for an alleged breach of contract by UNI and for intentional infliction of emotional distress by Butler.

Ned Lamont to testify in the Kosta Diamantis trial, saying his testimony wouldn't be relevant.","A U.S. District Court judge ruled Tuesday that Gov. Ned Lamont does not have to testify in the ongoing criminal trial of Konstantinos Diamantis.
Diamantis’ attorney, Norm Pattis, filed a motion in early October seeking to add Lamont to the witness list.
Lamont was served a subpoena last week, and Attorney General William Tong’s office hired attorneys from the Hartford law firm Shipman and Goodwin to handle the matter.
They were prepared to file a motion to quash the subpoena as early as today, but Judge Stefon Underhill ruled from the bench that Lamont’s testimony wasn’t relevant to the charges against Diamantis.
Underhill held the hearing outside the presence of the jury. 
The judge asked Pattis to explain why the governor’s testimony would be relevant in the bribery and extortion case against Diamantis. 
Pattis explained that Lamont instructed Diamantis to bring school projects in on time and on budget. And he said those orders were what caused Diamantis to be so aggressive on the school projects. 
Throughout the trial, several witnesses testified about how aggressive and abrasive Diamantis was in the school construction field. One witness, Jack Butkus, said his team referred to Diamantis as “Napoleon.” And another witness called him “an arrogant prick.” 
But after Pattis was done explaining that rationale for calling the governor, the prosecution objected to Lamont being hauled into court and placed on the stand. 
The judge quickly agreed with the prosecution and ruled that Lamont’s testimony would not be relevant. In rendering that decision, Underhill pointed out that Diamantis is on trial for soliciting and accepting bribes, not being personally aggressive toward people. 
As court ended, Pattis said he didn’t understand the judge’s ruling and said it would likely be an appealable issue if the trial does not go Diamantis’ way.
Diamantis, the former the head of the Connecticut Office of School Construction Grants and Review, was charged last year with 22 federal counts of bribery, extortion, conspiracy and lying to federal investigators. They alleged that he set up a pay-to-play scheme within Connecticut’s school construction office.
Federal prosecutors are expected to wrap up their case in the next few days, and Pattis had listed Lamont as a potential defense witness. 
During last week’s cross-examination of John Duffy, the vice president of Acranom Masonry, which won a number of school construction projects, Pattis asked Duffy if he was aware that Lamont and Diamantis had had private meetings during COVID during which the governor told Kosta to “get the school construction projects done quickly, anyway he could and to use Connecticut laborers.” 
Duffy testified he wasn’t aware of those meetings. Outside the courtroom, Pattis said he will ask Diamantis about those meetings with Lamont when Diamantis testifies later this week.
During his first term, Lamont promoted Diamantis to the position of deputy director of the state’s Office of Policy and Management. Diamantis held both positions during the COVID crisis.
But Lamont later fired Diamantis from that job in October 2021, after investigators subpoenaed the state for a long list of records related to Diamantis and several public building projects he oversaw.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2025_1006_SR_KostaTrialDay1_084-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-10-14 16:58:47.236663

Two years after he moved to Vermont to lead Northfield’s police department, Chief Pierre Gomez has submitted his resignation, effective Nov. 1.
Gomez said he emailed his letter of resignation to the select board and the town manager Tuesday, just after noon.
Ongoing racial discrimination from some people and “their attempt to undermine the department since I was hired in 2023” are among reasons for Gomez leaving, he said in an interview.

He said he is unable to comment further “due to pending litigation.”
Select Board member Merry Shernock confirmed she heard from the chief Tuesday after he submitted the letter.
“This saddens me very much, but I have been sad about this for quite some time,” said Shernock, who has been the most vocal among board members in supporting Gomez at public meetings this year.   
“I was on the committee that hired Mr. Gomez and we had such high hopes. I think he did as well,” she wrote in an email Tuesday.
Northfield Town Manager Jeff Schulz and other members of the board did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Gomez, 58, was hired in September 2023 as chief of police in the Washington County town of about 5,900 — home to Norwich University — after former chief of police John Helfant retired amid controversy in May 2023. 
One of three police chiefs of color in Vermont — he identifies as a Black Latino — Gomez has reported facing racial harassment since he moved to town.
Northfield residents packed a select board meeting in April to support him after Lynn Doney, a disgraced former selectman who worked as a deputy sheriff and EMT in Washington County, made a racist remark regarding Gomez wearing a hoodie on duty instead of wearing his uniform, “so he looks like a police chief and not a gangster off the street that’s just driving our cruisers around,” he said.
Doney was interrupted by selectboard member Shernock, who said she didn’t think Gomez looked like a gangster and that police officers don’t always have to be in uniform.
More than a dozen residents wore hoodies to a subsequent select board meeting in solidarity with Gomez, who was also present and wearing a gray hooded sweatshirt in the back of the room. 
In September, while on duty, Gomez was accosted by a resident – later identified as Gary Allen Smith – who, he said, “ranted and raved” at him using racist terms.
Originally from Pittsburg, Gomez moved to Vermont with more than two decades of experience after retiring as a detective in Philadelphia.
His decision to leave comes during Hispanic Heritage Month and after another leader of color in policing — Etan Nasreddin-Longo — was removed from the Vermont State Police’s Fair and Impartial Policing Committee last month. 
Gomez said he hopes to go back to Philadelphia in January, “where they celebrate diversity.”

(Chase Woodruff/Colorado Newsline)Immigrant advocates and the American Civil Liberties Union of Colorado sued three Trump immigration officials over arrests of immigrants in Colorado they say violate federal law.
The lawsuit, filed last week in U.S. District Court for Colorado, was brought on behalf of four people who were detained by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, including a 19-year-old University of Utah student, Caroline Dias Goncalves, who spent 15 days in the ICE detention center in Aurora after a traffic stop.
It alleges that immigration officials are arresting and detaining people without determining probable cause or flight risk — and making assumptions about their citizenship status based on accent and skin color — in order to meet the Trump administration’s high demand for arrests. The lawsuit asks a judge to stop that action.

“They are scrambling to fill arbitrary quotas set by the Administration, causing chaos and terror in neighborhoods throughout Colorado. This lawsuit seeks to enjoin Defendants’ ongoing pattern and practice of flouting federal law in connection with their mass immigration arrests in Colorado,” the lawsuit says.
The lawsuit was brought by ACLU of Colorado, Meyer Law Office and Olson Grimsley Kawanabe Hinchcliff & Murray. It names Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, Acting Director of ICE Todd Lyons and Director of ICE’s Denver Field Office Robert Guadian as defendants.
The Department of Homeland Security did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Federal statute requires that federal immigration agents have probable cause to arrest a person they think is in the country illegally and deem the person a flight risk before they can obtain a warrant. The lawsuit alleges that those steps did not happen in the cases of the four detained people.
“Regardless of the color of our skin, the language we speak, or the neighborhoods we live and work in, the law protects us from these types of warrantless arrests,” Kenzo Kawanabe, partner at Olson Grimsley, said in a statement. “Each of us is protected from being rounded up and arrested in mass raids meant to meet arbitrary government quotas.”
ICE agents arrested Goncalves in June after being tipped off by a Mesa County sheriff’s deputy who pulled her over for a traffic stop. That deputy had asked her about her immigration status and accent. Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser filed a complaint against that deputy for violating a state law that prohibits coordination between local law enforcement and ICE. The deputy resigned.
Refugio Ramirez Ovando, 43, another of the plaintiffs, was arrested on his way to work at a construction concrete company in Grand Junction in May. He was detained for three months, and an ICE agent later admitted they arrested him by mistake in an effort to find someone else.
A 36-year-old asylum seeker identified in the lawsuit as J.S.T. was arrested during a February raid at an Aurora apartment complex. J.S.T. was leaving the complex to head to work when he was arrested and he was detained for four weeks.
A 32-year-old man identified in the lawsuit as G.R.R. was waiting at a Colorado Springs nightclub to be a designated driver for a friend when he was arrested. He was detained for over six weeks.
The lawsuit describes similar experiences of people in Colorado who have been arrested and detained since Trump took office in January. It seeks class-action status.
“These agents indiscriminately arrested people, including people with pending immigration applications, no criminal history, established residences in the community, steady employment, family in the United States, and other community ties contradicting any purported flight risk. And agents targeted high-density locations like apartment complexes and nightclubs where many Latine people lived or gathered but conducted no individualized analysis about their status or likelihood of escape,” the lawsuit says.

Last week, DeVaughn Ward sent a letter to DOC Commissioner Angel Quiros asking that the department immediately suspend its contract with Bansley Law LLC of Old Saybrook, the firm hired by the state to administer the program. 
According to year-end reports from Bansley Law, the firm conducted only three professional visits and initiated four court cases in 2022-23, although it was contacted by 355 incarcerated people during that time. The following year, 2023-24, the firm held five professional visits and initiated two court cases but was contacted by 471 incarcerated people. 
Attorneys for the firm did not appear in court on behalf of incarcerated clients at any point during those years. 
Ward, the state’s correction ombuds, wrote in the letter to DOC officials that during his visits to prison facilities across the state, he saw almost no signs advertising the legal aid program or any kind of educational materials informing people that the program existed. 
“The extraordinary cost of these services compared to the negligible value it delivers is not merely striking — it is unacceptable,” he wrote. 
Andrius Banevicius, spokesperson for the Department of Correction, confirmed in an email last week that Quiros had received the letter. He wrote that the commissioner “is reviewing it with members of the agency’s legal team, and they are in the process of preparing a response.” 
According to the state’s most recent contract with Bansley Law, Connecticut is paying the firm $800,000 annually for services provided through the Inmate Legal Assistance Program, or ILAP. The firm has been contracted to administer the program since at least 2015. 
Walter Bansley IV, the owner of Bansley Law and director of the Inmate Legal Aid Program, told CT Mirror in an email that the program deals only with issues surrounding  “conditions of confinement,” and that the attorneys don’t represent inmates in legal actions or appear in court on their behalf. 
Instead, he said, the program’s role lies in “evaluating the needs and merit of a given claim and guiding [incarcerated individuals] in making and filing a claim.” That means most of the issues incarcerated people contact Bansley lawyers about land outside the terms of the firm’s contract with DOC, he said.
“Examples of this are actions against non-state actors, probate matters, criminal defense cases, etc,” Bansley wrote. “Unfortunately, when inmates have an issue, and we inform them that we cannot help because the issue is OUTSIDE THE SCOPE, they complain that we do not do anything.” 
Judging the firm’s performance based on things like court appearances, case filings and in-person visits “shows that Ombuds does not understand the purpose, intent, and scope of the ILAP program,” Bansley wrote. 
But several formerly incarcerated individuals, advocates and civil rights attorneys who spoke to CT Mirror agreed with Ward’s analysis, saying the Inmate Legal Aid Program was ineffective. 
Hassan Foster, who was incarcerated at Garner Correctional Institution and at MacDougall-Walker Correctional Institution, said he had tried to contact the Inmate Legal Aid Program and that the lawyers had been unhelpful. He tried to file a civil case against a correctional officer, who, he said, punched him in the leg during a strip search, leaving bruises. 
Foster said the program attorney he spoke to told him there was nothing they could do. He said eventually he ended up filing a case with the help of another person who was incarcerated, who walked him through the steps. The case was settled with the state for $1,500.  
“Between a 1 to a 5, if I had to rate [Bansley]? Three,” said Foster, acknowledging that some of the paralegals were helpful and friendly. 
Bryan Jordan, who runs the nonprofit Guided By Purpose Initiative, said he contacted the Inmate Legal Aid Program several times while he was incarcerated regarding medical treatment in the prisons. He said the organization wasn’t responsive, didn’t come to visit him, didn’t explain relevant information and didn’t assist him with filling out forms. Like Foster, Jordan ended up filing his cases on his own. 
Asked about specific cases, Bansley said he was unable to comment without a release form signed by a notary public, citing attorney-client privilege. 
Attorneys who frequently work with incarcerated people also said the firm’s work was inadequate. 
“This program has proven inadequate and is not providing Connecticut individuals with their constitutional rights to access to the courts,” Alex Taubes, a civil rights attorney, said. 
Taubes added that getting access to legal materials has been a struggle for decades in Connecticut prisons, ever since a 1996 U.S. Supreme Court Case, Lewis v. Casey, in which the court ruled that an incarcerated person’s right to access the courts does not include the right to access a law library. 
Ward said in the letter that he had issued two subpoenas requesting documents from Bansley Law related to ILAP, which the firm refused to provide.
Bansley told CT Mirror that the documents Ward requested were either private under attorney-client privilege or “attorney work product,” or available through a Freedom of Information request. 
Ward has filed a motion in state Superior Court requesting that the court force Bansley Law to release the documents. The case is still ongoing.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/IMG_8111-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-10-14 16:58:47.236663

Attorney General Nick Brown is proposing legislation, dubbed the Immigrant Worker Protection Act, that would require employers to notify their employees of a planned inspection of employment eligibility paperwork within 72 hours of being notified about it by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Other states, including California, Oregon and Illinois, already have similar laws.
The attorney general’s office notes workplace raids are increasing under President Donald Trump. But first, federal immigration agents usually tell employers they want to audit I-9 documents. 
“While the employer is given 72 hours to gather and produce their employees’ I-9 forms, employees often have no idea that their I-9 documents are being sent for review,” spokesperson Mike Faulk said. “This bill would give workers the opportunity to get their documentation in order, speak to an attorney, or make plans with their family if needed.”
Employers fill out I-9 forms for all of their employees. On the forms, workers attest to their legal status or authorization to work in the United States, and must provide documentation to that effect. 
Businesses can use the federal E-Verify system to compare an employee’s I-9 to government data to determine their eligibility to work. Many states require at least some employers to use E-Verify, but Washington isn’t one of them.
The proposed law would protect against raids like one earlier this year at a Bellingham roofing company. 
Immigration officials had reportedly asked Mt. Baker Roofing for I-9 documentation for its workers. Investigators said they found 56 employees had given false information. They used this information to get a judge to sign off on a warrant to search the company’s warehouse. In an early morning raid in April, federal agents arrested 37 people.
In May, agents arrested 17 workers at Eagle Beverage and Accessories Products in Kent, with the help of the Internal Revenue Service. Authorities attributed the arrests to employees presenting fraudulent work documents attesting to their immigration status.
The Biden administration had paused such large-scale workplace raids, and instead focused on holding employers accountable for hiring unauthorized workers. The Trump administration restarted the practice this year.
One of the Trump era’s largest workplace immigration operations came last month, when agents arrested nearly 500 workers, mostly South Korean citizens, at a car plant in Georgia. 
The executive director of the Washington Immigrant Solidarity Network called Brown’s proposal “an important means of transparency for workers.”
“Immigrant communities who are essential to the economic and cultural vitality of our state are facing enormous threats because of the federal government’s ongoing mass detention and deportation agenda, while also struggling to meet basic needs,” Catalina Velasquez said in a statement.
On the other hand, state Rep. Jim Walsh, the chair of the Washington Republican Party, called it a “clear effort to undermine enforcement of federal immigration law.”
“It’s not clever. It’s not smart,” Walsh, R-Aberdeen, said in a text message Tuesday. “It’s decadent. And it puts the interests of illegal aliens ahead of the rights of American citizens.”
The attorney general’s office and state Department of Labor and Industries would enforce the policy.

Brown outlined his proposal in a Labor Day report last month on his office’s efforts to protect workers, and in a request for funding to Gov. Bob Ferguson. Lawmakers next year will approve a supplemental budget building on the two-year spending plan they passed this year. 
Brown wants about $400,000 to carry out the law if it is passed. Some of that money would go to community organizations like the solidarity network for outreach and education work.

Stephen Bryant, 44, pleaded guilty in 2008 to murder, burglary, arson, and assault and battery with the intent to kill, all during an eight-day crime spree in 2004.
His attorneys argued his mother’s alcohol use while pregnant with him made him incompetent for execution, a claim the U.S. Supreme Court rejected Tuesday.

The state Supreme Court typically issues death warrants on Fridays. If Bryant receives a warrant this Friday, his execution date would be set for Nov. 14. Inmates facing execution have the choice to die by lethal injection, electrocution or firing squad.
Between Oct. 5 and Oct. 13, 2004, during a series of burglaries, Bryant killed three people in Sumter County — Cliff Gainey, Willard Tietjen and Christopher Burgess. Bryant, 23 at the time, shot another person in Richland County, Clinton Brown, who survived.
Bryant received life sentences for killing Gainey and Burgess. Prosecutors pursued the death penalty for Tietjen’s murder.
According to court filings, Bryant killed the 62-year-old while robbing his Sumter home. After shooting Tietjen nine times, Bryant then ransacked his house looking for items to steal before smoking cigarettes and a cigar, then going on the computer.
When Tietjen’s wife and daughter called to check on him, Bryant answered Tietjen’s phone and told them he killed Tietjen.
Law enforcement found cigarette burns on Tietjen’s eyes and several notes, including writing on the wall that read, “victim number four in two weeks, catch me if you can,” according to court filings.
Unless Bryant’s attorneys file another appeal, he will be the seventh inmate executed since the process resumed in September 2024.

Civil rights groups say the legislation impedes the rights of young people to register to vote and have their ballots counted when using same-day registration during the early voting period.
Republicans who authored the bill claim it’s necessary to protect election security.
However, attorney Adrianne Spoto with the Southern Coalition for Social Justice said that young voters largely rely on same-day voter registration compared to other age groups, and SB 747 targets this preferred method of voting.
“Essentially, the bill made it so voters who use same-day registration can have their ballots discarded if a single verification mailer sent to them bounces back as undeliverable,” explained Spoto.
A simple postal error out of the voter’s control could easily cause a ballot not to be counted.
Jovita Lee, director of the North Carolina Black Alliance
“This is especially challenging for young voters in college dorms. These dorms often have complex, convoluted systems and addressing standards,” Spoto said during a Tuesday press briefing.
Although a federal judge ruled county boards of elections must reach out to voters before discarding ballots, the notice and cure process has not always proven to be effective, according to the Southern Coalition for Social Justice.
Dr. Jovita Lee, director of the North Carolina Black Alliance (NCBA), said SB 747 disproportionately impacts students attending North Carolina’s 11 historically black colleges and universities.
“Before Senate Bill 747, the Board of Elections would verify the addresses of same-day voters using various means. Now [voters] only get one letter and they may not know that their vote has been cancelled,” said Lee.
Expert analysis offered in a pre-trial brief indicates that young voters under the age of 26 overwhelmingly rely on same-day registration, making up between 30 and 40% of same-day registrants in a given election.
Jennifer Rubin, League of Women Voters of North Carolina
Plaintiffs’ expert Dr. Kevin Quinn is also expected to testify that historical elections data from 2010 to 2025 shows young voters were disproportionately more likely to rely on a second verification mailer to save their registration than any other age group, with approximately 20,000 individuals verified by using a second mailer.
The League of Women Voters of North Carolina is also a plaintiff in the federal case.
“When young people learn to vote early in their careers, they stay voters,” explained Jennifer Rubin, president of the League.
The League is concerned that a voter can do everything correctly, only to have their voice and vote canceled out.
Rubin said same-day registration has been one of the best ways to ensure that every eligible voter is able to cast a ballot – benefiting not only young adults and college students who tend to move more often, but also those who have changed their name, or missed the registration deadline.
“Disenfranchising voters over a piece of returned mail undermines trust, fairness and the integrity of our elections,” said Rubin.
Provision blocked in 2024 elections could be in play in ‘26
U.S. District Judge Thomas Schroeder initially issued an injunction that prevented election officials from using the “undeliverable mail provision” in the  2024 election cycle.
Attorneys for Republican legislative leaders argued the voting rights groups failed to prove the same-day registration policies in 747 caused any specific harm, and that their complaints were “speculative, generalized grievances.”
But Schroeder wrote in that temporary order that “By failing to provide voters with notice and opportunity to be heard, section 163-82.6B(d) creates an unacceptable risk that eligible voters’ ballots will be erroneously removed and not counted.”
In July, Schroeder rejected a motion by lawmakers for summary judgement.
Now the case returns to the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of North Carolina Monday, with an outcome that could have implications for the 2026 midterms.
As the case is being heard in Winston-Salem, Republican legislators will be back at the General Assembly redrawing congressional district maps to give Republicans a further advantage in the U.S. House.
Spoto, the attorney for the Southern Coalition, said the mid-decade redistricting announced just this week speaks to a broader, disappointing trend to cut back on voting rights.
“Whether it’s a matter of shaping the districts in a way that’s designed to harm voters from having their views expressed, things like SB 747, putting up barriers to people having their votes counted fairly–these all speak to problems our legislature is putting into place. It’s the exact opposite of how a democratic system should be operating.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/GettyImages-Voting-votingstickers.jpg,,,2025-10-14 16:58:47.236663

“It’s going to take us years to get these markets back,” Walz said Tuesday, calling on Trump to walk back his tariffs. 
China is the world’s largest consumer of soybeans, and the biggest international buyer of American soy, historically importing around one-quarter of the soybeans grown in the U.S. But in the aftermath of the trade war during Trump’s first term, China has instead become dependent on Brazilian soybeans.
In response to taxes Trump levied on American imports from China, China slapped an extra tax of 20% on American soybeans — giving a major price advantage to Brazil and other countries in the market. 
China typically begins buying American soy in October, but with the tariffs in place, farmers are facing an uncertain outlook. 
The Trump administration is considering a multibillion dollar bailout for American soy farmers, similar to how his administration handled the first trade war.
But soy farmers have insisted that a check won’t make up for the lost marketing opportunities. 
“We don’t want a bailout. We want markets for our crops,” said John Bartman, a corn and soybean farmer in Illinois. 
Bartman is featured in a new Democratic political ad, part of a new ad campaign targeting red districts in the Midwest. 
Tuesday’s press call coincided with Trump’s meeting with Argentina’s President Javier Milei. Trump has promised a $20 billion bailout of Argentina’s economy — which stands to benefit many Trump administration allies — drawing even more ire from the soybean industry and some Republicans. 
Hours after Trump announced the bailout, Argentina sold 20 shiploads of soybeans to China, and leaders opted to waive an export tax that effectively lowered the cost of the beans.
U.S. Rep. Sharice Davids, D-Kansas, who sits on the House Committee on Agriculture, said on Tuesday’s call that Democrats should spend more time in rural communities discussing farm economy issues. 
“We also need to send the message to the president that these chaotic tariffs, this reckless approach, this whiplash that people are feeling, is having real consequences,” Davids said.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/soybean_harvest_4-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-14 16:58:47.236663

(Via Terran Orbital)While Florida leads the nation in attracting and developing skilled workers, headwinds are approaching, according to Florida Commerce Secretary Alex Kelly.
Florida is now third in the nation in terms of total manufacturing companies, but only 10th in the number of manufacturing employees, at approximately 430,000. Since 2014, Florida has increased manufacturing employment by 23.3% and, in 2022, the average annual wage for manufacturing jobs was more than $74,000, according to the 2023 Florida Manufacturing Report.
Speaking before the House Careers and Workforce Subcommittee on Tuesday, Kelly discussed what he said was a “huge challenge” in getting young people interested in working in a skilled labor environment, saying a high salary isn’t always the driving factor.
Florida Department of Commerce Secretary Alex Kelly (Via his X page)
And he said that more than 50% of Florida’s manufacturing workforce is 45 years or older.
“Which is very disproportionately different than most of our other workforce sectors in Florida,” he said. “So, for all we’re doing, we’re just simply aging our retirements out of our manufacturing sector … faster than people coming into it.”
The nature of the state’s retiring workforce will remain constant until approximately 2035, Kelly said, when it will “arc back in the other direction. But that’s a 10-year challenge for us that will definitely require a lot of policymaking thought.”
That remark prompted state Rep. Rep. Allison Tant, D-Tallahassee, to ask the three members of the business community also appearing before the committee whether they were doing anything specifically to draw younger people into industry, specifically middle-school students, to avoid attrition in the manufacturing workforce before 2035.
Andy Norman, president and CEO of Lakeland’s GMF Steel, said it would take a combination of public and private efforts to encourage young people to enter trades and, specifically, construction management in the case of his company.
“We’re only graduating 250 students a year in the entire state of Florida in construction management out of five [state] universities,” he said, adding that the largest number is coming from the University of Florida, but only between 65 and 70 students.
He noted that as the largest producer of tonnage of structural steel in the state, “we’re having to train every single aspect of it because there’ s no formal training” at either a four-year or a technical institution for the skills required to work at his company.
Eddie Gonzalez Loumiet, chairman of the board at Ruvos, a Tallahassee IT services company, expressed concern about outdated computers in the K-12 school system, but said a real opportunity lies in teaching digital literacy to the parents of those students.
When Rick Scott led Florida as governor from 2011-2019, his administration offered hundreds of millions of dollars in economic incentives to recruit out-of-state businesses.
Committee Chairwoman Tiffany Esposito, R-Fort Myers, asked Kelly where he was philosophically when it comes to offering tax incentives to recruit businesses to Florida.
Kelly replied that the two biggest drivers for companies considering coming to Florida is the quality of the workforce and the physical location.
“No company is going to go somewhere in the time that we’re in if you don’t have the workforce and the site that can be a great host to that company,” he said.
He added that when a company that begins the conversation about moving to Florida by discussing tax incentives that’s an immediate “red flag” to his staff that perhaps that company isn’t seeking to stay long in the Sunshine State.

He announced Tuesday he was resigning due to health concerns. (Photo courtesy NM Senate GOP)A Republican state senator representing a Southeast New Mexico district announced Tuesday he was resigning immediately from his seat early in his first term, citing recent health concerns.
Sen. Nicolas Paul (R-Alamogordo) represented District 33, which contains parts of Chaves, Lincoln and Otero counties, beginning in January. 
“Serving the people of District 33 has been one of the greatest honors of my life,” Paul said in a statement. “I’m deeply grateful to the citizens of Otero, Lincoln and Chaves Counties for their trust and support. Together, we’ve worked hard to make our communities stronger, and I will always remain committed to the success of the district and New Mexico.”
Paul did not respond to Source New Mexico’s phone call, and a Senate GOP spokesperson said Paul would not be commenting further about his departure. 
During the 60-day legislative session, Paul sponsored or co-sponsored 14 pieces of legislation, most of them regarding crime, gambling and border security. Two of the bills related to gambling were pocket-vetoed. One that he co-sponsored with Democrats regarding state support of infrastructure projects became law. 
Paul did not attend the recent special legislative session.

To represent District 33, he won a three-way Republican primary in the 2024 election before running unopposed in the general election.
Because Paul’s district spans three counties, commissions in all three counties will meet soon to send a list of one or more proposed replacements to Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham, who has the final say. 
Senate GOP spokesperson Brandon Harris told Source on Tuesday that that process “has already begun,” given the short amount of time between now and the 30-day legislative session that starts on Jan. 20. 
Paul served on the Senate Judiciary Committee and the Tax, Business and Transportation Committee. He also served on the interim Courts and Criminal Justice Committee, Republican members of which recently toured the state’s biggest immigration detention center in Chaparral.

BRATTLEBORO — Ask administrators at Brattleboro Memorial Hospital about a multimillion-dollar operating budget shortfall and they’ll point to everything from too many unpaid patient bills to their own staff’s rising health insurance costs.
“We fully recognize that we are in a very bad financial condition,” one hospital official said at an Aug. 6 budget review hearing. “We need to increase cash and decrease our payables and receivables.”
Vermont health care regulators, for their part, cite a bigger problem: fiscal figures they say don’t add up.

READ MORE

“BMH has not accurately or completely answered many questions,” the state’s Green Mountain Care Board wrote in an Oct. 1 decision on hospital spending. “This missing, incomplete and inaccurate information makes it challenging to understand BMH’s current financial position.”
No one, for example, can pinpoint the exact sum of the shortfall attached to the $119 million annual budget that ended Sept. 30. At a Sept. 3 hearing, the board said hospital filings were projecting a deficit of $2.8 million and, at the same time, reporting a year-to-date loss of $10.8 million.
Regulators, expressing fears that “the hospital may be at risk of a sudden solvency crisis,” have told Brattleboro leaders to resubmit “corrected and accurate” budget numbers or risk becoming the first Vermont health care facility to receive outside intervention under a new state law.
As administrators revise their math, the hospital’s more than 500 staffers and 45,000 residents in its service area are questioning both the budget and this month’s unexplained leave of absence of CEO Christopher Dougherty.
Dougherty has referred all inquiries to the hospital’s communications office, which isn’t elaborating “out of respect for Chris’s privacy,” it has emailed corporators. 
The hospital also is limiting comment on its finances, saying only that administrators are cooperating with regulators. But the extent of the challenge can be gleaned from Green Mountain Care Board records, reports and recordings full of red ink.
‘Significant financial challenges’
The hospital, one of Brattleboro’s three largest employers, hasn’t reported a positive operating margin since 2020, according to board figures. But regulators didn’t initially see that as a red flag, as Vermont’s 13 other community hospitals also faced budget problems during the Covid-19 pandemic and a subsequent boom in patients that drove up spending.
Brattleboro, which ranks eighth in the state for net patient revenue, isn’t as large as Burlington’s University of Vermont Medical Center, Rutland Regional Medical Center or Berlin’s Central Vermont Medical Center, all which can offer more profitable subspecialties. On the flip side, Brattleboro’s 61-bed count isn’t small enough to be one of the state’s eight “critical access hospitals” (up to 25 beds in a rural location) that qualify for federal support.
Brattleboro’s financial plight became public in May, when the hospital warned it had four months to find $4 million in reductions and new revenue to balance its budget by Sept. 30.
“Like rural hospitals here in Vermont and across the nation, BMH faces significant financial challenges that have been imposed on us in large measure by both the state and federal governments,” Dougherty wrote in the email to community supporters.
The not-for-profit pointed to its status as the state’s only Medicare dependent hospital, meaning at least 60% of its admissions are Medicare patients age 65 or older. Brattleboro’s Medicare reimbursements for professional services have declined by almost 3% annually, Dougherty wrote. At the same time, the hospital is paying $600,000 a month in Vermont health care provider taxes — charged to facilities statewide — to help fund Medicaid expenditures for people with limited incomes.
“While part of that money comes back to us,” Dougherty wrote of the provider taxes, “the state recently reduced the percentage of annual return to less than 10%.”
‘System inefficiencies’
State regulators see the numbers differently. In last year’s budget decision, they noted that Brattleboro Memorial Hospital’s low Medicare payment-to-cost ratio, clinical productivity data and higher-than-average wait times indicated “system inefficiencies” that could be reduced through better management of expenses.
Hospital administrators went on to launch a hiring freeze and let go of six administrators in hopes of lowering its staff count from 543 last spring to 513 this fall. The hospital also recently won selection to a Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services’ Rural Community Hospital Demonstration project that helps with financial reimbursements. 
But during the state’s annual budget hearings in August, hospital administrators detailed an even longer list of troubles. Unpaid patient bills had risen as high as $50 million after the arrival of Covid-19 and a 2024 cyberattack on its electronic claims processor. And costs had increased for everything from a self-funded employee health benefit plan to salaries of travel nurses and other contract workers.
As for the future, administrators told the board the hospital could lose nearly $4 million a year if the federal government doesn’t extend a subsidy provided to Medicare-dependent and low-volume facilities. Another $700,000 is at risk annually if the hospital is dropped from a national drug pricing program called 340B that offers financial help. 
Administrators also are unsure about the impact of new U.S. tariffs and a coming switch from the OneCare Vermont accountable care organization, closing at the end of 2025, to another company.
In response, state regulators praised Brattleboro’s high scores in patient satisfaction before pointing out their own problems receiving budget data.
Asked to submit management salaries, for example, the hospital didn’t provide numbers but instead simply noted, “We were just recognized by the Lown Institute as the best hospital in Vermont for pay equity, which they measured using our CEO’s comp in comparison to a median (support) employee.”
‘Survival of the hospital’
After repeatedly requesting other facts and figures to no avail, regulators began to make noise.
“It’s not a surprise to Brattleboro Memorial Hospital that GMCB staff have been consistently concerned about the accuracy of information that’s been submitted,” Mark Hengstler, the regulators’ attorney, said at a recent hearing, underlining the board’s multiple inquiries.
“It is really hard to properly evaluate your budget when we just have discrepancies, inconsistencies and unanswered questions,“ added board member Jessica Holmes, a professor of health economics and public policy at Middlebury College. “I don’t think I’ve ever said that to a hospital in the 10 years that I’ve been doing this.”
According to the hospital, its two staffers charged with helping regulators had been busy addressing the shortfall.
“Our financial condition has really interfered with preparing and submitting the documentation,” Laura Bruno, the chief financial officer, told regulators in August. “I’ve been fully focused on the survival of the hospital.”
The board wasn’t swayed.
“I understand your financial condition and we’re very worried about it, and so we really need to ensure that the data that is submitted is accurate,” Holmes said in response. “Your regulator is asking you questions and it is your obligation to answer.”
The state reiterated that in its Oct. 1 budget ruling.
“Stated as directly as possible, we are deeply concerned about BMH’s solvency,” the board wrote. “We believe that its leadership must make big strides to adjust course.”
Since then, the hospital has announced Dougherty’s leave and the appointment of two new acting co-CEOs, orthopaedic surgeon Elizabeth McLarney and primary care physician Tony Blofson.
“While we do not yet have a budget resubmission date, we take the concerns in the budget order very seriously,” McLarney and Blofson said in a statement to VTDigger. “We are in the process of evaluating the hospital’s overall financial status and are making progress to secure an outside consultant to conduct a thoughtful and thorough evaluation of the issues raised.”
“We will be working with the GMCB to address all questions,” the acting co-CEOs added, “and will continue to do so moving forward.”
The state, for its part, said it would review the hospital’s revised budget once submitted — no date has been stipulated — and publicize any follow-up hearings.
“This is an important hospital, one that we feel very strongly needs to be there for the community,” board Chair Owen Foster said at a recent meeting. “Some of the data may not seem that important on the hospital side, but we rely on this to make really important decisions. The data needs to be right.”

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch) PERRY — JBS USA broke ground Tuesday on its “state of the art” sausage making facility and celebrated with city and state leaders a “turning point” for the Perry community. 
The roughly 110-acre site on the southeast side of Perry is slated to be operational a year from now and officials said the plant would add a second shift about six months later, to hit the full 500-job metric. 
JBS officials said Tuesday a portion of the sausage made at the facility will go to JBS’ recently purchased facility in Ankeny that will make ready-to-eat sausage and bacon. 
Rick Foster, president of JBS USA’s prepared foods division, said the Ankeny facility is scheduled to open partially in July and fully open when the Perry plant becomes operational.

JBS announced plans for the plant in May and was awarded a $12 million tax benefit from the Iowa Economic Development Authority board because nearly 60 jobs at the facility will offer salaries of $30 or higher per hour.
Iowa Secretary of Agriculture Mike Naig welcomed JBS to the site and said the plant would add “tremendous value” to Iowa’s pork industry. He said the value-added products made at the facility are part of Iowa’s story of “long-term strength” in the agriculture industry. 
“From an Iowa farm to JBS Perry to a plate here in Iowa or around the world, this is how it works,” Naig said. “This is how Iowa communities grow even stronger because of investments like this.” 
The groundbreaking occurred a little more than a year after a Tyson Foods pork processing facility, which employed nearly 1,300 people, closed in town.

Perry Mayor Dirk Cavanaugh said the plant and its associated benefits will bring jobs back to the community and help to boost the existing businesses in town. 
“JBS’ investment will bring a lot of opportunities to town, it will bring good jobs back to Perry so our residents don’t have a commute to work,” Cavanaugh said. “It will help us recover from last year’s setbacks.” 
Wesley Batista-Filho, CEO of JBS USA, said the company decided to build the facility from scratch, rather than converting an existing company, with the hopes that the factory will “be here 100 years from now.” 
Batista-Filho said the facility will produce 130 million pounds of sausage annually. According to Foster, that equates to roughly 200 million pounds of pork processed annually. 
Batista-Filho said the Ankeny facility, which the company announced in August it planned to buy, will help to “ramp up” the production in Perry. 
U.S. Rep. Zach Nunn attended the groundbreaking and said the JBS facilities in Iowa are an example of “what good pork spending looks like.” 
“We’re going to keep doing the same thing right in Washington, D.C. to make Perry’s success a model that can be replicated across the country,” Nunn said. 
In July, around 200 employees of a JBS plant in Ottumwa were terminated and had their visas revoked following steps from the Trump administration to change protected status for Haitian, Nicaraguan and Venezuelan nationals. JBS officials said Tuesday they did not have an update on the situation in Ottumwa. 
Foster said he is not concerned about the ability to hire workers for the Perry facility, even with ongoing immigration policy changes. 
“We’ve got very good feedback from the Perry community about the workforce and they’re kind of hungry for these jobs to come to the market, so we feel very strongly about the workforce that we’ll be able to put together,” Foster said. 
Rachel Wacker, the executive director for the Greater Dallas County Development Alliance, said the plant opening was “more than an economic milestone” but a “statement” that Perry is a town worth investing in. 
Wacker said through the hardship of shuttered plants, which account for a significant portion of the city’s jobs, the community has remained strong. 
“Today is a turning point, and today we plant the first stake in a sustainable future full of promise,” Wacker said.

(Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)   A nationwide coalition of organizations serving domestic violence survivors in 14 states and the District of Columbia recently notched another victory in its lawsuit to block the Trump administration from cutting off federal funding to groups that value diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI.)
A federal judge in Rhode Island on Friday granted a preliminary injunction against the departments of Health and Human Services (HHS) and Housing and Urban Development (HUD), halting grant policies directing grantee organizations to eliminate all DEI initiatives in their work or risk losing funding. 
U.S. District Court Judge Melissa DuBose’s ruling favored the plaintiffs in a lawsuit led by the Rhode Island Coalition Against Domestic Violence that included five other Rhode Island-based nonprofits. The plaintiffs had argued the new funding terms would imperil women and transgender youth experiencing homelessness and other populations their organizations serve. 
In court filings, attorneys for both federal agencies countered that the organizations’ only harm from the grant restrictions was financial in nature and therefore should be addressed by the U.S. Court of Federal Claims.
In a joint statement, the plaintiffs said DuBose’s decision “ensures that vital programs grounded in equity and compassion can continue uninterrupted.” 
“Domestic and sexual violence survivors, LGBTQI+ youth, and unhoused individuals deserve dignity and access to support without restrictions — it’s a relief and a win that gives us breathing room to continue this vital work,” the groups said. 
The other five Rhode Island organizations listed in the lawsuit include House of Hope Community Development Corporation, Community Care Alliance, Foster Forward, the Rhode Island Coalition to End Homelessness, and Haus of Codec.
The HHS grant policy, updated in April, prescribes that grantees “do not, and will not during the term of this financial assistance award, operate any programs that advance or promote DEI, DEIA, or discriminatory equity ideology in violation of Federal anti-discrimination laws.” Such language was stripped from the agency’s grant policy ahead of a July 24 hearing where DuBose temporarily granted relief to the housing and domestic violence relief groups.
HUD grant eligibility documentation online still notes the Trump administration’s goal of “ending radical and wasteful Government DEI programs and preferencing.”
DuBose, a Biden appointee, said the terms imposed by HHS and HUD were “likely unconstitutionally vague” because the agencies “do not clearly identify and define the contours of what is prohibited” when applying for grant funding.
“The phrases ‘promote gender ideology’ and ‘promote elective abortion’ obscure meaning like Russian dolls stacked inside each other,” DuBose wrote. “The plaintiffs stand between a rock and a hard place, and surely such a high stakes dilemma constitutes irreparable harm in the eyes of this court.”
DuBose added that the agencies failed to provide any explanation for the new rules or consider how they would affect vulnerable populations.
“To date, the defendants have failed to achieve even this basic requirement,” she wrote.
DuBose’s injunction orders HHS and HUD to treat their conditions as “null and void” and inform employees of the court’s order within two business days.

An HHS spokesperson did not immediately respond to request for comment. Rhode Island Current received an automated response after making an inquiry to HUD stating its public affairs office was “operating in a limited capacity” since the federal government shutdown began Oct. 1.
“Once the government is reopened, we look forward to being back in touch,” the email states.
The Rhode Island groups were joined by domestic violence prevention organizations in the District of Columbia and the following states: California, Colorado, Idaho, Iowa, Kansas, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Montana, North Carolina, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and Wisconsin.

(Photo via Roku)Roku, the smart TV company, has raised the eyebrows of Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier, who alleges the company sold children’s consumer data.
Uthmeier’s Office of Parental Rights is taking action against the tech company in the Collier County Circuit Court. Uthmeier opened that office in April in the interest of “putting our money where out mouth is.”
“We believe that Roku has taken, used, shared, and sold the personal, sensitive data of our consumers, namely, our kids, and that they’ve done so in violation of the Florida Digital Bill of Rights and the Florida Deceptive and Unfair Trade Practices Act,” Uthmeier said in a video posted to his social media.
Uthmeier said he believes Roku has used and sold data “regarding online preferences and behaviors of kids, videos and images that they might use online, even their location.”
“This is wrong and it violates Florida’s commitment to parental rights,” Uthmeier said.
In a news release, Uthmeier’s office said Roku “collected, sold, and enabled reidentification of sensitive personal data — including viewing habits, voice recordings, and other information from children — without authorization or meaningful notice to Florida families.”
The company didn’t protect parental consent or effectively disclose privacy controls and opt-out tools, the attorney general said.
The AG’s civil enforcement action targets Roku and its Florida subsidiary for violations of the laws mentioned above. He seeks civil penalties, injunctive relief, and measures ensuring Roku provides clearer disclosures and “lawful parental-control mechanisms.”
“Roku knows that some of its users are children but has consciously decided not to implement industry-standard user profiles to identify which of its users are children. Roku buries its head in the sand so that it can continue processing and selling children’s valuable personal and sensitive data,” the attorney general alleges in his 25-page complaint.
Roku forms partnerships with third-party data brokers “in an effort to avoid complying with Florida law,” Uthmeier contends.
One of the data brokers is Kochava, “a data broker with a long history of privacy violations and public scrutiny,” he wrote.
The complaint alleges that Roku does not perform age verification and thus does not comply with the Florida statute, passed in 2023. The Digital Bill of Rights was designed to protect children and others from big tech, the Phoenix reported at the time.

(Jordan Hansen / Daily Montanan)A Lewis and Clark County District Court judge found Gov. Greg Gianforte has the authority and responsibility to investigate a complaint filed against Montana Public Service Commission President Brad Molnar — and Molnar has a “duty to cooperate in the investigation.”
In the order, Judge Mike Menahan denied a motion to stop the governor from acting on a complaint filed against Molnar that alleged he was interfering with an internal investigation and should be suspended from elected office.
In Montana, the governor has the authority to suspend a commissioner if the commissioner fails to perform their duties, as described in state law.
Last month, the judge temporarily blocked Gianforte from suspending Molnar, finding the complaint against him was invalid, and that voters in his district would lose representation if he was suspended.
PSC Vice President Jennifer Fielder had filed the complaint with Gianforte, but Molnar alleged she did not follow agency policy in requesting the suspension, rendering her complaint unathorized.
Fielder made the complaint as chairperson of an internal Public Service Commission “response team” handling allegations of professional misconduct against Molnar. Fielder could not be immediately reached for comment early Tuesday afternoon.
Allegations against Molnar include that he was interfering with the investigation and engaged in sexual harassment, which included jokes or innuendo.
Molnar has denied interfering with the investigation. He earlier told the Daily Montanan he made a joke that he later was told had sexual innuendo, but he was not aware of any such reference.
PSC spokesperson Alana Lake said Tuesday she could not comment on the status of the investigation. Lake said Molnar had removed her role as the agency’s media contact, and she apologized for the inconvenience.
“I do not believe this (removal) is in line with our policies, so will be challenging this, but I don’t want to overstep until this is solidified,” Lake said in an email.
Molnar said Tuesday he has not been presented with results of the investigation but said he was told roughly one week ago that it would need to be redone. He said the court order appears to give governors the ability to suspend any commissioner based on an unsubstantiated complaint.
“This is a far-, far-, far-reaching case,” Molnar said.
A spokesperson for Gianforte could not be reached early Tuesday afternoon for comment on the status of the complaint to the governor. The Governor’s Office did not take a position on the court case.
In the motion to the court, Molnar alleged Fielder had failed to follow internal policies before filing the complaint, including that she obtain four affirmative votes by commissioners, and therefore, the complaint was invalid.
In the order Friday, Menahan said the court agrees “there are questions whether Fielder acted in violation of internal policy when she sent the complaint” to the governor.
However, the judge also said Molnar’s arguments that Fielder didn’t follow internal policies are not relevant to the governor’s authority to act on the complaint.
He said Montana law is simple and unambiguous.
“The governor has the authority to act when a complaint is presented to him or her,” said the order. “While Molnar argues that the governor’s review and suspension is triggered only upon the filing of a ‘valid’ complaint, the statute contains no such requirement.”
The judge also said the harms that Molnar outlined are either speculative or largely against others — the public. In this case, the judge said Molnar is not representing electors.
And the judge said a prerequisite for a preliminary injunction — in this case, to tie the hands of the governor — is that “the applicant” himself is likely to suffer harm.
The order acknowledged Molnar identified personal injuries too, but the judge said they are, at this point, “entirely speculative.”
“Any harm to Molnar would occur only if, following the governor’s investigation into the allegations in the complaint, he found good cause to suspend Molnar and acted to do so,” the judge wrote.
The judge said the four factors that determine whether a preliminary injunction is warranted all tipped in Fielder’s favor, and Molnar was unlikely to succeed on the merits.
In an email, lawyer Matthew Monforton, representing Molnar, said he and his client were disappointed with the ruling.
Molnar had alleged the attempt to suspend him comes out of his firm stance that NorthWestern Energy should be transparent and the Public Service Commission should not help it operate in the dark.
“Governor Gianforte and the big utilities are one step closer to completely hijacking the PSC from Montana voters,” Monforton said in an email.
PSC spokesperson Lake earlier said the allegations against Molnar are unrelated to NorthWestern Energy, the state’s largest public utility.
At a meeting in September, PSC staff had asked commissioners to not rescind the complaint filed with the Governor’s Office. Staff expressed support for Molnar’s experience and commitment but concern over his refusal to participate in the investigation.
Molnar took office in January 2025, but he earlier served on the PSC in 2007 when it denied the sale of NorthWestern to an Australian company, Babcock and Brown Infrastructure, and then saw Babcock and Brown file for bankruptcy.
NorthWestern recently announced a merger with Black Hills Corp, and it also has a major settlement pending with the Public Service Commission.

Jackson Women’s Health Organization decision, which ended the legal right to abortion. (Photo by Emma Davis/ Maine Morning Star)Maine’s U.S. Senate primary is now teed up as a test for the future of the Democratic Party. 
With Gov. Janet Mills’ official campaign launch Tuesday, the Democratic primary field for Republican U.S. Sen. Susan Collins’ seat not only got more crowded but is primed for a battle between growing grassroots momentum and the establishment. 
Mills, who was scouted by and launched her campaign with the financial backing of national Democrats, will face a Democratic field of otherwise largely political newcomers. So far, most of the momentum has been building behind Graham Platner, an oysterman and military veteran from Sullivan who was scouted by unions and community groups. 
Platner’s campaign is centered around breaking away from the Democratic establishment. He says he’s running not just to become a senator but to build out a lasting structure for grassroots politics in the Pine Tree State.
“I have held over twenty town halls in every corner of Maine, from Rumford to Madawaska to Portland. Everywhere I hear the same thing: people are ready for change,” Platner said in a statement Tuesday. “They know the system is broken and they know that politicians who have been working in the system for years, like Susan Collins, are not going to fix it.”
He and many of the other Democratic challengers welcomed Mills into the race Tuesday, calling primaries an essential part of the democratic process. One dropped out, while another called Mills’ bid a mistake for the party, echoing an earlier critique made by independent Vermont U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, who endorsed Platner.
“It’s disappointing that some Democratic leaders are urging Governor Mills to run,” Sanders wrote on social media earlier this month. “We need to focus on winning that seat & not waste millions on an unnecessary & divisive primary.”
The Senate GOP’s top super PAC made a similar point. In a statement Tuesday, executive director Alex Latcham called the Maine Democratic primary “increasingly toxic.” 
“The only thing Mills has gotten right in her career is praising Senator Susan Collins’ effective and proven leadership,” Latcham wrote. “So while Democrats fight among themselves, Senator Collins will keep doing what she’s always done — delivering for Maine families.”
Collins did not respond to a request for comment about Mills entering the race nor Mills’ critique of Collins in her launch video as someone who has “forgotten their principles” and let bullies like President Donald Trump “have their way.” 
In Collins’ hometown, Platner brings his grassroots pitch to The County

Collins hasn’t officially announced she’s seeking reelection, though she’s told Maine Morning Star she intends to run and has already raised millions to support her campaign. ​​Maine Republicans have rejected the idea of forcing a primary on Collins, though there are two longshot Republican challengers.
A large Democratic primary field has some benefits for both voters and candidates, said Mark Brewer, chair of the political science department at the University of Maine. Voters have a bigger menu of options to choose from, while candidates get campaign experience before the general election, including debates.  
“That can be beneficial, especially, for inexperienced candidates,” Brewer said.
After Mills’ announcement Tuesday, another Democratic candidate Jordan Wood, a former congressional aide, called for debates in all 16 counties. 
“This campaign is about courage, accountability, and who has what it takes to defeat Susan Collins, defend our democracy, and deliver for working families,” Wood said in a statement. “I’m ready to make that case on the debate stage – and in every county across Maine.”
But there are also downsides. It can deplete resources — money, staff — for the general election. But Brewer sees a bigger downside in candidates from the same party beating each other up, exposing flaws that provide general election opponents hints on how to attack that candidate down the line. Research has shown that bitter primaries hurt high-profile candidates’ chances in general elections.
That’s top of mind for Keith Endy of Presque Isle, who attended a town hall Platner hosted in Caribou, Collins’ hometown, earlier this month. 
“I am concerned about that one, just because if she enters the race, you are gonna have basically the entire establishment against Graham,” Endy said of Mills. 
With Mills now officially in the race, Brewer sees the candidate pool essentially shrinking to two or three people. Even if other candidates don’t formally withdraw, he said, “she will take a lot of the oxygen out of the room.” 
So far, only Dan Kleban, co-founder of Maine Beer Company, has officially suspended his campaign in light of Mills’ entrance. He also endorsed Mills. 
“I entered this race because I believe Washington needs more leaders who put people before politics and who will fight every day to make life better for Maine families,” Kleban said in a video announcing his campaign suspension. “While our message was right, the timing isn’t. Governor Mills is the right leader for this moment and is in the best position to win.”
No one else has formally withdrawn so far, though little-known Natasha Alcala of Madawaska said she’s considering quitting.
Before Mills’ official announcement, another Democratic candidate, David Evans, ​​an Army veteran and former Pentagon policy writer, entered the race on Oct. 1. He said he will stay in through the primary next June. 
“Janet Mills and I both care deeply about Maine,” Evans said on Tuesday. “I look forward to a primary focused on solutions, not divisions and on delivering real solutions at the national level.”
Tucker Favreau, an Army veteran who works in cybersecurity, said Mills’ decision to enter the race has only energized him to grow his campaign more. While he said Mainers deserve a pool of candidates to choose from in the primary, he thinks Mills’ campaign is a mistake. 
“She could have helped mentor multiple candidates throughout this race and helped Maine Democrats build a deep bench of candidates for multiple future races,” Favreau said. “Instead, she has chosen to run for a position which she would likely only be able to occupy for one term.”
Mills has already pledged to serve only one term in the U.S. Senate if elected, according to an interview with the Boston Globe. When Collins, who is approaching 30 years in Congress, was first elected in 1996, she had pledged to not serve more than two terms.

DemasTwo bills addressing earmark transparency rules, adopted by the Legislature during this year’s budget battle, are moving closer to becoming state law.
Members of the Senate Appropriations Committee on Tuesday adopted changes to House Bill 4420 and Senate Bill 596 before the committee reported both bills to the Senate floor. 
The upper chamber’s bill, if passed, will next move to the House for final consideration and concurrence. Members of the House already passed their portion of the legislation, and Senate passage would position the legislation to move next to Gov. Gretchen Whitmer.
House Bill 4420 and Senate Bill 596 are tie-barred, so they need to pass and be signed by Whitmer in tandem to become law.
The bipartisan, bicameral effort appears to be on a fast track, however, after the new rules were a key piece of the bargain when lawmakers agreed to a budget deal earlier this month. 
Both bills are based on that framework, which the House adopted as new rules in the early stages of the budget process. The lower chamber dictated that any earmark proposed in its spending plan would have to be made public, with the sponsoring legislator’s name attached, and that only earmarks designated to non-profit organizations would make the final cut. Many of the proposed earmarks, listed on a public website for scrutiny’s sake, did not end up in the final proposal put forward by the House in August.
In the months leading up to final negotiations on the budget, House Speaker Matt Hall (R-Richland Township) implored his Senate colleagues to do the same. At the same time, state Rep. Rep. Tom Kunse (R-Clare) introduced House Bill 4420 in May. It was passed unanimously in the House on May 4.
The Senate eventually joined the party as earmark transparency for both chambers became part of the negotiations. On the eve of its vote to adopt a conference budget earlier this month, and days after the new fiscal year began, the Senate Appropriations Committee held a hearing to disclose its earmarks before they became part of the final package.
With that battle behind them, both chambers appear eager to reform the earmark process and make the new rules set in stone for the entire Legislature. Since the House already passed its version of the proposal, the Senate is now tasked with keeping the momentum.
Members of the Senate Appropriations Committee on Oct. 8 met to discuss Senate Bill 596 but did not take any action.
Michigan Senate appropriators hold first hearing on new earmark rules in wake of budget fight

On Tuesday, senators held further discussions on their version and also House Bill 4420, featuring testimony from Kunse, its sponsor.
State Sen. Sarah Anthony (D-Lansing), the committee’s chair, said the adopted changes reflect conversations between the House and Senate – not just in the last budget cycle and directly afterward, but over the course of the past three years.
The new version of Senate Bill 596 gives a clearer definition for earmarks to help compare them against regular government spending. There is also a new disclosure and disbursement process baked into the substitute bill including rules that prohibit earmarks going to for-profit entities and new requirements for eligible non-profit organizations. For the latter, the non-profits slated to receive funding must have a long history in Michigan of stable operations. 
A requirement for posting the proposed earmarks to each chamber’s legislative website are included in the changes, as well as a new mandate for hearings on the earmarks before the are proposed in either chamber’s budget plans.
Similar changes were made to House Bill 4220. Kunse said the proposals are fairly straightforward. The House bill will dictate the form and manner for submitting the earmarks and the Senate bill will focus on the overarching rules related to what is eligible or not.
Some questions from legislators dealt with why for-profit companies were excluded and if there was a deadline to turn in new earmark requests, given that the Legislature has a June 1 statutory deadline – which is not often enforced – for both chambers to pass their spending plans.
Anthony said there were far more transparency mechanisms with non-profits that make the money and the companies easier to track. A representative from Kunse’s office also said the timing piece was still a topic of discussion.
Both bills were ultimately reported and moved to the Senate floor.

The state Chamber of Commerce and Manufacturers Alliance will form South Carolina Manufacturers and Commerce, which will represent more than 900 business owners. The merger will officially take effect Jan. 1.
“Both organizations for decades have worked together on a variety of issues, and this was an opportunity to come together and build an organization that’s just bigger, better and stronger together,” said Sara Hazzard, who will lead the combined group.
The combined organization will build on major investments companies have made in the state in recent years, such as the $2 billion Scout Motors electric vehicle assembly plant just north of Columbia, said Hazzard, who has led the Manufacturers Alliance since 2018.
The two advocacy groups tossed around the idea of becoming one for years, but with the recent momentum, the time seemed right, Hazzard said.
The combined advocacy group is still hammering out the specifics of its policy goals, leaders said. At the top of the agenda will be pushes to reform the state’s taxes to be more competitive for business, increase access to affordable energy, reform the way lawsuits are handled, and ensure residents have the skills to enter the workforce, Hazzard said.

Tick found on a dog in Franklin County has implications for animal and human health.,"Kansas health and agriculture officials say Asian longhorned tick — an exotic, invasive species with cattle and human health implications — has been identified for the first time in Kansas. The tick was tested after taken from a dog in Franklin County. (Kansas State University)
TOPEKA — Kansas officials issued a public notice after testing confirmed the invasive Asian longhorned tick was identified in Franklin County and posed an emerging threat to animal and human health.
It was the first known detection in Kansas of the prolific tick, which afflicts wildlife, pets and livestock. The tick is a hazard for cattle as it infects red and white blood cells and causes weakness, fever, loss of appetite or death.
The reddish-brown tick is known to carry a variety of pathogens and has proven efficient at establishing populations in new areas due to its ability to reproduce without mating. In Asia, the tick has transmitted a virus causing human hemorrhagic fever.
“Right now, our concern is mainly for cattle,” said Gregg Hanzlicek, a Kansas State University professor and associate director of the Kansas Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory. “But like any tick, people should take precautions: wear long sleeves, use insect repellent and check for ticks after being in grassy or wooded areas.”
He said the report didn’t mean Kansas had a widespread population of the tick, but the public should be aware of the insect and diseases they carry.
The Kansas Department of Health and Environment said laboratory analysis identified the tick after it was found on a dog in Franklin County.
“We’re still learning about this tick and the ecologic role that it currently plays and may play in the future in terms of disease transmission to humans,” said Erin Petro, KDHE’s public health veterinarian. “While the human health implications are uncertain, this tick has serious implications for animal health.”
The Asian longhorned tick was initially found in 2017 in New Jersey, then spread westward to more than 20 states. Kansas was the most recent documented location.
Kansas animal health commissioner Justin Smith, of the Kansas Department of Agriculture, said the agency had monitored migration of the tick since it was confirmed in neighboring states.
“Now that it has been identified in Kansas, we have been in contact with accredited veterinarians across the state to remind them to be alert for this tick and to ensure they understand the risks,” Smith said.
In 2024, KDHE piloted a program to create a tick surveillance network. Participating veterinary clinics submit tick samples from animals in their care to KDHE. One of these partners submitted the sample identified as the Asian longhorned tick by KDHE and confirmed by the U.S. Department of Agriculture.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Asian-tick-via-ksu-image-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-10-14 15:57:18.186644

The Pride Center of Vermont is keeping its support hotline active amid its recent closure, in partnership with the Vermont Network’s Steps to End Domestic Violence.
Operating since 1999, the longtime nonprofit announced a pause in services Friday due to a funding shortfall, and the board issued a call to raise approximately $350,000 needed to restore operations.
In the meantime, the center’s support line remains active and will redirect to the Steps to End Domestic Violence’s hotline, according to Monica Allard, co-chair of the Pride Center’s Board of Directors.

When she heard about the closure Friday, Nicole Kubon, executive director of Steps, said she immediately called the hotline’s director.
“They are one of our sister organizations through the Vermont Network — a statewide coalition that supports domestic and sexual violence survivor organizations,” she said. “I said, ‘What can we do to help?’ And we just made a plan.”
Operating for at least three decades, the StepsVT hotline at 802-658-1996 runs 24/7 and offers victims of domestic violence a free, confidential pathway to resources and referrals. Last year, the organization received about 2,800 calls or about 54 calls each week, according to Kubon.
The SafeSpace Anti-Violence Program at the Pride Center is a confidential phone help line at 802-863-0003 and secure chat online for LGBTQ+ Vermonters, or in Spanish on WhatsApp at 802-860-7812, for those who have experienced violence, abuse, bias, hate and discrimination. Advocates are available for calls or chats between 10 a.m. and 6 p.m. Monday to Thursday and from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. on Fridays, according to the website.
The partnership effectively makes the hotline available 24/7. Both hotlines remain active, Allard said, so it doesn’t matter which number callers use.
Created with grant funding as an independent nonprofit in the early 2000s, SafeSpace merged with the Pride Center in 2007. It currently consists of a full-time director, a full-time advocate and a part-time advocate, according to Allard.
The staff, who were laid off Friday, will be paid in full for time worked, as well as up to two weeks of accrued time off, and receive health benefits until at least the end of the month, the board announced Monday.
“We recognize that this does not provide enough support for some staff and are exploring additional ways to reduce the harm of this sudden crisis,” the board’s latest statement reads. “This includes, but is not limited to, providing free access to financial planning assistance and job search assistance, while simultaneously acknowledging and amplifying staffs’ independent fundraising efforts.”
While the closure of the Pride Center leaves a major hole in services for LGBTQ+ people, Kubon said she is cautiously hopeful that other programs across the state can rally to provide that support.
“We certainly already work with LGBTQ+ survivors, and we’ve had a strong partnership with Pride Center and Safe Space for many years,” she said.
In the meantime, the board is assessing the organization’s finances to figure out what went wrong and to create a plan to move forward. 
“The outpouring of support has given us hope that the Center can be relaunched in the future with stronger accountability, governance and sustainability from the ground up,” the board’s statement reads. It also directs clients to partner organizations such as Vermont Cares, Vermont Network Against Domestic and Sexual Violence, Howard Center Substance Use & Recovery Support, Pathways Mental Health Urgent Care and the LBGTQ+ National Hotline.
 “We expect to have more information in the coming days to share about our partnership with the Vermont Network,” Allard said Monday.

Whitehouse links rising insurance costs to climate change at Raleigh roundtable,Christine Zhu,,,,,https://ncnewsline.com/2025/10/14/us-sen-whitehouse-links-rising-insurance-costs-to-climate-change-in-raleigh-roundtable/,Whitehouse has served as the ranking member of the Committee on Environment and Public Works since January 2025.,"U.S. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse joined U.S. Rep. Deborah Ross at the Walnut Creek Wetlands Center in Raleigh on Oct. 14, 2025. (Christine Zhu/NC Newsline) 






	U.S. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, a Democrat representing Rhode Island, held a roundtable in Raleigh on Tuesday to address climate change driving up insurance costs.
Speaking at the Walnut Creek Wetlands Center, Whitehouse joined U.S. Rep. Deborah Ross (NC-02), the North Carolina League of Conservation Voters and Partners for Environmental Justice to address concerns from local experts, community leaders and residents.
Whitehouse is in his fourth term in the Senate. He has served as the ranking member of the Committee on Environment and Public Works since January 2025.
Whitehouse said his home state of Rhode Island faces some of the same environmental challenges as North Carolina. Rhode Island is subject to rain bursts — sudden amounts of precipitation in a short period of time — that can flood rivers and overwhelm sewage treatment facilities. The Ocean State also has rising sea levels, coastal storms, and erosion.
“Those are familiar topics to you here in North Carolina – upland river flooding from rain bursts and coastal erosion and storms tearing away at your coastal communities,” Whitehouse said.
Flooding, storm water, and storm control are familiar issues to Ross’s constituents in the second congressional district, she said, but they are less common in other parts of the state.
She referenced Hurricane Helene sweeping through western North Carolina last year and sending floodwaters through the mountainous terrain at an unprecedented level.
“It is a new [issue] to the North Carolina mountains and to many other areas in this country that are feeling the effects of climate change that have been spreading and worsening over time,” Ross said.
This raises costs for homeowners insurance, according to Whitehouse. He talked about insurance companies deeming properties too risky due to concerns with climate change, which then leads to increased rates for families.
A poll found that 92% of voters in Texas are worried about the costs of their home insurance rising due to severe weather like hurricanes and flooding, Whitehouse said, referencing a roundtable he held in Houston in August.
“This is actually everywhere, and it opens a new era of a climate conversation that will give us the political power to solve the problem before it gets devastatingly worse,” he said.
Dan Crawford, senior director of public affairs at the NCLCV, said North Carolina is on the front lines of this conversation. He said the state now has the third highest rate of property insurance policy cancellations in the country.
In some coastal counties, more than one in 10 homeowners lost their coverage in 2023, he said.
“The message is clear: You can’t solve the insurance crisis without also addressing the climate crisis,” Crawford said. “Rising risk means rising cost, and unless we take action to make our communities more resilient and reduce the pollution driving these disasters, North Carolinians will continue to pay that price.”
State Commissioner of Insurance Mike Causey didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment on the issue.
Community members at the roundtable shared stories of losing a business in Chapel Hill due to flooding and neighborhoods being destroyed from Tropical Storm Chantal in July.
Others expressed concerns over policy, especially with cuts to resources like the National Weather Service, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, and the National Flood Insurance Program.
Whitehouse said the NFIP “isn’t sound or fair now” and needs restructuring. Improvements should include better mapping, allowing people to know when they’re really at risk, and options for people to be able to get assistance to relocate before they have to rebuild their homes, he said.

Causó una polémica entre activistas conservadores y religiosos, quienes afirmaron que permitiría a los adultos traficar menores.","This article is also available in English. Read it here.
El gobernador Gavin Newsom firmó el domingo un proyecto de ley que permite ampliar la lista de   familiares que pueden asumir el cuidado de los niños si sus padres son deportados, una medida que había provocado una tormenta de críticas conservadoras.
El Proyecto de Ley 495 también prohibirá a los proveedores de guarderías recopilar información de inmigración sobre un niño o sus padres, y permitirá a los padres nominar a un guardián legal temporal para su hijo.
 “Queremos dejar constancia de que apoyamos a nuestras familias y su derecho a mantener segura su información privada, mantener los derechos de los padres y ayudar a las familias a prepararse en caso de emergencias”, dijo Newsom en un comunicado de prensa.
Esta fue una de varias medidas que la legislatura, dominada por los demócratas, impulsó este año en respuesta a la agresiva represión de las deportaciones de la administración Trump en Los Ángeles y en toda California. Newsom firmó varios proyectos de ley —que prohíben a los agentes del Servicio de Inmigración y Control de Aduanas (ICE) usar mascarillas y exigen que las escuelas y los hospitales exijan órdenes judiciales cuando los agentes se presenten— en una ceremonia celebrada en Los Ángeles el mes pasado.
Newsom dejó la Ley 495 sin decidir durante semanas, lo que desencadenó una oleada de activismo por parte de grupos defensores de los derechos de los inmigrantes para conseguir su firma ante la intensa oposición de los activistas conservadores. El gobernador anunció su decisión un día antes de la fecha límite para firmar o vetar los más de 800 proyectos de ley que los legisladores le enviaron el mes pasado.
El aspecto más controvertido del proyecto de ley se refiere a un formulario poco conocido y de décadas de antigüedad llamado declaración jurada de autorización del cuidador. Los familiares de un niño cuyos padres no están presentes, y con quienes vive el niño, pueden certificar ser su guardián; esta designación permite al adulto matricular al niño en la escuela, llevarlo al médico y dar su consentimiento para recibir atención médica y dental.
La nueva ley ampliará la posibilidad de  quién puede ser considerado como guardián, pasando de las definiciones más tradicionales de parientes a cualquier adulto de la familia que tenga parentesco consanguíneo, adoptivo o de ‘afinidad dentro del quinto grado’, lo que incluye a personas como tías abuelas o primos. Los padres pueden cancelar la designación de guardián, que es un acuerdo temporal y no otorga la custodia a esa persona.
 Los defensores afirmaron que los padres en riesgo de deportación deberían poder elegir a alguien de confianza para cuidar a sus hijos si el ICE los detiene. Ampliar la elegibilidad para el formulario de cuidadores, señalaron, ofrece a los padres inmigrantes más opciones, ya que, aunque no tengan familiares cercanos en el país, se benefician de fuertes vínculos con familiares o redes comunitarias informales.
 La legislación fue respaldada por grupos de derechos de los inmigrantes y defensores de los niños, como la Alianza para los Derechos de los Niños y First 5 California.
 “Presenté este proyecto de ley para que los niños no tengan que preguntarse qué les pasará si sus padres no pueden recogerlos de la escuela”, dijo la autora del proyecto de ley, la asambleísta Celeste Rodríguez , demócrata de Arleta, en una conferencia de prensa reciente. 
 Los críticos afirman que desconocidos podrían obtener la custodia
 Pero los republicanos, la derecha religiosa y los activistas en defensa de los derechos de los padres argumentaron que el proyecto de ley pondría en peligro a los niños.
Afirmaron que permitiría a desconocidos firmar la declaración jurada y reclamar al niño bajo su cuidado. Cientos de opositores acudieron al capitolio en Sacramento en autobuses para manifestarse contra la legislación, organizada por el pastor Jack Hibbs, de la megaiglesia Calvary Chapel Chino Hills, quien la calificó como “el proyecto de ley más peligroso que hemos visto”. Parte de la reacción negativa se debió a afirmaciones falsas de que el proyecto de ley permitiría a desconocidos obtener la custodia de niños con quienes no tienen parentesco.
 El asambleísta Carl DeMaio, republicano de San Diego, calificó la legislación como “el sueño de un traficante de personas”.
 En un correo electrónico, Greg Burton, vicepresidente del Consejo de Familia de California, cuestionó el hecho de que los padres podrían no estar presentes cuando se firma el formulario de declaración jurada.
 “¿Qué son los derechos parentales?”, escribió. “Estos derechos no sirven de nada si otra persona puede reclamarlos simplemente firmando un formulario”.
 Durante el verano, Rodríguez limitó la legislación para excluir a los “miembros de la familia extendida no emparentados”, pero no fue suficiente para calmar la controversia. La legislación se aprobó siguiendo las directrices del partido.
En comparación con una legislatura bastante progresista, el gobernador se ha posicionado a menudo como una fuerza moderadora en cuestiones de custodia y protección infantil, lo que suele movilizar a activistas conservadores y poner a los demócratas californianos a la defensiva. En 2023, vetó un proyecto de ley que habría obligado a los jueces de los tribunales de familia a considerar el apoyo de los padres a la transición de género de un menor en las disputas por la custodia.
 En una conferencia de prensa la semana pasada en la que los activistas instaron a Newsom a firmar el proyecto de ley, Angélica Salas, directora ejecutiva de la Coalición por los Derechos Humanos de los Inmigrantes de Los Ángeles, pidió al gobernador “que no escuche las mentiras, que no escuche todas las demás cosas que se dicen sobre este proyecto de ley”.
 Al anunciar su decisión, Newsom reconoció discretamente la controversia en un comunicado de prensa. Incluyó declaraciones que, según él, “corrigen el expediente” sobre las tergiversaciones y afirmó que la nueva ley no modifica el hecho de que los derechos parentales y las tutelas legales deben ser decididos por los jueces de los tribunales de familia.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/020825_Duran-Family_JAJ_CM_01.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-10-14 14:57:23.481296

Innovate Mississippi is a nonprofit organization trying to connect entrepreneurs with investors and other resources across the state.,"Mississippi has bemoaned its lack of technology startups and venture capital since the first dot-com boom in the mid 1990s. 
Innovate Mississippi believes it might have a solution. It is providing funding and training to seven Mississippi tech startups through a 12-week program.
Alex Bucklew and Johnathan McAdory had an idea for a product that would find the best price for prescription drugs by aggregating discounts from a variety of sources. Their company, SimpleScript, is their first try at starting a business. For Bucklew and McAdory, Innovate Mississippi’s accelerator has taught them how to grow their business. 
 ”Especially something that’s scalable to the level (SimpleScript) is, it can be difficult to figure out what to do next. We needed some counsel on how to get from point A to point B.” said Bucklew. “From working with CoBuilders we will be ready to get funding.”
Mississippi has a nascent tech scene and state leaders have struggled with how to grow it. Innovate Mississippi is a nonprofit organization trying to connect entrepreneurs with investors and other resources across the state.
“With  3 million people in Mississippi, we’ve gotta do a lot of work just to find the business that needs the mentor three hours away, that needs the accounting person,” said Tony Jeff, the CEO and president of Innovate. “We connect those dots.”
Jeff says that without this connection, founders would turn to other states for funding and resources. 
CoBuilders, Innovate’s 12-week startup accelerator, mentors and trains Mississippi entrepreneurs on how to get their company and product ready to show to investors. Innovate, which is funded through a mix of public and private money, also invests $25,000 into each company.
This year’s cohort of seven companies has been refining its products to pitch to investors on Nov. 11. On pitch day, they’ll be looking to raise upwards of $100,000 each. Unlike other small businesses, startups are focused on rapid growth and capturing a large share of a market. 
To support this they usually rely on raising money from outside investors. In the early stages of a startup, companies often look to “angel investors,” wealthy individuals or groups that invest a small amount in a company. 
Jeff said it’s not enough for founders to have a polished pitch, they need to have researched their competitors and received feedback from users.
Leta Palmiter’s company, Vertical Take-Off Reading, is currently in its third pilot round and has over 130 students using it.

The software she created with co-founder Ben Stasa, measures students’ oral reading skills. As a speech therapist and executive director of a nonprofit that serves dyslexic students, Palmiter saw students needed one-on-one help with reading that teachers just didn’t have the time for. She looked for a tool to help her measure her students’ ability to read out loud but couldn’t find anything. So she decided to do it herself.
Vertical’s program can be used in a classroom or at home on any device with a microphone. A child reads out loud while the app records it then creates a report for the teacher to measure the student’s progress.

Reading out loud helps with comprehension and is especially important for students with dyslexia. Palmiter says that Vertical is designed to complement teaching, not replace it.
“ We know that it’s doing a great job measuring that accuracy at that sound level and that kind of data will drive instruction,” said Palmiter.
She met Stasa, a doctoral student in computer science at the University of Southern Mississippi, who was tackling the same problem. Palmiter said that working together helped bring the product to market. 
Mississippi’s colleges are playing an active role in growing the startup pipeline, funding research and fostering new ideas. Innovate works with universities to host pitch competitions and connect to founders.
“ There’s a lot of resources that the schools and universities help support tech entrepreneurs,” said Ricky Romanek founder of ClaimTra,  a healthcare analytics tool for hospitals and clinics to recover insurance claims.
Jeff says that students regularly tell him that they plan on leaving Mississippi because it lacks good job opportunities for them. While it’s a small slice of the economy, Jeff thinks the tech sector could play a role in addressing Mississippi’s brain drain problem.
“ There are a slice of Mississippians that these are the best and most exciting ways for them to stay here, be gainfully employed, and even move people here,” said Jeff. 
It can be difficult finding the right companies for the accelerator. They need to be innovative companies, often in the tech sector, that are early in development and have high growth potential.
“It is very obvious we have more money chasing deals than we have deals. So we’ve got to get everything we can to make every startup qualified for that money,” said Jeff. That’s where Innovate comes in, nurturing home-grown companies and attracting new companies to Mississippi.
Romanek has brought Innovate “ a couple other crazy ideas” before and is excited to contribute to Mississippi’s tech industry.
Romanek said: “ I think there’s a huge startup potential in Mississippi that’s untapped. There’s a lot of great ideas. I don’t think they’re aware of all the resources that are available.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/09141648/Innovate-Mississippi-event-2.jpg,,,2025-10-14 14:57:23.481296

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)Tuition at the University of Utah will be free for some students with families earning less than $100,000 a year, the state’s flagship higher education institution announced Tuesday morning.
With a new initiative called the Utah Promise, the school is set to cover tuition and mandatory fees for up to four years of full-time enrollment starting in fall 2026 with scholarships and grants. 
The program will be available for undergraduate students who are Utah residents and whose household income and assets are each less than $100,000 annually. The effort has been designed to expand access to higher education across the state, according to a news release from the university.

“This is a transformative step for the University of Utah,” Taylor Randall, University of Utah president said in a statement. “No student should have to choose between pursuing a college education and their family’s financial security. Utah Promise ensures that higher education is within reach for thousands of talented students across our state.” 
To qualify for the program, Utah students must be first-time, first-year undergraduate students who graduated from high school with a 3.5 or higher unweighted GPA. Eligible students must also apply for admission by the University of Utah’s Dec. 1 priority deadline and complete their Free Application for Federal Student Aid, also known as FAFSA, by Feb. 1.
Students will remain eligible as long as they file the FAFSA form every year and their families maintain their qualifying income and assets. Recipients must also complete full-time course loads every semester and keep a cumulative 3.5 GPA or higher.
The program also adds to another effort the university is testing, guaranteeing admission to the state’s highest performing high school students in certain school districts. It was estimated that about 5,000 students would qualify for that initiative. It also joins other initiatives to simplify and streamline the school’s merit scholarship process, the university said.



Let us know what you think...


 


As trust in higher education, according to a Gallup poll, recovers from a 2023 and 2024 low, and the Utah Legislature explores ways to reshape the public higher education system to accommodate programs that will launch students’ careers into a trade quicker, the University of Utah also witnessed historic enrollment and completion numbers this year.
This fall, the university had the largest incoming class in its 175-history, the U. said in a news release — 6,513 first-year students and 1,497 new transfer students.
Enrollment in the university has grown for the last six years. It increased almost 8% last year and 31% since 2020, according to the U. The most popular major is business.
The university also awarded the largest number of degrees in its history during the 2024-2025 academic year. About half of them were in STEM disciplines and 80% in what the Utah Department of Workforce Services identified to be high-demand fields.
“Enrollment growth only matters when it leads to student success,” Paul Kohn, senior vice provost for strategic enrollment and student success, said in a statement. “We’re investing in every stage of the student journey — from access and affordability to academic support and career readiness — to help students reach graduation in a timely and meaningful way.”

(Photo by Robin Opsahl/Iowa Capital Dispatch)Iowa Auditor Rob Sand said in a news conference Tuesday he would welcome the opportunity to audit and investigate Des Moines Public Schools in the wake of former Superintendent Ian Roberts’ arrest — but said the request submitted by GOP lawmakers last week was invalid.
Last week, three state senators — Sens. Jesse Green, R-Boone; Kerry Gruenhagen, R-Walcott, and Lynn Evans, R-Aurelia — sent a letter to Sand him to audit and investigate the spending practices of the Des Moines school district in light of the Roberts situation. Roberts was arrested and detained by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement in late September.
In the weeks since his arrest, it has been confirmed Roberts was given an order of removal by an immigration judge in May 2024 — and reporting has found the Guyana native had falsified parts of his resume and credentials in addition to not disclosing his immigration status or criminal history during the Des Moines hiring process.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The Associated Press also reported that three months after he was hired, Roberts had asked the Des Moines school board for emergency approval of $116,000 in contracts for “culturally responsive coaching” that included a contract with Lively Paradox, a company that he was affiliated with as a consultant and speaker.
Finance officials warned Roberts that the contract with Lively Paradox requested in September 2023 would be a conflict of interest, and the superintendent canceled the request. But Lively Paradox was paid $6,476 by DMPS for consulting and travel expenses in December 2023 for a school board retreat, records show, an expense that was not flagged as a conflict of interest by the board or district staff.
This contracting issue, alongside other reports related to Roberts’ hiring and service at DMPS, are subjects that could warrant investigation, Sand told reporters at a news conference.
“After reading those reports, yeah, we have concerns,” Sand said. “We are already conducting two other reviews of spending by superintendents and other districts in the state. But again, the law says we can’t do this until we have a qualifying request. Just because the word ‘auditor’ is in the name doesn’t mean that we can jump out and audit any taxpayer, for example. We follow the law first. We want to know the facts, but we want to make sure that we’re doing things correctly.”
The letter sent by the three senators called for Sand to “take the time to do the job and help both lawmakers and Iowans as we continue to deal with the consequences of Roberts’ deceptions” and perform an audit of the school district. But Sand said his office cannot begin an audit of DMPS on this request. It must be requested by a Des Moines school board member, DMPS staff, or through a petition with 100 signatures from people living within the district.
Sand said at the time of the news conference, his office had not received a qualifying request to audit DMPS from a valid party. State law would have to change in order to allow his office to accept the state lawmakers’ request, he said, but added, “I don’t think that that’s a good idea.”
“We have avenues that are appropriate and then work right,” Sand said. “Anyone who’s a DMPS employee right now can send an email to info@aos.iowa.gov from their personal email, show us that they’re an employee of Des Moines public schools, and that is enough for us to initiate and audit.”
The auditor, the only Democrat to hold statewide elected office and who is running for governor in 2026, said the state legislators’ letter was “partisan politics.” He said all three of the GOP senators had supported a 2023 law that he said allows public officials to refuse to turn over certain documents during an audit, in addition to supporting the state’s Education Savings Account (ESA) program providing public funds for private school tuition and associated costs, which Sand has said does not allow for adequate oversight over how private schools spend taxpayer dollars.
Sand also questioned why lawmakers did not request an audit of the Iowa Board of Educational Examiners, the state entity that granted Roberts an administrator license in July 2023.
Gov. Kim Reynolds signed an executive order earlier in October requiring the licensure board, alongside all state government departments, to use the federal E-Verify and SAVE systems to verify applicants’ immigration and citizenship status when hiring workers and granting occupational and professional licenses.
“This is what legislators can request: They can request reviews of issues of spending by a state department with money from a state department. That’s it,” Sand said. “You’ll notice that none of them requested us to review what was going on with the Iowa (Board of) Education Examiners, who actually approved a license for Ian Roberts to teach. That might be partisan politics.”
Sand said if a qualifying request from a DMPS employee or school board member is made or a petition is submitted, the auditor’s office would not reveal the identity of the person making the request, but would confirm that an audit was requested or started. If an audit of DMPS is started, Sand refrained from giving any estimates on how long the investigation would take.
“The problem with giving people a time frame is, once you’ve given them a time frame, the integrity of your prediction of the time frame is competing with the integrity of the report,” Sand said. “You don’t want to put yourself in that situation, because you want to make sure that you’re focused on the integrity of the report. Sometimes it’s eight months. Sometimes it’s 18 months.”

(Photo by Emma Murphy/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — Oklahoma’s updated campaign finance reporting system will launch on Oct. 28, according to a news release. 
Guardian 2.0, which provides public access to candidate expenditures and contributors, was initially set to launch Oct. 1 but was delayed for “final adjustments” and to ensure data was accurately converted between the old and new software systems.  
The change in the software system is a result of a vendor no longer supporting the old system. Guardian has been shut off since Sept. 19. 
The site also provides information about lobbyists, which candidates have filed ethics paperwork to run for public office and the formation of political action committees.
Guardian 2.0 will make filing and public access to campaign finance information easier, have a new login, and a more intuitive filing experience, according to the Ethics Commission’s website. The Legislature previously appropriated $1.2 million to the Ethics Commission for system updates. 
Lee Anne Bruce Boone, executive director of the Ethics Commission, said launching the system before it’s fully ready would create “far greater problems.” 
No filers will be penalized while the system is down, according to the Ethics Commission website. Staff at the Commission are available to work directly with filers.
Third quarter campaign finance reports are due Oct. 31. The reporting period could be extended with late fees waived if necessary, according to the Commission’s website. 
“Our responsibility is to deliver a product that performs accurately and securely from day one,” Bruce Boone said in a statement. “Taking the time to ensure the system is stable and the data is reliable reflects our commitment to doing this right—not just doing it fast.”
There could be minor technical issues when Guardian 2.0 launches but a support team will be available, she previously said.

Earlier this year, former-Attorney General Andrew Bailey accused Jackson County Judge Jerri Zhang of abusing her discretion when she issued a temporary injunction that struck down several “targeted regulation of abortion providers,” or TRAP laws, as unconstitutional under the reproductive rights amendment approved by voters in November.
That injunction allowed Planned Parenthood clinics in Kansas City, Columbia and St. Louis to start offering procedural abortions for the first time in years. 
The attorney general’s office in its appeal argued the TRAP laws should be re-enacted in part because they were not causing a high enough degree of “irreparable harm.” The harm was only “minor” because Missourians looking to end a pregnancy could instead travel to Illinois or Kansas for an abortion, the attorney general’s office wrote in court filings. 
The appeals court unanimously rejected Bailey’s argument on Tuesday, calling it “disingenuous.” 
“The irreparable harm flowing from a denial of abortion care within the confines of the Missouri (reproductive rights amendment) are unique because an abortion decision by an expectant mother ‘simply cannot be postponed, or it will be made by default with far-reaching consequences,’” wrote Judge Mark D. Pfeiffer, citing an earlier ruling by Zhang.
The appeals court also found no proof of Zhang abusing her discretion, noting that she applied “exhaustive consideration” to both sides’ arguments by conducting multiple hearings and sifting through hundreds of pages of written briefs over several months. 
Plus, the appeals court noted, the bench trial on the matter is set for January, which is only a few months away. At that trial, Zhang will make a final ruling on the lawsuit filed last November by the ACLU of Missouri and the two Planned Parenthood affiliates in the state. 
Until then, the temporary injunction in place prevents the state from enforcing a handful of regulations, including requirements that patients have two visits at least seventy-two hours apart before having an abortion and that abortion clinics be licensed as ambulatory surgical centers.
Missouri attorney general subpoenas Planned Parenthood for patient abortion records

Bailey previously appealed Zhang’s decision to the Missouri Supreme Court, which said the attorney general should have first appealed to the western district before taking his request to the state’s highest court. 
The office, now run by Attorney General Catherine Hanaway, can appeal Tuesday’s decision to the Missouri Supreme Court. A spokesperson for Hanaway did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
Zhang is still considering a separate request from Planned Parenthood to overturn even more state regulations that Planned Parenthood argues are preventing clinics from prescribing mifepristone and misoprostol, which are used in medication abortions. 
About two-thirds of abortions nationally are performed using medication.  
Emily Wales, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood Great Plains based in the Kansas City area, accused the attorney general of being one of several examples of “disingenuous” state leadership. She pointed to an abortion ban proposed by the Republican legislature that will appear on the November 2026 ballot, coupled with attempts to make it more difficult to amend the constitution through citizen-led initiative petitions, which is how the reproductive rights amendment ended up on the ballot. 
“We will not stand by while extremist officials try to override the law and the will of the people,” Wales said in a statement Tuesday. “Missourians deserve better.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/IMG_0818-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-14 14:57:23.481296

(Provided by USC)COLUMBIA — A competitive scholarship program for University of South Carolina sports management students is now permanent with a $5 million donation from NFL owner David Tepper and his wife Nicole.
In recognition of the gift, USC named the David and Nicole Tepper Department of Sport and Entertainment Management on Tuesday after the family of the Carolina Panthers owner.
“What I could say for not only this department and school, but for the university overall — they care,” Nicole Tepper told reporters. “They put time into each student. The student’s success is the university’s success.
“That just draws people like Dave and I in to say, we want to invest, and we want to be a part of it,” she added.
The Teppers, through the family’s charitable foundation, funded the Tepper Scholars Program at USC, starting with $1.5 million six years ago. The additional $5 million will continue that into perpetuity.
David Tepper, a hedge fund billionaire who grew up in Pittsburgh, and Nicole Tepper, who was raised in New Jersey, have a personal connection to the South Carolina school: One of their daughters received a bachelor’s degree from USC, though they did not say when.
The dollar amount awarded to scholars varies from year to year but covers a large portion of students’ tuition, said college spokesman Allen Wallace.
The scholars also work a summer internship with the Teppers’ sports and events management company, which includes the Panthers and the Major League Soccer Charlotte Football Club.
“It was always my dream to work in professional sports but being from a small island I saw it as something perhaps unattainable,” said Ambar Ferra, a class of 2025 sports management graduate and scholarship recipient from Puerto Rico. “Where I am from, there are not opportunities like this.”
Through the program, Ferra took part in two Tepper Sports internships. Today, she works as an event services coordinator for the Houston Dynamo and Dash soccer teams.
“Thank you, Nicole and David, for giving a young girl from Puerto Rico the opportunity to live her dream and shine,” said Ferra, who is among 24 scholarship recipients so far.
Other Tepper scholars have gone on to work for the Panthers, as well as the Cleveland Browns and the Washington Commanders. Most attended the USC announcement.
The Teppers’ latest donation also pays for three professorships at the school, “bringing elite practitioner-educators into USC classrooms,” according to a statement.
“By investing in students through scholarships, mentorship, and access to industry expertise, we can help create lasting impact,” the couple said in a statement. “It’s inspiring to see how the Tepper Scholars have already begun shaping the future of this field, and we are proud to build on this partnership with the University to continue opening doors for talented students for years to come.”
The degree program is among one of the most popular at USC, with about 1,600 students currently enrolled.
The announcement comes six years after the Legislature passed an incentives package intended to bring the Panthers’ headquarters south of the border.
But in 2022, David Tepper pulled the Panthers out of plans to build a $500 million practice facility and headquarters in Rock Hill, abandoning the site where work began two years earlier. The failed complex, once seen as a game-changer for the region, fell apart over a dispute related to bond funding for roads and other infrastructure leading into the 240-acre site along Interstate 77.
Three years later, the site remains undeveloped, with an $80 million state-funded interchange from I-77 to nothing. The city, which purchased the land, announced this month that it is marketing it as an industrial park, targeting manufacturing and life sciences businesses, according to WCNC-TV, a Charlotte NBC affiliate.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/tepper.jpg,,,2025-10-14 14:57:23.481296

Remnants of a powerful typhoon swept into Western Alaska’s Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta on Oct. 12, 2025, producing a storm surge that flooded villages as far as 60 miles up the river. The water pushed homes off their foundations and set some afloat with people inside, officials said. More than 50 people had to be rescued in Kipnuk and Kwigillingok, hundreds were displaced in the region, and at least one person died.
Typhoon Halong was an unusual storm, likely fueled by the Pacific’s near-record warm surface temperatures this fall. Its timing means recovery will be even more difficult than usual for these hard-hit communities, as Alaska meteorologist Rick Thoman of the University Alaska Fairbanks explains.
Disasters in remote Alaska are not like disasters anywhere in the lower 48 states, he explains. While East Coast homeowners recovering from a nor’easter that flooded parts of New Jersey and other states the same weekend can run to Home Depot for supplies or drive to a hotel if their home floods, none of that exists in remote Native villages.

 What made this storm unusual?

Halong was an ex-typhoon, similar to Merbok in 2022, by the time it reached the delta. A week earlier, it had been a powerful typhoon east of Japan. The jet stream picked it up and carried it to the northeast, which is pretty common, and weather models did a pretty good job in forecasting its track into the Bering Sea.
But as the storm approached Alaska, everything went sideways.
The weather model forecasts changed, reflecting a faster-moving storm, and Halong shifted to a very unusual track, moving between Saint Lawrence Island and the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta coast.

Unlike Merbok, which was very well forecast by the global models, this one’s final track and intensity weren’t clear until the storm was within 36 hours of crossing into Alaska waters. That’s too late for evacuations in many places.
 Did the loss of weather balloon data canceled in 2025 affect the forecast?

That’s a question for future research, but here’s what we know for sure: There have not been any upper-air weather balloon observations at Saint Paul Island in the Bering Sea since late August or at Kotzebue since February. Bethel and Cold Bay are limited to one per day instead of two. At Nome, there were no weather balloons for two full days as the storm was moving toward the Bering Sea.
Did any of this cause the forecast to be off? We don’t know because we don’t have the data, but it seems likely that that had some effect on the model performance.
 Why is the delta region so vulnerable in a storm like Halong?

The land in this part of western Alaska is very flat, so major storms can drive the ocean into the delta, and the water spreads out.
Most of the land there is very close to sea level, in some places less than 10 feet above the high tide line. Permafrost is also thawing, land is subsiding, and sea-level rise is adding to the risk. For many people, there is literally nowhere to go. Even Bethel, the region’s largest town, about 60 miles up the Kuskokwim River, saw flooding from Halong.
These are very remote communities with no roads to cities. The only way to access them is by boat or plane. Right now, they have a lot of people with nowhere to live, and winter is closing in.
Native residents of Kipnuk discuss the challenges of permafrost loss and climate change in their village. Alaska Institute for Justice.
These villages are also small. They don’t have extra housing or the resources to rapidly recover. The region was already recovering from major flooding in summer 2024. Kipnuk’s tribe was able to get federal disaster aid, but that aid was approved only in early January 2025.
 What are these communities facing in terms of recovery?

People are going to have really difficult decisions to make. Do they leave the community for the winter and hope to rebuild next summer?
There likely isn’t much available housing in the region, with the flooding so widespread on top of a housing shortage. Do displaced people go to Anchorage? Cities are expensive.
There is no easy answer.
It’s logistically complicated to rebuild in places like Kipnuk. You can’t just get on the phone and call up your local building contractor.
Almost all of the supplies have to come in by barge – plywood to nails to windows – and that isn’t going to happen in winter. You can’t truck it in – there are no roads. Planes can only fly in small amounts – the runways are short and not built for cargo planes.

The National Guard might be able to help fly in supplies. But then you still need to have people who can do the construction and other repair work.
Everything is 100 times more complicated when it comes to building in remote communities. Even if national or state help is approved, it would be next summer before most homes could be rebuilt.
 Is climate change playing a role in storms like these?

That will be another question for future research, but sea-surface temperature in most of the North Pacific that Typhoon Halong passed over before reaching the Aleutian Islands has been much warmer than normal. Warm water fuels storms.

Halong also brought lots of very warm air northward with it. East of the track on Oct. 11, Unalaska reached 68 degrees Fahrenheit (20 degrees Celsius), an all-time high there for October.

(Credit: Getty)The nonprofit Poynter Institute on Tuesday announced a pilot project establishing a “public editor” to serve the Indianapolis news market.
The Indianapolis Public Editor project will “act as a bridge” between the area’s newsrooms and “test the effectiveness” of independent accountability and public education in a local news market, the news release said.
The public editor will be a news media critic focused on how Indianapolis outlets provide coverage in line with the needs of local communities.
The project is led by Poynter’s senior vice president Kelly McBride, chair of Poynter’s Craig Newmark Center for Ethics and Leadership, and has received grant funding from the Lumina and Hearst Foundations. Poynter is currently accepting applications for the role.
“The goal of a local public editor is to help the people who live in Indianapolis understand their news ecosystem better,” McBride said, “and ultimately enable people to hold their local journalists accountable for what they need from them, and also when appropriate, to elevate great journalism.”
The public editor will examine the entire news ecosystem that serves Indiana’s capital, answering questions from the audience and explaining how journalists throughout the market make decisions about coverage. Those columns will appear on the project’s partner newsrooms, which currently include the Indiana Capital Chronicle, Mirror Indy and WFYI public radio.
Additional newsrooms are considering joining the project at a later date.










The goal of a local public editor is to help the people who live in Indianapolis understand their news ecosystem better and ultimately enable people to hold their local journalists accountable for what they need from them, and also when appropriate to elevate great journalism


– Kelly McBride


While a public editor works closely with journalists and newsrooms to write about coverage, their loyalty is with the news audience, the release said.
“The public editor can get your questions answered. They have the experience and the credibility to encourage journalists to respond,” McBride said. “They also have the experience to understand the journalism process.They are often explaining how the process works and why the process isn’t meeting the needs of the public.”
Mirror Indy Editor-in-Chief Oseye Boyd said her newsroom is participating to help increase community understanding of what Mirror Indy does and why.
“This not only provides an opportunity to increase media literacy in our city, but also allows community members to hold us accountable in how we cover them,” she said.
Greg Petrowich, WFYI president and CEO, said the Indianapolis public radio station was eager to participate.
“At a time when public trust in news is at a critical low, the role of a public editor offers transparency and education around how news is gathered and reported,” he said.
McBride said the goal is to hire the public editor and begin the work before the end of 2025. The public editor will live in Indianapolis and have a journalism background.
The project also plans to hold public events with the news audience, the public editor and news organizations. There are only a handful of public editors in the U.S., and those that exist tend to work for a single news organization, such as McBride’s role at NPR.",https://indianacapitalchronicle.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Indiana-Capitol-2-GettyImages-1089342774-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-14 14:57:23.481296

(Photo courtesy USF)Tampa Bay Students for a Democratic Society, a group protesting in support of Palestinian rights, filed suit last week against the University of South Florida, claiming the university violated members’ constitutional rights after expelling one student and disciplining others. 
In an 85-page complaint filed in federal court in Tampa, the group [TBSDS] alleges 19 counts against the university, including negligent training, conspiracy to violate rights, defamation, libel, slander, discrimination, and violation of due process and free speech. 
“Since at least October of 2023, Defendants have conspired to violate Plaintiffs’ constitutional and statutory rights by suppressing their speech and advocacy, stigmatizing their organization, and subjecting them to baseless and discriminatory conduct sanctions, all due to their protected speech and activity in support of Palestinians, and in defense of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion programs that benefit minority students,” attorneys for the students wrote. 
The suit names the USF trustees, USF Police Department, President Rhea Law, Assistant Dean and Director of Student Conduct & Ethical Development Melissa Graham, and Dean of Students Danielle McDonald. 
Plaintiff Victoria Hinckley was expelled days before she was to graduate, and suspension and other conduct sanctions were made against Saba Indawala and Vicky Tong. They seek monetary damages and injunctive relief, including reversal of sanctions against the students.
The plaintiffs claim USF was “treating them differently from other similar situated persons because of the Palestinian nationality, ethnicity, and alienage and association therewith of Plaintiffs and their speech,” and were “singled out” “in conspiracy with several high profile local megadonors including but not limited to the JCC [Jewish Community Centers & Federation] as part of a cash for influence scheme.”
The plaintiffs cite initiatives between JCC and other organizations and the university, saying JCC and USF “have conspired for over a decade to target and silence pro-Palestinian speech.”

Timeline
Among the damages alleged: “Plaintiffs have sustained severe emotional pain, anguish, humiliation, insult, indignity, loss of self-esteem, inconvenience and hurt, postponed graduations among other things, and have suffered tremendous mental and emotional damages due to Defendants’ conspiracy to silence and stigmatize them on campus”
The group objects to university allegations that students started a riot and says that administrators used “sham conduct proceedings that fail to provide basic due process protections.” It also alleges “the creation of arbitrary and capricious policies contemporaneous with or immediately after pro-Palestine events, without notice or due process” and discriminatory application of those policies against the organization. 
In February 2024, after pro-Palestine flyers were posted on campus, the “USF administration caved to this external anti-Palestinian pressure and complied with the demand by scheduling a disciplinary meeting — itself a significant disincentive for students to continue their advocacy in support of Palestinians.”
In April 2024, the organization protested budget cuts related to diversity, equity, and inclusion programs, including a march to McDonald’s office to deliver petitions, the suit says. “In retaliation for this petition delivery action, Defendants issued TBSDS four conduct charges and put the organization on interim suspension.”
They allege that during the Spring 2024 semester, McDonald shut down all organizational tabling efforts. 
The most detailed account in the complaint involved attempts to host events remembering the “Nakba,” or “catastrophe,” referring to the Arab perspective of the 1948 creation of Israel that displaced Palestinians, despite bans and time, place, and manner restrictions from the university. As the timeline goes, students were shut down by campus police because the location had been declared a study zone. 
At 1 p.m., the group asked what time the curfew would be imposed. At 4:30, McDonald replied “5:00.” The “curfew was created out of thin air, with no basis in USF policies or procedures, and with insufficient notice to Plaintiffs and others assembled in the Plaza.”
That night, the plaintiffs allege, “USF hastily installed surveillance cameras on a tree next to the MLK Plaza in furtherance of its campaign of intimidation against Plaintiffs.”
The next day, police used tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse students who pressed the 5 p.m. curfew and students were arrested. 
“​​In the moments after the tear gas was deployed, a TBSDS-associated student asked MCDONALD whether she approved of the police brutality against USF students, and MCDONALD stated she was happy to see it,” the suit alleges. 
The suit claims that President Law “falsely stated that the protest stopped being peaceful when Plaintiffs and other students attempted to stay in the MLK Plaza past 5:00 pm.”
The suit details other run-ins, including one in which McDonald attempted to “corral” students who showed up to a protest advocating for free expression. Some students were issued a trespass warning during that encounter. 
The suit alleges “[s]elective over-enforcement of those new and arbitrary policies against TBSDS and its members to interfere with and terminate pro-Palestinian events and cripple the TBSDS organization on campus, by violating the organization or its members’ ability to advocate, assemble, and speak.”
The school eliminated the group as a student organization and has rejected attempts for it to form again under another name. The complaint seeks restoration of the group’s campus registration.
The case has been assigned to U.S. District Judge Steven Merryday.
In the months following the Oct. 7 Hamas attack on Israel, Florida politicians boasted about how universities in the state handled pro-Palestine protesters and punished alleged anti-semitic behavior.
USF was among the universities the Phoenix wrote about in the summer of 2024 that tightened restrictions on protesting. That coverage included a letter from McDonald to students at the start of the school year, updating them on the new policies.

(Photo by Chris Dorst/Charleston Gazette-Mail)Bridge Day, West Virginia’s largest one-day festival, will go on Saturday, even if the federal government is still shut down, Gov. Patrick Morrisey said Tuesday.
The state is paying nearly $100,000 to keep its national parks — New River Gorge and Harpers Ferry — open despite the federal shutdown. That agreement ends Friday night, Morrisey said. 
Morrisey said Tuesday he intends to extend that agreement with the federal government if federal operations have not resumed by then. If necessary, he’ll extend the agreement through the end of the month, he said. 
Last year, the state’s tourism industry had a $9.1 billion economic impact, Morrisey said. In the past year, 1.8 million people have visited the New River Gorge National Park. More than 200,000 people visit the New River Gorge in October alone, he said.
Bridge Day, held annually on the third Saturday in October, draws tens of thousands of people to the New River Gorge National Park to see BASE jumpers parachute from the structure on the only day it’s legal. Last year, 325 certified BASE jumpers reportedly participated in the event.  BASE stands for building, antenna, span (such as a bridge) and earth.
‘So this was not the time to be shut down,” Morrisey said. 
Becky Sullivan, president of the Fayette County Chamber of Commerce, said as of Tuesday, more than 300 BASE jumpers have registered from 39 states and four countries have registered for Bridge Day. More than 200 repellers. 
More than 500 people from 26 states have also registered to take part in a 5K race on the bridge Saturday morning, she said. More than 200 vendors from several states will participate in the festival as well.
“Bridge Day has a huge economic impact on Fayette County and our surrounding region,” Sullivan said. “The entire New River Gorge region benefits from Bridge Day. It is a huge event for our state. It is a huge event for our area.” She added her thanks to Morrisey and Tourism Secretary Chelsea Ruby that this year’s event will go on.
The federal government shut down at midnight Oct. 1 after Congress failed to approve a funding bill before the beginning of the new fiscal year to keep services running. At issue are enhanced health care subsidies that particularly impact West Virginians. Democrats in Congress want to see these subsidies included in the spending bill. Republicans do not.
The enhanced subsidies — which are for plans purchased on the Health Insurance Marketplace — are set to expire at the end of the year. According to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, the subsidies expiring is projected to cause 4.2 million Americans to lose their health insurance by 2034.
Thousands of West Virginians in particular will be impacted if the health care subsidies end. About 67,000 West Virginians buy their health care on the marketplace. The West Virginia Center on Budget and Policy said that West Virginians who buy insurance through the marketplace will see their premiums increase by an average of 133% or $1,400 annually if the subsidies end. If the premiums expire, about 15,000 West Virginians will lose their health care because they can no longer afford it, according to the Center on Budget and Policy.

In the hearing, judges and lawyers debated the threshold — if not biological species — of when to grant such rights. 
The Nonhuman Rights Project, a legal advocacy organization, has sued the DeYoung Family Zoo for living conditions that they consider to be violations of the bodily liberty of chimpanzees housed there.
Lawyers for the chimpanzees are seeking an order to hear the merits of the case — essentially, to have a decision on the content of the case, as opposed to procedural matters — in the suit for the habeas corpus rights of seven chimpanzees, who the group refers to as the “DeYoung Prisoners“.
“It’s a novel issue, obviously,” said Judge Brock Swartzle, the presiding judge in the hearing, as he and fellow judges Matthew Ackerman and Christopher Trebilcock considered the arguments presented by Jake Davis, the attorney for the Nonhuman Rights Project.

The Menominee County Circuit Court dismissed the case in December 2023, determining that the law’s use of the word “person” made the chimpanzees ineligible for the relief that their lawyers were seeking — transfer out of the DeYoung zoo, which they called in the hearing an “unjust confinement,” to a designated sanctuary. 
The Nonhuman Rights Project filed its appeal in January 2024, arguing that Michigan common law — not a statute that includes the word “person” — should determine the outcome of the case, instead relying on the autonomy of chimpanzees. 
For those representing the chimpanzees, the case goes beyond these seven animals, however. 
“What’s at stake here really is whether suffering chimpanzees are entitled to go to a sanctuary, and also whether protection of liberty and autonomy is going to remain the supreme law in Michigan or whether it’s going to get truncated,” Christopher Berry, the executive director of the Nonhuman Rights Project, said after the hearing’s conclusion. 
Davis presented judges with the story of Tommy, another chimpanzee that had been at the DeYoung Family Zoo and died there, as an example of why the seven chimpanzees named in the case should be granted habeas corpus rights. 
When Tommy was moved without notice from a zoo in New York to the DeYoung zoo, it “epitomized his status as a rightless thing, his legal status as a rightless thing,” Davis said.  “Tommy could be bought, could be sold, he could be used and he could be trafficked, all without the slightest hiccup.”
Swartzle asked Davis how far he would go in expanding habeas corpus rights beyond humans. “You’re asking for something fairly extraordinary,” Swartzle said. “If you want us to go over that line into non-humans, where do we draw a sensible line?”
Michigan Court of Appeals Judge Brock Swartzle. Oct. 14, 2025 | Screenshot
For Davis, that line is simple — autonomy, which can be defined as “self determined behavior based on freedom of choice,” he said, presenting research from famed late primatologist Jane Goodall, that chimpanzees largely experience the world the same way humans do. 
Goodall wrote similarly in a scientific declaration in the case, filed in late 2023, “There is ample proof from studies of chimpanzee behavior, both in the wild and in captivity, that chimpanzees are autonomous beings with a highly complex cognitive nature, which can be illustrated by their ability to perform complex tasks.”
But for Swartzle, the ability — or lack thereof — of an animal like a chimpanzee to participate in what was referred to as the “social contract” presented questions on whether autonomy was enough to grant rights like these.

While the decision of the court is still forthcoming, Ginny Mikita, a Michigan lawyer working alongside the Nonhuman Rights Project in the case, said after the hearing that she felt positive about the outcome based on how the judges responded to their arguments. 
“I’m feeling hopeful,” she said. “The judges today clearly had given a lot of thought to this case and were fully engaged in the argument.”

(Photo by Mitch Perry/Florida Phoenix)For the first time since Floridians voted to restore voting rights to most people with felony convictions, the state has agreed to provide timely information about which of them have paid the financial obligations that would entitle them to cast ballots.
That change is the result of negotiations last year after the Florida Rights Restoration Coalition dropped its 2023 lawsuit against Gov. Ron DeSantis, Secretary of State Cord Byrd, and other Florida election officials. The coalition had alleged the state had  created “such a bureaucratic system around the implementation of Amendment 4” that it prevented Florida citizens from voting.
More than 65% of Floridians approved Amendment 4 in 2018, ostensibly restoring voting rights to all individuals who had completed their sentences (except for those who committed murders and sexual offenses). In 2019, the Legislature passed implementing language requiring felons (or “returning citizens”) to have paid any legal financial obligations, including fines, fees, or restitution imposed on them by a judge, before they could see their voting rights restored.
In a highly publicized incident just days before the August 2022 primary election, the then-newly formed Florida Office of Election Crimes and Security arrested 20 individuals for alleged voter fraud, mostly those with past felony convictions. Several of those arrested had received voter registration cards from the state, leading them to believe that their rights had been restored.
Now individuals with felony convictions who have completed their sentences but remain uncertain whether they still have legal financial obligations to fill out a request form to the Department of State to inquire about voting eligibility.

New form
“We have a standardized form that will cost the individual nothing if they want to submit information to us as to whether or not that they are eligible,” Florida Secretary of State Cord Byrd said last week before the Florida House Government Operations Subcommittee. “We’re happy to do that. We do that on a regular basis.”
As part of the final rule, the state now has a 14-day deadline to respond to an initial request to determine whether a submitted form is complete and 90 days to issue an advisory opinion after receiving that completed request.
The advisory opinion would be one of three responses:

The individual is eligible to register to vote.
The individual is ineligible to register and vote.
The Division of Elections lacks credible and reliable information — therefore, “nothing precludes you from registering and voting.”

The program is similar to legislation filed by Rep. Dotie Joseph, D-North Miami, (HB 1525) and Sen. Tina Polsky, D-Boca Raton, (SB 904) during the 2024 legislative session.
Desmond Meade, president and executive director of the Florida Rights Restoration Coalition, says the original lawsuit was ultimately about whose responsibility is it to determine voter eligibility.
“The primary purpose of this piece is to take away the mens rea part of it,” Meade said last week, referring to the concept in criminal law that separates accidental acts from intentional crimes.
“If the state wants to charge somebody with committing a certain crime, part of the element that they must show beyond a reasonable doubt is that they were doing something wrong,” he said.  “That is a key element in any voting case that you’re going to come across.”
For the past several years, Florida Democrats have filed legislation to establish a centralized database to track the voting-rights status of individuals with felony convictions. A 2026 version (HB 73) has been filed in the House by Rep. Felicia Robinson, D-Miami Gardens, and in the Senate (SB 132) by Polsky to require the Florida Commission on Offender Review to maintain a financial obligations database.
Secretary Byrd was responding last week to an inquiry from newly elected Rep. RaShon Young, D-Orlando, who said returning citizens in his community were “still expressing confusion” about the verification process. Young asked what steps the Department of State was taking to “reduce that confusion” and make the process clearer.
Byrd mentioned the new form and told Young that it was important the information “is getting out to the people in your community and we will conduct that information, because we’re doing it, so that people know that we don’t want to trap anybody into a felony.”
Meade said he thinks the new process is “great first step” for the state. He adds that he’d like the Department of State to make the form more accessible online if possible, and also hopes the agency could partner with voting rights groups like his own to get the word out to affected individuals.
“Now people who want to be part of democracy can get an answer in a timely manner that would direct them one way or another, and it takes away the necessity for the state to even go after these folks and spend millions of dollars trying to prosecute people who should not be prosecuted in the first place,” he said.
The Phoenix reached out to the Department of State for comment, but officials there declined to provide a response.

King, The Who and ZZ Top and other stars, and his love of music and show business took him around the world.
The love of the blues, historic homes and his wife, Madison native Suzanne Case, brought him to Mississippi, where he moved full-time after he retired in 2016. The veteran publicist Dera died Friday in Bentonia. He was 74.
“A list of everyone he worked with would probably be 20 pages long,” said Chris Roslan, a former business partner of Dera’s. 
Dera “always had a real fascination with old houses,” including one from the 1700s that he had in New York and the home where he an Case were living in Bentonia, Roslan said.
“He also loved blues music, so I think that also drew him to that area,” Roslan said.
In his five-decade career Dera represented marquee stars and entertainment brands.
Dera eventually started his own company, Dera & Associates, and his clients also included Billy Joel, Queen, Robert Palmer, UB40, Clint Black, Duran Duran, Foreigner, Ray Davis, Pink Floyd, The Band, Alabama, Les Paul and Rick Springfield. He did public relations work for big events, including Live Aid and Woodstock ’99.
Dera
Dera served as former Beatle Paul McCartney’s spokesman for over 20 years. He also represented the National Geographic Society, Dick Clark Productions, the American Music Awards, the History Channel and Gibson Guitars, among many others.
Dera was born in the Netherlands, son of a Dutch coal miner who moved the family to New Jersey.
His first foray into music was interviewing Robert Palmer for his community college newspaper. Dera would later become Palmer’s press agent and Palmer helped Dera start his own firm years later.
After retiring, Dera and Case moved to the historic Bradshaw House in Yazoo County, where he provided free PR counsel to local businesses. He and Case were active in rescuing and caring for abandoned dogs.
In a 2017 interview with the Clarion Ledger, Dera said he had many fond memories from his career, albeit in a dog-eat-dog industry often full of outsized egos.
“Even those with tough reputations are real sweethearts,” Dera said. And he said living in Mississippi had been “fun.”
“I don’t miss the snow,” Dera said then. “It’s all summer weather here.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/14091858/Dera.jpg,,,2025-10-14 13:58:19.508992

(Photo by Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)LENEXA — Castle Brazil sat alone Monday night in the back of a church sanctuary in Lenexa as he processed the “insane” revelations about Republican plans for a special session on redistricting.
The Johnson County Community College student — who sat with a sign reading, “People choose the politicians / not the other way!” — said it angered him that other people his age weren’t interested in attending the public forum. When Brazil tried to get a friend to come with him, the friend decided he would rather go to McDonald’s.
An aspiring teacher, Brazil said he is civically engaged in part because his mom is active duty military and his dad is with the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs.
“When I talk to people my age, the most common response is, ‘Oh, I don’t really keep up with that stuff.’ But when I tell them actually what’s going on, then they get upset,” Brazil said. “It’s like, if they actually knew, they would be upset, too.”
One of the things he learned at the forum: Republicans could vote on new congressional maps as soon as Nov. 7.
“That’s insane, right?” Brazil said.


Republican legislative leaders on Monday authorized $460,000 to cover up to four days of a special session, which is contingent on getting two-thirds of both the state Senate and House members to sign a petition. Their goal would be to gerrymander Democratic U.S. Rep. Sharice Davids out of office by fragmenting Johnson County among two or more congressional districts.
Senate President Ty Masterson, R-Andover, said in a statement that there was “a misunderstanding out there” about redistricting efforts.
“I’m not drawing a map,” Masterson said. “A group of federal redistricting experts is developing a map from a federal perspective.”
A spokesperson didn’t immediately respond to a Kansas Reflector inquiry seeking clarity about who the experts are and the meaning of “a federal perspective.”
Masterson confirmed to Kansas Reflector that legislators were preparing to meet Wednesday with White House policy staff in Washington, D.C., “to discuss a range of administration policy priorities.” But, he said, redistricting “is not on the agenda.”
Kansas Sen. Cindy Holscher, an Overland Park Democrat who is seeking her party’s nomination for governor in next year’s race, organized the Monday night forum to bring awareness to the community about the prospect of a special session on redistricting. She was joined in the panel discussion by Connie Brown Collins, of the Voter Rights Network of Wyandotte County, and Rep. Stephanie Sawyer Clayton, D-Overland Park. Johnson County Commissioner Julie Brewer moderated the discussion for a crowd of about 150 at Shawnee Mission Unitarian Universalist Church.
After the forum, Holscher posted on her campaign Facebook page the names and phone numbers of eight House Republicans who have yet to sign the special session petition. There are 88 Republicans in the House, where 84 are needed to call a special session.

Sticky fingers and a fat crayon
Sawyer Clayton predicted Republican legislative leaders would meet with the state’s GOP congressional delegation while in Washington this week to finalize the drawing of a new map.
She said the build-up to a special session detoured from the usual redistricting process, where congressional and legislative districts are redrawn once every decade to reflect changes in the census count. Those efforts are accompanied by a series of public forums held around the state so a legislative committee can gather feedback.
Additionally, Sawyer Clayton said, Republicans in the special session could rely on “parliamentary loopholes” to ensure the public gets “zero input.” Instead of holding committee hearings with testimony on the new maps, legislative leaders could bring them straight to the Senate and House floor for a vote.
“We have heard that that is a possibility,” she said.
She referred to the situation as “this bizarre redistricting scenario hellscape.”
“I think one of the problems is that when you see politicians drawing maps it’s kind of a fox guarding the chicken coop kind of thing,” Sawyer Clayton said. “We want these maps to be drawn with these dignified quills of our founding fathers. Instead, what we’re seeing is someone with sticky fingers and a big fat crayon following their id, when they should be following their sacred duty. But here we are.”
She said Republicans were violating the public’s trust by placing politics ahead of their duty to serve constituents.
“A lot of times I’ll sit there and I’ll look at these moments and I’ll think: This is why everyone hates us. This is why everyone hates politicians. It’s when these types of games occur,” she said.

Powerless and disheartened
Brown Collins warned the Johnson County crowd that they could suffer the same fate as voters in Wyandotte County.
Republicans in 2022 tried to remove Davids from office by breaking the Kansas City metro into two districts. They sliced the north half of Wyandotte County out of Davids’ 3rd District and placed it into the 2nd District, which covers most of the eastern third of the state, outside of Kansas City and Wichita. To preserve the Republican advantage, they moved the Democratic stronghold of Lawrence out of the 2nd District and into the vast 1st District that covers all of western Kansas.
Brown Collins said her community is no longer valued or represented in Congress, and voter turnout has suffered.
The community doesn’t support the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, the president’s executive orders, abolishing diversity, equity and inclusion programs, the siphoning of funds from public schools to prop of private schools, or the detention of law-abiding immigrants, she said.
“The list goes on,” she said. “These issues and policies directly and negatively impact our communities.”
Most people, she said, won’t even bother to approach Republican U.S. Rep. Derek Schmidt, who represents the community, about their concerns.
“It’s not a good situation when you feel powerless to be able to put forth your needs and wants, your priorities, because you don’t feel you’ll be heard,” Brown Collins said. “So yeah, that’s very much the case, and it’s, it’s disheartening to a lot of people.”

Personal attack
The discussion at the church, which included a town hall-style round of questions from the audience, was billed as the first public forum on redistricting ahead of the presumed special session.
Kellie Martiny, of Shawnee, adorned in a Davids for Congress T-shirt, sat with her sister-in-law on the front row. In an interview, Martiny said the attempt to drive Davids out of office feels like a personal attack.

Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.) joined a group of U.S. Senate Democrats sponsoring a bill to protect federal workers and contractors during the federal shutdown.
According to a Tuesday news release,  the Federal Employee Civil Relief Act, introduced by U.S. Sen. Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii), would protect federal workers during the shutdown and for 30 days afterward from being evicted or foreclosed; having their cars or other property repossessed; falling behind on their student loan payments; having negative effects on their credit histories; falling behind on bill payments; and losing insurance due to missed premium payments.
“Federal workers make our government work for New Mexico families — from caring for our veterans to maintaining our public lands and keeping our communities safe. They shouldn’t have to suffer because Republicans in Congress refuse to come to the table and work with Democrats to lower health care costs,” Heinrich said in a statement. “Every hardworking New Mexican deserves the dignity of financial stability and security. The Federal Employees Civil Relief Act will help ensure that the folks who keep our country running aren’t left wondering how they’ll pay their bills or keep their homes during Trump’s manufactured crisis.”
Cosponsors of the bill in the Senate include Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) and U.S. Senators Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), Alex Padilla (D-Calif.), Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), Angela Alsobrooks (D-Md.), Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.), Mazie K. Hirono (D-Hawai‘i), Tim Kaine (D-Va.), Catherine Cortez Masto (D-Nev.), Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), Cory Booker (D-N.J.), Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.), and Mark Warner (D-Va.). Companion legislation in the House of Representatives is set to be introduced by U.S. Representative Brendan Boyle (D-Pa.).
“While the President and congressional Republicans continue to refuse to work with Democrats to stop health care costs from skyrocketing and reopen the government, people are suffering,” sponsor Schatz said in a statement. “Right now, hundreds of thousands of federal workers, federal contractor employees, and their families don’t know whether they’ll be able to pay rent and make ends meet. Our bill will protect these workers and make sure they aren’t harmed during this shutdown.”
Several unions support the bill, including the American Federation of Government Employees.
“This bill provides essential protections for federal workers who, through no fault of their own, face severe financial hardship during a government shutdown,” AFGE President Everett Kelley said in a statement. “No public servant should be at risk of eviction, repossession, or losing health insurance simply because they are working without pay or furloughed.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Heinrich-2-1024x684.jpeg,,,2025-10-14 13:58:19.508992

You can read more about the section here.

The Trump administration’s obsession with sending National Guard troops hither and yon brings back memories of the time I spent as a member of a mobilized Guard unit. 
It was 63 years ago on Sept. 30, and yes, it did coincide with the admission of James Meredith as the first Black student at the University of Mississippi. I was a senior journalism student at Ole Miss and a part-time reporter for The Oxford Eagle. I also had another part-time job as a member of the Mississippi National Guard, one I had held since high school. 
All three came together in the last week of September 1962. I covered Lt. Gov. Paul Johnson, who was in Oxford to deny Meredith’s enrollment because Gov. Ross Barnett’s flight was fogged in at Jackson and could not be there himself to turn Meredith away. Things got even more interesting that weekend.
On Saturday, Sept. 29, Gov. Barnett called up the National Guard to go to Oxford to stop the U.S. Justice Department from enrolling Meredith on Oct. 1. A contingent of federal officials, including U.S. marshals and Department of Justice officials, had flown in from Memphis with Meredith and placed him in a highly guarded dormitory.

My unit, B Troop of the 108th Armored Cavalry Regiment was based in Pontotoc, 30 miles from the university. After a night and the next day rounding up troops, we were ready to go. We soon heard, however, that we had a new boss. President John F. Kennedy had federalized the Mississippi National Guard, taking away Barnett’s biggest club. 
We heard that a crowd was gathering on campus. There had been an Ole Miss football game in Jackson the night before, where Barnett had vowed to keep Meredith out of Ole Miss. Students returning to campus found a phalanx of U.S. marshals and other assorted federal officers surrounding the Lyceum, the administration building. Students and outsiders, egged on by former Gen. Edwin Walker, soon were throwing bottles, rocks and Molotov cocktails at state Highway Patrol officers, U.S. marshals, other law enforcement officers and the contingent of the news media that had gathered.
The federal security was not large, and defenses became even weaker when the state Highway Patrol pulled away from the lines and refused to help the Feds.
It was soon obvious that things were out of hand. National Guard Troop E of the 108th Armored Cavalry Regiment in Oxford was the first unit onto the campus. Capt. Murry Falkner, nephew of novelist William Faulkner, was the commander. Falkner was hit by a chunk of concrete, sustaining a broken arm, but led his troops into the fray. Troop E only had 67 soldiers. Soon, the Water Valley National Guard was brought in. 
Pontotoc’s Troop B was next, and we loaded into our jeeps and troop trucks and headed west on U.S. Highway 6 to Oxford. On the 40-minute drive we were constantly being passed by cars heading to the same place as we were, but not for the same reason. Most did not know that Kennedy had taken the Guard away from Barnett and were shouting “let’s go get him,” (not the exact quotes). 
By the time we got on University Drive heading onto the campus, it was obvious things were going to be rough. As we went into the circle around the Grove, where the rioters were massed, we saw cars burned. One belonged to my professor Samuel Talbert, chair of the Journalism Department. We did not have time to think about what we were seeing.

Suddenly, someone threw a Molotov cocktail firebomb from the Grove, striking the tailgate of our troop truck and fortunately falling back on the street and not torching us. Rocks and bottles pelted the side of our truck. Every obscenity known to man and newly concocted ones were yelled at us. 
We finally got in front of the Lyceum, jumped from our vehicles and began taking positions. We shined the lights of the vehicles into the Grove where the rioters were congregated, hoping that would help us spot trouble better.
We found out the next morning that might not have been our best move. One of our officers, Lt. John Fox, and I stood behind a jeep for a while observing the turmoil. The next morning Lt. Fox told me to look at the front of the jeep. I did and saw bullet holes in the windshield, around the headlights and on other parts of the jeep.
The rioters were not happy with the headlights and were trying to shoot them out. Fortunately, they did not hit us as we took shelter behind the vehicles.
The situation got worse after midnight when the word passed down the line that the U.S. marshals were running out of tear gas. That rather obnoxious gas was what was keeping the mob at bay. As the marshals fired their canisters fewer apart, the rioters moved close and closer to our lines in front of the Lyceum.
Things were becoming dangerously catastrophic. We had weapons and ammunition but not enough for the situation. We were attentive when we heard a “tromp, tromp, tromp” coming down toward the football stadium. Soon a line of soldiers from 503rd Military Police Battalion Airborne at Fort Bragg, wearing riot gear and carrying rifles with bayonets, marched up the street and took up positions. Kennedy had sent in the trained regular Army riot dispersers. 
I will never forget the gravelly-voiced sergeant who ordered his troops to “Right face,” so they would be facing the Grove. Then he said, “Fix bayonets!” Then he said, “Lock and load, one round.” The metallic ring of the bayonets and the click of the rifles being loaded obviously made an impact. Rioters were already running away before the sergeant ordered his troops into riot formation and they fanned out across the Grove. 
The real danger was over but there were skirmishes the next morning with Guardsmen and the MPs chasing scattered bands of dispersed rioters and troublemakers around the university campus and the city of Oxford. 
Two people were killed in the riot, many injured and there was looting, destruction of property and hijacking of cars. Besides the students who took part in the rioting, there were outsiders who came in from around the state and from surrounding states to preserve their sacred institution of segregation.
One Mississippi television station even encouraged people to go to Oxford to stop Meredith from enrolling. Gov. Barnett did not discourage anyone from going. 
Why rehash “The Oxford Incident” as the Feds called it, or “Operation Rocky Road” as the Mississippi National Guard termed it? 
It might be worth considering the circumstances as President Donald Trump seems intent on using the National Guard for his endeavors. Let us consider the situations in Los Angeles and Washington. No signs of rioting, people being killed by rioters, no looting, no extensive burning or property destruction. I did not see two Guard members standing behind a jeep for safety and finding bullet holes in it the next day.
In D.C., I saw Guard troops standing around national monuments, chatting with tourists and having their pictures taken with them. I saw Guard personnel stationed in front of federal buildings in Los Angeles with little activity around.
After college, as a reporter for United Press International, I covered a few other disturbances that involved the use of National Guard troops. There was always credible evidence for their use. 
There seem to be more plans for such far-fetched actions. Trump is trying now to send the Guard to other cities, like Chicago and Portland. He seems to have a gleam in his eye for New York City.
We have heard claims that there is serious trouble in all those cities, but the Trump minions have not brought any evidence to contradict relative scenes of peace. 
Force was needed at Ole Miss. There was rioting, looting, killing, property destruction and defiance of federal court orders. Force used to quell dangerous and catastrophic situations can be necessary.
Force used for personal whim and for personal political advantage without cause are a travesty against our democracy and Constitution. The Trump administration opts for the latter.

(Photo by Robin Alam/Icon Sportswire via Getty Images)Attorneys for Matthew Weiss, a former University of Michigan offensive coordinator who is accused of stealing intimate photos of nearly 150,000 student athletes in a hacking scheme, said Tuesday that the federal government is attempting to “turbocharge punishments” for what they consider a “routine computer trespass.”
Weiss is facing three fraud charges on 24 separate counts, of which counts 11 through 20 deal with fraud via identification documents. 
The former coordinator’s attorneys, David Benowitz and Paulette Pagan of the Price Benowitz law firm, on Tuesday filed a motion in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan to dismiss those counts, accusing federal prosecutors of pushing legal theories on shaky ground for the sole purpose of creating a test case out of Weiss’ prosecution.
Benowitz and Pagan have asked U.S. District Judge Nancy Edmunds of the Eastern District of Michigan to drop those charges because prosecutors are treating routine digital trespassing, which is prohibited under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, as aggravated identity theft under the federal identity theft statute.

The attorneys warn that if the federal government is successful in prosecuting those counts under that theory – that each of those individual data trespass counts amount to aggravated identity theft – a conviction that would normally lead to a probation sentence could be morphed into a two-year mandatory sentence in prison for each act of hacking. Benowitz and Pagan said that could net Weiss up to 20 years total in prison.
“Congress has created a careful framework for how to punish computer hacking, and the government’s novel theory conflicts with Congress’s design in exactly the way [past precedent in Dubin v.

The counts Weiss’ attorneys are attempting to dismiss are among the heftiest facing the former offensive coordinator under former U of M Coach Jim Harbaugh. Weiss was alleged to have illegally accessed a database of athletes at more than 100 universities and colleges, downloaded their personal data, including medical records, and stole key account identifiers like login information.
Weiss is alleged to have then used those account identifiers and login information to hack the accounts of those athletes to steal intimate photos that were not intended to be released outside of intimate partners, prosecutors said in a March indictment.
The former coordinator is also facing a separate civil lawsuit from more than 50 women who said they were victims of Weiss’ hacking.

Notably, Weiss’ criminal case is still in its early stages; he has not faced trial, a jury has not yet determined his guilt in the matter and he has not been convicted of a crime.
Still, Weiss’ attorneys are arguing that if he were to be convicted under the computer fraud and abuse act, the sentencing guidelines call for a recommended sentence of probation. But they contend that’s not where prosecutors are headed, as they are approaching the crimes as violations of the aggravated identity theft statute.
“Counts 11-20 of the indictment in this case take a radically different approach based upon a novel bootstrapping theory: In the government’s view, the entering of login credentials to access another’s account – the standard way to begin a felony computer trespass under the CFAA – also triggers the two-year mandatory minimum punishment,” Weiss’ attorneys argued.” Under the government’s theory, routine acts of hacking can be double-counted to dramatically enhance punishments: The same misuse of usernames and passwords that enables hackers to enter computers in violation of the CFAA also counts as a theft of account holders’ identities, adding a two-year mandatory minimum for every felony hacking crime on top of the hacker’s otherwise-existing CFAA liability.”
The attorneys said they were aware of no court decision ever accepting that theory despite both statutes being in effect for several decades. Federal prosecutors’ basis for the 10 counts also requires the court to take on a broad reading of the aggravated identity theft statute, a position the Dubin case roundly rejected, Weiss’ attorneys added.
“This court should not be the first to do so. The government’s effort to revolutionize the law of computer hacking by pairing the [computer fraud and abuse act] and the Aggravated Identity Theft statute in this way is untenable,” the motion said. “Because the government’s theory presents an issue of law, rather than a dispute of fact, it is an appropriate subject for resolution under [federal court rules allowing for the dismissal of an indictment for failing to properly state a viable offense].”

(Photo by John Moore/Getty Images)Hundreds of thousands of more children in the United States are going without health insurance, and experts warn that actions by the Trump administration and Congress will likely make the problem worse.
The national uninsured rate for children and teens rose to 6% in 2024, up from 5.4% in 2023, according to new year-over-year data released by the U.S. Census Bureau in September. The rate is the highest in a decade and follows a trend of childhood coverage losses that began a few years before COVID-19 arrived and picked up again after the pandemic emergency response.
“The storm clouds are gathering for people who rely on public health insurance and Medicaid, but for children, sadly, they are already here,” said Joan Alker, executive director of the Center for Children and Families at Georgetown University, during a briefing on the new child health data.
Last month, the center released an analysis of the latest census data, finding an 18% increase in the number of uninsured U.S. children between 2022 and 2024. The upsurge — which represents more than half a million additional kids who lost health coverage — affected nearly every racial and ethnic group. American Indian and Alaska Native children still had the highest uninsured rate by far, at 12.4% in 2024, compared to 9.7%, 5.5% and 4.9% among Hispanic, Black and white children, respectively.
Twenty-two states experienced a “significant increase” in the rate of uninsured kids from 2022 to 2024, according to the analysis. Just one state, New Hampshire, reported a “significant decrease,” from 3.4% to 2.3%.
Texas continues to have the highest rate of uninsured children ages 18 and under, at 13.6% in 2024, up nearly 3 percentage points from 2022. About 1.1 million Texas kids went without coverage last year, making up nearly a quarter of the nation’s 4.6 million uninsured children.


States with Medicaid expansion for low-income adults — now effective in all but 10 states — had lower uninsured rates among children than states without expansion on a cumulative basis, the Georgetown analysis found. Some expansion states still have relatively high rates, and non-expansion states relatively low ones.
Bruce Lesley, president of First Focus on Children, a national, bipartisan advocacy group, said he fears even more children will lose health coverage as states wrangle with the approximately $1 trillion in federal Medicaid cuts included in H.R. 1, the “big, beautiful” tax-and-spending bill that President Donald Trump signed in July.
“For 20 years, we cut the uninsured rate for kids — it’s probably one of the most significant things to happen to American children in a half a century,” Lesley said. “Now we’re going backward.”
Here are some answers to key questions on the issues based on data and interviews with advocates and experts.
Why is the children’s uninsured rate rising again?
In 1997, the year President Bill Clinton signed the budget bill creating the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP), 15% of U.S. kids — or 10.7 million — were uninsured, up from nearly 14% a couple of years earlier.
CHIP covers kids who don’t qualify for Medicaid but whose families can’t afford private coverage. Its creation led to a dramatic upswing in kids covered by both CHIP and Medicaid because of more intensive outreach efforts, according to federal officials. By 2016, coupled with the effects of the 2010 Affordable Care Act, the rate of uninsured children dropped to a historic low of 4.7%.
Soon after, it started inching back up. By 2019, it was at 5.7%.


Lesley attributed the reversal to a number of actions by the first Trump administration, including weakening “welcome mat” programs and singling out coverage of lawfully present immigrants for additional scrutiny. For example, it slashed funding for ACA marketplace navigators, who help families find affordable coverage, by 84%.
It also expanded the “public charge” rule — which immigration officials use to determine if a person will likely rely on public assistance — to include Medicaid. The change didn’t apply to kids, but researchers documented a chilling effect that led to a drop in Medicaid enrollment of hundreds of thousands of children. The Biden administration reversed the rule change.
More recent drops in kids’ health coverage — those reflected in the new census data — follow the expiration of emergency COVID-19 rules that had paused all Medicaid disenrollments. Millions of children nationwide lost coverage during the Medicaid “unwinding,” when states resumed eligibility checks in spring 2023.
Not every state tackled unwinding the same, and disenrollment rates vary widely. In Oregon, for example, children’s Medicaid enrollment declined about 2%. In Texas, it declined by more than 30%, or by 1.3 million kids, and mostly for paperwork reasons, not because they were ineligible.
“If all states had done as poorly as Texas did with the unwinding,” Alker said, “we would have seen a much higher jump in the uninsured rate of children nationally.”
Will the child uninsured rate keep going up?
According to Alker, “it’s probably happening as we speak.”
Many of the same factors that drove down child coverage in 2016-2019 are back in the second Trump term, she said at the briefing, including funding cuts to ACA enrollment assistance and heightened fears among immigrant families.
Earlier this year, federal health officials agreed to share personal Medicaid data with Immigration and Customs Enforcement. A judge ordered the administration to stop the practice.
One in 4 children and teens in the U.S. has at least one immigrant parent, KFF found.
Children’s health services could see trims even under scaled-back Medicaid cuts

“We’ve already had reports of families dropping coverage over data-privacy fears,” said Lynn Cowles, director of health and food justice at Every Texan, a nonprofit policy institute. “[Immigrants] are scared to go to appointments. … Health centers are getting more requests for telehealth.”
Children’s coverage will also take a hit if Congress lets enhanced ACA tax credits expire later this year. Enrollment in the ACA marketplace has more than doubled to over 24 million since enhanced credits became available in 2021. Those credits are at the heart of the impasse in Congress that’s led to the federal shutdown.
If the credits expire, out-of-pocket premiums will skyrocket and 4.2 million more people will be uninsured by 2034, according to estimates from the Congressional Budget Office. More than 2.1 million U.S. children depended on marketplace coverage in 2024, Georgetown researchers reported.
Cowles said more than 540,000 kids in Texas rely on ACA health plans. She expects many families will be priced out of the marketplace and become uninsured if tax credits expire.
State efforts that make it easier for low-income kids to stay insured face their own expiration date in Trump’s second term. In July, the U.S. Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services said it would not renew or approve additional Medicaid waivers on multiyear coverage for children, citing spending concerns.
Nine states currently have such waivers to provide multiyear Medicaid coverage for kids from birth until age 6. Research shows continuous coverage in Medicaid or CHIP can reduce disenrollments and “churn,” or when kids move on and off the rolls.
In 2022, Oregon became the first state with a multiyear waiver. Dr. Ben Hoffman, a pediatrician at Doernbecher Children’s Hospital in Portland, said the uninterrupted coverage addresses a “critical developmental period” in a young child’s life, when access to preventive and screening services is key.
“We want to make sure kids are as healthy and as ready as possible for kindergarten,” he said.
Oregon’s waiver expires in 2027, meaning families would return to more-frequent eligibility checks. Hoffman hopes the state will make that process as seamless as possible, but he suspects the end result “will be terrible for kids.”
“It’s just an underhanded way to increase turnover and lower costs through attrition,” Hoffman said about CMS’ decision. “In what universe is it beneficial to anybody for a child not to have health insurance?”
Will kids feel the trillion-dollar cut?
Trump signed the sweeping tax-and-spending bill, H.R. 1, in July, approving the biggest federal funding cut in Medicaid’s history — almost $1 trillion over 10 years.
A loss that large likely won’t spare children.
“With almost half of the nation’s children covered by Medicaid and CHIP, they cannot be shielded from a cut of approximately 11%,” Alker said.
Lesley, at First Focus on Children, agreed. State responses to the funding loss will vary and it’s still early, but he worries that lawmakers will seek out cost savings by putting up more enrollment hurdles for families.
“These barriers can be really tragic,” Lesley said

(Dana DiFilippo | New Jersey Monitor)The region’s three biggest airports will not show a video of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem blaming the federal government shutdown on Democrats.
The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, a bistate agency that oversees Newark Liberty, LaGuardia, and JFK airports, said airport-controlled screens will not play Noem’s video.
The 30-second spot, in which Noem warns that the shutdown could affect operations, violates the Port Authority’s longstanding policies that “prevent airing of politically partisan messages at our facilities,” a spokesperson said in a statement to the New Jersey Monitor.
Andy Kim likens Donald Trump’s shutdown behavior to ‘mafia tactics’

The three airports join a growing number of facilities rejecting the video over concerns it violates a 1939 law known as the Hatch Act, which limits partisan political activities for federal workers.
The Port Authority also oversees Teterboro Airport.
Tuesday marks the 14th day of the government shutdown, which was caused by a partisan rift over competing measures to continue funding the government’s operations. Many federal employees are furloughed, while others, like air traffic controllers, are required to work without pay until a deal is reached.
The Trump administration continued on Tuesday to pin the blame for the shutdown on Democrats.
“The Trump Administration won’t shy away from sharing the truth with the American people: Democrats shut down the government because they want to give free health care to illegal aliens — and Americans are suffering as a result. Democrats could reopen the government at any point,” White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said.
Democrats deny that their plan to reopen the government includes free health care for undocumented immigrants. They argue they are withholding support of a GOP plan because it does not extend federal subsidies for health care plans purchased on Affordable Care Act marketplaces.
Tricia McLaughlin, a spokeswoman for the Department of Homeland Security, largely echoed Noem’s script in a statement Tuesday.
“It’s unfortunate our workforce has been put in this position due to political gamesmanship,” McLaughlin said. “Our hope is that Democrats will soon recognize the importance of opening the government.”
A spokesman for Gov. Phil Murphy, a Democrat, deferred comment to the Port Authority. New York Gov. Kathy Hochul, a Democrat, said New York officials are “focused on keeping the flying public safe – and that means not playing political ads in our airports.”
“When Kristi Noem isn’t busy trying to defund the police in New York, she’s apparently hard at work subjecting travelers to obviously false and nakedly partisan messaging,” she said in a statement.

(Photo by Alex Wong/Getty Images)The Florida Supreme Court refused Monday to force the Florida Bar to investigate U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi for alleged state ethics violations, denying a request made by dozens of attorneys and former judges.
The court’s five-sentence rejection sided with the Florida Bar — the overseer of the state’s legal profession — and state Attorney General James Uthmeier in finding that the 70-odd legal experts lacked standing to ask a state-level organization to investigate federal officials, even if they’re certified to practice law in Florida.
“Because petitioner has failed to show a clear legal right to the relief requested, he is not entitled to mandamus relief,” the brief denial reads, co-signed by five of the seven Florida Supreme Court Justices.
“I’m glad to report that the Florida Supreme Court rejected the attempted partisan lawfare against @AGPamBondi. Case dismissed,” Uthmeier celebrated on social media. In September, his office had filed a brief defending Bondi and excoriating the petitioners for trying to force the Florida Bar to investigate her.
Florida Supreme Court justices, via the court
Bondi, 59, served as attorney general for Florida from 2010 through 2018. In November 2024, she became one of a host of Floridians tapped by President Donald Trump to serve in his administration. Bondi was confirmed as U.S. attorney general in February and, as the head of the Department of Justice, she’s been in lockstep with Trump in cracking down on immigration, pushing to expand the death penalty, and working to prosecute former enemies.
But her role hasn’t come without controversy.
Jon May vs The Florida Bar
In June, South Florida defense attorney Jon May filed a complaint with the Florida Bar asking for an investigation into Bondi, accusing the DOJ chief of abusing her power by firing or forcing resignations of federal attorneys.
In his complaint alleging ethics violations, May pointed to three instances, the Miami Herald reported: In February, multiple federal prosecutors in New York and Washington resigned after refusing to follow a DOJ order to drop corruption charges against New York Mayor Eric Adams.
Weeks later, another federal prosecutor resigned rather than carry out orders from Trump officials to pursue charges that she claimed were not supported by evidence. In April, Bondi fired an immigration lawyer accused of “sabotaging” the Trump administration’s case over Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a man mistakenly deported to El Salvador.
May said these examples showed that Bondi “ordered Department lawyers to do things those lawyers were ethically forbidden from doing, under threat of suspension or termination — or fired them for not having done so.”
Still, the Florida Bar dismissed May’s complaint a day after he filed it, noting that the organization doesn’t “investigate or prosecute sitting officers appointed under the U.S. Constitution while they are in office.”
So May, joined by roughly 70 other attorneys, scholars, and former judges — including two retired Florida Supreme Court justices — took his case to the Florida Supreme Court in July. He asked the justices to issue a writ of mandamus to the Florida Bar — a court order forcing a official or agency to do its job — to investigate the complaint against Bondi.
Florida’s legal officers, headed by DeSantis-appointee Uthmeier, pushed back on May’s case as an example of “partisan lawfare” in a friend-of-the-court brief supporting the Florida Bar.

You can’t have the Land of Enchantment without the public lands that define New Mexico. As a born-and-raised Burqueño, I’m proud to celebrate Albuquerque’s recent leadership in public lands protection, especially as these critical spaces are under attack from the Trump administration.
Access to world-class protected places like the Petroglyph National Monument, Valle de Oro National Wildlife Refuge, and the Sandia Mountain Wilderness have defined my life — from my career, to my childhood, and even my romance. As a young child, I was inspired to pursue a career in environmental science while out on hikes in the Sandia mountains with siblings, friends, parents, and grandparents. As a former environmental educator, I had the joy of taking the next generation of environmental stewards to study wildlife at Valle de Oro. And I met my soulmate at Petroglyph National Monument, where we deepened our love for a protected place while falling in love with each other.
When the Trump Administration announced its plans to sell-off public lands in New Mexico and across the country to the highest bidder (i.e., private developers and Big Oil and Gas), it was a personal issue. I know I’m not alone in this fight — a recent national poll shows 71% of voters nationwide oppose public lands sell-off. In early October, Albuquerque City Council unanimously passed a Public Lands Memorial to protect the public lands in the greater Albuquerque area from sell-off and development. My gratitude and congratulations go out to the Council, especially Councilor Tammy Fiebelkorn, who led this effort. Making the decision to protect public lands in the Greater Albuquerque area is an investment in the future of our community. Annually, New Mexico’s public lands contribute $3 billion to our state economy through public recreation, and support 30,000 jobs across the state.
Taking steps to protect and fund the stewardship of Albuquerque’s lands supports critical habitat corridors for endangered species and beloved migratory birds such as the sandhill crane. Keeping lands public and protected supports more accessible, affordable spaces for families in Albuquerque to get outside. In protecting its public lands, Albuquerque plays an important role in strengthening recreational and cultural connectivity between southern New Mexico’s world-class national parks and monuments – like White Sands, Carlsbad Caverns, the Gila Wilderness, and the Organ Mountains, with international ski destinations like those in the Santa Fe and Carson national forests. By the way, these are all public lands, which will remain under threat by an increasingly overreaching Trump administration.
Just this past summer, thousands of New Mexicans joined together in Santa Fe to protest Trump’s Secretary of the Interior — the federal agency responsible for stewardship of public lands — for being Trump’s enforcer on rolling back protections for public lands. In the right hands, like former Secretary of the Interior Deb Haaland, this agency can help guide the stewardship of public lands to reflect the cultural, recreational, environmental and many other benefits of public lands. However, while the Trump administration turns its back on these values, local municipalities and states’ governments can provide support to ensure public hands remain protected. As a young professional, I’m choosing to make roots in New Mexico not only because of what our public lands means to me, but also because I know I’m a part of a local community that cherishes the environmental, cultural, and economic values of protecting these public lands.
Now is the time to say “no” to the Trump administration’s attacks on public lands and an opportunity to say “yes” to all the values that Albuquerque’s public lands have to offer. I’m calling on local governments in New Mexico and across the West to join Albuquerque in its leadership to keep public lands in public hands for generations to come.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/20240603_182450-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-10-14 12:57:25.424770

“We’re proud to help Delaware homeowners take advantage of these federal incentives before
they disappear,” said Ben Boyce Sr., owner of Aire Serv Heating and Air. “Heat pumps have
come a long way—they’re reliable, efficient, and environmentally responsible. This is the perfect
time for families to upgrade, lower their monthly bills, and enjoy greater comfort year-round. At
Aire Serv, our mission has always been to serve our neighbors with expertise, honesty, and

Why Heat Pumps Are a Smart Upgrade
Modern heat pumps—either as all-electric systems or in hybrid (dual-fuel) setups—are gaining
popularity for good reason. They transfer heat rather than generate it, which often leads to
efficiency ratings of 200–300%. In contrast, even the best gas furnaces lose energy through
exhaust. The improved reliability, quieter operation, and reduced environmental impact make
heat pumps a compelling option for many homeowners.

Early in her military career, she collapsed from heat exhaustion while carrying a 65-pound pack on a sweltering hike in Quantico, Virginia. Years later in Afghanistan, Rivera drove a truck in temperatures nearing 120 degrees. But she was ready. She’d taken a mechanics course — twice — to make sure she could fix the truck’s air conditioning if it failed.
She knew extreme heat could incapacitate her Marines. “They need water and good temps like everybody,” she said.

Across the U.S. military, climate change isn’t a distant threat. It’s a daily challenge. The fallout from a warming planet has hit the military hard, sidelining more than 10,000 troops since 2018, flooding bases and undermining everything from runways to nuclear readiness.
Extreme weather is battering installations from Guam to North Carolina and fueling instability in regions overseas where American forces may be called to intervene.
For decades, the Pentagon viewed climate change as a national security threat — not for environmental reasons, but because it undermined operations and readiness. 
Now the Trump administration is dismantling that approach. Pentagon leaders have cut climate research funding and abandoned adaptation plans. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has dismissed global warming concerns as “climate change crap.” 
Critics warn that the military is being forced to fly blind — and that the cost could be strategic vulnerability in a world where climate is increasingly shaping conflict.
“I think it puts our troops at risk,” said Erin Sikorsky, director of the Center for Climate and Security. “… We’re going to be less prepared if our troops are deployed somewhere where it’s incredibly hot and their equipment doesn’t work right, or if they themselves can’t physically operate … That’s malpractice, I think.”
The Defense Department did not respond to Floodlight’s requests for public documents and an interview to discuss changes to its climate policy.
The Pentagon’s 2026 budget request recommends cutting $1.6 billion in “wasteful” climate spending. Among the targeted programs: a $6 million grant to decarbonize emissions from Navy ships. Where most of the remaining cuts would come from is unclear.
That marked a sharp break from the previous administration, when the Department of Defense sought $5 billion for climate initiatives in its fiscal 2024 budget — including efforts to harden bases against extreme weather and reduce battlefield fuel dependence.

How warming undermines U.S. military power
In September 2018, Hurricane Florence dumped 36 inches of rain on Camp Lejeune in North Carolina, creating a 13-foot storm surge and damaging more than 3,000 homes at the Marine Corps base and nearby air stations.
Just a month later, Hurricane Michael struck Tyndall Air Force Base in Florida with 160 mph winds, flipping fighter jets and damaging more than 600 buildings. The branch spent nearly $5 billion to repair and upgrade the base to become more resilient to future storms. 
And in May 2023, Typhoon Mawar slammed Andersen Air Force base in Guam with 140 mph winds and 28 inches of rain. The storm upended cars, took out power lines and damaged nearly 500 buildings. It cost nearly $10 billion to repair and to harden the base against future extreme weather events. 
According to the National Weather Service, unusually warm ocean temperatures supercharged all three storms.

These aren’t isolated events. Rising seas are projected to cause chronic flooding at coastal military bases in the coming decades. By 2050, half of coastal bases could each face 270 or more flood events each year, according to a study by the Union of Concerned Scientists.
Major storms can hobble nuclear deterrence, too. Hurricanes could damage submarines or delay the transport of nuclear warheads, warned researcher Jamie Kwong, a fellow in the Nuclear Policy Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. All three nuclear delivery systems — air, land and water — could be hampered by climate change, she said. 
Training and lives at risk
Since 2022, the U.S. military has been deployed to more than 230 climate emergencies, according to the nonprofit Center for Climate and Security. 
Much of that work has fallen to the National Guard. Over the past decade, the National Guard put in nearly 4 million days of service responding to hurricanes, floods, wildfires and other disasters, the Pentagon said in a recent report to four Democratic U.S. senators who had requested the information.
And heat-related illnesses among troops are climbing. From 2020 to 2024, the annual rate of heat exhaustion among service members jumped 52%. In 2024 alone, troops suffered more than 2,800 heat-related illnesses. 
Fort Benning has long had a problem with excessive heat. Stretching across 182,000 hot and muggy acres in west-central Georgia straddling the Alabama state line, it’s one of the Army’s top training centers — and it has recorded more heat-related illnesses than any other U.S. military base. Until about a decade ago, someone there was dying from the heat every three years.
That crisis led to the 2019 creation of the U.S. Army’s Heat Center at Fort Benning, where military personnel are taught how to prevent and treat heat-related illnesses.
Officers there developed techniques like arm immersion — lowering soldiers’ arms into cold water during training breaks to reduce body temperature — and ice sheeting, where frozen bed sheets are wrapped around overheated troops to bring down body heat quickly.

To reduce the risk of heat illnesses, the military generally suspends nonessential outdoor activities on extremely hot days. One such instance occurred in August, when a heat wave gripping the Korean Peninsula forced U.S. and South Korean forces to postpone half of their field training exercises.
These so-called “black flag” days— generally 90 degrees Fahrenheit or above —  are becoming more common at many military bases, according to a 2023 Defense Department report. 
As global temperatures rise, the military may have to suspend summer training at its hottest bases and “spend a heck of a lot of money” to relocate that training, predicts Caroline Baxter, a former deputy assistant secretary of defense for education and training under the Biden administration.
It’s not just troops who suffer. Military planes and ships are affected, too. Hot, humid air is less dense, which means planes struggle to generate the lift they need and can’t carry as much cargo. In fact, a 2019 Climate and Security brief warns that hotter, more humid air will force military aircraft to reduce payloads — or abandon missions entirely. 
During the 2016 raid to capture Osama bin Laden, one of the Black Hawk helicopters sustained severe damage during a hard landing. President Barack Obama emphasized the impact that the hot temperature had on the incident.
Warm seawater, meanwhile, makes it harder to cool ship engines, while melting glaciers dilute ocean salinity, which can compromise the effectiveness of sonar. 
As the world warms, it’s bringing more droughts and food shortages to fragile areas, contributing to problems that threaten national security interests, the U.S. Army said in its 2022 climate strategy document. 
Retired Army Lt. Gen. Russel Honoré, who led the military response to Hurricane Katrina in 2005, noted that drought caused by global warming helped trigger the 2011 Syrian civil war and the later armed conflict in Sudan. He has since founded the Green Army, an organization that fights toxic pollution in Louisiana.
“You can change your policy to not consider the impact of global warming on your strategic posture,” Honoré said, “but … the heat will cause a disruption to global stability as well as security. And it will continue to have a human impact on our day-to-day training and operational readiness.”
Melting Arctic ice also increases the potential for military conflict, experts say, because it’s opening up shipping lanes that were once inaccessible. Contested economic and military activities between Russia and other Arctic nations “will increase the risk of miscalculation,” a 2023 threat assessment by the U.S. Intelligence Community warned.
“What that really means is there is an accident waiting to happen,” according to “Threat Multiplier,” a book by Sherri Goodman, who as deputy undersecretary of defense led the military’s environmental efforts during the Clinton administration. 
Mission over emissions
For more than 25 years, the U.S. military planned for climate change.
The Department of Defense developed its first climate change strategy in 1998 and a decade later declared global warming a national security issue. After Joe Biden took office, the military’s focus on climate impacts took on new urgency.
“Climate change is an existential threat to our nation’s security,” then-Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said in 2021, “and the Department of Defense must act swiftly and boldly to take on this challenge and prepare for damage that cannot be avoided.” 
For the Pentagon, climate change wasn’t just about the environment — it was about how and where troops could operate.
“How do I continue to do my job despite the fact that the operational environment is changing?” said John Conger, a former high-ranking Defense Department official who later ran the Center for Climate and Security. “ …You’re not thinking about emissions, you’re thinking about missions.”
In 2022, the U.S. Army began rolling out its first hybrid tactical vehicles. There was a practical reason for that, too: Hybrids are quieter and consume less fuel, which can save lives in combat.
“We were losing marines and soldiers in the constant movement of fuel to the front in Afghanistan and Iraq,” Goodman wrote in her book. “For every 24 fuel convoys in Afghanistan, one soldier was killed.”
Some Pentagon projects aimed at boosting effectiveness and efficiency have also spun off climate-friendly civilian innovations. For example, the military’s work with General Motors on hydrogen fuel cells produced fast-charging, off-grid power units that could speed electric car charging.

New doctrine: Climate doesn’t matter anymore
President Donald Trump has pushed to rechristen the Department of Defense as the “Department of War.” And  Hegseth has made it clear that the Pentagon’s priorities have shifted.
“The @DeptofDefense does not do climate change crap,” he wrote in a March posting on X. “We do training and warfighting.” 
On March 17, Hegseth issued a memo banning Pentagon agencies from spending money on climate planning and ordering leaders to “remove all references to climate change and related subjects from mission statements.”
Hegseth doubled down on his message in his Sept. 30 address to hundreds of military leaders at Quantico, declaring there would be “no more climate change worship” in the U.S. military.
The secretary’s March directive does leave room for the continuation of some weather-related work, including risk assessments, environmental reviews and base resilience improvements.
But the Pentagon also announced it’s canceling 91 studies focused on climate and social science research. The move will save $30 million — a tiny fraction of the department’s $850 billion budget. That research was designed to help military planners anticipate emerging security threats, including climate change, extremism and disinformation. 
‘We’re not going to be ready’
Cutting those grants is short-sighted, says Tom Ellison, deputy director of the Center for Climate and Security. His group, working with Virginia Tech, was slated to get $2 million to study how rising seas and extreme weather could fuel instability in the Philippines, Guam and Japan — regions important to U.S. strategy in the Indo-Pacific. But in March, they learned the grant was canceled.
“These research projects answer key questions about not just climate change, but a variety of issues shaping the world in which the US military operates, including migration, technology, ideology, public opinion, etc.” Ellison wrote in an email to Floodlight. 
“Moreover,” he added, “they do it for relative pennies,” noting the Pentagon spends $30 million “roughly every 20 minutes.” 
Climate action plans from the Army, Navy, Air Force and Coast Guard have quietly disappeared from public websites in recent months. The Pentagon also shut down its climate resilience portal. 
Baxter, the former deputy assistant defense secretary, helped build that portal, which she called a vital hub for validated climate data. 
Said Conger, the former Center for Climate and Security director: “If you do not have complete information because you willfully ignore certain parts of the puzzle, you put yourself at a disadvantage — because the Russians and the Chinese aren’t ignoring it.”
Sikorsky, the center’s current director, agreed. 
“It sends a message to our competitors and adversaries … ‘We’re going to be weak because we’re not going to be ready.’”

Perfect fall weather sets the stage for thousands of walkers uniting across Delaware in 5K Walks to celebrate health, friendship, and community impact
WILMINGTON, Del. (Oct. 14, 2025) — With crisp fall air, clear skies, and golden leaves setting the scene, Delawareans are preparing to step into a weekend filled with purpose — joining thousands across the state for a series of 5Ks and charity walks that combine fitness, fun, and compassion.
For Glen Gray of Wilmington, this weekend’s Walk to End Alzheimer’s is personal. Gray has gathered friends and family to honor several loved ones affected by the disease. “This is one of those weekends where a small step can have a huge impact,” Gray said. “You don’t have to be a runner or an athlete — just showing up helps your neighbors, your friends, and your community in ways that truly matter.”
That sense of community connection extends across Delaware, from Smyrna to Lewes. “Every October, we see new faces who start by walking one mile and end up volunteering year-round,” said McKenzie Blithe from the Delaware Breast Cancer Coalition. “It all starts with the first step — that’s how awareness grows, and that’s how lives are changed.”
From the purple Promise Gardens of Wilmington’s Riverfront to the garden paths of Smyrna and the sand trails of Cape Henlopen, more than 5,000 Delaware residents are expected to take part in at least five major events between Saturday and Sunday, October 18–19 — walking for causes that touch nearly every family in the First State.

Wilmington’s Walk to End Alzheimer’s: A Sea of Purple for a Powerful Cause
The highlight of the weekend will be Wilmington’s Walk to End Alzheimer’s, one of Delaware’s most emotional and unifying events, where caregivers, advocates, and families come together to honor loved ones and advance the search for a cure.
Set for Saturday, October 18, at Tubman Garrett Riverfront Park, the event already boasts over 750 registered participants and 127 teams, with fundraising nearing $180,000 toward a $283,000 goal.
The morning begins with registration at 8:00 a.m., followed by the Promise Garden Ceremony at 9:00 a.m., where participants hold colored flowers representing their connection to the disease — blue for those living with Alzheimer’s, yellow for caregivers, purple for those who’ve lost someone, and orange for supporters.
“This is a community that refuses to give up hope,” said a spokesperson for the Alzheimer’s Association Delaware Valley Chapter. “Every step taken, every flower lifted, represents a promise to keep fighting for a world without Alzheimer’s.”
Funds raised will support local caregiver programs, education and outreach services, and Alzheimer’s research. Walkers can still register, volunteer, or donate online.

Communities Across Delaware Join In
While Wilmington’s Riverfront glows purple on Saturday, the spirit of giving will echo throughout Delaware as multiple charity walks and 5Ks bring together families, friends, and co-workers to support causes that make lasting change.

Cody Balmer, the Harrisburg man accused of firebombing the Governor’s Residence in April as Gov. Josh Shapiro, his family and guests slept inside, pleaded guilty to attempted murder with a sentencing enhancement for terrorism on Tuesday.
Balmer, 38, will serve a total sentence of 25 to 50 years. He’ll be eligible for parole in 2050 when he is 63 years old.
Balmer, who confessed to police when he was arrested hours after starting the fire, said that he disagreed with Shapiro’s position on the Israeli response to the Oct. 7, 2023, attack by the Palestinian militant group Hamas that killed more than 1,100 people. Balmer said he had planned to kill Shapiro with a hammer he carried as he broke into the residence.
All 22 people who were in the residence, including Shapiro, his family, and guests celebrating the Passover holiday, were evacuated safely. All were asleep save two state troopers who were on guard.
Balmer also pleaded guilty to 46 other charges, including aggravated arson, burglary and the reckless endangerment of 22 individuals, including children between the ages of 8 and 16.
Dauphin County District Attorney Fran Chardo said in a press conference after the hearing, “I think it was the right sentence based on, thankfully, that no one was hurt or killed … The fact that it was by guilty plea, that’s a good thing.”
Video evidence played in court, captured by security cameras around the Governor’s Residence, showed Balmer breaking a window with a sledge hammer and throwing a Molotov cocktail into the home. Balmer then broke a second window and entered the residence.
Judge Deborah Curcillo called the video evidence “horrific.”
Chardo said in court that Balmer then tried to break down multiple doors in the home, including one with people sleeping behind it. When he was unable to move further into the residence, he set off a second molotov cocktail and fled the grounds.
The incident occurred early in the morning of April 13, the first night of the Jewish Passover holiday.
Balmer called 911 and turned himself in shortly after the attack. He cited Shapiro’s stance on the war in Gaza between Israel and the militant group Hamas as his motivation for the attack.
According to Chardo, this motivation, along with Blamer’s confession that he intended to kill Shapiro with a sledge hammer if he had found him, was the basis for the terrorism enhancement to the attempted murder charge, doubling the sentence.
Shapiro is the highest-ranking Jewish official in Pennsylvania.
Chardo read a letter from Shapiro and his wife, First Lady Lori Shapiro, in court. The letter said that Shapiro and his family have been left with a “nagging sense of fear,” which has manifested in trouble sleeping and anxiety while in public.
“Time has now separated between before the fire and after the fire,” the letter said. “It’s a fear and anxiety we are learning to live with, but we are expecting to carry with us for a lifetime.”
Mary Clapp, one of the public defenders representing Balmer in court, read a letter from Balmer’s family.
It described Balmer as a loving father and active community member who had struggled with mental illness in the time before the attack on the Governor’s Residence. The letter said Balmer’s family had tried to get him committed in the days ahead of the incident, but the request was denied because he was not considered an immediate danger.
“While Cody’s actions can not be excused, they can only be understood” through the lens of mental illness, the letter said. Members of Balmer’s family were present for the hearing.
Chardo confirmed a police call was made and that did not result in involuntary commitment.
“Our mental health procedures act is an old one. It’s more than 40 years old,” Chardo said. “We need to figure out how to deal with that in a better way so that people are not getting their treatment for mental health by being stuck in jails.”",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-14-at-10.23.33 AM.png,,,2025-10-14 11:59:43.392807
,Connecticut Mirror,2025-10-14 15:08:30+00:00,CT Mirror,Darien outlines plans to boost affordable housing,Abigail Brone | Connecticut Public,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/10/14/darien-affordable-housing-fairfield-county/,The town is trying to set an example for surrounding Fairfield County communities on ways to increase affordable housing stock responsibly.,"Over the last 15 years several apartment buildings that incorporate affordable housing and retail space were constructed in downtown Darien, but local officials say there is still room for improvement.
The town is trying to set an example for surrounding Fairfield County communities on ways to increase affordable housing stock responsibly.
One of the main ways towns can work to increase affordable housing is by giving financially to a project, according to Evonne Klein, with the Fairfield County Center for Housing Opportunity.
“What towns can contribute is critically important, because you want as much money as possible to go into the units and not into parking or not into fees,” Klein said.
Financial assistance can come from grant funding or a local affordable housing trust fund in lieu of constructing affordable units, Klein said.
Klein is also the former chief executive officer of the Connecticut Coalition to End Homelessness. She also once served as Commissioner of the state’s Department of Housing.
Klein led a walk through several housing developments near Darien’s Metro-North train station Thursday, highlighting developments constructed within roughly the last 15 years.
Communities along the New Haven rail line have the unique opportunity to develop transit-oriented, walkable communities around the train stations, Klein said.
“I’m proud that Darian is able to do that and offer people of all incomes, and hopefully more of all incomes, housing choice,” Klein said. “Not just homeownership opportunities, because most of our municipalities are single family homes, they’ve been zoned for single family homes. So more and more we’ve had more approvals of multifamily projects, some with affordable on-site.”
Darien’s affordability requirement says affordable units must be available at 80% of the State Median Income (SMI), as opposed to the more commonly used Area Median Income (AMI). Using SMI instead makes the units more accessible to a range of income levels, Klein said.
At those rates, a single income household must earn no more than about $64,000 to qualify for an affordable apartment, Klein said. Two- and three-person households must earn no more than about $83,000 and $103,000, respectively, to qualify.
Four percent of Darien’s housing stock is considered affordable, which is still below the state mandate requiring towns and cities to make 10% of their housing stock affordable.
“We also want to build housing that is affordable,” Steve Olvany, chairman of Darien’s Planning and Zoning Commission, said. “That’s why I don’t want all the two bedrooms or three bedrooms torn down. There’s people that want to bulldoze those neighborhoods, which we just walked down, and put up townhouses and put affordable housing.”
However, there’s still work to be done in Darien to increase housing options, particularly for people who may earn too much to qualify for an affordable apartment, but too little to be able to purchase a home in Fairfield County, according to Olvany.
“You’re a recent college graduate. You cannot afford a house that is $800,000. You don’t make that much money,” Olvany said. “They don’t necessarily want to live in apartments, so you need to build affordable housing, and housing that is affordable.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/DSCN7127.jpg,,,2025-10-14 11:59:43.392807

(Photo by Wichayada Suwanachun/Getty Images)TOPEKA — Kansas’ health ranking had one of the steepest declines in the nation in the past 30 years, according to a study that sought to identify potential reasons and fixes for the state’s downward slide.
One hundred experts determined that Kansas’ lack of a coherent policy agenda, income disparities and fragile, underfunded health care systems have contributed to the state dropping from eighth in the country in 1991 to 28th in 2024.
“Kansas’ health ranking decline reflects deeply rooted structural and cultural dynamics, not simply individual behaviors or programmatic gaps. Turning the tide will require a fundamental shift in how health is prioritized and pursued,” said four authors who recently published reports through the Kansas Health Institute under the title, “What Happened to Health in Kansas?”
The institute surveyed health professionals, academics, advocates, community organizations and public health, state and local government officials and analyzed their responses after three rounds of questionnaires to identify a collective consensus.
That consensus contained insight into the reasons for Kansas’ ill health and why leadership is the most direct way to fix it.
“Kansas is one of only 10 states that have not expanded Medicaid, and not surprisingly, nine of those 10 states fall in the bottom half of the rankings,” one participant said in the report.
The report cited rural hospital closures, the lack of Medicaid expansion, limited mental health services and low public health funding as the highest priorities to resolve. Next, participants said chronic disease, obesity, wealth inequality, workforce shortages, housing access, absence of a culture of health, and piecemeal systems were also identified as key priorities to address the state’s health dip.
The decline also can be attributed, in part, to lower than average levels of physical activity, higher than average smoking and a higher than average teen birth rate, according to America’s Health Rankings, a platform under the United Health Foundation.
“While downstream conditions such as chronic disease, obesity and related risk factors were rated as important, participants placed greater emphasis on the upstream and midstream policy and infrastructure conditions that influence these outcomes,” the report said. “This suggests that stakeholders perceive many of Kansas’ downstream health challenges as symptoms of broader systemic issues, particularly insufficient access to care, underinvestment in public health capacity and fragmentation across sectors.”
Another survey participant characterized the cultural norms surrounding health care in Kansas: “There’s a whole ideology built around the idea that people’s circumstances are the direct result of their behavior, their choices and their fundamental goodness or badness.”
In the report, the authors — who are Kevin Kovach, Emma Uridge, Viktoria Sterkhova and Wen-Chieh Lin — acknowledge that Kansas’ health ranking was declining before Medicaid expansion was an option. They concluded that Kansas’ health systems need strong leadership.
“But this is not leadership as authority or position,” they wrote. “It is leadership as practice focused on engaging others to co-create change through action, learning and shared meaning making.”
The Kansas Health Foundation is positioning itself to embody that kind of leadership.
Despite the state’s declining well-being, the health rankings platform featured the Kansas Health Foundation as a prime example for approaching health holistically while using data to focus on the root causes of health problems, such as social and economic factors.
“Data holds you accountable. The point of measuring something is to create pressure to do something,” said Ed O’Malley, president and CEO of the foundation, in a Sep. 29 news release.
The foundation is a Wichita-based nonprofit that funds the Topeka-based Kansas Health Institute, along with other health-focused organizations.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/GettyImages-2176362473-scaled-1-1024x618.jpg,,,2025-10-14 10:57:33.713932

(University of Kentucky photo)Beloved Kentucky writer Gurney Norman, whose fiction chronicled life in Appalachia and the 1960s counterculture, died Oct. 12. He was 88.
Norman taught and mentored generations of aspiring writers as the University of Kentucky’s director of creative writing and a professor of English. 
He was Kentucky’s poet laureate and the recipient of many awards and honors including an honorary Doctor of Humane Letters from Berea College and an affiliation with novelist Ken Kesey’s Merry Pranksters.
Norman’s legacy — “the tail of his comet” — will live on in “all the writers to whom he’s been tremendously influential,” said Willie Davis, a writer in Lexington and creative writing teacher at Kentucky State University. “He was kind and generous with his time.”
Davis said reading Norman’s work, especially “Kinfolks,” opened his eyes by depicting Appalachia in ways more alive and vivid than common stereotypical treatments. “He writes with such precision. His characters are so full of life. It really enraptured me. I told him if everyone wrote about a mountain like you write about a mountain, no one would ever tear another mountain down.”
 Gurneyfest
In the fall of 2023, Norman’s fans, friends and scholars gathered at UK for a two-day Gurneyfest that included music, readings, discussions and a screening of “The Wilgus Stories,” a trilogy of short films starring Ned Beatty and otherwise unknown actors adapted from the short story collection “Kinfolks.” 
Published in 1977 and told through the eyes of young Wilgus Collier, a coal miner’s son, the stories illuminate “the universal experiences of love, loss, and finding one’s way in the world,” says a KET description.
In an interview in 2001 with KET producer Guy Mendes, Norman, who was born in Grundy, Virginia, remembered growing up between two sets of grandparents, one in southwestern Virginia, one near Hazard in the Perry County coal camp of Allais.
His mother was a teacher and his father a coal miner who exposed him to books and ideas.
“I remember enjoying so much hanging around with my dad on days off with all his buddies, these miners. And they would all be clean and have on a nice clean shirt, and they were enjoying being out in the sunshine. And their talk was … It was excellent, it was wonderful. I could listen forever. And the best part about it for me was the humor,” Norman told Mendes.
“I remember a hundred times, probably, these friends of my dad’s — you know, I was like 4 and 5 and 6 years old — but one of his buddies every now and then would grab the seat of my pants, and he would say, ‘Well, I can tell you’re going to be a miner by the slack in your pants.’ And this was a kind of teasing that was very benign. But I just remember everybody being articulate and very creative with language.”
Norman said he knew from age 15 — the year his father died — that he wanted to be a writer. “You know, that was an emotional upset. I don’t think I showed it, but I remember soon after he died I just felt this need to write stories.” He received some encouragement from a teacher and also wrote for his high school newspaper and yearbook.

‘Kentucky Fab Five’
Arriving at the University of Kentucky in 1955, he first majored in journalism, writing a satirical column for the student newspaper, the Kentucky Kernel, before gravitating to literature and the English department where he studied with professors Hollis Summers Jr.  and Robert Hazel.
Also studying creative writing at UK and striking up lifelong friendships with Norman and each other were soon-to-be acclaimed Kentucky writers Wendell Berry, the late Ed McClanahan and the late James Baker Hall.
“They were exciting times. It was a time of ferment,” Norman recalled.
Bobie Ann Mason, who would become a bestselling novelist, also was a student in the UK English department. They came to be known as the “Kentucky Fab Five” for their literary accomplishments. 
On Friday nights, Norman recalled, the Paddock Club on the corner of Euclid and Rose streets, “was the most interesting and fabulous quasi-Bohemian place that you could find — based not on espresso, but on beer.” 
In 1960, Norman received a Wallace Stegner Fellowship in Creative Writing at Stanford University where he studied with literary critic Malcolm Cowley and the Irish short story writer Frank O’Connor.
At Stanford, Norman and McClanahan became friends with Ken Kesey, also studying creative writing, and soon to be author of “One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest” and “Sometimes a Great Notion.”
‘Divine Right’s Trip’
While Kesey gained fame for an LSD-fueled cross-country trip in an old bus from his home in Oregon, Norman wrote about a fictional journey from California to a Kentucky mountain farm in “Divine Right’s Trip: A Novel of the Counterculture,” published in 1971 by Stewart Brand in The Last Whole Earth Catalog.
The novel follows “Divine Right (D. R.) Davenport, a restless young man on a journey of self-discovery, as he embarks on a cross-country road trip in his beloved but unreliable old Volkswagen bus, Urge,” according to a description by Ohio University Press.
Brand, who was Norman’s neighbor in Menlo Park, California, paid him a monthly stipend of $300 to write the novel. “In the ’60s one could live a happy life on that,” Norman told Dee Davis in a 20221 interview in The Daily Yonder.
“Divine Right’s Trip,” the Gnomon Press version. (Ohio University Press)
“And so, I sat down and started making up a story right out of … I don’t know, I just started making it up. And when the chips are down and someone says here’s an opportunity, ‘Just make it up.’ Well, you just start making it up. And it helped that I myself had become a kind of alternative person and had had certain visionary experiences.”
“Divine Right’s Trip” was later published by the Dial Press, Bantam Books and Gnomon Press. 
Along the way Norman, who had been in ROTC, served two years in the U.S. Army; was a reporter for the Hazard Herald in Kentucky, and staffed a fire tower in the Cascade Mountains of Oregon, before joining the English faculty at UK in 1979.
He was inducted into the Kentucky Writers Hall of Fame in 2019.
His nonfiction includes “Confronting Appalachian Stereotypes: Back Talk from an American Region” written with Dwight B. Billings and Katherine Ledford, published by the University Press of Kentucky, and “An American Vein: Critical Readings in Appalachian Literature” with Danny Miller and Sharon Hatfield published by the Ohio University Press.
Other fiction includes “Book One From Crazy Quilt: A Novel in Progress” published by  Larkspur Press and “Ancient Creek: A Folktale” published by Old Cove Press, a Lexington publishing house founded by Nyoka Hawkins, Norman’s wife of 29 years.
Hawkins, in announcing Norman’s death Monday on Facebook, wrote, “Gurney’s spirit was so vast, so powerful and affirming, he will never leave us. We have his words, his stories and his books, the gift of his brilliant and graceful writing. 
“But his presence in the world, his essence, his being, was so much larger than books. He was a force of generous, irresistible love that a hundred books could never contain. I feel him here with me now as I write this, urging me on with those amazing blue eyes and powerful smile.”
Hawkins said his health challenges had mounted in the last four months and that “he went peacefully, no pain, no struggle.”
She said a memorial and celebration of Gurney Norman’s life will be held later this year.

The Deep South Today Investigative Reporting Center will launch in early 2026 with a lead investigative editor, dedicated full-time investigative and data reporters, and New York Times Local Investigations Fellows at Mississippi Today and Verite News. It will also include support from Big Local News, a program at Stanford University that empowers journalists with data, tools and collaborations. As the Deep South Today network of newsrooms continues to grow, the Deep South Today Investigative Reporting Center will add capacity in its new newsrooms with dedicated reporters and fellows.
“The Deep South Today newsrooms are already publishing impactful and award-winning investigative reporting, and our new Investigative Reporting Center in collaboration with The New York Times Local Investigations Fellowship will dramatically expand the breadth and depth of that work,” said Warwick Sabin, President and CEO of Deep South Today. “We developed Deep South Today to provide the infrastructure to sustain and grow local journalism in a region that is under-resourced and underserved, and this critically important initiative will advance our mission.”
The New York Times Local Investigations Fellowship is committing substantial resources in addition to the fellowship positions. Deputy Editor Chris Davis will manage the Deep South Today investigative team and the work will be co-published by Deep South Today newsrooms and The Times, and made available to local news organizations for co-publication. The Times will also lend staff time to help Deep South Today recruit, hire and train the editors and reporters who will be a part of their new investigative reporting center, as well as edit the stories being produced. Support from the Times will help fast-track Deep South Today’s ambitious goals to produce local beat coverage and investigative stories of importance to communities across the region. Additionally, the Local Investigations Fellowship will continue working with other newsrooms across the U.S. to produce original accountability journalism.
“Deep South Today has big ambitions for robust coverage of the South and building an investigative team is vital to that mission,” said Dean Baquet, former Executive Editor of The Times who now leads the Local Investigations Fellowship program. “We’ve already worked with Mississippi Today to much success and we look forward to doing more.”
Across the Deep South, the capacity of local and state newsrooms to produce resource-intensive, in-depth investigative reporting that exposes injustice and holds the powerful accountable is scarce. Local journalism is under attack on numerous fronts, and this initiative is being launched at a critical time when access to public information in the public interest is increasingly being restricted and accountability reporting is more challenging than ever to produce.
“This collaboration will redefine what’s possible for local journalism,” said Adam Ganucheau, Deep South Today’s Executive Editor and Chief Content Officer and a native Mississippian. “By combining the familiarity and trust of Deep South Today’s newsrooms with the resources and expertise of The New York Times, we’re building something truly unprecedented — a regional force for accountability and change. Together, we’re proving that the future of investigative reporting starts here, in communities that need it most.”
By working with The Times to launch and build out a new investigative reporting center, Deep South Today will position an upstart investigative team alongside some of the most prominent editors in the journalism industry. This initiative builds on the success that Mississippi Today already established with The Times and Big Local News: A joint investigation by those organizations about corruption and abuse by Mississippi sheriffs was a finalist for the 2024 Pulitzer Prize in Local Reporting and led to expanded federal investigations and legislative reforms in the state. Mississippi Today also separately won the Pulitzer Prize for Local Reporting in 2023 for its investigative series “The Backchannel” and The Local Investigations Fellowship won the Pulitzer Prize for Local Reporting in 2025 in collaboration with the Baltimore Banner and Big Local News for an investigation into the deadly opioid crisis.
“This collaboration is about more than just investigative journalism — it’s about building power through reporting in communities that have long been overlooked and where local newspapers are struggling to survive” said Terry Baquet, Verite News Editor-in-Chief and a Louisiana native. “We’re not just working together on stories; with The New York Times, we’re building a new model for how serious journalism can thrive in the South. It’s deeply personal to me, and I believe it is the future of local journalism.”
Integrating data journalism into the investigative teams and providing mentoring and training in computational methods with the support of Big Local News will level up the capacities of the Deep South Today newsrooms to uncover hidden patterns, provide sophisticated investigative coverage, and lower the cost of accountability reporting through better use of tools and algorithms.
“These resources mean Big Local News will be able to provide data journalism support to the Deep South reporters and editors that will further equip them to find and report out critical investigative stories,” said Cheryl Phillips, Founder and Co-Director of Big Local News. “I hope this work in the Deep South can serve as a model for how to scale local news.”
This initiative was made possible through a grant from Arnold Ventures, and Deep South Today and The Times view it as an opportunity to create a new sustainable, replicable model for building strong regional investigative teams that can produce high-impact local, state and regional stories in underserved communities.
All of the new positions for the Deep South Today Investigative Reporting Center will soon be posted on the Deep South Today website at: https://deepsouthtoday.org/careers

	APU’s Indigenous Peoples’ Day celebration combined festivities, food and education. There were dances, demonstrations of traditional Native sports, a buffet featuring salmon and reindeer stews, and educational booths hosted by artists and activists.
Phillip Blanchett, the musician and artist who emceed the event, took time to speak about the flood and storm damages in Western Alaska’s Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta, his home region.
He asked the audience to think about the people who were missing or otherwise suffering from the remnants of Typhoon Halong, which lashed the region and caused record flooding and hurricane-force winds.
Blanchett, who is Yup’ik, was in his hometown of Bethel over the weekend. His band, Pamyua, played a benefit concert for the local public media station, KYUK, on Saturday night, just before the storm hit. He saw the water rising just before he was able to fly to Anchorage, he said.

Local people prepared the best they could, but it’s difficult to combat such a powerful natural disaster, he said. “In the Bush, everybody knows when a storm’s coming and what to do,” he said. However, “this storm was not a normal storm.”
Other speakers at the event, including APU President Janelle Vanasse, also expressed concerns about Western Alaska storm victims.
Alaska, which has the nation’s highest percentage of Indigenous residents, became one of the first states to officially recognize Indigenous People’s Day when then-Gov. Bill Walker signed a proclamation in 2015.
While state offices were not closed in observance, Anchorage municipal offices were, thanks to a 2023 ordinance making Indigenous Peoples’ Day and Juneteenth official holidays.
Among the other sites holding Indigenous Peoples’ Day events was the University of Alaska Fairbanks.

(Photo by Stephen Maturen/Getty Images)Most Indiana voters said the state is on the “wrong track” and expressed growing frustration with their political choices — including unfavorable views of top elected officials and both major parties — according to a new statewide poll released Tuesday.
The survey of 604 registered voters, conducted last week by North Star Opinion Research, on behalf of Independent Indiana, shows President Donald Trump, Gov. Mike Braun and Secretary of State Diego Morales all with negative favorability ratings.
Trump was viewed favorably by 42% of Hoosiers and unfavorably by 49%. Braun fared worse, with 24% favorable and 43% unfavorable, while 22% had no opinion and 11% had never heard of him.
Morales was viewed favorably by 5%; 17% unfavorable — with 21% offering no opinion and 57% saying they’d never heard of him.
Morales faces two Republican opponents already and Democrat Beau Bayh recently announced his candidacy for the office. Bayh has already raised $100,000 in large donations, including $50,000 from Michael Browning, a central Indiana developer. Morales had about $900,000 on hand when he filed his June 30 campaign finance report.
More than half of Hoosier respondents — including Republicans, Democrats and independents — were reportedly “dissatisfied” with the choices of candidates on their ballots in state elections, overall.
Story continues below.
OCT 14 — IN Statewide Survey Presentation
 
Fifty-three percent of all respondents said Indiana is on the “wrong track,” while just 34% believe Indiana is headed in the right direction.
Views were split along party lines, however: 63% of Republicans said Indiana is moving in the right direction, compared with only 28% of independents and 15% of Democrats.
The mixed-mode survey — which used a blend of live phone interviews and text-to-web responses — carries a margin of error of 3.99 percentage points.
Last week, Independent Indiana, which supports independent candidates throughout the state, released findings early on redistricting, finding that 53% of all respondents opposed drawing congressional maps early, compared with 34% who support it. Opposition cut across party lines, including among the GOP — 59% of Republican respondents said they support a mid-cycle map redraw, and 25% were opposed.
Republican lawmakers weigh whether to call a special session for redistricting, following Vice President JD Vance’s return visit to Indiana to rally support for the effort. Lawmakers are expected to discuss the proposal further this week.
Voters ‘dissatisfied’ with choices and parties
The results mark a continued cooling in Hoosiers’ opinions of top officials since Morning Consult carried out polling this summer, when Trump’s approval stood several points higher among Indiana voters, 
As of mid-August, 51% of Hoosiers approved of Trump while 45% disapproved, according to earlier polling.
Tuesday’s North Star survey additionally showed about half of Hoosier voters said they are “dissatisfied” with the choices of candidates available in Indiana elections — including 26% of Republicans, 71% of Democrats and 61% of independents.
Both state parties were viewed more negatively than positively. Just 33% view the Indiana Republican Party favorably (45% unfavorable), and 25% view the Indiana Democratic Party favorably (43% unfavorable).
Nearly 70% of survey respondents further said the two-party system “leaves out the views of too many people,” compared with just 21% who think it does a good job representing most Hoosiers.
Unite America poll shows more opposition to redistricting
Another new poll, released Monday by Unite America, also measured how Hoosiers view Indiana’s state and federal officials.
For example, Trump drew a 47% favorable rating overall, and a 78% favorable rating among Republicans, while Braun posted 32% favorable overall, with 53% of Republican respondents favorable.
The Indiana Legislature was viewed favorably 29% of all respondents, and 48% by Republicans; Morales was viewed favorably by 9% of all respondents, and 14% by Republicans; Lt. Gov. Micah Beckwith was viewed favorably by 9% of all respondents, and 16% by Republicans; former Gov. Eric Holcomb was viewed favorably by 36% of all respondents, and 49% by Republicans; U.S. Sen. Todd Young was viewed favorably by 27% of all respondents, and 46% by Republicans; and U.S. Sen. Jim Banks was viewed favorably by 21% of all respondents, and 37% by Republicans.

Unite America also reported mounting resistance to redistricting.
The survey, conducted by 3D Strategic Research from Oct. 7–9, included 500 registered voters and 450 Republican primary voters. It found that 44% of Hoosiers oppose mid-decade redistricting, compared with 31% in support.
After respondents heard arguments from both sides, opposition jumped to 69%, with only 21% still in favor.
Just 10% of respondents overall — and 17% of GOP primary voters — said the governor and legislature should call a special session to redraw the maps.
“Voters across Indiana — including a majority of Republicans — are sick of partisan games that put party over country,” said Nick Troiano, executive director of Unite America. “If lawmakers want to build trust, they’d be wise to focus on issues that directly affect Hoosiers’ everyday lives, instead of wasting taxpayer dollars to further gerrymander Indiana’s congressional districts, which are already among the least competitive in the country.”
The Unite America poll also found most voters oppose a GOP proposal to close Indiana’s primaries to registered party members only. Initially, 52% opposed the change, but after hearing arguments from both sides, opposition surged to 77% — including 66% of Republican primary voters.

HOST: Jennifer Smith
GUEST: Mark Williams







FACING WAVES OF federal funding cuts, Massachusetts’s financial picture was already looking bleak as October approached. Legislative leaders warned of revenue slowdowns, universities and medical systems identified programs that could be cut or pared back, and the state attorney general’s office continued with a barrage of lawsuits against the Trump administration for grant cuts and immigration crackdowns. 
Then, of course, Congress entered a budget stalemate over expiring federal tax credits that have helped millions of Americans pay for health insurance. The resulting federal government shutdown is now approaching its third week. 
This week on The Codcast, CommonWealth Beacon reporter Jennifer Smith interviews Mark Williams, finance lecturer at the Questrom School of Business at Boston University. Williams projected in April that the level of federal spending cuts and the Trump administration’s aggressive immigration policy changes posed a specific danger to the state economy. It’s only gotten worse since then, Williams said. 
“The shutdown itself is interesting because it is just a layer that creates additional uncertainty in the economy of the state of Massachusetts, and then also the US economy and globally,” said Williams. Hundreds of thousands of federal workers across the country are either furloughed or working without pay, which Williams noted has a knock-on effect.  
“Employees don’t get paid, they can’t spend,” he said. “If they can’t spend, the economy doesn’t grow. And if the economy doesn’t grow, GDP shrinks, and then of course eventually we have a recession.”  
Based on updated federal cuts under the tax bill passed on July 4, plus lingering effects if the shutdown drags on, Williams projects that the state could enter a recession by the third quarter of 2026 unless aggressive action is taken by lawmakers to pare back spending and rally behind the immigrant population essential to the state workforce.  
Even if the Legislature found an appetite to tap into the “rainy day fund,” which it is notoriously loath to do, Williams projects offsetting the federal cuts would rapidly and dangerously siphon state reserves. 
And the fate of the federal workforce in Massachusetts becomes less certain by the day. 
Just under 1 percent of Massachusetts’s workforce is either a civilian federal government employee or active military, Williams noted. On Friday, the Trump administration began to follow through on its threat to use the shutdown as a mechanism to lay off substantial numbers of federal workers. 
”We’ll be cutting very popular Democrat programs that aren’t popular with Republicans,” President Trump said Thursday at the White House. The White House announced over the weekend that it identified Pentagon funds that could be shifted to pay military troops before they missed a paycheck on October 15. 
The federal workforce purges under the current Trump administration, beginning with the slash-and-burn tactics of the so-called Department of Governmental Efficiency under the direction of Elon Musk, have made once reliable and essential jobs feel risky, Williams said. 
“It used to be that you’d go into sort of a federal job, and the pay wasn’t that great, but benefits were good and the stress was low,” he said. “And now it’s the opposite. Pay isn’t very good, it’s not predictable, and it’s quite risky to potentially lose your job without having any control over it.”  
On the episode, Williams discusses vulnerable Massachusetts workforces (3:45), political scrapping at the federal and state level (9:15), and what levers local officials could pull (20:15).",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/The-Codcast_Wide-Banner.png?fit=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-10-14 09:57:50.143580

(Photo by Mike Mosedale/Minnesota Reformer)MAHNOMEN  — The day after Minnesota officially legalized recreational marijuana in August 2023, agents with the Paul Bunyan Drug Task Force raided a squat, single story cinderblock building across the railroad tracks from a grain elevator in the sleepy northwestern Minnesota town of Mahnomen.
The search of the Asema Tobacco & Pipe Shop yielded approximately 7.5 pounds of marijuana, much of it stored  in plain sight in mason jars bearing labels like “Black Plague” and “Ghost Candy.”  Investigators also seized just under a pound of marijuana wax and, from the till and several people who were present, $2,748 in cash. 
Eight months later,  Todd Jeremy Thompson, Asema’s owner, was charged by the Mahnomen County Attorney with one count of felony first-degree possession of marijuana. 
For Thompson, a blunt talking, occasionally profane 56-year-old enrolled member of the White Earth Band of Ojibwe, neither the raid nor the criminal case came as a surprise. 
“I was told by certain individuals that they were going to come. Two different sources,” Thompson told the Reformer during a pair of wide-ranging interviews at what he refers to as his “old school head shop.”
Still, those warnings did not dissuade Thompson from exercising what he believes are his rights under treaty law, applicable federal precedent, Minnesota’s 2023 cannabis legalization law, and the constitution of the Minnesota Chippewa Tribe. 
Thompson has a long history of successfully asserting his rights as a Native in the face of an array of legal authorities, but this constitutional clash is not without risk: He could face up to five years in prison and a $10,000 fine.
In the more than two years that have passed since the raid, the retail sale of marijuana has exploded across Minnesota, first with a proliferation of tribally-owned dispensaries located on reservations,  and more recently, with a slew of tribal and non-tribal outlets opening off-reservation. 
At White Earth, Thompson explained as he gave a driving tour of Mahnomen, the band got a head start in the burgeoning industry because it already had a functional medical marijuana operation up and running. 
Rolling down the road, it’s hard to miss that enterprise, which is every bit as aromatic as you would guess. The growhouse is located in a 40,000-square-foot former potato chip factory, now encircled with tall fences and concertina wire. The tribally run dispensary, Waabigwan Mashkiki, is close too, just across the street from the Shooting Star Casino.
As his court case drags on, Thompson has continued to operate Asema, where products on display include bulk tobacco, incense, posters, and a wide array of paraphernalia: glassware, vapes, stash containers, cheap cigars, wraps, vape juice, scales and the like. 
Competition from the tribal dispensary has cut into his glassware sales, said Thompson. He’s still making enough to pay his bills, he said, adding ruefully that he probably won’t be in the market for a new truck any time soon.

In seeking dismissal of the felony charge, Thompson’s defense has hinged largely on a jurisdictional claim.
Under a 1953 law called Public Law 280, the U.S. Congress granted policing authority on Indian reservations to state law enforcement in six states, including Minnesota. But, broadly speaking, that authority does not extend to what are referred to as civil/regulatory matters. So when Minnesota legalized marijuana, the argument goes, the regulation of cannabis on reservations fell outside the purview of state courts.   
Thompson’s defense also points to the language of the 2023 state law that legalized recreational marijuana in Minnesota. That law explicitly “acknowledges the sovereign right of Minnesota Tribal governments to regulate the cannabis industry and address other matters of cannabis regulation [on reservations].”
Nonetheless, in March, District Court Judge Seamus Duffy rejected Thompson’s motion to dismiss. In his ruling, Duffy allowed that it was a close call but pointed out that Minnesota’s cannabis law still contains criminal provisions, including limits on allowable quantities and a prohibition on products such as marijuana wax.  
Duffy was less sympathetic to a second argument — that possession and sale of cannabis by Thompson and other band members is a reserved right under the 1855 treaty. Noting that the treaty is silent on the subject and that cannabis use among the Ojibwe is a relatively modern phenomenon, the judge wrote that “Thompson has not shown that marijuana was envisioned with any of the reserved rights at the time of the Treaty.”
The legal setback proved fleeting. 
In a highly unusual move, the Minnesota Court of Appeals agreed to take up Thompson’s appeal prior to the conclusion of the district court case. The grant of this interlocutory appeal typically signals a court’s view that the case raises a significant legal question. 
Oral arguments are scheduled for November 4. 
A history of standing up for Indigenous rights
The Asema raid is not the first time Thompson has found himself in legal crosshairs of state law enforcement. In the past decade, Thompson has been involved in long-running court cases that tested the bounds of state authority over netting fish and harvesting wild rice in the so-called “ceded territories” — land that the Ojibwe sold to the U.S. government in a series of 19th century treaties. 
After extensive legal wrangling, he came out on top both times. In the fishing case —brought after Thompson and a friend set gill nets in Gull Lake —  the Office of Crow Wing County Attorney dismissed the charge after a district court judge found that Thompson, as a White Earth band member, retained the right to fish on Gull Lake. (Thompson’s friend, a Fond du Lac band member, was convicted after the judge ruled that Fond du Lac band was not a signatory to the relevant treaty.)
Last spring, a different district court judge dismissed the ricing case after concluding that the state had violated Thompson’s right to a speedy trial by charging him, dismissing the charge after three months, and then re-charging eight months later.
Thompson also successfully rebuffed a trespass charge stemming from his participation in a 2021 protest over the construction of an oil pipeline, called Line 3, across the headwaters of the Mississippi River
In that fight, Thompson managed to get the case transferred to White Earth’s tribal court. In dismissing the charge, Tribal Court Judge David DeGroat ruled that Thompson’s actions were “in conformity with the goal of protecting environmental resources that impact ceded and reservations land.”
Thompson’s string of legal victories — and his willingness to put his neck on the line — has earned him admirers.
“Todd is out in front of most tribal members trying to figure out how to use treaty rights for economic benefit, whether it is standard hunt, fish and gather, or if it is something a step beyond,” said Frank Bibeau, a White Earth band member and an attorney for the 1855 Treaty Authority, which advocates for Ojibwe people’s off-reservation rights. “To me, Todd is the tip of the spear. He can see what his rights are. He doesn’t need to be told.”
Bibeau is not representing Thompson in the Asema case, though he filed a friend of the court brief on behalf of the 1855 Treaty Authority. 
Claire Glenn, a former Hennepin County public defender who now works with the Climate Defense Project, is  Thompson’s attorney in the cannabis case. 
Glenn got to know Thompson when she represented him — and nearly 100 other “water protectors” —  who were involved in the Line 3 protests. More recently, she was his attorney in the ricing case that was dismissed this spring.
“He has a lot of integrity,” Glenn said of Thompson. “He lives his life in accordance with his values and without apologies. He has undertaken his own study of the treaties and the history of treaty making and Indigenous genocide. And he has learned a lot from the elders who came before him.”
An urban upbringing, mentoring by a spiritual tutor
Thompson grew up middle class, mainly in Minneapolis, where his father, Leonard, was a firefighter who pushed the Minneapolis Fire Department to loosen regulations limiting hair length for Native Americans.  
Thompson’s parents used to send him to the reservation during the summer, where the family still had property. At times, he stayed with a great-grandfather, Frank, who lived in a tar paper shack — not far from Thompson’s current home. 
For a city kid, the close-to-the land life of his kin took some getting used to. 
“He didn’t go to the store to buy meat. He shot deer, beaver, muskrat, whatever,” Thompson recalled. “For dinner, he would come out with a pan with some roasted animal — teeth and still head on — and you had to pick off your meat.” Accustomed to grocery store food, Thompson found it difficult to choke down the rustic fare. 
“But after three days of starving, man, you started eating,” he added with a laugh.
As a teen, Thompson drifted from early interests in boxing and hockey and started partying and chasing girls. He caused enough trouble that his parents didn’t hesitate when he expressed an interest in attending a Native American boarding school in Flandreau, South Dakota.
“A friend of mine, a Red Laker in Minneapolis, told me about the school. Made it sound all really cool and all that sh*t,” Thompson recounted. “And so I told my folks, ‘Hey, I’m thinking about heading out with Maynard and Tony and them guys.’ My dad was like, ‘That’s a great idea’ just to get rid of me because I was a hell raiser, only child.”
Although he only lasted one year at Flandreau, it made an impression on Thompson. He was exposed to some Native religious traditions for the first time and, he said, had mystical experiences. 
“That was the first sweat lodge I ever went to. And it was a  pretty powerful, profound f***ing experience,” he said. Other cultural practices also made an impression, especially the drums. “I didn’t know why, but when they would be playing the drum, my f***ing hair would stand up on the back of my neck and then just, I’d get that tingle.”
A year in boarding school was enough, Thompson said, so he returned to Minnesota and moved to St. Francis, in rural Anoka County, where his parents acquired a hobby farm. Thompson finished his last two years of high school in the exurbs but, he said, he struggled to fit in. “There were no Indian people there,” he said. “It was f***ing deadass country sh*t.”
As a young man, Thompson bounced around, got a DWI, and ultimately moved back to Minneapolis where he attended technical college and got a degree in graphic design. For a time, he worked at The Circle, a Native American newspaper in south Minneapolis.
He started a family and had four kids. At the same time, he found himself increasingly drawn to Native traditions. A seminal moment came when he attended a lecture at the American Indian Center by Eugene Begay, a revered spiritual leader and fluent Ojibwe speaker from Lac Courte Oreilles reservation in Wisconsin. 
“I listened to his talk and I’m like, man, there’s something going on here,” Thompson recalled. “And after his talk, I told him some things and he was like, ‘Yeah, why don’t you come on up and move in with me?’ He said, ‘I’ll show you a few things. I’ll teach you some things.’ I didn’t know what the hell he meant by that. But that sh*t kept beating away at me for about two weeks. And I just told the old lady, I said, ‘I’m going to go spend some time up there with that old man.’ I ended up living with him for two years.”
Begay had lost a leg, so Thompson took on a role as a helper and chauffeur, driving Begay to ceremonies and AA talks. 
Begay was not the only elder to influence Thompson. 
As a young man, he was arrested during the heyday of the treaty rights fight at Mille Lacs, a legal battle that ultimately culminated with a 1999 U.S. Supreme Court decision upholding the rights of Ojibwe people to hunt, fish and gather in territory that the Ojibwe ceded to the U.S. government in a treaty in 1837.
Thompson’s recollection of the episode revolves less around the legal nuances than the wild scene that unfolded at the boat landing. When the game wardens arrived at the scene to ticket the Native anglers for setting nets, Thompson said, he attempted to elude them by diving into the still icy waters. 
“I was the only one that ran in the water. I don’t know why, but I ran in f***ing water,” he said. “They arrested Vernon Bellecourt [the late American Indian Movement leader] and they arrested my dad. I’d swim 20, 25 feet, and pop up. I kept yelling:  ‘I’m practicing my 1837 treaty rights!’ Eventually, I got too cold. So then they grabbed me, pulled me in a boat, and I went to jail. The next day they’d let us go, give us our canoe back.”
Another influence, Thompson said, was his uncle, Marvin Manypenny, father of Lt. Gov. Peggy Flanagan, and a well known White Earth land back activist. (Although they are cousins, Thompson said he is not close to Flanagan).
About 18 years ago, Thompson decided city life was not for him. He had a good job at the time, laying water lines, and a nice home in the St. Paul suburbs. He had been thinking about leaving for years before he finally broke the news to his then-partner and mother of his kids.
“I came home one day from work and I said, ‘I’m moving, babe. I hope you come with me.’ And she was like, ‘Let me think about it.’ And then she said, ‘No, I’m staying.’ I went and got a U-Haul truck loaded all my sh*t up, and I drove up north here and we worked out things with the kids and I found a house to rent.”
After saving for a spell, Thompson went to the White Earth land office and successfully applied for an allotment — an acre and a quarter near the community of Naytahwaush — where he now lives. 
When he opened his head shop Asema in 2019, Thompson said, no one in the vicinity was selling paraphernalia or bulk tobacco. These days, business is down and competition is up. Thompson said he hopes to stick it out.
 “Will I be able to keep going? Who knows? I’ll push it as long as I can,” he said. “But I love being my own boss. I will say that, man.”
Whether he can remain his own boss will likely hinge on the outcome of his court case.
Asked why he takes legal risks again and again, Thompson paused for a moment.
“I always tell myself I’m going to stop messing around with courts,” he said. “But, man, it’s in my DNA.”",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/20250429_152537-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-10-14 09:57:50.143580

On Monday Gov. Gavin Newsom decided the fate of the remaining bills lawmakers sent to his desk in September. 
Throughout this legislative session, a total of 917 bills awaited the governor’s verdict, according to longtime lobbyist Chris Micheli. Newsom signed 794 into law and vetoed 123 — citing “significant fiscal implications that are not included in the budget” for part of his reasons behind several of his vetoes. Stay tuned later this week for more on the bills Newsom spiked. 
As for the latest batches of measures he approved, Newsom greenlit two hotly contested pieces of legislation that drew strong pushback from bill opponents:

More housing near transit: Newsom is allowing denser housing projects located near major transit stations, reaffirming his alignment with the “Yes In My Backyard” movement. Opposed by local governments and neighborhood groups, the contentious bill went through 13 separate rounds of amendments that limited the measure’s reach to just eight highly urbanized counties and select transportation stops. Read more from CalMatters’ Ben Christopher.


Caring for kids whose parents are deported: In response to the federal government’s crackdown on immigration, Newsom signed a bill allowing a broad range of relatives to step in as children’s caregivers if their parents are deported. The law widens who can sign a caregiver affidavit, which proponents say would help parents at risk of deportation to be able to choose a trusted person to care for their children if they are detained. But Republicans, the religious right and parental rights’ activists argued it would make it easier for strangers to sign the affidavit, which would endanger children. Read more from CalMatters’ Jeanne Kuang.

Other bills Newsom signed, including those on consumer protections and public health:

Insulin prices: On Monday the governor signed a bill capping insulin copays at $35 — a reversal of a bill he vetoed in 2023. More than 3.5 million Californians live with diabetes.


Expanding CARE Court: People experiencing psychotic symptoms due to bipolar disorder will be eligible for treatment under CARE Court, a mental health program intended to help seriously ill Californians living on the streets. Since its introduction in 2022, only people with schizophrenia and other limited psychotic disorders have had access to the program. Read more from CalMatters’ Jocelyn Wiener and Marisa Kendall.


Pay for incarcerated firefighters: The hourly wage for incarcerated firefighters battling active wildfires will be raised from $1 to $7.25. The new policy is one out of five bills Newsom signed that seek to support incarcerated firefighters upon their reentry. Read more from CalMatters’ Cayla Mihalovich.


Riding shotgun: Newsom signed a bill last week that originally proposed to ban smaller teenagers from sitting in the front seat, and require children as old as 13 to use a booster seat if they’re not tall enough. The measure has since been watered down and now requires children between the ages of 8 to 16, starting in 2027, to pass a five-step test to be considered properly restrained by a seat belt. Read more from CalMatters’ Ryan Sabalow.


Protection against chatbots: California companies that operate online chatbots will be required to monitor chats for signs of suicidal thoughts, and to take steps to prevent users from harming themselves. Read more from CalMatters’ Colin Lecher.

The potential limits of ‘no tax on tips’

Restaurant servers, drivers for ride-hailing services, barbers and other tipped workers making less than $150,000 a year could deduct up to $25,000 in tips from their federal income taxes starting this tax year and through 2028.
But while President Donald Trump’s campaign pledge of “no tax on tips” may seem like a boon to these workers, some tax experts argue that the benefits may be limited.
As CalMatters’ Levi Sumagaysay explains, a Yale Budget Lab analysis found that a third of tipped workers do not make enough to owe income tax in the first place, and will not benefit from the provision. Experts also raised concerns that employers may cut workers’ pay because of the tax savings, and that consumers may stop tipping since they may assume all tipped workers will now be able to deduct their tips.
Most notably, however, is that the deductions may not be enough to offset the repercussions of the Republicans’ spending bill, said Kayla Kitson, a senior policy fellow at the California Budget & Policy Center.

Kitson: “It’s a bit of a distraction from the overall bill. … Many low-income tipped workers will likely be harmed by the cuts to health care and food assistance and the failure to extend enhanced premium tax credits.”

New data on CA’s anti-crime measure

Nearly a year after voters passed Proposition 36, a first-of-its-kind report reveals that few people are actually getting into the treatment promised by its proponents, writes CalMatters’ Cayla Mihalovich.
Released last week by the state’s Judicial Council, the report finds that about 9,000 people have been charged with a treatment-mandated felony within the first six months that the law took effect. Since then, 15%, or 1,290 people, elected treatment; 771 people were placed into treatment; and only 25 completed it.
The data also details how different counties are using the law: Orange County, for example, has the highest number of treatment-mandated felonies charged at 2,395, while Kings and Napa counties each had one.
Some supporters of the measure argue that district attorneys have difficulty implementing Prop. 36 because of a lack of state funding. Republican and Democratic state lawmakers requested as much as $600 million to implement Prop. 36, but Gov. Newsom and the Legislature ultimately approved a one-time allocation of $100 million in the state budget.

Kevin Kiley has garnered his most well-known  Democratic challenger yet in Dr. Richard Pan, the former state senator who once made national headlines for going toe-to-toe with Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as California pushed to enforce school vaccine mandates.","In summary
Republican Rep. Kevin Kiley has garnered his most well-known  Democratic challenger yet in Dr. Richard Pan, the former state senator who once made national headlines for going toe-to-toe with Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as California pushed to enforce school vaccine mandates.  


Republican Rep. Kevin Kiley’s newest Democratic challenger might be even more well known to Sacramento-area voters than the two-term congressman who has represented the area since 2023. 
Dr. Richard Pan, a Harvard-trained pediatrician and former state senator who made national headlines for leading California’s effort to eliminate religious and “personal belief” exemptions to school vaccine mandates, announced his candidacy for California’s 3rd Congressional District on Tuesday. 
Pan and Democrats nationwide hope to hold Republicans like Kiley accountable for supporting President Donald Trump’s megabill, which over the next 10 years will cause an estimated 10 million Americans to lose health coverage under Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.
“We see a federal government that seems to be intentionally attacking health care, whether it’s taking away people’s health insurance, undermining public health to allow disease to spread, cutting research for things like cancer treatments,” Pan told CalMatters in an interview. 
“As a pediatrician, I’ve spent my life really trying to keep kids and their families healthy,” he added. “I’m running for Congress to be sure that we can protect people’s health care.”
Pan joins Democrats Tyler Vandenberg, a Marine Corps veteran and former “Jeopardy!” winner, and Heidi Hall, an environmental advocate and Nevada County supervisor, who launched campaigns against Kiley earlier this year.
Proposition 50 would remake the district
Kiley’s district is one of five that would shift to favor Democrats if California voters next month approve a plan to gerrymander the state’s congressional districts – known as Proposition 50.
While the district he represents currently spans much of the California-Nevada border and is in largely rural, forested areas, the new seat would encompass many of Sacramento’s eastern neighborhoods and suburbs, including Auburn, Rancho Cordova and Folsom. The new district would also include Grass Valley, Truckee and the California portion of Lake Tahoe, as well as the Eldorado National Forest.
Kiley, who has branded himself as a Republican foil to Gov. Gavin Newsom, has been a vocal opponent of Prop. 50 and accused the governor of targeting his seat because of his attempts to “Newsom-proof California” in Congress by eliminating the state’s ban on gas-powered cars and halting federal funding for high-speed rail.
“There’s a reason Newsom sent his own staffer to run against me last year,” Kiley wrote on social media last month, referring to Democrat Jessica Morse, “and has now made me the number one target of his redistricting sham.”
Pan, a Sacramento resident who supports Prop. 50, has previously represented about 70% of voters who live in what would become the new district, according to his campaign.
By challenging Kiley, whom Pan has characterized as a “rubber stamp” for House Republicans and Trump’s agenda, Pan hopes to also serve as a check on the Trump White House and a former nemesis of his own, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. 
Pan started pushing to eliminate religious and personal belief exemptions to school vaccine requirements after public health experts traced the origin of a 2014 measles outbreak to an unvaccinated Disneyland traveler. His 2015 bill, and a subsequent measure in 2019 to strengthen that original law, ignited Kennedy’s anti-vaccine activist allies and prompted harassment from opponents, death threats and physical violence against the then-state senator. 
“I even had blood thrown at me and got assaulted on the street, but I didn’t back down,” Pan said of the bills he led that ended religious and personal belief exemptions for school vaccination requirements. He said Americans “should be very disturbed and concerned and worried” about Kennedy’s leadership.

Emotional fights erupted over a controversial attempt this year to counter antisemitism in schools by restricting what teachers teach in classrooms, exposing a political quagmire for California Democrats who needed to balance the needs of Jewish communities against the fury of a growing pro-Palestinian base.


Tears welling in her eyes, Assemblymember Rebecca Bauer-Kahan paused mid-sentence to calm herself on the Assembly floor.
Almost a century ago, the Nazis forced her grandmother to flee Austria, leaving behind her great-great-grandmother who died in the Holocaust, the Jewish Democrat from San Ramon told her fellow lawmakers. Last year, she said, her daughter told her that the bathrooms at her school had been vandalized with swastikas. 
“My children deserve to show up at school and not have to face hate crimes in their building, to face the symbols that represented the end of their relatives,” she said.
Stories like hers, as well as Hamas’ attack on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, prompted California’s Jewish lawmakers to make countering antisemitism in schools their top priority this year. They sought to create a list of words and ideas that could not be mentioned in classrooms, including heavily disputed claims about Israel. The effort sparked the biggest, most emotional legislative fight of the year: Should the government regulate what can be taught in schools? If so, how far should it go?
At issue was Assembly Bill 715, which Gov. Gavin Newsom signed into law this month after it went through multiple major, sometimes last-minute rewrites during months of political tussling. 
Champions have argued the law will protect Jewish students from rising bullying and discrimination, sometimes from teachers. While the state does not collect data on antisemitism in schools, reports of anti-Jewish bias statewide have doubled between 2021 and 2024, according to the California Department of Justice. Last year, more than 15% of all hate crime events in California were anti-Jewish, even though Jewish people make up about 3% of the state population.
“We cannot hide from the profoundly unfortunate truth that Jewish kids are being isolated, made to feel unwelcome, and verbally and physically attacked. And far too often, our schools are failing to protect them,” Assemblymember Rick Zbur, a Los Angeles Democrat and co-author of the bill, said during a May hearing, when the bill started as merely a promise to curb antisemitism in schools.

By July, it had undergone a major overhaul, including determining that any instruction that “directly or indirectly deny Israel’s right to exist,” equating Israelis with Nazis, or disrespecting “the historical, cultural, or religious significance of Israel to the Jewish people” would count as creating an “antisemitic learning environment.” It reinvigorated debates over whether criticism of Israel’s founding, or even the belief that Jewish people should have an independent country in their ancient homeland, counts as antisemitic — something Jewish thinkers do not agree on.Mainstream Jewish groups maintain that anti-Zionism, a broad term that generally opposes the idea of a standalone state with a Jewish-majority population, is antisemitic. Many Jewish academics, however, don’t think it is antisemitic on its own, but they agree that blaming individual Jews for the actions taken by the Israeli government is antisemitic.
That July version of the bill drew heavy opposition from a vast coalition of education groups, from teachers unions to school boards, civil rights advocates and Muslim community organizations, who feared censorship of pro-Palestinian voices and infringement upon academic freedom. They would remain opposed through its many iterations, and many of them urged Newsom to veto it.
Their concerns lingered even as the bill was ultimately watered down in the final days of this year’s legislative session to address bias more broadly: The final version no longer mentions the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and bars using professional development materials that violate the state’s anti-discrimination laws. It also requires “factually accurate” instruction that is free of “advocacy, personal opinion, bias, or partisanship” — a controversial element the bill’s authors said they ran out of time to tackle and promised to “clean up” next year.
“In its current form, this bill only reinforces broader national trends of silencing constitutionally protected speech, erasing historically relevant curriculum, and persecuting anyone who expresses even the slightest opposition to the federal administration,” said Assemblymember Robert Garcia, a freshman Democratic lawmaker from Rancho Cucamonga and former teacher and school board member, who ultimately abstained from voting on the measure.The squabble over the bill was messy, marked by hundreds of attendees, hourslong hearings, and accusations of bad faith from both sides. Bauer-Kahan called a teachers union advocate who opposed the bill antisemitic. After the bill passed out of the Legislature, a handful of pro-Palestinian activists protested from the Assembly gallery for more than an hour, yelling: “You will all have blood on your hands!”

The tension highlights the discomfort for California Democrats, who, despite having traditionally defended Israel, have had to reckon with a base growing increasingly critical of Israel. They faced a tough choice: Support the bill and risk upsetting some of the most powerful labor allies as well as their pro-Palestinian constituents, or oppose the bill and risk being labeled as antisemitic or unwilling to combat antisemitism. Amid the pressure, some Democratic lawmakers voted for the bill even as they warned it could be used to censor free speech. Others abstained instead of taking a side.
“I’m actually surprised that California state legislators would want to even touch it, because it’s just so radioactive right now,” said Kim Nalder, a political science professor at Sacramento State University. “It just feels like at this political moment, we want to lower the temperature, not shine a spotlight on ways in which we might target each other.”
The issue was such a hot potato that many lawmakers avoided tackling it early in the legislative process, when policy differences are often ironed out, said Sen. Sasha Renée Pérez, a freshman progressive Democrat from Pasadena who chairs the Senate Education Committee. When the bill arrived in her committee in June, it still had no substantive language. Some lawmakers told her to not touch it either, while others left it up to her to “take care of it,” she said.
“The ball got thrown to me,” she told CalMatters. “And people knew that they were doing that.”
‘People would end up being very angry on both sides’
California’s Jewish lawmakers introduced the bill in response to intensifying clashes in schools and college campuses nationwide over the Israeli-Palestinian conflict in Gaza. For some Democrats, the timing couldn’t have been worse.
The Gaza war has forced a tidal shift within the Democratic base, as voters’ support for Israel’s military campaign tanked over the past two years. That has forced some Democrats, even moderates who have historically backed Israel, to condemn the country and pull away from pro-Israel donors. Young Democrats are also more critical of Israel than their older peers, so any vote that could be perceived as silencing pro-Palestinian voices is risky.
“A very strong part of Democratic and leftist values that we are seeing expressed now is anti-genocide or anti-war,” Nalder said. “(For) my students who are politically active, this is one of the chief issues that they care about.”
The bill also came as President Donald Trump ordered immigration agents to arrest student activists critical of the Israeli government and withheld billions of dollars in funding from universities for their alleged failure to protect Jewish students. At least half a dozen other state Legislatures sought to fight antisemitism in schools this year, with some adopting a highly disputed definition of antisemitism in state education codes. Enraged, some opponents accused California Democrats of taking a page out of Trump’s playbook.

But the Democratic lawmakers had to balance all that with the risk of upsetting the Jewish community, a key voting block. A no vote could be construed as antisemitic, making the lawmaker vulnerable to challenges in the next election, Nalder said. 
The bill was the sole priority of the 18-member California Legislative Jewish Caucus, which is composed entirely of Democrats and led by Assemblymember Jesse Gabriel of Encino and Sen. Scott Wiener of San Francisco, who chair the budget committees in their respective chambers.
Neither would speak with CalMatters about what happened with the bill. Gabriel’s office did not respond to several CalMatters emails seeking an interview, whereas Wiener declined to comment, pointing CalMatters to the bill authors instead. 
David Bocarsly, executive director of the Jewish Public Affairs Committee, which sponsored the bill, said the caucus’ backing was crucial.
“The Jewish caucus was able to leverage their influence and respect with their colleagues and effectively represent the Jewish community’s needs,” he said. 
Pérez acknowledged the political challenge, telling CalMatters she would have preferred to hold the bill until next year, but said legislative leaders had promised to deliver a bill the governor could sign this year. She said some colleagues told her it was “an impossible situation” to navigate.
“They felt like there was no winning,” she said. “Regardless of what they would try to do to make amendments to it … people would end up being very angry on both sides.”
A debate over academic freedom
The clash over AB 715 is the latest episode of yearslong strife over how to teach about marginalized communities in California’s K-12 schools and who should be included. 
In past years, the fight primarily focused on ethnic studies — a mandatory high school course on the history and culture of groups such as Latinos, Asian Americans, African Americans and Native Americans. The state adopted a model curriculum in 2021, after years of fine-tuning amid disputes over which ethnic minority groups to teach about and criticism from Jewish advocates, who accused past versions of being antisemitic. 
Jewish lawmakers championed a bill earlier this year that aimed to tackle antisemitism by restricting the ethnic studies curriculum, but the effort was stopped early in its tracks, and legislators turned to AB 715 instead. 
“This is a bill about protecting Jewish students, and it shouldn’t have been controversial,” said Bocarsly, of JPAC. “If we don’t teach empathy and understand it, we’re going to build a generation of intolerance, and that’s what we’re trying to correct for.”
He said AB 715 was “the hardest political fight in JPAC’s history” and that the initial definition of an antisemitic learning environment was only meant to offer teachers guidance. 
But opponents had two major concerns: that the bill’s initial definition of antisemitic learning environment risked silencing discord about Israel, and that even in its final watered-down version it could chill free speech and open teachers up to lawsuits for teaching about anything controversial.
“Jews are most safe when democracy flourishes, when pluralism flourishes, not when rights are taken away,” said David Goldberg, president of the California Teachers Association and a Jewish father to three children who attend public schools.

What’s safe for Jews was itself a matter of disagreement among the bill’s backers and dissenters. Bocarsly said CTA leadership’s opposition to every version of the bill shows that they “have little interest in supporting a bill that would protect Jewish students.”Goldberg, in an interview, called that accusation “a lot of chutzpah, frankly.”
The fact the bill even tried to prescribe what an antisemitic environment looked like in classrooms was concerning to Kenneth Stern, a scholar on hate. More than 20 years ago, he was the lead author of the highly controversial definition of antisemitism that’s been adopted by some states this year. It all but labels anti-Zionism as a form of antisemitism. Now, nearly 50 countries, including the U.S., have embraced the definition. 
Though Stern wrote the definition, he opposes using it to restrict speech in schools, arguing that it could threaten academic freedom and fuel censorship by chilling discussion about controversial topics. Stern said despite all the revisions made during the process, the final version will likely make antisemitism worse. 
The law creates an antisemitism prevention coordinator to advise education and legislative leaders and says the person in that role should use federal guidelines published under former President Joe Biden as “a basis” for decision-making. The controversial definition of antisemitism Stern wrote is labeled as the most prominent definition of antisemitism in those guidelines, though it mentions others. 
“I understand why people care about (preventing antisemitism in schools),” he said. “They want the Legislature to do something. I think the legislators are sincere that they want to do something. This is the wrong thing.”
Educators like Goldberg worry the bill could allow bad-faith critics to also dispute a wide array of controversial topics taught in schools. Will it become the basis for critics of the transgender community to pressure teachers to say there are only two genders, he wondered.Gabriel Kahn, a Jewish teacher in Oakland who said he’s being investigated by his school district after challenging the content of an antisemitic training last year, said he fears prosecution for voicing the need to distinguish between antisemitism and criticism of Israel.
“What I’m most afraid of is that in the Democratic state of California, we can pass a censorship bill that protects a foreign nation from criticism implicitly,” he said. “What does that say about the future of academic freedom in our country?”

After pushback from some Democrats, a controversial bill that would have banned short kids from the front seat was watered down. But small children face new seat belt rules under a law Gov. Gavin Newsom signed last week.


A new California law aims to keep more short children in booster seats for longer, imposing fines if they can’t properly wear their seat belt.
Last week, Gov. Gavin Newsom signed a watered-down version of Assembly Bill 435 that originally proposed to ban smaller teenagers from sitting in the front seat and to require short-statured youth to use booster seats into their middle school years.
But enough of the Democrats who control the Legislature balked at ending the time-honored tradition of teens calling “shotgun” to ride in the front seat. 
Instead, they settled on changing the standards police officers use to determine if a child is tall enough to safely wear a seatbelt while riding in a vehicle. Currently, California law requires children to use booster seats until they turn 8 or reach a height of 4 foot 9 inches.
That won’t change under the law Newsom signed. But beginning in 2027, children from 8 to 16 years old will have to pass a five-step test to be considered properly restrained by a seat belt under California law. 
If the driver of a vehicle can’t answer “yes” to all of these five questions about their seat-belted child passenger, the driver could get a ticket and fines of $490.
1. Does the child sit all the way back against the seat?
2. Do the child’s knees bend comfortably at the edge of the seat?
3. Does the belt cross the shoulder between the neck and arm, resting on the collarbone?
4. Is the lap belt as low as possible, touching the thighs?
5. Can the child stay seated like this for the whole trip?
The bill’s proponents said the point is to encourage children and their parents to stay in booster seats until they’ve grown tall enough for a seat belt to fit them properly. The new rules are in line with recommendations public health officials and the California Highway Patrol have for years encouraged parents to follow.
Advocates cite numerous studies showing that small children in car wrecks are more likely to be severely injured or killed because seat belts aren’t designed for their small frames. It’s also especially dangerous for small-framed children to sit up front. 
“The longer the child can be using a booster if they do not meet the test, the better, because it is so important to have the belt in the right place,” said Stephanie Tombrello, the former executive director SafetyBeltSafe U.S.A. and a longtime proponent of seat belt laws. 
Original bill was a tough sell
The original version of the bill would have banned teens up to 16 years old from sitting in the front seat if they couldn’t pass the five-step test.
The bill also would have required all children younger than 10 to use booster seats and bar all those under 13 from sitting in the front seat. The measure also would have required children as old as 13 to use a booster seat unless they passed the five-step test.
But even with child and automotive safety and health care groups supporting the bill, it proved to be too tough a sell in its original form for its author, Democratic Assemblymember Lori Wilson of Suisun City. 
Her bill sailed through its first two committees. Then, in May, the bill died when Wilson brought it to the Assembly floor. It needed 41 votes to pass. It got 35, with 25 Democrats not voting, which counts the same as voting “no.”
As CalMatters reported, Democrats almost never vote “no” on their colleagues’ bills. Instead, they typically don’t vote at all. In the Capitol, it’s seen as a more polite way of saying “no” and less likely to lead to retaliation. Not voting also allows politicians to dodge accountability for controversial votes since it’s difficult for a member of the public to determine if a particular lawmaker was actually there to vote that day. 
Wilson told CalMatters that part of the resistance from her Democratic colleagues was fallout over controversial legislation that sought to increase penalties for teen sex solicitation. That legislation raised difficult questions in the Democratic caucus about how hard to crack down on those accused of soliciting sex from minors, based on whether the victims were younger or older teenagers.
Then along came Wilson’s bill soon after. Wilson said conservative media outlets made comparisons between the bills, since hers sought to have the state treat some teens like small children. That was seen as hypocritical given the resistance from progressive Democrats to increasing penalties for those soliciting sex from older teenagers.
“It then started getting eyes on it,” she said. “And people started talking about, ‘Well, actually, I have a 10-year-old, and they don’t want to sit in a booster seat. I don’t want them to sit in a booster seat.’”

The following month, Wilson brought the bill back to the Assembly. Noting that many of her colleagues were leery of the bill, she promised to fix it in the Senate.
With her assurances, the bill squeaked by with 42 votes. Then, after the most controversial provisions were removed, it passed the Senate unanimously. 
Wilson said she’s satisfied with the version of the bill that Newsom signed and has no plans to resurrect the more controversial measures in future legislation.

Donald Trump has urged the National Parks Service to delete inconvenient truths and has laid off 1,000  workers, endangering wildlife and Yosemite's history.","Guest Commentary written by

Pedro Hernández
Pedro Hernández is a historian and California program manager for GreenLatinos.


Yosemite National Park turns 135 this year. For many Californians it may feel distant by miles, but near at heart. 
Its rivers irrigate our farms, its forests clean our air and its wildlife capture our minds and hearts. For Latinos — even those who have never visited — Yosemite flows through our lives: in the water we drink, the food we grow and the landscapes we cherish. We are in Yosemite’s history.
Yet this anniversary should give us all pause, because today Yosemite and the lands that hold so much rich history are under threat. 
An icon of that history, George Meléndez Wright, fought for the park long ago. Hired in 1927, Wright was the first Latino naturalist in the National Park Service. 
He saw how mismanagement was threatening park wildlife. When Congress refused to fund a survey of the wildlife there, Wright funded it himself. His “Fauna No. 1” report became the park service’s first science-based wildlife plan, an authoritative text that guided its wildlife management for more than 30 years. 
By age 27, Wright had reshaped the park service’s mission for generations to come. Two mountains were later named after him.
Wright’s story is more than a footnote. His values — humility before ecosystems, scientific integrity, respect for life — remain vital to Yosemite’s future. They matter more now as climate change, habitat loss and mismanagement intensify. 
Today Yosemite faces a danger Wright never could have imagined: the erasure of its human stories and the dismissal of park staff.
A park under pressure
In March, President Donald Trump signed Executive Order 14253, which he called “Restoring Truth and Sanity to American History.” It directs federal agencies, including the Interior Department, to purge “improper ideology” from parks, museums and monuments.
Translation: Narratives that confront slavery, Indigenous dispossession, colonial expansion or racial injustice could be treated as improper. Latino histories, migrant perspectives and environmental justice struggles — inherently complex and contested — may be erased.
The Interior Department already has issued Secretarial Order 3431 to implement the mandate. With vague terms like “divisive narrative” and “shared American values,” officials now have broad discretion to soften or delete inconvenient truths. 
In Yosemite, museum exhibits and interpretive signs are under review. The park’s official story risks being sanitized into scenery alone, stripped of labor, conflict and resistance.
These ideological pressures come as the park service faces severe staffing and budget cuts. 
In early 2025, about 1,000 employees — nearly a quarter of its workforce — were laid off. In Yosemite, biologists and watershed scientists have been reassigned to clean bathrooms or staff entry gates.
A coalition of 40 former national park superintendents warned Interior Secretary Doug Burgum that parks are opening without enough staff to maintain safety, protect habitats or prevent vandalism. Garbage is piling up, trails are decaying and wildlife goes unmonitored. 
With fewer staff to steward, research, interpret and educate, all visitors bear a risk.
Latinos already face barriers to accessing parks — cost, language, transportation. Executive Order 14314, dubbed “Making America Beautiful Again by Improving Our National Parks,” will add to that by increasing park entrance fees for “nonresidents,” which will impact many Latinos in California. 
Environmental groups such as the national GreenLatinos urge California’s congressional delegation to demand transparency before park narratives are altered. Elected leaders also should fight agency cuts and firings and defend Wright’s vision of science-based stewardship, which cannot survive without trained staff and adequate funding. 
Americans should reject any policy that “restores truth” by erasing complexity. If executive authority can decide which histories and people are permissible, then our collective national memory and national parks become hostages to politics. 
Yosemite’s future anniversaries will matter only if both land and story are protected. Let’s insist the next 135 years be written by many hands, many voices, all truths.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/070723-Yosemite-National-Park-MG-CM-15.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-10-14 08:57:13.231073

(Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images)“Buy now, pay later” consumer loans in Nevada may soon be easier to get, and they may come with better consumer protections, thanks to a new state law that went into effect earlier this month.
BNPL loans are typically interest-free and paid back in four or fewer installments. They can be seen as the modern-day equivalent to layaway, except that the customer receives the product they’re purchasing upfront rather than after the payments have been made.
They are not always seen by customers as loans, but BNPL are short-term loans that have become increasingly popular with online shoppers. Sometimes called “pay in 4,” these payment plans are now widely available — at luxury brand stores and dental offices, to retail giants like Walmart, and even delivery app leader DoorDash.
Passed by lawmakers and signed by the governor earlier this year, Senate Bill 437,removed from state law a requirement that internet-based consumer lenders, like those offering BNPL loans, maintain a physical office in the state. The new law went into effect Oct. 1.
The change was first pitched in 2021 through legislation sponsored by  then-state Sen. Ben Kieckhefer. A representative for Affirm, a publicly traded company that offers BNPL loans, testified to lawmakers that year that it maintained a physical office in Nevada in order to comply with state law but “has never had a single customer come to the location.”
Other buy now, pay later companies appear to have opted simply to not operate in Nevada.
This year, Kieckhefer, now a lobbyist for Affirm and another fintech company, Upstart, resurrected the effort.
Consumer protections
Peter Aldous, a consumer rights attorney at Legal Aid of Southern Nevada who supported SB437, believes the most substantial part of the new law are provisions requiring the lenders to use Nevada law to govern the loan.
This should end the use of “choice of law” clauses, which says a different state’s laws govern the contract. Typically that chosen state is one like Utah or New Jersey with more lax consumer protections.
“For the most part, we have strong consumer protection laws,” says Aldous of Nevada.
Consumers likely won’t notice the change buried in their BNPL fine print, but it could make a big difference if they found themselves in a dispute.
Critics of BNPL warn that these types of short-term financing generally offer less protections for consumers than credit cards, particularly when it comes to refunds after returning products.
In May 2024, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau issued an interpretative rule clarifying that BNPL lenders are credit card providers and customers have the right to dispute charges and demand refunds.
The rule followed earlier research by the CFPB found that 13.7% of BNPL loans in 2021 involved a return or dispute.
“Regardless of whether a shopper swipes a credit card or uses Buy Now, Pay Later, they are entitled to important consumer protections under longstanding laws and regulations already on the books,” said then-CFPB Director Rohit Chopra when announcing the rule.
Chopra was fired by President Donald Trump in February of this year. In May, the Trump administration announced it would not enforce the earlier Biden-era rule and is contemplating rescinding it.
Also changing at the national level this year: BNPL loans may now impact your credit score. FICO this year announced it would begin incorporating BNPL data into its credit score model.
Industry growth
Buy now, pay later loans have been around for several years and gaining traction with consumers.
PayPal’s chief executive has said BNPL is an area of growth for the company and is driven by younger consumers who are wary of credit cards. Another giant of the industry, Klarna, held an initial public offering last month.
The Consumer Protection Finance Bureau in January released a report on BNPL and found that 21% of consumers with a credit record financed at least one purchase in 2022 using one of the six BNPL firms: Affirm, Afterpay, Klarna, PayPal, Sezzle and Zip. They also found that the majority of these consumers are taking out multiple BNPL loans at a time. Approximately a fifth of BNPL users can be classified as “heavy users” who finance more than one purchase per month with BNPL.
According to the CPFB, people with the lowest credit scores make up nearly half of all BNPL loans, though their default rate on BNPL loans is lower than their default rate on their credit cards — 2% compared to 10%.
Many BNPL lenders require customers to set up automatic direct deposit payments from their checking account, making repayment more likely.
Aldous from Legal Aid says a BNPL loan might be the best option for a consumer who would otherwise use a credit card or high interest payday lender. But there are concerns about deceptive marketing that can lead people to taking on too much debt.
While many associate BNPL loans with interest free loans over a few months, these companies also offer loans with longer terms and interest. Sometimes interest and fees can also be tacked onto the interest-fee loan if a customer misses a payment.
“That’s where you can get caught up, getting too used to paying over time, and not lining up your budget,” says Aldous. “People don’t think of it as a credit card. They think, ‘I’m going to have a monthly bill. I can afford that.’”",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/GettyImages-2234677734-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-14 08:57:13.231073

However, as more days go by, food access advocates worry about whether an overhaul to food programs already scheduled to start in November will result in scarcer resources for those in need. 
The state had already secured October’s funding for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, known as SNAP, according to the Utah Department of Workforce Services. The Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children, known as WIC, is also afloat for the month, and the state is still processing applications for both.
“We are issuing SNAP benefits as normal in October, but we have not yet been informed by USDA if funds will be provided for November, so we are awaiting further federal guidance,” a Utah Department of Workforce Services spokesperson said in a statement.

What happens in November is still uncertain without an agreement between Republicans and Democrats to fund the federal government. The pause in some government operations also brings questions about new requirements for nutrition programs mandated by the spending package widely known as the “big, beautiful bill.”
Starting Nov. 1, the government is expanding its work requirements for different assistance programs, including SNAP for people between 18 and 65 years old.
Nutrition program for women, infants and children to stay afloat through end of month

“States have not received a lot of guidance on that,” Gina Cornia, director at Utahns Against Hunger said on Monday. “And so we’re concerned about the impact that implementing those work requirements starting Nov. 1 will have because the Department of Workforce Services, if they need technical assistance and if they need policy guidance, there isn’t anyone right now at the USDA that is providing that.”
With the uncertainty, some advocacy groups, including Utahns Against Hunger, are planning on making a request to Gov. Spencer Cox this week to ask for a delay on implementing the changes in light of the government shutdown. 
“Right now states can’t afford to implement new provisions without more guidance from the USDA,” Cornia said.
About 169,300 people in Utah received SNAP benefits during the 2024 fiscal year. If they don’t have those funds to feed their families, Cornia worries they’ll have to go without, or use other resources, which could overwhelm food pantries and food banks across the state.

“If they suddenly have to accommodate tens of thousands of more people, it’s just not going to happen,” Cornia said of the food banks. “They can’t fill that gap.”
Pantries are already seeing more people than ever before, Cornia said, and more so with reduced federal support for programs like the Commodity Supplemental Food Program for seniors. Adding more pressure could have “devastating” ripple effects.
Other shutdown effects
Funding has been shifted to approved expenses during the latest days of the shutdown — troops will get paid come Oct. 15 after the Pentagon “identified approximately $8 billion of unobligated research development testing and evaluation funds” from last fiscal year. 
And WIC will remain afloat through the rest of the month with a $300 million transfer from its child nutrition programs account, which has long been funded in part by tariff revenue.
At Salt Lake City’s airport, operations by the Transportation Security Administration are running smoothly, said Nancy Volmer, director of communications and marketing at the airport. 
“We’re keeping a close eye on it, and just if there are any sort of impacts, we’ll make sure that we get the word out to the passengers,” Volmer said. “But we’re just asking that passengers plan plenty of time in case there are any delays. And then also just to be kind to the workers up front, because this is a really difficult time for them.”

(Ralph Chapoco/Alabama Reflector)A state bar association last week sharply criticized the U.S. Department of Justice for bringing felony charges against an attorney in a lawsuit challenging Alabama’s gender-affirming care ban.
In an indictment unsealed last month, the department charged attorney Carl Charles with allegedly lying to a panel of three judges who were investigating allegations of judge-shopping in the case.
In a statement released last week, the New York State Bar Association said that the rules of conduct that govern the profession dictate that the tribunal of judges and the respective bar associations are the ones that should address allegations of professional misconduct and not the U.S. Department of Justice.

“The City Bar urges the Executive Branch to adhere to the rule of law, cease warping the Department of Justice’s missions and functions by targeting individuals and groups the administration politically disfavors, and refrain from attempting to criminalize attorneys who advocate on behalf of transgender people and other marginalized communities,” the statement said.
The Bar also said that the panel did not include several facts pertaining to the incident when the judges had concluded its investigation and presented the findings to the judge overseeing the case who eventually sanctioned Charles.
Charles was charged with making a false statement to a grand jury or court, a felony that carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison. The case is still pending.
A message was sent to the New York Bar Association on Monday seeking additional comment.
According to his biography found on the Lamba Legal website, Charles worked with the New York City Commission on Human Rights Law Enforcement Bureau, investigating and prosecuting violations of New York City Human Rights Law.
The lawsuit sought to overturn a 2022 law allowing prosecutors to charge physicians with a felony when they prescribe puberty blockers and hormone therapies for transgender youth.
U.S. District Judge Liles C. Burke in May of that year issued a temporary injunction against the prescription ban, ruling it interfered with parents’ rights to decide the welfare of their children. A three-judge panel of the 11th Circuit of Appeals overturned the ruling in 2023, citing the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision in  Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, which eliminated federal abortion protections in part by saying the 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution does not protect rights “not deeply rooted in the nation’s history and traditions.”
Charles and other attorneys representing the families were accused of trying to manipulate the system by allegedly attempting to secure a judge more sympathetic to their clients’ position by dropping an initial filing and then refiling the lawsuit.
A panel of three judges was convened to investigate the incident and called Charles and the other attorneys to testify about their roles in the incident. Burke sanctioned Charles, along with Melody Eagan and Jeffrey Doss, after the panel issued the findings. He ordered that Eagan and Doss be removed from the case and imposed a $5,000 fine for Charles. Burke also publicly reprimanded the three attorneys and referred the matter to the U.S. Attorney’s Office who then charged Charles with making a false statement to the panel investigating the incident.
The charge pertains to a statement that Charles made before the panel denying that he made a phone call to the chambers of U.S. District Judge Myron Thompson to ask questions about the case and the temporary restraining order that was filed.
The New York State Bar Association said that the findings from the three-judge panel did not include that Charles eventually admitted to making the phone call to the judge’s chambers and later apologized.
“Further, the indictment mentions neither that Mr. Charles had no advance notice that the related case designation and phone call would be subjects of the inquiry nor that he indicated that he was very nervous and was trying to be as forthright as possible,” the statement from the New York Bar Association said. “Additionally, at no point during the inquiry did the court, the U.S. Attorney’s Office, or the three-judge panel find the call to be improper in which case Mr. Charles’s initial statement about the call was immaterial.”",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/20240717_083407-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-10-14 08:57:13.231073

The discussion was part of the Southern Poverty Law Center’s (SPLC) Critical Memory Tour, an analysis of how Germany and the United States publicly remember the Holocaust and the Civil Rights Movement, respectively. 
Baxley, the youngest attorney general in the country when he was elected to the office in 1970, reopened the case. In 1977, he successfully prosecuted Robert Chambliss for his role in the bombing. Chambliss was convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to life in prison, where he died in 1985.

“I felt strongly about the Civil Rights Movement from the beginning. I’d always thought it was wrong to mistreat you because of the color of your skin,” Baxley said. “This time with the death of four children in the house of worship, I thought that exceeded all the bad deeds.”
Jones reopened the case for the remaining two suspects when he was appointed U.S. District Attorney in Northern Alabama in 1997. He prosecuted and won convictions against Thomas Edwin Blanton Jr. in 2001 and Bobby Frank Cherry in 2002. Cherry died in Kilby Correctional Facility in 2004. Blanton died in Donaldson Correctional Facility in 2020. 
“It’s a journey about this community and this state, and really for Bill and myself. This was a remarkable case, and cases, for lawyers to get involved in,” Jones said.
The tour started in Germany in March. Lisa Borden, deputy federal policy director for SPLC, said in an interview after the event that the German government has done a good job of sharing an accurate history of the Holocaust. However, she said, pushback has started from far-right groups.
“For the last 10 years, at least, there has been a real trend in our country for far right rhetoric to become mainstream in politics in the US. Even back when we were together in Germany in March, we didn’t understand how relevant this was going to be by the time we sit here today,” Borden said. “Since the beginning of the year, there has been an assault on history in our country.”
Borden said that it is important to remember the history of the Civil Rights Movement and the Holocaust so that it does not repeat itself. 
“When the Nazis were planning their final solution, they looked at U.S. laws. They looked at Jim Crow and the eugenics that had been practiced during slavery and during the Reconstruction Era and even during the Jim Crow period,” Borden said. “These are the instruments of hate that have been used since time immemorial.”
Throughout Jones’ cases, he kept coming back to a photo of Denise McNair, one of the four girls killed in the bombing, holding a white Chatty Cathy doll. He said it reminded him then, and now, of hope.
“At the time, it was hope of a race here in America. But today, it’s really a hope for everyone, given all that we’re doing,” Jones said. “Even when I tried these cases years ago, immigration issues and other issues of hate will begin to bubble up. And today it’s really the hope of so many people that we can all live on this planet together, love each other a little bit more, (and) respect each other a hell of a lot more.”",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/ba42e469-4ed6-4409-9e27-304b767f5da4-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-10-14 08:57:13.231073

Late on October 9, Israel’s cabinet formally approved plans for a ceasefire with Hamas, setting a Gaza peace process in motion. U.S. President Donald Trump announced that it constituted the “first phase” of his twenty-point peace plan that the White House had unveiled last week. Qatar, a critical player in the mediation efforts, has confirmed the developments, as have Israeli and Hamas officials.
Once both sides proceeded with a pause of the conflict, Hamas moved forward with the release of all of its living hostages.  Israel, in turn, has begun releasing hundreds of Palestinian prisoners. Trump, addressing Israel’s Knesset after the hostage release, declared that the war had “ended,” though other White House officials and experts have noted the fragility of the ceasefire. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said today that the deal “opens the door to an historic expansion of peace in our region,” while Hamas leader Ghazi Hamad said that the group would “determine its responses” for commitment to the ceasefire after the hostage-prisoner stage was complete.
More than twenty countries’ officials gathered in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, on Monday to discuss paving the way for peace in Gaza, though neither Israel nor Hamas had a representative at the table.
The movement toward a truce comes after days of intense negotiations between Israel and Hamas in Egypt and European and Arab partners in Paris. It falls on the heels of the war’s two-year anniversary, which broke out on October 7, 2023, when Hamas attacked southern Israel from Gaza. Around 1,200 people were killed by Hamas fighters and another 251 were taken hostage. Israel responded with a major military offensive that has killed more than sixty-seven thousand Palestinians, according to data from the Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry.
The warring sides have twice tried and failed to uphold a ceasefire, once in November 2023 and again in March 2025. Both efforts collapsed and experts warn that hurdles remain, but broad international support for the latest effort has led to greater optimism.
The new plan lays out “tough conditions for Hamas and Israel,” CFR Middle East expert Steven Cook wrote. Several points have long been contentious issues between the two. “Whether this leads to an end to the war remains an open question.”
Here’s what the twenty-point peace plan entails.
 What have Israel and Hamas agreed to so far?

A ceasefire. Israel and Hamas agreed to halt fighting. This initial ceasefire went into effect on Friday after Israel’s cabinet formally approved the agreement the day before. Trump’s peace plan sketches this out as “all military operations, including aerial and artillery bombardment, will be suspended, and battle lines will remain frozen.”
Israel’s military action in Gaza had reportedly intensified until right up to the ceasefire deadline. Since the truce, Palestinians have been returning in droves to Gaza City after an Israeli military spokesperson declared it safe to head back to the enclave’s previously most populous city.
A military drawdown. The Israeli military, known as the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), agreed to withdraw their troops up to a line that leaves it in control of 53 percent of the enclave. The White House released a map of the Gaza Strip that shows this would be the first of three stages of Israel’s withdrawal.



Israel Completes First Phase of Gaza Withdrawal
The plan states that two further withdrawal phases will follow





(Map: Austin Steinhart for CFR based on map released by the White House.)





The White House plan indicates future withdrawals to around 40 percent and 15 percent of Gaza territory. The final stage keeps a security perimeter until Gaza is “secure” from any “resurgent terror threat.” On October 10, U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff confirmed in a social media post that Israeli troops had finished the first phase of the withdrawal.



A hostage and prisoner release. The twenty hostages who are still living and were among those taken in October 2023 were released back to Israel on Monday morning. Hamas has not yet released the bodies of the twenty-eight deceased hostages that remain in their possession. Hamas said it would give back four of the hostages’ bodies on Monday, but the timeline for their return remains unclear. Of the 251 hostages taken by Hamas, 147 were released or exchanged in prior deals. Eight of those released were dead, and the bodies of 41 others were previously recovered by Israel.
As part of the exchange, Israel has begun the release of 250 Palestinian prisoners who are serving life sentences in Israel, as well as 1,700 detainees from Gaza. The first buses of Palestinian prisoners arrived in the West Bank and Gaza on Monday. Israel will also give back fifteen Palestinian bodies for the remains of each Israeli hostage it receives. Several high-profile political figures at the top of Hamas’s release list were not included in the deal.
Aid delivery increases. The White House’s plan says that “full aid” will be sent to Gaza “without interference,” which Trump has specified means six hundred trucks carrying aid per day. This includes “rehabilitation of infrastructure (water, electricity, sewage), rehabilitation of hospitals and bakeries, and entry of necessary equipment to remove rubble and open roads.”
Aid groups have warned that the enclave has faced a growing humanitarian crisis as the conflict has continued. The World Health Organization has said that Gaza hospitals are at a “breaking point”—94 percent are damaged or completely destroyed and supplies are falling short. The UN-backed global hunger monitor, the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification system, has said there is an “entirely man-made” famine in Gaza and emphasized the need for the resurgence of aid.
Israel has maintained that Hamas has undermined aid efforts and has forcefully denied the famine determination, which it says is based on Hamas data and a manipulated process.
The United Nations reported on Sunday that progress on aid was “well underway” in the strip. Supplies such as cooking oil flowed in for the first time in months, the UN humanitarian office reported. UN officials said that the aid is still falling short of what is needed to address a widespread humanitarian crisis.
Troop deployment. The Rafah crossing with Egypt has been opened for aid delivery, European officials have confirmed, while a small Israeli troop presence remains there. The United States is also sending two hundred troops to Israel to monitor the ceasefire and help with aid delivery. No U.S. troops will be deployed directly inside Gaza, officials say.
 What happens next? 

Trump joined officials from more than two dozen countries at a Gaza peace conference to work out more details in Egypt on Monday. Netanyahu didn’t attend because of a Jewish holiday, his office said.
Long term, Trump’s twenty-point plan stipulates that no Palestinians will be militarily forced to leave Gaza, and that Israel will agree not to occupy or annex the Gaza Strip. The enclave will “be redeveloped for the benefit of the people of Gaza, who have suffered more than enough,” the plan reads. At the same time, Gaza must be “a deradicalized terror-free zone” that “does not pose a threat to its neighbors.”
In the more immediate future, the twenty-point plan encompasses a range of different efforts.
Stabilization. The United States and Arab and other international partners will join forces to form an International Stabilization Force (ISF) to immediately deploy in Gaza for security as it undergoes the transition from war to peaceful governance. The ISF will also train and support vetted Palestinian police forces. The plan aims for the IDF to progressively hand over the occupied Gazan territory to the ISF as the Israeli military withdraws its forces.
Governance. At the same time, Gaza will transition to “temporary transitional governance of a technocratic, apolitical Palestinian committee” which will operate under an international board headed by Trump. The only other member of the board who has been publicly announced so far is former British Prime Minister Tony Blair, who will have a central, but still undefined, role. The “Board of Peace,” as Trump calls it, aims to set the framework and monitor funding for Gaza’s redevelopment. The Palestinian Authority (PA), the governing body of the West Bank, will simultaneously undergo a reform program to prepare for governance of the strip.
Demilitarization. An independent monitor group will oversee the “demilitarization” of Gaza, including placing weapons “permanently beyond use” and an internationally funded “buy-back” program. All “military, terror, and offensive infrastructure” will be destroyed, a condition that Hamas has previously refused and is expected to resist.
Economic reform. A panel of experts will convene and come out with an economic development plan to “rebuild and energize Gaza.” They also hope to establish a special economic zone with preferred tariff and access rates (to be negotiated with participating countries). The peace plan didn’t address the amounts or sources for funding for reconstruction of the battered enclave head-on, but the World Bank estimated earlier this year that it would cost more than $50 billion. The plan cites “thoughtful investment proposals and exciting development ideas” to “create jobs, opportunity, and hope” for Gaza, without elaborating on what those are.
Negotiations over the next sets of details will continue as observers watch to see whether the first phase holds.
Over the longer term, the PA will eventually take over governing the Gaza Strip after it has been reformed, the White House plan says. It claims that “regional partners” will “guarantee” that Hamas and its factions will comply with the details of the plan and won’t pose a threat to the region, though it does not provide further details of how this will work. There will also be an “interfaith dialogue process” to “try and change the mindsets and narratives of Palestinians and Israelis,” who have long been at odds, on the “benefits of peace.”
The final point in the peace plan is for the United States to “establish a dialogue” between Israel and the Palestinian territories to agree on a political horizon “for peaceful and prosperous coexistence.”
“The first stage of this peace plan is the easy part,” CFR Senior Fellow for Middle Eastern Studies Elliott Abrams told CFR. “As world attention turns away when the fighting stops, these intractable issues will be no less difficult to solve than they have in the past decades.”
 What is the outlook for peace in Gaza?

Hamas will not have a future role in governing, according to the plan, but its members will be offered amnesty if they agree to peaceful coexistence or are provided safe passage out of the area. The group, which has governed Gaza since 2007, has steadfastly opposed the proposals of laying down weapons for good or giving up power. Israel, meanwhile, has long demanded these terms. Hamas has previously said it would not disarm until Palestinian statehood is recognized. “Success depends in the long run on Hamas giving up its struggle to destroy Israel through what it calls ‘armed resistance’ and the United States calls terrorism,” Abrams said.
Importantly, the plan does not guarantee the establishment of a Palestinian state, a longtime goal of the PA and the PLO, or Palestine Liberation Organization. It does acknowledge the possibility, saying that only after reform to the PA and Gaza reconstruction will there be “a credible pathway to Palestinian self-determination and statehood, which we recognise as the aspiration of the Palestinian people.”
Israel has agreed to the plan in full, but Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has resisted having the PA play a role in governing Gaza. Several of the hardline members in his cabinet are also likely to oppose some of the provisions in the later phases, experts believe, with some already condemning them.
“There is no appetite for a two-state solution among Israelis who have concluded after October 7 that Palestinians do not want to live side-by-side in peace with them,” Cook said. Indeed, the latest local polling shows that a growing majority of Israeli Jewish and Arab respondents oppose a two-state solution. At the same time, a majority of Israelis—66 percent, up thirteen points from last year—believe it is time for the war to end.

The letters, dated Oct. 10, were sent to four companies and follow a KFF Health News investigation that exposed widespread issues in states using Deloitte-run systems to assess Medicaid eligibility for millions of people. Failures have resulted in the erroneous loss of health coverage and other vital safety-net benefits for low-income people. Malfunctions in those systems can cost millions and take years to fix.
As most states prepare to institute work requirements mandated by the tax and domestic spending law President Donald Trump signed in July, senators wrote it is each company’s responsibility to build functioning systems, “rather than to prioritize their bottom line.”
Democratic senators Ron Wyden of Oregon, Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, and Raphael Warnock of Georgia, as well as Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), sent the letters to several companies the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services identified as eligibility system contractors: Deloitte, GDIT, Gainwell Technologies, and Conduent.
“They’re essentially health care middlemen that are in the business of red tape, and they profit when Americans don’t get health care,” Wyden, the top Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, which oversees Medicaid, said in an interview.
“They’ve got a history of poor performance when it comes to determining eligibility or in helping Americans enroll in Medicaid,” Wyden said. “Without stronger oversight and real accountability, these contractors are just going to get a jumbo windfall for creating systems that actually harm Americans trying to get health care.”
Spokespeople for the four companies did not provide comments for this article.
As of June, 70.5 million people were enrolled in Medicaid, according to CMS.
A handful of states operate their own Medicaid eligibility and enrollment systems, but most rely on contractors to build and run them. KFF Health News found that Deloitte, a global consultancy that generated $70.5 billion in revenue in fiscal year 2025, dominates this slice of government business. Twenty-five states have awarded Deloitte contracts for eligibility systems. The agreements, in which the company commits to design, develop, implement, or operate state-owned systems, are worth at least $6 billion, dwarfing any of its competitors.
Kinda Serafi, a partner at Manatt Health, is advising states on how to reconfigure their systems to incorporate work requirements.
States are in a “major sprint” to make changes by 2027, she said, and they’re being “inundated” with pitches from vendors looking to secure contracts. It underscores the business opportunity these system changes represent for contractors.
“I think we have to really be vigilant to make sure that these vendors are implementing the requirements consistent with the law,” Serafi said.
Companies sign contracts with state governments, but the federal government pays the bulk of the cost. The federal government covers 90% of states’ costs to develop and implement state Medicaid eligibility systems and 75% of ongoing maintenance and operations expenses, according to federal regulations.
The Senate letters cite problems with Deloitte-run eligibility systems that KFF Health News identified. Among other issues, the Florida eligibility system erroneously cut benefits for new moms, and a problem in Kentucky prevented coverage applications from getting through online, which cost $522,455 and took 10 months to resolve.
“Unfortunately, these are just a few examples of third-party systems’ failure to serve their very function: to reliably and accurately determine an individual’s eligibility for Medicaid coverage and services,” the senators wrote.
The senators asked the companies to respond by Oct. 31 to their questions, such as whether companies’ contracts with states include financial incentives tying payment to the removal of Medicaid enrollees and whether the companies are penalized for coverage terminations made in error. The senators also demanded an accounting of the company’s lobbying expenditures for the past five years and protocols for making system changes.
By 2027, the Congressional Budget Office projected, based on an early version of the bill, 18.5 million Medicaid beneficiaries will have to work or complete other qualifying activities for 80 hours a month to keep their benefits, unless they qualify for an exemption. The CBO estimates that 5.3 million enrollees will lose coverage by 2034.
The new work requirements are just one of several federally mandated Medicaid changes that are forcing states to adapt their eligibility systems.
Medicaid work requirements have been plagued with problems in the few states where they’ve been tested. Medicaid enrollees have been frustrated in trying to navigate byzantine rules and glitchy technology. Work requirements have also come at great cost.
Georgia has not adopted the ACA Medicaid expansion, which has granted benefits to millions of adults earning up to 138% of the federal poverty level. Instead, the state offers benefits to some people earning up to the poverty line who can prove they’re working or participating in similar activities for 80 hours a month. Nearly 110,000 Georgians had applied to the state’s Georgia Pathways to Coverage program through May, but only 9,157 people were enrolled as of mid-August. Under typical ACA expansion rules, 336,000 adults would be eligible for coverage, according to KFF.
The Georgia program has cost $109 million, with $34 million spent on health benefits and more than $20 million allocated to marketing contracts, according to a KFF Health News analysis of state reports. Deloitte built Georgia’s eligibility system and is the primary consultant for the Pathways program.
Before Medicaid work requirements became federal law, Arizona also submitted a request to federal regulators to launch its own version that would apply to roughly 190,000 people.
The state’s application provided insight into the types of system changes states may soon need to make to manage the new federal work requirement.
Arizona Medicaid officials said they would gather information on enrollees’ work hours, training, and education. The state’s eligibility system, which is operated by Accenture, would also need to check whether someone is exempt.
States are in the early stages of determining changes they need to make to implement work requirements.
Tessa Outhyse, a spokesperson for the California Department of Health Care Services, said the state expects upgrades to be processed “through the existing contractual change order process.” State contracts with eligibility companies often set aside millions to cover the cost of changes, but systems may require upgrades beyond the agreed-upon work.
In Missouri, upgrades are expected to cost roughly $33 million, according to a state budget document.
The state has a contract with private company RedMane to handle some of its Medicaid eligibility processing. Missouri plans to hire an additional contractor to ensure it properly institutes Medicaid work requirements, according to Baylee Watts, a spokesperson for Missouri’s Department of Social Services.
Medicaid eligibility contractors “have a lot of leverage and expertise to influence contracts, to win contracts,” Wyden said. “They can do a lot more, to the value of what we’re giving them.”

After months of speculation, Maine Gov. Janet Mills officially announced on Tuesday she’s running for U.S. Senate in 2026 to try to oust long-time Republican Sen. Susan Collins. 
Mills, a former state attorney general and district attorney, gained a national profile when she told President Donald Trump in February “see you in court” after he tried to deny federal funding to Maine over the state law that allows transgender athletes to compete on girls’ sports teams. 
Known locally as a moderate Democrat, Mills terms out as governor next year and has reportedly been scouted by national Democrats to launch a bid against Collins. But the Democratic primary field has been taking shape with political novices banking on frustration with establishment figures, including Mills and Collins. 
“I think I can win this, and I think I’m the one who can beat Susan Collins, because I have a track record of winning and of delivering for Maine people,” Mills said in an interview with the Bangor Daily News ahead of the official launch.
Mills v. Collins
So far, Mills has shied away from critiquing Collins, while other candidates have been vocal critics. 
Last month, when a reporter asked Mills whether she believed Collins was adequately pushing back on Trump’s actions, she said, “She’s in a tough position. I appreciate everything she is doing.”
Mills’ comment prompted the following quip from another challenger, oysterman and military veteran Graham Platner: “I do not appreciate everything that Susan Collins is doing.” 
Platner’s critiques of Collins started immediately when he made a splashy campaign launch in August. In his launch video, he equated Collins to “the oligarchy.” 
He’s also said Democrats need to stop running establishment candidates chosen by the party elites in D.C., pointing to earlier failed attempts to unseat Collins using that very tactic. Collins’ victory over Democrat Sara Gideon in 2020 came after pollsters had Gideon ahead by six points. 
This time around, many of Collins’ challengers are focusing on their working-class roots, living the same affordability challenges as their would-be constituents, and trying to draw a contrast to Collins, a now-multi-millionaire who is approaching 30 years in Congress.
Eyeing a sixth term, Collins is facing pressure from both sides

With the possibility of Mills entering the race being floated for months, several other candidates have already said whether that would influence their decision to remain in the running. 
Platner and Jordan Wood, a former congressional aide who spent a decade working in politics in Washington, D.C., have said they won’t drop out, while Dan Kleban, cofounder of Maine Beer Company, refrained from a clear answer. 
History of standing up to Trump
Mills’ “see you in court” remark that pulled her into the national spotlight this year was not the first time she’s stood up to Trump or his allies. 
When Trump visited Maine in 2020, he criticized her response to the COVID-19 pandemic and called her “a dictator” who “doesn’t know what she’s doing.” Mills, who is the first female governor of Maine, responded, “I have spent the better part of my career listening to loud men talk tough to disguise their weakness.” 
When Mills earlier served as Maine’s attorney general, she also routinely clashed with the Republican governor at the time, Paul LePage, a long-time political ally of Trump. 
For example, Mills sued pharmaceutical companies for their role in the opioid epidemic and then used settlement funds to purchase overdose-reversal kits — after LePage had vetoed legislation that sought to provide police greater access to opioid overdose medication. In 2017, LePage supported Trump’s ban on immigrants from predominantly Muslim countries, but as the state’s chief legal officer, Mills challenged it in court. LePage then unsuccessfully sued Mills. 
Background
Mills, who grew up in Farmington, first entered public service as an assistant attorney general and, in 1978, she co-founded the Maine Women’s Lobby to advocate for abused women after seeing faults in how the criminal justice system handles such cases. She then went on to become district attorney for Androscoggin, Franklin and Oxford counties and later serve in the Maine House of Representatives. 
After serving as attorney general from 2009 to 2011 and again from 2013 to 2019, Mills was elected governor in 2019. 
Some notable accomplishments during her tenure include expanding access to MaineCare, Maine’s Medicaid program, ensuring abortion access following the U.S. Supreme Court overturning Roe v. Wade and meeting the obligation to pay 55% of the cost of K-12 education for the first time in the state’s history. She also ushered the state through the COVID-19 pandemic and launched free community college, though the future of that program is now uncertain. 
She’s taken flack from both sides of the aisle for some of her funding plans, with Republicans objecting to any tax increases and Democrats pushing back on program cuts. But she’s walked the line, rejecting any broad-based income tax changes while making significant investments in health and child care. 
The state has seen record savings under Mills’ tenure.

(Photo by Scott Housely/CDC)[2025 governor's race Voter Guide: Where NJ’s governor hopefuls stand on the issues]In public settings, the leading candidates for governor in New Jersey say they support the state’s current childhood vaccine requirements and believe the state should pursue herd immunity.
But the two differ on the details, with Democrat Mikie Sherrill saying she would follow “vaccine protocol” and Republican Jack Ciattarelli promising to allow more parents to opt out of vaccine requirements for their children.
The two are campaigning to replace a term-limited Gov. Phil Murphy (D) in January as state health officials express alarm about declining immunization rates and a dip in herd immunity, a threshold level of community immune protection sufficient to restrict the spread of disease.
Sherrill, a four-term congresswoman, has promised that if she becomes governor, she would work with other northeastern states that have joined forces to develop their own science-based vaccine guidelines in the wake of federal policy shifts driven by vaccine skepticism in the Trump administration.
When asked during the first gubernatorial debate at Rider University about falling immunization rates nationwide and the rise in infectious diseases like measles, Sherrill said New Jersey parents “should be very worried.”
“These are eminently curable diseases and we are allowing children to get sick and, yes, die because we are not appropriately following medical research and vaccine protocol,” she said.

New Jersey, as the nation’s most densely populated state, is particularly at risk, Sherrill said, since close contact increases the chance of transmission. Nationwide, more than 1,500 measles cases have been diagnosed this year alone — including 10 in New Jersey — and three children have died, two in Texas and one in New Mexico, according to federal data. 
“These are diseases that in my childhood had been pretty much eradicated,” Sherrill told WPIX-TV recently. 
Ciattarelli has also pledged to uphold New Jersey’s current childhood vaccine requirements, or schedule, and said his priority as governor would be to protect public health and safety.
“The rise in things like measles, mumps, and whooping cough and the like is very, very concerning,” Ciattarelli, a former state assemblyman, said at Rider University. “We’ve got to get above the threshold for herd immunity to keep our communities safe.”
But Ciattarelli has also publicly said he would never mandate a vaccine, and last month joined an event hosted by the New Jersey Public Health Innovation Political Action Committee, which opposes mandatory vaccination, where the keynote speaker was a doctor who claimed COVID-19 vaccines can make people magnetic, according to the New York Times.
“Jack will oppose a one-size-fits-all vaccination schedule, support medical and religious exemptions for vaccines, and create a parental rights ombudsman in state government to give parents more of a voice on key issues, including those seeking a philosophical vaccine exemption,” Ciattarelli’s website says. 
Early in-person voting in the gubernatorial race begins October 25. Election Day is November 4. Mail-in ballots are being accepted now.
The front-runners’ campaigns have focused largely on affordability, with Ciattarelli seeking to connect Sherrill to unpopular elements of Murphy’s tenure and Sherrill underscoring Ciattarelli’s support for — and endorsement from — President Trump. But Ciattarelli, who almost defeated Murphy four years ago in a race shaped largely by voters’ feelings about the Murphy administration’s response to the pandemic, has also emphasized parental choice around education, gender identity, and health care. 
Sherrill has said Ciattarelli’s connection to vaccine-skeptics shows he is “taking his cues from fringe activist, conspiracy theorists” whose “extreme policies” will reduce access to vaccines and lead more children to become sick from preventable diseases. 
“People are getting sick because of politicians like Jack who campaign with anti-vaxxers and spread dangerous lies about our public health, and it’s clear we can’t trust him to keep our kids safe and healthy,” she said in a statement.
Ciattarelli told reporters at Kean University recently that parental choice and herd immunity are not in opposition. Communities would still be sufficiently protected even if families have more ways to opt out of childhood immunizations, he said, since the majority currently comply with the state immunization requirements. 
“Considering how many parents still vaccinate their children according to the current recommended schedule, I don’t think herd immunity is an issue here,” Ciattarelli said.

Guidelines for the use of vaccines are shaped by various federal bodies, but states control their own immunization schedules, a mix of recommendations and requirements that dictate what shots are given to newborns and what is needed to attend public school or child care. New Jersey requires children attending K-12 schools to get seven vaccinations — including the MMR, which targets measles, mumps, and rubella, and influenza — some involving multiple doses over several years. COVID-19 shots are not mandated for school. 
Immunization levels have declined in New Jersey and other states in recent years as concerns about the COVID-19 vaccines have elevated the voices of longstanding vaccine skeptics, including Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who Trump tapped to lead federal health programs. 
Herd immunity varies depending on the disease, but Dr. Kaitlan Baston, a former commissioner at the New Jersey Department of Health, warned state lawmakers in April that all counties in the Garden State had dipped below the needed threshold — 95% — to block measles transmission. The rate has also declined nationwide, federal data shows, so that 93% of kindergarteners were immunized against measles last school year, leaving some 286,000 youngsters unvaccinated. 
Baston said state officials need to work with medical providers and local health leaders to make sure families have accurate information about the risks and benefits of vaccination. Immunizations have saved 150 million lives globally over the past five decades, according to the World Health Organization. COVID-19 vaccines saved between 14 and 20 million people worldwide in the first year they were available, a study by the National Institutes of Health found. 
New Jersey health officials have continued to encourage people to get vaccinated, with recent campaigns highlighting the risk of seasonal respiratory illness and reminding people that measles is a preventable disease. The health department has also ordered pharmacists to offer COVID-19 vaccines to anyone older than 6 months — the minimum age for which they’ve been approved — regardless of federal guidance. State insurance officials are calling on insurance companies to cover the cost. 
Dr. Eddy Bresnitz, a vaccine expert and former state epidemiologist, said herd immunity or community protection is “not a single entity,” but varies depending on the disease. Measles is highly infectious, increasing the need for more people to be vaccinated in order to protect those who have health risks that prevent them from getting certain shots. Public health measures like keeping children home from school when sick, wearing masks, and regular hand washing also impact how a disease spreads, he said. 
Vaccine requirements “are not just about protecting children in the school setting. It’s also about protecting adults,” including teachers and administrators who are not able to be immunized themselves, Bresnitz said. The same principle applies in the wider community, he said. 
All states permit children who have immune disorders or cannot be vaccinated for other medical reasons to be exempted from these requirements. Like most states, New Jersey also allows for religious exemptions, a category that has become more popular in recent years. In 2019-2020, 3% of pupils opted out of immunizations for religious reasons; by last year, religious exemptions had risen to 5%, state data shows.
While most parents still support vaccination, Bresnitz — who lives in Pennsylvania — said adding another option for exemptions, as Ciattarelli proposes, inevitably increases the pool of unprotected children.
“The easier you make it for parents and caregivers to exempt their children” from the vaccine schedule, “the more likely it will put the community at risk,” he said. 
Ciattarelli has said that parent advocates want a process that provides them more information before they consent to shots for their children, along with options to “spread out” the vaccine schedule. The number of shots babies must get is “of great concern to a great number of parents across the state,” he said.
“The schedule is very different today than when my kids were children, and when I was a kid,” he said. 
Vaccine skeptics emerged as a political force here in late 2019, when Democratic leaders in the Legislature sought to limit New Jersey’s religious exemption, claiming it was being misused. Thousands of people, including many families with children, converged on Trenton for one of the largest, loudest Statehouse protests in recent times. Even Kennedy, founder of the anti-vaccine group Children’s Health Defense, made an appearance. Democrats abandoned the reform effort, which has not resurfaced since.

Family treatment courts save money and improve efficiencies. The societal benefit is clear: Children and families are safer and better off.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Meghan Masterson: We cannot afford to lose the Family Treatment Court docket.","This commentary is by Meghan Masterson of Burlington. Masterson is the executive director of KidSafe Collaborative, which serves as a member of the Chittenden County Family Treatment Court Docket steering committee.


Last month, it was announced that the Chittenden County Family Treatment Court docket will close at the end of the year. For those of us who have worked closely with this initiative, the news is heartbreaking and deeply disappointing.
The family treatment court docket, which is based on a nationally recognized evidence-based model, was created to support families affected by substance use disorder through a collaborative, trauma-informed and family-centered approach. It focuses on particularly challenging cases, where the stakes are highest for adults, children and the systems that support them.
This approach has been shown to work and be more effective than traditional dependency court processes. For adults, family treatment courts have been found to get people into treatment faster, retain people in treatment longer and support completion of treatment. For children, having parents participate in a family treatment court makes it substantially more likely they will achieve reunification without increased risk of future foster care reentry. 
Family treatment courts save money and improve efficiencies. The societal benefit is clear: Children and families are safer and better off.
The Chittenden County docket has been a powerful example of what is possible when courts, child protection, treatment providers and community organizations come together around a shared vision. It created real opportunities for parents to pursue recovery and for children to experience safe, stable connections. It stands as proof that when systems align and people persist through the inevitable challenges of collaboration, outcomes for families improve.
The closure of this docket is a step backward. At a time when Vermont families continue to grapple with the increasingly complex challenges of substance use and our communities cry out for effective solutions, we should be digging in to safeguard programs that work, not dismantling them because of funding decisions. 
The children and parents who would have benefited from this model next year will no longer have that opportunity. The professionals who staffed this program and relied on the docket as a structure for collaborative work will lose an evidenced-based and effective strategy. Our most stretched and overburdened systems will be forced to return to inefficient and less effective models of support.
The lessons of the family treatment court docket are too important to lose. Vermont must find a way to sustain and replicate this model, because the well-being of children and families demands it, and because our community deserves it.

Spokespeople for both the Flint Bishop International Airport and Grand Rapids’ Gerald R. Ford International Airport confirmed Monday afternoon that they have not been playing the video. Meanwhile, Matt Morawski, the director of communications and external affairs for the Wayne County Airport Authority, which operates the Detroit Metro Airport, directed the Michigan Advance to a spokesperson for the Transportation Security Administration, noting that the monitors are located in a TSA-leased space in the airport. 
However, the spokesperson, Amanda Osborn, was unable to provide further information on whether the video was being shown, on account of the government shut down. 
An automatic reply from Osborn’s email reads “I will be out of the office starting Wednesday, October 1, 2025, due to the current federal funding hiatus. I will not be able to return emails or telephone calls until I return to duty upon conclusion of the funding hiatus.”
Kasey Posa, director of marketing and public relations for Flint Bishop International airport told the Advance in an email that the airport’s operations have not been impacted by the federal government shutdown with flights running on schedule and no staffing or service interruptions. 
“We continue to stay in close communication with our federal partners to monitor the situation and remain prepared should circumstances change,” Posa said. 
Heidi Groenboom, communications and events associate for the Gerald R. Ford International Airport Authority said that as of Monday afternoon, they had not received the video and that it was not playing at the airport.
In the video, Noem said “Democrats in Congress refuse to fund the federal government” acknowledging the shutdown has affected operations, with many TSA employees working without pay.

“We will continue to do all that we can to avoid delays that will impact your travel. And our hope is that Democrats will soon recognize the importance of opening the government,” Noem said. 
According to a report from Reuters, more than 23,000 flights were delayed last week due to the government shutdown, while some 13,000 air traffic controllers and roughly 50,000 TSA officers are working without pay. 
Since the shutdown began, the Trump administration has received repeated criticism as several federal agencies display messages laying the blame for the government shutdown at Democrats’ feet. According to a report from Politico, the Small Business Administration shared a template for automated response out-of-office emails for furloughed employees which reads in part “I am out of office for the foreseeable future because Senate Democrats voted to block a clean federal funding bill.” 
Democrats have noted that Republicans control both the U.S. House and Senate, as well as the White House, and as the party in control have the ability to pass legislation that would reopen the government.
The consumer advocacy group Public Citizen has filed legal challenges against nine government agencies over the messaging, alleging a violation of the Hatch Act, which bars federal employees from engaging in partisan political activities while on duty, in a federal facility or using federal property.
The Center for Biological Diversity has also filed Hatch Act complaints against the U.S. Forest Service and the Department of Health and Human Services for displaying messages blaming Democrats for the shutdown.

But paying more won’t mean getting more. 
In Missouri, insurance doesn’t guarantee access. It often guarantees delays, denials and avoidable harm. Behind those higher costs are insurer rules that reach beyond billing and into clinical decisions once left to physicians.
Insurers argue these rules control costs in a system where waste is a legitimate concern. But in practice, they’ve become barriers that delay treatment, increase administrative spending and force patients through unnecessary tests. 
In a 2024 AMA survey, 94% of physicians said insurance pre-approvals, often called prior authorizations, delay treatment and 29% said it led to serious adverse events such as hospitalization or permanent disability.
Linda Quach, a former ICU nurse in Missouri, saw firsthand how insurer rules endangered patients.
“One incident that still haunts me today was when my patient needed an urgent MRI, but his insurance wouldn’t approve it unless we did a CT scan first,” she told me in a recent interview. “Our physicians said the CT wouldn’t be helpful, but we had no choice. The stress of transport caused his vitals to crash, and by the time we got back upstairs we had to code him. It was my first code, and it left me traumatized.”
Many hospitals already run overbooked CT and MRI machines, with inpatient and outpatient imaging sharing the same limited equipment and staff. Outpatients often wait weeks between scheduling and receiving a scan, and urgent inpatient cases can displace their test at the last minute.
When insurers require unnecessary procedures, they don’t just delay care for one patient. They limit access for others already waiting. 
In stroke care, timing is critical. Clot-busting drugs like tPA and TNK must be given within 3 to 4.5 hours of symptom onset, and only after imaging confirms the stroke is not caused by bleeding. When machines are tied up by avoidable imaging, it can delay diagnosis for patients whose outcomes depend on speed. Insurer rules that require sequential tests are intended to control costs, but they can worsen system-wide delays when they override medical judgment.
For many Missourians, those rules extend far beyond imaging. When insurers update or restrict their drug formularies, patients can lose coverage for medications that were already working. A 2024 Missouri Foundation for Health survey found that one in three Missourians skipped or rationed prescriptions because of cost, and more than half delayed or went without other care. 
Doctors are often required to follow “step therapy” policies — sometimes called fail-first rules — forcing patients to try cheaper alternatives before an insurer will approve the drug their physician originally prescribed. 
Unsafe staffing is the quiet emergency in Missouri hospitals

Prior authorization can also limit which doctors or specialists patients can see, or which treatments are covered, depending on the plan’s network and review process. In practice, medical decisions often hinge less on a clinician’s judgment and more on what the insurer is willing to cover that month.
Nationally, private insurers deny nearly one in five in-network claims. Investigations show some denials are issued with little or no physician review. Insurers defend these policies as safeguards against unnecessary care, yet investigations continue to show that these barriers delay or deny medically necessary treatment across the health system. 
In Missouri, as in most states, many people with private insurance are covered by self-funded employer plans regulated under federal rather than state law. A federal statute called the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, or ERISA, exempts these plans from most state oversight. 
ERISA’s preemption clause was originally designed to enable national uniformity in employer-based benefits, rather than shield insurers from accountability, and today it constrains states’ ability to act when those plans deny care. In the Supreme Court’s 2004 Aetna v. Davila decision, which ruled that patients harmed by coverage denials under ERISA-regulated employer plans can’t seek damages under state law,limiting accountability for insurer decisions.
That regulatory gap became painfully clear when Anthem ended its contract with University of Missouri Health Care on April 1, 2025, putting about 90,000 Missourians out of network. For more than three months, many insured Missourians faced canceled appointments, limited access to their regular providers, or out-of-network costs they could not afford, without knowing when or if coverage would return. A new agreement was reached in July and applied retroactively, but the disruption showed how vulnerable patients are when insurers control access without accountability. 
For thousands of Missourians, insurance itself became a barrier to care, forcing many to choose between paying out of pocket or delaying treatment.
The MU-Anthem dispute exposed what happens when insurers operate with little state oversight. In legislative hearings that followed, Director Angela Nelson of the Missouri Department of Commerce and Insurance testified that her agency has “no real authority” over many commercial insurance products — leaving Missourians with little recourse when coverage fails and regulators unable to act even when patterns of delay or denial emerge.
The Missouri Department of Commerce and Insurance conducts market conduct examinations and reviews rate filings, many of which are made public through SERFF. But unlike some states, Missouri does not routinely publish detailed market conduct examination reports beyond settlement summaries. 
Consumers can see proposed rates, but they rarely have access to the specific findings from these examinations or to the corrective actions regulators require of insurers, when regulators identified violations or required corrective action.
Missourians are expected to shoulder rising costs without meaningful public accountability.
As reimbursement stagnates and insurers retain more of each premium dollar, hospitals absorb growing losses through uncompensated care — the combined cost of charity care and unpaid bills. In 2023, Missouri hospitals absorbed more than $1 billion in uncompensated care, according to the Missouri Hospital Association.
The Affordable Care Act’s Medical Loss Ratio rule requires insurers to refund excess premiums when they spend too little on patient care and quality improvement. Those rebates make the flow of money visible, showing how insurer margins can expand even as hospitals operate at a loss. Missouri has no framework to tie those rebates to patient access or workforce stability, particularly for ERISA-exempt employer plans that fall outside state oversight.
The cost of inaction is clear to Quach, the ICU nurse: “Unsafe staffing ratios. Administrators who prioritize budget over lives. The emotional whiplash of being both essential and expendable.”
Premiums are rising even as many Missourians already can’t afford healthcare. Insurers are rebating millions while hospitals absorb tens or hundreds of millions in unpaid and unreimbursed care. Rural hospitals are closing, safety-net facilities are shrinking, and patients are left with nowhere to go. Insurer accountability should be as visible as hospital transparency.

The statewide median teacher salary was $60,100 as of the 2025 fiscal year, compared with $98,193 for school administrators and $114,825 for corporation administrators, according to a presentation prepared by the Legislative Services Agency.
The mean salary across Indiana was $63,424 for teachers; $99,556 for school administrators; and $116,731 for corporation administrators.
Though average salaries rose about 4% from 2024 to 2025, LSA staff told the committee that when adjusted for inflation, median wages for teachers and administrators have actually declined since 2020.
Suburban districts continue to pay the most, while teachers in rural and small-town schools saw the smallest wage growth, according to the LSA analysis.
Public schools spent roughly $824 million on teacher and administrator benefits in 2024, nearly 80% of it for health insurance.
‘We simply have to raise teacher pay’
Joel Hand, representing both the American Federation of Teachers Indiana and the Indiana School Social Workers Association, told the committee that Indiana “still lags far behind our other Midwestern states.”
He pointed to Wisconsin, for example, where teacher salaries averaged $65,196 for the 2023-24 school year. Ohio, meanwhile, reported average teacher pay at $72,644.

“If we want to keep those students who are getting degrees in education from leaving to go to Illinois or Ohio or Wisconsin or Michigan, we simply have to raise teacher pay,” Hand said.
He emphasized that Indiana currently ranks 39th in the nation for average teacher salary, citing data from the National Education Association. 
“If we want to address teacher retention … we have to raise teacher pay across the board,” Hand told lawmakers.
Gail Zeheralis, with the Indiana State Teachers Association, echoed those concerns. She reminded the committee that the 2019 Governor’s Teacher Compensation Commission had set a goal of a $60,000 average teacher salary.
“A $40,000 salary in 2019 equates to roughly $50,000 today, and a $60,000 average in 2019 equates to about $76,000 in today’s dollars,” she said. “Indiana must continue increasing state funding.”
LSA staff told lawmakers that statewide, student-to-teacher ratios have declined — from 17.6-to-1 in 2019 to 15.6-to-1 in 2025 — while the student-to-administrator ratio dropped from 208-to-1 to 196.9-to-1 over the same period. 
The trend, said LSA Assistant Director Austin Spears, mirrors national patterns but is “really driven by an increase in the count of teachers” rather than student enrollment growth. 
Still, Sen. Fady Qaddoura, D-Indianapolis, noted the roughly 1,300 open, unfilled teaching positions currently posted on the Indiana Department of Education’s website.
But other committee members questioned whether funding decisions at the local level steer too few dollars directly to classrooms. 
“It’s frustrating up here … that we want to take care of teachers as best we can, because we think that helps us educate kids better,” said Sen. Scott Baldwin, R-Noblesville. “But dollars going into the school system from this body don’t seem to always make it into the classroom or teachers’ pockets.”
Hand responded that “the erosion of collective bargaining for teachers at the local level” has weakened educators’ ability to advocate for fair pay and working conditions.

Hand additionally called attention to Indiana’s severe shortage of school social workers, which he and others flagged as a “critical” issue in the midst of growing mental health needs across the state’s schools.
The latest data from the state and national school social worker associations showed that Indiana has a student-to-social worker ratio of 1,829 to 1 — massively above the recommended ratio of 250 to 1.
“With the enormous crisis we have in Indiana — and really throughout the country — with mental health in our schools, this is a ratio that I would strongly challenge you as members of the General Assembly to work on,” Hand said.
School social workers are different from school counselors and are primarily focused on students’ lives outside of the classroom and on helping deal with issues outside of school that interfere with academic progress. 
Hand said that despite holding master’s degrees and being specially-certified, school social workers are typically not considered to be teachers and many are not on teacher contracts. 
He urged legislators to include social workers in the state’s definition of “teacher” for funding purposes, arguing that change will make it easier for school social workers to get hired or be qualified for raises.
Possible legislative solutions
Lawmakers and education advocates pointed to Senate Enrolled Act 146 — approved earlier this year — as a starting point for potential reform, but said additional changes are needed to make teacher pay competitive.
That law raised the minimum teacher salary from $40,000 to $45,000 beginning June 30, and increased the share of state tuition support that school districts must spend on teacher compensation from 62% to 65%.
Indiana’s annual average teacher pay tops $60K — but many still make less — per new report

It also created a statewide Teacher Recruitment Program to help fund training and placement in high-need schools, while requiring annual reports on expanding affordable health plan options for educators.
Several lawmakers on the committee signaled interest in going further. 
Rep. Jeff Thompson, R-Lizton, suggested offering weighted funding or incentive pay for shortage areas such as special education and STEM fields — “a market-based approach,” he said, that would help schools recruit for the hardest-to-fill roles.
Baldwin continued to push for greater transparency in local spending to ensure that “dollars reach classrooms and teachers,” rather than being absorbed by administrative growth.
Qaddoura additionally proposed a deeper analysis of district administrative structures to distinguish between small charter schools and large corporations when comparing salary ratios, noting that such distinctions “would give us a clearer picture of where our dollars are actually going.”
Other ideas discussed included restoring stronger collective bargaining rights for teachers and giving districts more flexibility to redirect certain capital project funds — like those used for athletic facilities — toward salaries. 
“We just need to somehow loosen up that money for teachers over another astro-turf football field,” said Sen. Travis Holdman, R-Markle.
No formal recommendations were adopted, but lawmakers said the findings will guide education discussions in the 2026 legislative session. 
“We’ve seen the data,” Thompson said. “Now we need to figure out what levers we can pull.”

(Photo by Stephen Maturen/Getty Images)My name is Matt Kinney, I live in St. Louis Park, and every year I volunteer to serve as an election judge. 
That means that when I walk into a school gym or community center on Election Day, I am there not just to vote, but to participate in making our democracy function.
I sit at a folding table with my neighbors, check in voters, and keep watch as democracy unfolds right before me.
There is nothing more uplifting and inspiring than to see neighbors from every walk of life voting.
Voters come as they are. Working parents bring their young children along, modeling the importance of being an active participant in our community and our democracy. 
Young voters exercise the franchise for the first time, sometimes with nervous excitement, sometimes with friends cheering them on. 
New Americans walk in with pride on their faces. 
Seniors who have voted in every election since Lyndon Johnson are there. 
In the voting booth, we aren’t defined by our age, race, income, or political affiliation — we’re Minnesotans coming together across differences to make our voices heard. 
But, as November approaches again, our democracy faces threats.  
Billionaires, big corporations and the politicians they fund who want to take us backward are sowing doubt by trying to convince people like you and me that our elections and our neighbors who run them can’t be trusted. 
They are also rigging the rules of our democracy so that they can maintain their wealth and power by distracting and dividing us.
That makes it even more important for us to vote and have our voices heard every chance we get. Because no matter what we look like, how we pray, or how much money we have in our bank accounts, we all deserve the freedom to vote and choose our leaders. 
Our democracy is a group project, and we can’t afford for Minnesotans to sit on the sidelines this election season or any to come. Voting equals power, and it is among the few tools at our disposal to fight the influence of the wealthy and big corporations and the politicians they fund.
Voting in Minnesota is safe, easy and secure. We lead the country in voter turnout, and it’s no wonder: Minnesota also has some of the strongest voter protections in the country, including guaranteed time off from work to vote and same-day voter registration. Our elections are run by professional election officials and supported by our friends and neighbors — from a mix of major political parties, as the law requires — who have stepped up to serve as election judges.
Whether you vote in person on Election Day, vote early at your city hall, or are one of the nearly 1.3 million voters across Minnesota (nearly 40% of voters) who cast their ballots by mail in 2024, you can be sure your vote will be counted accurately.
That’s why I show up every year to serve my community, my state and my country as a poll worker. It’s the same reason why I vote, and why this year I’ll work to make sure all of my friends, family, coworkers and neighbors have a plan to vote by Tuesday, November 4th.  
You can vote now through Election Day on Tuesday, November 4th. If you have local elections to vote in this year, you can find your polling location by going to the Minnesota Secretary of State’s poll finder.
Use your power to vote to send a message on Election Day that you’re tired of the wealthy and big corporations making all the decisions in our public life.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Minnesota-voting-line.jpg,,,2025-10-14 07:58:47.140335

(Photo by Isiah Holmes/Wisconsin Examiner)Democratic lawmakers are proposing a package of higher education bills to help address affordability for students by investing in a statewide tuition promise program and to support faculty and staff members by reversing Walker-era collective bargaining and tenure policies. 
Rep. Jodi Emerson (D-Eau Claire), the ranking member on the Assembly Colleges and Universities committee, said Democratic lawmakers are looking for ways to ensure Wisconsin’s higher education system is strong and accessible to “anybody who has the talent and the work ethic to want to pursue something.” 
“That’s part of our American dream, is that no matter where you start out in life, you’ve got an opportunity to do better and to gain knowledge and training,” Emerson said. 
Emerson said Democratic lawmakers hope the bills can kickstart discussions about policy changes that could be made. She noted that Republican lawmakers have often stripped proposals from the budget, saying that policy should be passed through individual bills outside of the budget process.
“We’re putting some of these bills back out now and saying, let’s have the policy discussion,” Emerson said. “If you’re not willing to have that during the budget, let’s have the discussion now.” 
Emerson said the first pair of bills that lawmakers unveiled at a press conference last week seek to specifically help with the affordability of higher education. 
“A lot of us heard loud and clear last election that pocketbook issues are really what are leading people right now,” Emerson said, adding that it’s part of the reason she supported the recent state budget. “But it wasn’t a perfect budget, and so we thought, how can we make this a little bit better?”
One bill, coauthored by Sen. Kristin Dassler-Alfheim (D-Appleton) and Rep. Brienne Brown (D-Whitewater), would implement a statewide “tuition promise” program, allowing first-time, in-state students from households with an adjusted gross income of $71,000 or less to have their tuition covered at any UW school, other than UW-Madison. Under the bill, the state would dedicate nearly $40 million towards the program. 
The program would function as “last-dollar, gap funding” meaning it would fill in the rest of the tuition costs after all federal and state grants and scholarships are calculated.
According to The Hechinger Report , as of 2024, 37 states offered a statewide promise program. 
UW-Madison already offers “Bucky’s Tuition Promise,” which launched in 2018 and is funded with private gifts and other institutional resources, not state tax dollars. The program guarantees four years of tuition and segregated fees for any incoming freshman from Wisconsin whose family’s annual household adjusted gross income is $65,000 or less. 
Recent studies have found the tuition promise program increased enrollment among accepted students at UW-Madison and increased retention rates. 
UW-Milwaukee also offers its own program which covers up to four years of tuition and segregated fees for students from families earning less than $62,000 per year. 
The UW system also has a version of the program that recently relaunched in 2025 after the system secured private funding. The Wisconsin Tuition Promise first launched in 2023, but was ended in 2024 after Republican lawmakers declined to fund the program. 
Another bill by Dassler-Alfheim and Rep. Angela Stroud (D-Ashland) would invest $10 million in the UW system for student retention and talent development efforts. 
At the press conference last week, Dassler-Alfheim said the bills are essential for supporting the state’s workforce.  
“If our workforce is the engine that runs our economy, then our Universities of Wisconsin and Wisconsin Technical Colleges are the gasoline that power that engine as our baby boomers retire in droves. We have workforce shortages in every category. We have all struggled to schedule a doctor’s appointment, a plumber, an accountant, or even a cleaning at the dentist,” Dassler-Alfheim said. “The purpose of these two bills is to help qualified students access the higher education needed to advance themselves and to fulfill the promise to Wisconsin employers to develop the workforce necessary to maintain and grow Wisconsin’s economy.”
Democratic lawmakers also circulated bill drafts meant to help support staff and faculty at UW system campuses. 
One would again allow most UW system employees, faculty and academic staff to collectively bargain over wages, hours, and conditions of employment. UW employees were stripped of that ability under the Walker-era law Act 10. 
Another bill would reverse changes made in the 2015 state budget that eliminated language in state statute that protected tenure. Lawmakers said in 2015 that the changes were necessary to give the UW system flexibility to deal with budget cuts, though faculty members said then that the changes were an attack on tenure. 
Emerson said it is getting harder to recruit people to work at the universities in the state and that some of the changes could help. 
“If we’re making these big changes about how universities are dealt with, staff and faculty need to have a seat at the table for having these conversations and having a seat at the table in meaningful ways where their concerns are addressed too,” Emerson said. 
Emerson noted that in recent years Republican lawmakers have pushed through proposals and deals that triggered pushback from faculty members. 
The most recent budget deal negotiated between lawmakers and Gov. Tony Evers included new work load requirements for UW faculty, mandating that they teach a minimum of 24 credits per academic year, or four 3-credit courses, starting in Sept. 2026. The requirement has garnered concerned reactions from faculty, some of who have said it could be difficult to balance teaching and research demands.
In 2023, Republican lawmakers negotiated with UW leaders to secure concessions on diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives in exchange for staff pay raises and money for buildings. The deal garnered a lot of pushback from staff and students at the time.
“You know, the workload requirements that came through the budget, or the DEI deal that happened last session, none of those would have happened if we had collective bargaining in place,” Emerson said. “Those are two things that when you have people who don’t work in an industry trying to put working parameters around that industry, it falls flat.”
Bills likely won’t advance in Republican Legislature
The Democratic proposals will face a difficult road in the Republican-led Legislature. Emerson said the likelihood for a public hearing on the Democratic bills is “slim to none.”
However, Emerson said Democratic lawmakers plan to take the ideas to people in the state other ways. She and some of her Democratic colleagues will be on the UW-Stevens Point campus this week to start a tour of campuses around the state. 
Emerson said the purpose is to have as many conversations with staff, faculty and students as possible. 
“If we’re not going to have a hearing in Madison on it, we are ready to take this around to other campuses and other parts of the state and have the conversation on the college campuses,” Emerson said. “I want to hear what matters to the students. I want to hear what, you know, the career people need their students to have to get jobs. I want to hear from the business people in these communities.”
Emerson said part of the goal is to also start laying the foundation for if Democrats win more legislative power in 2026. 
“It’s always good when you’re making policy about something that you’re talking to the people that this is going to impact, so this is what we’re really hoping to do — work out all the kinks, and dust everything off, and, hopefully, have a little bit more governing power coming up in the next session, and be able to really hit the ground running with some of these bills,” Emerson said.
Emerson said Democratic lawmakers’ approach is focused on figuring out how the state can make higher education available for “anybody no matter their zip code, no matter their income level,” and she expressed skepticism the Republican bills will do that. 
“A lot of the bills that I see coming from my Republican colleagues about higher education tend to either be punitive — one person said one thing on one campus, therefore we have to make sure nobody ever says that again and getting into these free speech pieces — or they’re doing things in a way that tells me that they haven’t been on a college campus for a really long time,” Emerson said.
The Senate Universities and Technical Colleges Committee is scheduled to have a public hearing on eight Republican-authored higher education-related bills Wednesday. 
One bill, coauthored by Sen. Andre Jacque (R-New Franken) and Rep. Dave Murphy (R-Hortonville), would place caps on annual tuition hikes. It was proposed in reaction to the 5% tuition increase that was approved after the recent state budget was completed. The increase was the third annual hike in a row. UW President Jay Rothman and UW regents had said the tuition increases would be necessary if the system didn’t secure enough funding from the state. 
In a memo about the bill, the Republican lawmakers said the Legislature needed to “implement a common sense law placing controls on these types of skyrocketing tuition increases” and that a cap on tuition increases would provide families with “the predictability required to budget for college expenses into the future.” Sen. Julian Bradley (R-New Berlin) has also argued that the bill is about “protecting affordability.” 
Under the bill, the UW Board of Regents would be prohibited from increasing undergraduate tuition by more than the consumer price index increase in a given year.
Emerson said she didn’t think the bill would have the intended effect of helping students and families afford school. She noted some of the effects seen during the decade-long tuition freeze implemented under the Walker administration. 
UW leaders said at the time that the freeze was unsustainable as it limited campuses ability to maintain its program and course offerings and wages for staff and faculty. 
“Students couldn’t get the classes that they needed… so people would sometimes have to go for an extra year to get all of the classes that they needed to complete their degree. It ended up costing people more because they had to stay in longer to get the one last requirement that they needed for their degree,” Emerson said. “It’s a good messaging point to say we’re gonna not increase [tuition] by a certain amount, but I don’t think that that has the end result that they’re thinking it does.”

Another agency, which previously occupied the now-vacant work areas within view of the door, relocated years ago. (Photo by Leslie Bonilla Muñiz/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Indiana’s top public access official has issued her first two advisory opinions — and resolved more than 30 other complaints for 2025 so far.
Public Access Counselor Jennifer Ruby made her opinion-writing debut with repeated reminders of recent limits on her powers. Lawmakers in 2024 narrowed the source material for the non-binding opinions to the “plain text” of public access laws and valid Indiana court rulings.
Ruby’s first months in office were marked by complaints of nonresponsiveness. Gov. Mike Braun’s office said that had to tackle a sizable backlog before looking at the current year’s cases.
In her first opinion, issued Sept. 24, Ruby weighed in on a dispute between one Hoosier and the New Carlisle Town Council over economic development project records.

Complainant Debra Durall sought information about water use for Amazon’s data center project — such as nondisclosure agreements and communications between a flurry of parties — and any agreements or communications about the completion of an electric vehicle battery plant under construction by General Motors and Samsung SDI.
Durall sent the town a records request late last year, on Dec. 6. The town’s attorney offered up limited documents on Jan. 2. That included a blank NDA, because the town didn’t have the signed copies, and a redacted copy of a utility service agreement.
The town didn’t have other documents she requested — like those involving officials working for the county or chamber of commerce — and said it had no agreements with GM or Samsung. It withheld other communications, citing confidential attorney work, ongoing negotiations and trade secrets.
Durall filed a formal complaint with Ruby’s office Jan. 29.
Ruby opined that Indiana law doesn’t require governments to create records they don’t have to satisfy records requests. She also defended the redactions — noting statute protects a utility customer’s confidential personal information — and the withholding of the other confidential information.
The Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission, for instance, has found that utility customer water usage data can be a confidential trade secret.
“Although Indiana statute only allows the (Office of the Public Access Counselor) to consider public access statutes and case law when issuing advisory opinions, Indiana case law provides that the IURC can be given wide discretion in matters within its jurisdiction,” Ruby wrote. “Therefore, it seems reasonable for the OPAC to consider an IURC opinion when determining whether water usage information has the characteristics outlined by Indiana case law and qualifies as trade secrets.”
She issued an opinion saying the town didn’t break public records law.
Open door dispute
A second opinion, from Oct. 2, involved a township official seemingly iced out by his own colleagues.
Green Township Board Chair George Coffey accused Township Trustee Jon Fletcher of violating meeting access laws — by not telling him soon enough about a Dec. 19 meeting that the board’s other two members had called.
Hoosiers are entitled to notice at least 48 hours before a public agency’s governing body meets. In his Jan. 9 complaint, Coffey said board members usually were notified by email, but that this time, a letter arrived in the mail on the day of the meeting.

Fletcher defended himself in responses to Ruby’s office. He argued Coffey had emailed asking if there was a meeting and that the township attorney had responded Dec. 18 with the date and time. Fletcher also included a photograph showing the letters to all three board members were mailed Dec. 16.
Ruby noted that U.S. mail often takes three-plus for delivery. She argued that that Coffey “was at a disadvantage” — the other two board members knew about the meeting since they’d called it — and that only Coffey was left “in the dark.”
The photograph itself, she added, “leads our office to believe that Respondent knew that mailing the notice and agenda would be an issue.”
She wrote that it’s “unlikely” that the mailed letter or the township attorney’s emailed response were sufficient as written notice — but added, “As the statute is silent on the timeline and method of delivery for written notice … I decline to define ‘sufficient written notice.'”
Ruby opined that Fletcher didn’t violate open door law but that the conduct “violates the spirit of” Indiana Code’s provisions for ad hoc, special meetings. She recommended that the township trustee and board consider adopting a policy to ensure that all board members get consistent notice.
PAC settles in
The opinions represent two of 34 cases that Ruby has resolved as of last week, according to office spokeswoman Stephanie McFarland.
“Resolved is a fluid term,” McFarland noted. “… Some complaints may have been withdrawn, some may have been rejected due to jurisdiction or pending litigation, or the complainant may have received their request or no longer needs it.”

“Receiving and resolving complaints is an ongoing process, so please continue to visit the page above throughout the year for published opinions,” McFarland wrote.
Braun appointed Ruby to the role in late March, after former PAC Luke Britt, who ran the office for about 12 years under previous Govs. Mike Pence and Eric Holcomb, resigned.
“I’d always said that if I found that my voice was getting ineffective, it was time to leave. And that might have been my sign with that legislation,” he told WFYI at the time. House Enrolled Act 1338 also made the PAC serve “at the pleasure of the governor.” Before, one could only be fired “for cause.”
One nonprofit, in July, opened a public access hotline to “alleviate the pressure” on the new PAC.

Rep. John Bear has tried to spin the $700,000 payment to a former librarian as a win for those who want to crack down on Wyoming libraries. We’re not buying it, writes columnist Kerry Drake.
The post Freedom Caucus won’t let a legal settlement stop its First Amendment assault appeared first on WyoFile .","Far-right Wyoming legislators tried during the past three sessions to pass laws to lock up librarians for allegedly making “obscene” books available to children. After that batch of outrageous bills failed, this interim session was devoted to trying to bankrupt school and public libraries that offend them.

Opinion

A draft bill that fined libraries a whopping $50,000 every time an employee made “sexually explicit” material available to a minor was lowered to $500 Monday by the Joint Judiciary Committee.
But while panel members who approved the heavily amended and confusing bill by an 11-2 vote congratulated themselves for a job well done, one of the dissenters pointed out the bill still infringes on parental control by making certain books unavailable to all children.
“You’re creating a bounty reward system where you’re encouraging people to file lawsuits against the library,” said Rep. Ken Chestek, D-Laramie. Such lawsuits would allow plaintiffs to be awarded damages and legal fees.
The bill requires public libraries to relocate books deemed sexually explicit into the adult section, but school libraries do not have adult sections. “This is straight-up book banning,” Chestek said. “No question about it.”
This bill is a way-off-the-charts effort in the state to censor and ban books that has its roots in a 2021 controversy in Gillette over a “Pride” display of LGBTQ-related books at the public library.
The library’s executive director, Terri Lesley, who stood up for the First Amendment and refused to remove the challenged books, was fired in 2023 by the Campbell County Public Library System Board of Trustees. Before her termination, Lesley told the board that working at the library was her dream job but the last two years were “pure hell.”
Lesley and her staff were branded as pornographers and pedophiles by some members of the public at board meetings, and one family went to local law enforcement to try to get her arrested for violating state obscenity laws. A special prosecutor determined no crimes were committed.
After she was fired, the library board voted to move the books featured in the Pride display and other challenged books to the adult section. It was an expensive “victory” for the far right.
Lesley sued for wrongful termination and reached a $700,000 settlement last week with Campbell County, its commission and six members of the library board. I think she deserved more.


It was vindication for the librarian and her supporters, but it apparently did nothing to deter the extremist Freedom Caucus from going after Wyoming libraries again.
Rep. John Bear, R-Gillette, is chairman emeritus of the Freedom Caucus that controls the House, and co-chair of the powerful Joint Appropriations Committee. His wife, Sage Bear, is one of the six Campbell County library board trustees Lesley sued.
In a text message to WyoFile, Bear defended the board’s action and obnoxiously claimed that Lesley “was more concerned about fleecing her prior employer than the supposed altruistic motive of standing up for LGBTQ rights.
“I don’t believe the county’s insurance company or their attorneys should have settled this case, but I understand the business decision to attempt to keep costs of frivolous litigation minimized,” Bear wrote. 
Amazingly, Freedom Caucus leaders like Bear portray themselves as both the victim and the victor whenever their side loses.
Bear whined that Lesley’s case is the reason Wyoming needs to reform its tort laws that govern civil cases, which supposedly allow liberals to file frivolous suits for damages.
Then Bear pretended that somehow the Campbell County Public Library won when it settled the suit.
“Gillette public libraries are the first in the nation to stop the left’s onslaught on the innocence of children by moving books that sexualize children to the adult section of the library,” Bear wrote. “Is $700,000 too much to pay to save our children?”
Lesley’s wrongful termination had absolutely nothing to do with saving children. It was about appeasing a group of people who do not want the LGBTQ community represented in the books available at the Gillette library. 
Our society doesn’t work that way. Public resources should be inclusive and open to diverse groups.
Parents have the right to determine what books their children read, and most school districts have policies that allow parents to “opt-in” and allow their child to read a controversial book. Legislators can’t allow one set of parents to decide what all children should read.
But that’s effectively what they’re attempting to do with their latest library bill. The Joint Judiciary Committee, at the urging of Rep. Jayme Lien, R-Casper, decided in June to draft a bill to ban sexually explicit material from children’s sections in libraries. 
This was a significant change in approach from previous Freedom Caucus bills, which sought to repeal the exemption librarians, educators and museum workers now have from being charged with obscenity crimes for performing their job duties.
Under the earlier bills, the state established that materials may be deemed obscene if the average person applying contemporary standards would find it appeals to the prurient interest. The work must also lack “serious literary, artistic, political or scientific value” to be obscene. 
The committee’s bill, however, covers “sexually explicit” material, going into graphic detail to list any sex acts between two or more people.
Bill supporters want to keep LGBTQ-related books off the children’s shelves, especially ones aimed at the far-right’s favorite target, transgender individuals. These banned books would be unavailable to the people they were written for, teens who may be struggling with their own gender identity and want information.
Opponents say the bill would force libraries to move into the adult section all educational material about puberty and sex, historical books like “The Diary of Anne Frank,” and religious texts like the Bible, Quran and Book of Mormon.
Allowing libraries to be sued for allowing a book in the children’s section that describes any sex act, no matter the context, would have a chilling effect on libraries’ book purchases. What library official would take a chance ordering a book that has been challenged anywhere that could cause economic harm to the entire library and its staff, plus deprive patrons of their First Amendment right to decide what to read?
Before going to the polls during next year’s primary elections, do your homework. Research which candidates have voted to make libraries effectively ban books for fear of retaliation, or allow parents to make reading decisions for other people’s kids. Then vote them out.
Do it in the name of Terri Lesley. Do it in the name of all defenders of the First Amendment.

Jim Pillen before his press conference at St. Teresa Catholic School in Lincoln on Sept. 29, 2025. (Juan Salinas II/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — As Nebraska moves forward in converting a McCook state prison into an ICE detention center, concerns grow about the Governor’s Office stonewalling public requests seeking more about what is going on.
By late September, Gov. Jim Pillen’s office had denied at least nine public records requests asking for information about the state’s negotiations with the federal government regarding the McCook Work Ethic Camp, records obtained by the Nebraska Examiner indicate. Additionally, there’s evidence that broader requests on the subject have also been denied, although some state agencies, including the prison system, have released some records.
These denials raised the eyebrows of local activists and legal experts who say they are suspicious that potentially thousands of public records could be withheld under the governor’s justifications. Though there is little evidence of wrongdoing, the lack of information on a subject that involves a state prison and state funds makes some believe the state has something to hide.
“Whether or not they file an open records request, people are calling out for this information and are entitled to understand what their government is doing in their name,” said Jennifer Houlden, acting legal director for the American Civil Liberties Union of Nebraska. “The interest in obscuring that information completely … is really suspect, and the motivation for that needs to be questioned.”

Meanwhile, Nebraska is well underway in transitioning the McCook property into a jail that holds migrant detainees for the U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s Immigration and Customs Enforcement. A spokesperson for the Nebraska Department of Correctional Services said just over 60 of the 180 men the camp typically holds remained housed there as of Oct. 8.
Charlie McPherson, executive director with the McCook Economic Development Corp., said his team is “keeping eyes and ears open for more information,” and hasn’t gotten any fresh info from the city or state. “Just sitting tight.” He said driving by the camp, he noticed fencing work being done.
Talks between state officials and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security about the Work Ethic Camp have been going since at least late March, according to documents the government watchdog group Common Cause Nebraska acquired from the Department of Corrections.
News of the plan broke in late August. In early September, Pillen administration staffers revealed in a closed-door briefing that state officials initiated conversations with the federal government regarding the possibility of helping ICE.
At the time, State Sen. Wendy DeBoer of Bennington said she was told state leaders expect a written agreement between Nebraska and the federal government to be completed within 60 days.
Though it’s still within the 60-day window, State Sen. Terrell McKinney of Omaha said he’s heard from several sources that the state has already signed the contract and is waiting for a federal response. There has been no official confirmation as yet. Homeland Security operations continue during a government shutdown that could limit some ICE actions.
The Nebraska Examiner filed a public records request of its own Sept. 5 for communications between Pillen, his staff, and Homeland Security officials about the deal. The Governor’s Office responded to the request Sept. 18, well past the four-day deadline laid out in statute for how long state agencies have to respond.
In its response, the office denied the request based on four justifications:

The documents requested constitute “proprietary or commercial information.”
The documents requested constitute “negotiation records for the lease or sale of an interest in real property.”
The documents requested constitute “confidential communications.”
Cited a statute outlining the rules for lawyer-client privilege.

The Examiner sent a follow-up request on Sept. 22 seeking how the Governor’s Office responded to related requests from others. The office requested an extension and fulfilled the request on Oct. 8.
The state’s response revealed nine records requests made about Work Ethic Camp negotiations between Aug. 21 to Sept. 5, including the Examiner’s. All were denied, and seven of the nine were denied with virtually identical reasonings — those listed above. The requests were made by a range of individuals, including reporters, private citizens and State Sen. Megan Hunt of Omaha.

But the state’s justifications for denying the requests are questionable, according to multiple legal experts who spoke with the Examiner, including Houlden and Daniel Gutman, a lawyer who has litigated several public records disputes. Houlden said she believes the exceptions government agencies are granted under law are being applied more broadly than they ought to be.
“(The governor’s office) tends to blur lines when it comes to interpretations,” said Gavin Geis, executive director of Common Cause Nebraska.
Geis argued that the first two justifications treat the dealings between two public bodies — the Nebraska state government and the federal government — as though both are private businesses. Houlden noted the exact language of one of the cited statutes grants an exception for records that would “give advantage to business competitors and serve no public purpose” if they were made public, which makes her believe that the exception should not apply.
Houlden said the second justification contradicts previous public statements state officials have made that Nebraska will continue to own and operate the McCook facility.
Both Houlden and Gutman said the exceptions allowing government agencies to withhold public records are meant to be narrowly interpreted. Though Gutman said this isn’t a legally binding principle, there is a legal obligation for state officials to “understand and apply the exceptions in light of a broader public policy that favors disclosure.”
The Governor’s Office declined an interview for this story but sent a written statement.
“The Governor’s Office has responded to all record requests submitted about WEC and its transition to becoming a federal detention center,” Pillen spokesperson Laura Strimple wrote. “The process followed was the same as for any record request. Records have been provided to each requestor within the scope of law, which also allows for withholding information that meets specific exceptions.”
Gutman equated questionable public records responses to “the chicken or the egg” paradox, because while there is cause to suspect the Governor’s Office is withholding records that should be public, there is no way to know for certain without seeing the records being withheld.
There are legitimate reasons to withhold government records, Gutman said. The question is: Do those reasons apply to the potentially thousands of records that pertain to the WEC negotiations? Gutman said he thinks that’s unlikely.
Nebraska law treats most public documents as public records. According to the Attorney General’s Office, exceptions to the state’s public records statutes include personal information on students, medical records other than about births or deaths, trade secrets, investigatory records, vulnerabilities involving public property, firearms registration information and cybersecurity info.
A common obstacle that dissatisfied records requesters face: There is little to no recourse when they believe public records law has been violated. The main option is suing in Lancaster District Court, which Gutman said at best can take two to three months to resolve, or longer if the state appeals.
The state also recommends requesters petition the Attorney General’s Office for a review if they believe an error was made in their response.
In comparison to other states, Gutman said Nebraska has far fewer lawsuits challenging public records requests.

State Sen. Machaela Cavanaugh of Omaha, a vocal critic of the governor and other state agencies, said she believes Pillen’s office is banking on the assumption that most people won’t take them to court.
Cavanaugh acknowledged that hesitation over public records requests is not a problem specific to Pillen’s administration but argued it has gotten worse since he took office. Former governor turned U.S. Sen. Pete Ricketts, R-Neb., didn’t make the process easy, but he returned requests and allowed room for negotiations, she said.
When reached by the Examiner, McCook City Council members said they agreed to direct all questions on the McCook conversion to Molly Smith, a city spokesperson who did not return calls. McCook Mayor Linda Taylor also did not return calls.
State Sen. David Murman, whose legislative district includes McCook, said he had no fresh update. He supports the project and President Trump’s efforts to secure the border, he said, and believes many of his constituents do also.
Cavanaugh, along with fellow Appropriations Committee member State Sen. Ashlei Spivey of Omaha, requested that the committee hold a public briefing to better understand the transition process and its financial implications for the state. They were denied by committee chair State Sen. Rob Clements of Elmwood, who said there will be opportunity to discuss the topic when the Legislature reconvenes in January.
Judiciary Committee Chair State Sen. Carolyn Bosn of Lincoln also has denied requests for public hearings about the Work Ethic Camp.
The Urban Affairs Committee, chaired by McKinney, held a public hearing in September at the Capitol, which drew a large enough crowd that it required an overflow area. This is part of the “far-reaching consequences” Geis said come with withholding information on matters of high public interest. It limits the opportunities for voters to make informed decisions.
On the flip side, he said, it also keeps voters in the dark about good decisions their government is making. In this way, Geis argued Pillen could benefit from being more forthcoming.
“When they close the door, we can only assume that what’s happening back there is not to our benefit,” Geis said.

On Sept. 30, the Idaho Public Utilities Commission issued a decision approving new reimbursement rates called export credit rates that Idaho Power pays its rooftop solar customers. 
In April, Idaho Power officials applied for a larger decrease in the reimbursement rate. 
But the commission, which regulates utility companies in Idaho, approved a smaller decrease in the reimbursement rates after expressing concern about the impact on rooftop solar customers.
“The commission recognized that all customers have faced increases to their average monthly bills over the past 18 months, and the proposed update to the (export credit rate) would further affect customers in Schedules 6, 8 and 84,” the Idaho Public Utilities Commission said in a news release issued Oct. 2.
The new decreased reimbursement applies to about 14,000 Idaho Power customers who had rooftop solar systems or other on-site generation systems installed after Dec. 20, 2020. Customers who had a rooftop solar system, or other system installed before Dec. 20, 2020, are considered legacy customers and are not subject to the new reimbursement rate, officials said. 
Rooftop solar systems are the most common type of on-site generation systems among Idaho Power customers, but other types of on-site generation systems include wind and power systems, officials said. 
Idaho Power is a Boise-based electric utility company that serves more than 650,000 customers. About 20,000 Idaho Power customers have a rooftop solar system, a company spokesman said.
The decreased reimbursement rate that Idaho Power is paying its rooftop solar customers comes as Idaho Power is also seeking to increase the rates it charges its electricity customers by $199 million, or 13%, the Idaho Capital Sun previously reported. 
The Idaho Public Utilities Commission is accepting public comment on the proposed rate increase for residential electricity customers though Nov. 20.  
 



 Reimbursement rates Idaho Power requested vs. approximate rates the Idaho Public Utilities Commission approved


Summer peak rates: 14.0598 cents per kilowatt hour vs 15.68 cents per kilowatt hour
Summer off-peak rates: 1.7682 cents per kilowatt hour vs 3.39 cents per kilowatt hour
Non summer rates: 0.9540 cents per kilowatt hour vs 2.9 cents per kilowatt hour.

 Why did Idaho Power want to change the reimbursement rate it pays rooftop solar customers?

Idaho Power Communications Specialist Jordan Rodriguez said the company sought the change in reimbursement rates to more accurately reflect energy costs and avoid overcompensating rooftop solar customers.
Rodriguez said that in the beginning, rooftop solar customers were compensated for excess energy they pushed back on the grid at the same retail rate that customers paid per kilowatt hours on their electric bills. 
Rodriquez said the problem with that is the full reimbursement rate did not take into account expenses Idaho Power has for providing power to its customers, like maintaining and operating the grid and employing the people who operate it.
“When some customers are being overcompensated with the full retail rate credit, the difference is made up by the rest of our customers, 98% of which do not have rooftop solar or other on-site generation,” Rodriguez said, adding that Idaho Power followed the process the Idaho Public Utilities Commission put in place for updating rates.  
 Idaho Power’s application to change rooftop solar rates received widespread opposition

Idaho Power’s proposal to decrease compensation rates for rooftop solar customers was met with widespread public opposition from rooftop solar customers, environmental groups and Idaho residents. 
Several customers who use rooftop solar systems filed written comments urging the Idaho Public Utilities Commission to reject the change in reimbursement rates.
“My household made the decision to invest in solar panels because we believe in the power of clean energy,” Boise customer Wayne Rysavy wrote to the Idaho Public Utilities Commission in May. “We wanted to harness Idaho’s abundant sunshine, lower our long-term energy costs and do our part to reduce reliance on energy sources that are less environmentally friendly. Idaho Power’s proposal not only threatens the value of that investment, it also sends the wrong message to families and individuals trying to make responsible energy choices.”
Others agreed.
“Considering the urgency of climate change, it would greatly help to encourage solar panels rather than disincentivizing them,” Sandpoint customer Gabrielle Duebendorfer wrote to state regulators in June.
The city of Boise filed public comments asking the Idaho Public Utilities Commission not to approve Idaho Power’s proposed decrease and instead set rates that are fair and affordable and consider the long-term impact on customers who invested in solar systems. 
The Sierra Club, which publicly opposed decreasing the rooftop solar reimbursement rates, said there were nearly 1,000 written comments filed in opposition to Idaho Power’s application. 
“Even though we’re opposed to these solar rate changes, we appreciate the adjustments the PUC made to Idaho Power’s original proposal to help reduce the impact on customer power bills,” Lisa Young, director of the Idaho Chapter of the Sierra Club, said in a written statement. “Energy affordability is an increasingly important issue in Idaho, and the PUC has a key role to play in ensuring that our monopoly utilities don’t unfairly raise our bills. We will continue pushing the PUC to listen to Idaho ratepayers and prioritize fair rates moving forward.”
Following the Idaho Public Utilities Commission’s order, the change went into effect on Oct. 1. As part of its decision, the Idaho Public Utilities Commission also paused updates to the reimbursement rates until 2028, officials said.

(Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)Hunter Demster pulled out his phone at a gas station in Memphis to record over half a dozen men in bulletproof vests gathered around the flashing blue lights of a Tennessee Highway Patrol car. 
Then one of those officers stepped forward and told him to stand 25 feet away because he was violating a new Tennessee law that allows police to create a buffer zone for any of their interactions, according to video reviewed by the Lookout.
“They are explicitly trying to remove accountability for police across the state,” said Demster, a leader with the group Free the 901, a coalition of advocacy groups organizing against federal and state law enforcement’s presence in Memphis.
At the end of September, President Donald Trump and Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee established the “Memphis Safe Task Force” that brought in an additional 700 law enforcement officers, according to a report by the Daily Memphian. The task force includes a combination of federal and state agencies, like U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the ATF, the FBI, the Tennessee Highway Patrol, the state National Guard and more.
The heightened presence of enforcement comes with little detail from officials about the task force’s exact orders and their operational areas.
In an executive order issued by Trump on Sept. 15, the president said the objective of the task was to “end street and violent crime in Memphis to the greatest possible extent,” adding they would accomplish this through “hypervigilant policing, aggressive prosecution, complex investigations, financial enforcement, and large-scale saturation of besieged neighborhoods with law enforcement personnel.”
National Guard members were seen patrolling a popular commercial area after arriving in Memphis on Friday and there have been reports of an increase in immigration raids and stop-and-frisk policing.

What is the buffer law?
In 2025, Tennessee lawmakers passed the buffer law, allowing law enforcement officers engaged in official duties at a traffic stop, crime scene or “an ongoing and immediate threat to public safety” to create the 25-foot zone even if the person in question doesn’t pose a safety risk or is not obstructing law enforcement.
Anyone in violation of the law can be charged with a misdemeanor. 
The Tennessee law is similar to those passed in Indiana and Louisiana, which two federal courts have ruled unconstitutional due to the laws’ vague nature in allowing police broad discretion to create buffer zones. 
Both states are appealing the decisions. 
In Tennessee, seven news organizations filed a federal lawsuit arguing that the law grants law enforcement officers limitless authority to bar journalists and the public from reporting on protests and other newsworthy events. The Lookout is a plaintiff in the lawsuit.
Demster has been told at least three times by law enforcement working with the Memphis Safe Task Force that he must remain at least 25 feet away from police interactions, according to videos reviewed by the Lookout.
“The second I walked up with a camera, that’s the first words out of their mouths,” he said.

[…]","Gov. Bill Lee applauds after signing a universal school voucher measure into law on Feb. 12, 2025. (Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout) Key Tennessee lawmakers are taking different views toward Gov. Bill Lee’s desire to expand the state’s new private-school voucher program. 
House Speaker Cameron Sexton is gung-ho about an increase, saying he wants to double the number of students who receive the state funds when lawmakers return to the Capitol in 2026, according to Chalkbeat Tennessee.
But Lt. Gov. Randy McNally declined to say he supports such an increase in the program and was leery about the impact on the state budget.
“I anticipate there will be legislation to augment the current Education Freedom Scholarship program next session. While there is clearly an appetite to expand, until we start examining the overall budget and revenue numbers it would be premature to commit to any specific scope,” McNally, a former Senate finance committee chairman, said in a Monday statement.
Vouchers worth $7,300 each for 20,000 students are costing the state $144 million in the program’s first year. Doubling that amount could prove difficult as the legislature tries to buoy the budget amid two years of business tax reductions and rebates. Lawmakers also approved one-year bonuses for public school teachers to try to gain their support before a tight vote during a January special session.
The state received 42,000 applications for the voucher funds this year but couldn’t award all of them because of a cap on the number of recipients. Of those 20,000, half went to families without an income limit, and half were designated for students from families with incomes at 300% of the free or reduced-price lunch guidelines, more than $173,000 for a family of four.
Nearly two-thirds of the vouchers went to students in five counties, Shelby (3,738), Knox (2,924), Hamilton (2,458), Davidson (1,684) and Williamson (876), according to the Tennessee Journal.
The Department of Education is declining to release the number of private-school students who received the money, saying that information wasn’t required from applicants.
Lee was surrounded by students from private schools in the Capitol when he signed the measure into law this year, leading critics of the legislation to call it a private-school “subsidy.”
The governor, in contrast, said recently he is satisfied the vouchers were “widespread” as the state awarded them to students attending 200 of 220 schools that qualified for the program. 
“The only thing I’m not happy with is that we don’t have more scholarships to give to more income-limited, low-income families and families that aren’t limited in their income,” Lee said.
The governor added that because of the large number of applications, he hopes to persuade the legislature to “provide more scholarships to Tennessee families” when lawmakers return for the 2026 session.
The law contains a provision already allowing lawmakers to add 5,000 students to the program if the number of applications hits 75% of the number of vouchers available.
Lee, whose term runs out in January 2027, wasn’t specific about how much he would like to see the program expand. But Sexton’s spokesperson, Connor Grady, said the speaker is committed to “at least doubling” the number of available vouchers to meet student demand, Chalkbeat reported.
Nashville Rep. John Ray Clemmons, chairman of the House Democratic Caucus, criticized the move Monday, saying the voucher program is expected to have its biggest impact on the budget in two to three years when the state is committed to paying for more students to attend private schools and public schools lose enrollment.
“Bill Lee has lost his damn mind,” Clemmons said in a statement. “Our state is teetering on the edge of a fiscal cliff due to Lee and Republicans’ fiscal recklessness and now he wants to double the size of the most expensive and unpopular Republican welfare program in recent history.”
Clemmons, who recently toured the state, said officials from multiple rural areas told him the voucher program and other “irresponsible schemes” are causing job cuts and property tax increase proposals.

Aurora voters in November will choose from among a dozen council candidates. (Quentin Young/Colorado Newsline)Backed by conservative dark money groups, Republicans in Colorado’s third-largest city are looking to expand their council majority in the 2025 off-year election.

 Election 2025
Coloradans are voting on two statewide ballot measures and a variety of local issues in the off-year election. Click here for more of Newsline’s coverage.

Though Aurora’s elections are officially nonpartisan, slates of Republican-affiliated candidates led by Mayor Mike Coffman, a former GOP member of Congress, have solidified their grip on city politics in recent years — even as the sprawling, diverse suburb east of Denver became an unlikely target of national attention over false and exaggerated claims of immigrant gang activity.
Candidates up for reelection in 2025 include at-large Council member Danielle Jurinsky, whose tales of a “complete gang takeover” of Aurora were instrumental in drawing President Donald Trump to the city for a high-profile 2024 campaign stop. Trump, Jurinsky and other far-right figures painted a sensational picture of the influence of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua in Aurora, where police have described the gang’s presence as “isolated” and relatively small, and crime rates, consistent with national trends, have trended downward since 2022.
Jurinsky and four other conservative Aurora City Council candidates are backed by Building Aurora’s Future, an independent expenditure committee that has raised a combined $295,000 this year from Advance Colorado and Our Community Our Future, two dark money groups that do not disclose their donors.

Advance Colorado is a prominent conservative group that funds anti-tax ballot measures and other Republican-aligned causes in Colorado politics.
Our Community Our Future is a nonprofit incorporated in Colorado in 2023. In tax filings, it lists former Aurora City Council member Charlie Richardson as its lone board member. Its bare-bones website consists of a single sentence describing the group as seeking to “advance the mission of community building,” and a stock photo titled “Group of people support unity arm around together.”
No Democratic-aligned groups have reported any expenditures on behalf of Aurora municipal candidates this year.
Ballots began going out by mail Oct. 10 to all active registered voters in Colorado. The state’s coordinated 2025 election features two statewide ballot measures, Proposition LL and Proposition MM. Depending on where they live, voters will also be asked to weigh in on such items as local ballot issues, city council races, and school board races.
Voters who receive a mail ballot can return it through the mail, deposit it in a secure ballot drop box, or drop it off at an in-person polling location. County clerks in Colorado’s 64 counties oversee elections in their jurisdictions, and information about ballot drop box and in-person service locations is available at local county clerks’ websites.
Overall, 12 candidates are vying for five City Council seats in Aurora’s 2025 municipal election. Voters will also have the final say on five citywide measures referred to the ballot by council members.
 At-Large seats
Five candidates are running for two at-large seats, including the two incumbents: Jurinsky, who was elected to her seat in 2021, and Amsalu Kassaw, a Republican-affiliated member appointed to fill a vacancy on council by its conservative majority last year.
Kassaw is an Ethiopian immigrant who works for The GEO Group, a private prison company that operates the Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention facility in Aurora. Jurinsky and Kassaw are part of the slate backed by Building Aurora’s Future, and both lead the field of at-large candidates in individual fundraising, having received $250,740 and $101,908 in contributions, respectively, as of Sept. 30.
Two Democratic-affiliated candidates, Rob Andrews and Alli Jackson, have received endorsements from a long list of progressive groups and Democratic elected officials. Andrews, president of the nonprofit job-training service CommunityWorks, has raised $45,262, according to campaign finance disclosures. Jackson, a social worker, has raised $15,114.
An independent candidate, Community College of Aurora instructor Watson Gomes, has raised $610.
 Ward I
Three candidates are running for the Ward I seat being vacated by progressive Council member Crystal Murillo. Ward I is centered on the East Colfax corridor in northwest Aurora.
Murillo, who was elected in 2021 with 56% of the vote, has endorsed Gianina Horton, a former executive director of the Denver Justice Project. Horton also has the backing of the Colorado Working Families Party, Colorado People’s Action, Conservation Colorado and other progressive groups and elected officials.
Stephen Elkins, a product development manager for a data center business, is the conservative slate’s pick for the Ward I seat and has received support from Building Aurora’s Future.
Reid Hettich, a pastor at Mosaic Church of Aurora, is also running for the Ward I seat.
 Ward II
Incumbent Council member Steve Sundberg, a Republican, is running for reelection in Ward II, which encompasses Aurora’s sprawling northeastern quarter, extending as far as Denver International Airport to the north and the town of Bennett to the east.
Sundberg is part of the conservative slate supported by Building Aurora’s Future. He won his seat with a 48% plurality of the vote in a four-way race in 2021.
His lone challenger in 2025, Amy Wiles, is backed by Democratic elected officials and progressive groups including the Colorado AFL-CIO, the Colorado Working Families Party and Moms Demand Action.
 Ward III
Incumbent Council member Ruben Medina, a Democrat, is running for reelection in Ward III, which includes much of central Aurora along its border with Denver to the west. Medina narrowly won election to his seat with 51% of the vote in a head-to-head race in 2021.
His 2025 challenger is Marsha Berzins, a conservative who previously held the Ward III seat for 12 years before she was term-limited in 2021. Berzins is part of the conservative slate and has received support from Building Aurora’s Future.
 Ballot questions
Alongside the City Council races, Aurora voters will vote on five citywide ballot questions, referred by council members earlier this year.

Ballot Question 3B would amend the city charter to use gender-neutral language.
Ballot Question 3C would amend the city’s process for filling council vacancies, requiring special elections to fill any vacancy that occurs one year or more before the next election for the seat in question.
Ballot Question 3D proposes to eliminate the requirement that Aurora’s city manager must reside within city limits.
Ballot Question 3E would remove the city charter’s prohibition on elected city officials simultaneously holding another elected office.
Ballot Question 3F would amend the charter to allow at-large council seats and ward council seats to count as separate offices for the purposes of term limits.

Some Aurora residents within a designated area along East Colfax Avenue will vote on two ballot measures to create and fund a new downtown development authority, a taxing district to foster economic development along the corridor.

West Virginia Health Right’s annual #WeCareWV Day will be 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. Saturday, Oct. 18 at its East End clinic, 1520 Washington Street East in Charleston, West Virginia. 
During the pop-up clinic, volunteer medical and dental professionals will provide free teeth cleaning, fillings, eye exams and glasses, hearing screenings and other medical and dental care. 
This is the second year Health Right has hosted the event on its own. In previous years, the free and charitable clinic partnered with Remote Area Medical to offer an annual two-day free pop-up clinic. 
West Virginia Health Right typically provides care to about 46,000 people annually who don’t have insurance and make below 250% of the federal poverty level. On Saturday, no one attending the clinic will need to prove their income or that they don’t have health insurance, CEO Angie Settle said. 
“We understand there are people out there that have insurance, and they have deductibles and copays and things that are preventing them from getting that care,” she said. “So we don’t want anything like that to get in the way that day.”
Last year, the clinic treated more than 500 people during the event.  
Settle said vision and dental care are big needs in the community. Last year, the clinic treated many people for medical problems too, she said. 
“Even people that have insurance, sometimes it doesn’t cover preventative exams and things like that,” she said. “So it’s really important that [people] have this opportunity. We have people that come every year and they use it as their preventive service, because things are so expensive.” 
Settle said the clinic will see as many people as it can Saturday based on the number of volunteers who help. As of Monday, between 250 and 300 people have signed up to volunteer, she said. The clinic is always looking for more, she said. 
“It’s everything from nurses, doctors, pharmacists, dentists, eye doctors — you name it,” Settle said. “Lay people, lots of kids in the community, like high school kids, are wanting to volunteer, especially those interested in the medical field.
“It’s a great opportunity, I think, for everybody to get out and really get to know their community and understand that there’s real need,” Settle said.

(Photo by John Gray/Verite News)Louisiana’s first alternative program to certify teachers of English learners will seek final approval Wednesday from the Board of Elementary and Secondary Education in hopes of addressing a shortage of teachers serving the state’s growing English learning student population.
TeachNOLA is an alternative teacher preparation program that recruits locally, providing certification pathways for teaching and special education. If approved, the TeachNOLA program would provide a more affordable way for teachers to become certified to teach English language learners, compared to traditional certification courses housed in universities.
The initiative comes as the Trump administration rolls back education and support programming for students, leaving much of the burden to train educators for English learners to states.
The state has seen some of the largest growth across the country in the number of English language learners it serves, according to a recent report from the National Council on Teacher Quality. The number of English language learners in the greater New Orleans area has also grown in recent years, with 13% of New Orleans students and 39% of Jefferson Parish students identifying as Hispanic as of the 2023-24 school year.
Schools haven’t kept up with that growth rate, said Angela Ramirez, the executive director of Latine youth support group Puentes New Orleans.
Ramirez has noticed that local districts don’t have enough teachers who are trained to provide education to English learners, and that resources for such students can be scarce. Ramirez said that ESL programs are not effectively staffed or implemented to actually create a difference in outcome for Spanish-speaking students.
In 2023, only 33% of English-learning students graduated from high school in New Orleans, compared to a 77% overall district graduation rate.
“[English learners] still need that culturally responsive teaching and advising, and some of the schools are not able to provide that, and that has to do with a shortage of bilingual teachers and advisors,” Ramirez said.
Hiring rates for New Orleans public school teachers have increased recently, but two months after the beginning of the school year, the NOLA Public Schools district still had a shortage of 83 teachers. About a third of those vacancies were in specialized roles, with 18 openings in special education and nine in teaching English learners.
If approved, the new program will launch at the beginning of next school year and follow the blueprint TeachNOLA has for its other certification courses, which include a yearlong residency program and mentoring opportunities. The program will be fully online to be accessible to interested educators across the state.
All of TeachNOLA’s programs cost around $4,700, but many teachers only pay around $200 after state and private scholarships, Pereda said. Some districts and charter operators subsidize certification for teachers. A traditional certification pathway for teaching English learners at Tulane University can cost over $6,000.
Milton Pereda, the senior manager of instruction at TeachNOLA, said that the alternative certification is an effective tool at retaining teachers.
“TeachNOLA recruits local people, because we know one of the big factors of staying is feeling like you’re connected to a school community, which also means you’re connected to the city that you live and work in,” Pereda said.
Still, low pay continues to be an issue nationwide for specialized teachers, including those who are trained to work with English learning students.
The report from the National Council on Teacher Quality recommended that Louisiana provide differential pay of at least $5,000 and expand scholarships and loan forgiveness to recruit and retain specialized educators.
Many teachers for English language learners, Ramirez said, burn out and start teaching elsewhere or leave education altogether.
“If you are a talented bilingual teacher, you’re going to have plenty of opportunities, you’re going to have plenty of offers, and unfortunately we end up losing some of our best talent,” Ramirez said. “And the ones that have stayed are immensely attached or immensely devoted to these kids.”

Republished with ProPublica’s permission.
On a sweltering morning in Vidalia, Louisiana, Shannan Cornwell and Freddie Green got in a long line to wait for food.
The couple has struggled to pay for groceries amid soaring prices and health setbacks, they said. She had back surgery. He had undergone cancer treatment.
They turned to a local food bank to supplement their diets. Although they’re grateful for the food, lately they’ve noticed changes in what they receive. For months in the spring and summer their pickups did not include any meat, Cornwell said.
“You have to learn how to adapt to what you have,” Green said. “Which is hard,” Cornwell added.
In the spring, the Trump administration abruptly cut $500 million in deliveries from a program that sends U.S.-produced meat, dairy, eggs and produce to food banks and other organizations across the country — about a quarter of the funding the program received in 2024. The items that were delivered through The Emergency Food Assistance Program were some of the healthiest, most expensive items that organizations distribute.

The cancellation of these deliveries comes at a critical time for food banks. Food insecurity is higher than at any time since the aftermath of the Great Recession, according to federal data, and many food banks are reporting higher need than they saw at the peak of the pandemic. Demand is only expected to increase; this summer, President Donald Trump signed into law the largest cut to food stamps in the program’s history.
ProPublica obtained records from the Department of Agriculture of each planned delivery in 2025, detailing the millions of pounds of food, down to the number of eggs, that never reached hungry people because of the administration’s cut.
The cancellations began in mid-May, when over 100 orders of 2% milk bound for 31 states were halted.
The records show 4,304 canceled deliveries between May and September across the 50 states, Puerto Rico and D.C. (Experience this as an interactive story on ProPublica’s website.)



				According to the data, North Carolina lost out on 97 canceled shipments of requested food aid. That amounts to 2,921,900 pounds, or 1,461 tons.			


All told, the deliveries accounted for nearly 94 million pounds of food. The true loss is likely greater, food banks said, because not all of the year’s deliveries had been scheduled.
Most food banks rely on a combination of federal or state dollars, private giving and partnerships with businesses that donate leftover food. While the cancellations were disruptive to all food banks, according to their representatives, those that receive state funding or have strong community support said that they have weathered the cuts better than others.
The Food Bank of Central Louisiana, where Cornwell and Green’s groceries come from, gets more than half of its food from the federal government and receives very little state support. It serves rural areas of Louisiana, which has the highest poverty rate in the nation, according to U.S. census data.
The Trump administration canceled 10 orders for the food bank totaling over $400,000 of pork, chicken, cheese, dried cranberries, dried plums, milk and eggs, records show. The food bank has struggled to keep up with demand following the cuts and a decrease in private donations. Staff told ProPublica they used to distribute 25-pound packages of food, but over the summer, some packages shrank to about half of that weight.

“We’re not turning people away with no food. It’s not to that point,” said Jayne Wright-Velez, who has been the executive director at the food bank for 30 years. “But people are getting less food when they come to us.”
The organization has tried to fill the gap with produce donations, but transporting and distributing fruits and vegetables is challenging, and multiple patrons told ProPublica the produce had gone bad by the time they received it.
On a recent morning, Codie Dufrene, 23, came to collect food for her grandfather and his neighbors, who live 45 minutes from the closest grocery store.
Usually, the trunk of Dufrene’s car would be full. Not lately.
Dufrene received chicken for the first time “since way before the summer.” But the poultry came from a donation that hardly made up for the 74,000 pounds of chicken that never arrived in June.
She said that though her family is grateful and will use whatever they get, the quality of the food can be discouraging. Dufrene pointed out the condition of a cantaloupe she received. “You can tell — they’re frozen and they’re already super, super soft.” She said her mother would likely give them to her pigs, “because people can’t really eat those.”
Wright-Velez said the food bank trains its staff on food safety and does its best to check everything before it goes out, but it’s difficult to do at a large scale. “Especially in the heat of the summer, things just go bad so quickly,” she said. “The clock’s ticking as soon as we get the donation.”
The Emergency Food Assistance Program was created in 1983 to purchase farmers’ surplus food and distribute it to low-income people. The program’s budget is typically authorized every five years as part of the Farm Bill, but in 2018, the first Trump administration added funds to help farmers struggling under retaliatory tariffs the U.S. faced amid trade disputes. The additional, discretionary federal funds helped food banks serve more people; last fiscal year, they got nearly twice as much money from the fund as they did from their congressional allocation.
Now characterizing the additional funding as a “Biden-era slush fund,” the second Trump administration cut $500 million that had already been allocated. The government is still distributing food through other parts of the program, but food banks were caught off guard by the canceled deliveries because it’s rare for funding to be cut mid-year. Food bank managers, some with decades of experience, couldn’t recall a disruption like it. With the Farm Bill slated for renewal this fall, officials who run food banks worry that any additional cuts would cause them to have to scale back the number of people they serve.
Already the need is greater than what food banks have on hand, said Shannon Oliver, the director of operations at the Oregon Food Bank.
“We’re having to kind of prepare for the fact that there’s just not going to be enough food, and having to be clear with setting the expectation that we’re doing everything we possibly can,” she said.
The USDA did not respond to questions or requests for comment. In a May letter responding to senators’ concerns about the funding cut, the agency said it had made additional food purchases through another program and that the emergency food program continues to operate “as originally intended by Congress.”
“While the pandemic is over, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) has not and will not lose focus on its core mission of strengthening food security, supporting agricultural markets, and ensuring access to nutritious foods,” the letter said.
### The Need Continues to Grow
By 8 a.m., the line in the parking lot of a library in Albuquerque, New Mexico, snaked around a chain-link fence. People had been waiting for hours to pick up groceries from Roadrunner Food Bank, which lost about 850,000 pounds of food to the funding cut, according to USDA records. As a result, people are receiving less dairy, meat and other high-protein items.
New Mexico consistently ranks among the poorest states in the nation, and it has more food bank distribution sites than full-service grocery stores, according to data provided by the USDA and Roadrunner Food Bank. And in recent months, organizers have noticed more people showing up than usual.

“They’re having to run from place to place to place to try to stitch together enough coverage for their family,” said Katy Anderson, a vice president at the food bank.
Vivian Santiago, 54, pieces together what she can from food-distribution sites across Albuquerque. She also uses her benefits from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program to feed her daughter and 9-year-old granddaughter. Lately her electronic benefits card isn’t lasting even halfway through the month because of the increase in grocery prices, which have risen nearly 30% since February 2020, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
“It’s hard out there,” she said.
Patricia Parker, 42, suffers from kidney failure and receives disability benefits.
Parker has been homeless for about six months, sometimes sleeping in her car or staying with friends. She’s looking for a job after a recent stint at a laundromat didn’t work out. As she carried Doritos, green grapes, potatoes and onions from the Albuquerque food bank, she said she appreciates the help.

“I won’t have to go days without food,” she said.
Workers at food banks and pantries said that the canceled deliveries add to the growing challenges they face. Many staff members said they had seen a decline in private contributions and volunteers. Grocery stores and food manufacturers, which started managing their inventories more efficiently during the pandemic, now have less leftover food to give. Other Trump cuts have disrupted AmeriCorps, which helps staff mobile food pantries and other services, and are ending the Local Food Purchase Assistance Cooperative Agreement Program, which provided food from local farmers.
Food banks with more resources can be more creative. Several told ProPublica they’ve hired someone whose job is to find grocery stores in the area willing to donate food. But in areas where grocers are scarce, there are fewer options. In some cases, food banks are among the only places where people can get fresh fruits and vegetables.
“When we see federal cuts like this, that affects entire communities and villages and towns,” said Stephanie Sullivan, assistant director of marketing and communications at Food Bank for the Heartland, which serves 93 counties across Nebraska and western Iowa.
### “There’s Not an Option B”
Cuts and changes to foundational federal programs for low-income people — namely, SNAP and Medicaid — are a looming concern. The increase in need even before these changes take effect could signal that food banks are a “canary in the coal mine” for what’s to come, said Christopher Bosso, a food policy expert at Northeastern University and the author of a book on SNAP.
Hunger will also be harder to measure now that the USDA has canceled an annual food insecurity survey, calling it “redundant” and “politicized.”
“It feels like the idea is to make it harder to identify the consequences of the policy changes that we’re seeing right now,” said Marlene Schwartz, the director of the Rudd Center for Food Policy and Health at the University of Connecticut.
Food bank administrators emphasized that they could not fill the gap created by benefit cuts in the administration’s multitrillion-dollar spending bill. Feeding America, a national nonprofit association of food banks and other organizations, estimates that for every meal its food banks provide, SNAP provides nine. The majority of people who receive food assistance also receive Medicaid, so reductions in both programs could force people to choose between health care and groceries.
Food to be distributed at the Roadrunner Food Bank in Albuquerque, New Mexico.
The legislation cuts SNAP by $187 billion, or 20%, through 2034, according to estimates from the Congressional Budget Office. The bill, which has expanded work requirements for some recipients and taken protections away from others, will also increase the amount of money that states must contribute to the program for the first time in decades. Experts say it’s unclear how cash-strapped states will be able to shoulder that cost.
Two experts on food insecurity told ProPublica that hunger is expected to rise with the new program rules as it has when SNAP spending has been reduced in the past. There could also be ripple effects: Research has shown that people enrolled in SNAP are less likely to be hospitalized. And grocery stores where the majority of customers use these benefits could close, said Gina Plata-Nino, the interim SNAP director for the Food Research and Action Center, a national nonprofit that works to eradicate hunger.
The people who are harmed are “working incredibly hard,” Plata-Nino said.
“They are Americans who are falling on hard times and just need those resources to be able to have economic mobility and be able to escape poverty,” she said. “Without those resources, it just makes them even poorer and less equipped to be able to handle the tough economy that all of us are facing now.”
Michael Heaton, 76, takes care of his 31-year-old son, who has autism; the two live off Heaton’s Social Security and his son’s disability payments. After the pandemic, Heaton, who is retired, said he saw his SNAP benefits shrink from $600 a month to just over $100. To supplement their diets, he goes to pantries and food-distribution centers around Albuquerque.
On a recent morning, he picked up two bags. “This fills that gap,” he said. “We only take what we need, we’re not trying to be gluttonous or anything.”
Elvin Ortiz, 67, says he has been using a food bank for around two years and has noticed changes in the quality of the food. (Photo: Stephanie Mei-Ling/ ProPublica)
Even food banks that rely less on federal funding are worried about what comes next if the emergency food assistance program is reduced or altered in a significant way.
“There’s not an option B,” said Brian McManus, the chief operations officer of the Food Bank of Central New York.
Louisiana, one of the states most reliant on SNAP, stands to be among the places hardest hit by further cuts.
“It’s unfortunate that in a time where the social safety nets are being cut, that our resources are also being cut,” said Wright-Velez.
If people haven’t experienced food insecurity, or don’t know someone who has, they might forget something important, she said:
“Those are real people on the other end of those cuts.”
In all, the USDA records indicate that food banks were expecting more than 27 million pounds of chicken, 2 million gallons of milk, 10 million pounds of dried fruit and 67 million eggs that never arrived. Food banks had planned to schedule more deliveries in the coming months. Those orders are not reflected in this data.

The suit alleges that the state discriminated against Bethany Christian for their policy of hiring only employees who align with the group’s “statement of faith,” by not renewing a contract for refugee resettlement funding, which is managed by the Office of Global Michigan, or OGM. 
The case, filed in federal court in the Western District of Michigan, has now stretched over a year since it was first filed in September 2024. In a stipulated preliminary injunction granted soon after, the office agreed to continue two of Bethany’s three contracts for their final year — a value of $1,000,000.SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Bethany Christian’s suit comes at a time when conservative and religious advocates are pushing the envelope on legal cases, Michigan State University Law professor Frank Ravitch noted, with a conservative-leaning U.S. Supreme Court. 
“Prior to 2020, most of these claims wouldn’t have had a leg to stand on,” he said. “But because of recent Supreme Court decisions, there is at least some chance for these arguments to prevail.”
Lawyers for Bethany Christian filed a renewed motion nearly a full year after the initial suit was filed for another preliminary injunction, through which they are asking to have their funding granted to them for the cycle in which it was not renewed — a funding cycle from October 2024 through September 2025.
However, the state argued in a filing at the start of October that the preliminary injunction itself is not valid for a number of reasons — first, that the contracts for which Bethany Christian is seeking renewed funding has already expired in its regular cycle. They also argue that, because it took Bethany Christian nearly a full year to file its renewed motion for the injunctive relief, they have “unreasonably delayed” the case. 
In this response filed, the lawyers for the state and the two officials specifically named — Susan Corbin, director of the Michigan Department of Labor and Economic Opportunity, and Poppy Sias-Hernandez, director of the Office of Global Michigan — are seeking to have the renewed injunction denied in its entirety.
“OGM cannot revive expired contracts, or change their terms, or cancel other entities’ contracts for services, or simply provide some sort of funding stream to Bethany unattached to a properly awarded contract,” the response states. 
Ravitch noted that the specific ask for injunctive relief might dictate how effective this mootness argument will be in court. 
“A court can’t order the state to create a new contract that it doesn’t have funding for, and it really can’t ask the state to undo the current contract,” he said. “But would it be moot for purposes of something like a declaratory judgment or an injunction that in future bidding situations this can’t be considered?”
The state also refuted the argument that the decision not to renew the contracts with Bethany Christian was religious discrimination — instead stating that it was due to performance and cost considerations. Comparing the performance of Bethany Christian under that $1 million injunction to their prior work, the filing states that under the injunction, “Bethany provided approximately 85.35% less services to refugees in 2024, charging OGM approximately 305.72% more per client served.”
“One of the big questions that seems to be occurring here is, to what extent did the state just deny this under its in order normal bidding process, and it had nothing to do with the anti discrimination rule,” said Ravitch, “and they considered that when they found out about it, but they didn’t end up deciding based on that, in which case Bethany Christian has no leg to stand on.”
Ravitch added that even if Bethany Christian’s version of the facts is found to be more accurate than the state’s, they may still not successfully prove discrimination.
“As long as the state can show that it really did just neutrally apply its anti-discrimination provision and its rule about having someone representative of the religious community from which many of the refugees are from, I think that really hurts Bethany Christian’s argument,” he said. 
They also compare Bethany Christian to Samaritas — another Christian social service agency, which was granted the contracts in the 2024-25 year that Bethany Christian was denied. The filing goes on to say that Samaritas served 1148% more refugees than Bethany Christian in that time frame, while Bethany Christian’s cost per refugee served was 1075% more expensive than Samaritas. 
Ravitch also noted that the case is still in very early stages and has not yet gone through the process of discovery, which can take years — making it unlikely that this case will be wrapped up in any near future.

A new bipartisan bill in Congress would ban greyhound raising nationwide, outlawing the country’s last two remaining greyhound racetracks: the Mardi Gras Casino and Resort in Nitro and the Wheeling Island Hotel Casino and Racetrack in Wheeling.
“Public records reveal that some greyhounds used for live commercial racing suffer serious injuries including broken backs, broken necks, head trauma, paralysis, seizures and electrocution,” the bill said. 
While live racing is declining in popularity, West Virginia’s race tracks are still important economically. Revenue from racetracks help fund public services across the state along with providing jobs in a state where jobs are diminishing. 
“All 55 counties benefit from these casinos,” said Steve Sarras, a greyhound breeder in West Virginia, who said his dogs are well cared for to abide by strict state regulations. “Pensions are funded from these races. Police and fire [services] get a portion of simulcasting wagering.
Sarras said the greyhound racing industry brings thousands of jobs to West Virginia.
The casinos employ nearly 900 people, according to Glen White, director of corporate communications for Delaware North, the company that operates both casinos. The businesses “are positive economic drivers for the state and their regions,” he said, adding that they give back to local charities. 
Del. Shawn Fluharty, D-Ohio
Del. Shawn Fluharty, D-Ohio, represents the area that contains the Wheeling track. He noted that the track provides jobs in dog training, veterinary services and more.
“These are specialized economic and employment opportunities directly tied to the industry which would be gone tomorrow if racing is eliminated,” Fluharty said. “Not to mention, the owners and trainers of these dogs are residents of West Virginia. They are business owners employing people locally.”
Since 2007, state law has said all state-sanctioned casino table games and video lottery machines cannot operate without having horse or dog racing. State-level legislative attempts to undo the mandate have failed.
Casinos make annual video lottery payments to the West Virginia Lottery Commission. The lottery commission transfers some of the money into a purse account for kennel operators that they earn when they win or finish well in races. A separate fund — the West Virginia Thoroughbred Development Fund — supports the state’s horse racing industry.
The legally mandated Greyhound Development Breeding Fund typically pulls between $15 and $17 million annually. The fund, which goes to owners of accredited West Virginia whelped greyhounds, is supposed to promote better breeding and training track facilities.
Carey Theil is executive director of GREY2K USA Worldwide, which works to end greyhound racing around the world. He said that money could be better spent on the state’s roads or public education system. 
“The Legislature, if it wanted to, could absolutely end the live racing mandate and take that $17 million and redirect it anywhere it wants,” Theil said. 
Over the past five years, there has been a steady decline in the number of greyhound racing patrons at both Wheeling Island and Mardi Gras, according to White.
“At Wheeling Island, three kennels have closed in the last two years due to lack of profitability,” he said. 
Delaware North faces fierce competition from other casinos, he said, and focuses on marketing what’s profitable — slots and table games, the restaurants and hotels.
Regardless of what happens with the federal legislation, White said the company has said for years that if state lawmakers passed legislation that allowed it to operate without operating racing, “we would work with the kennel owners to phase out racing.”
Sarras said the decision should be made at the state level — not in Washington, D.C.
“The federal bill doesn’t really concern me,” he said. “I kind of feel like it’s more optics and posturing … Our country has a lot bigger problems to address.”
National organization already working to end greyhound racing in West Virginia 
For Theil, the potential federal ban represents a hope to end greyhound racing in West Virginia after his own efforts to lobby state legislators on the issue haven’t succeeded. His organization’s opposition to racing centers on animal welfare concerns. 
State records indicate that 487 greyhounds were injured at the two tracks in 2024, and it included 162 dogs that suffered broken bones, Theil said. Thirteen greyhounds died.
“These dogs have very short racing careers, and they’re out of the industry by age 3 or 4,” Theil said. Besides training, racing and using the bathroom, he said, “the rest of their life, basically, is spent in a cage.”
There are also concerns about live lure, where rabbits and possums are used in greyhound training.
Sarras emphasized that greyhound racing is an “extremely regulated” industry, and dogs are seen regularly by veterinarians who oversee the greyhounds’ care. Racing isn’t permitted without veterinarians on-site, and Sarras said any injuries to the dogs are treated immediately on-site then sent to a veterinary hospital.
“Those misconceptions of abuse and neglect are just people putting out lies. I always tell people, ‘Believe your eyes and not the lies.’ 
He continued, “These dogs are seen on the regular by veterinarians. There’s no room for abuse and neglect … I can promise you, those dogs are very well taken care of, and they’re happy and healthy and extremely fit.”
For Delaware North, White said, “As long as the company operates racing at Wheeling and Mardi Gras, we will do so to the highest of standards, always keeping the safety and wellbeing of the greyhounds as our top priority.”
Fluharty emphasized that the push to end greyhound racing is not coming from West Virginia residents. 
“It is being pushed by out-of-state propaganda groups like Grey2K,” he said. “They lie about the industry then pack their bags and go home. It’s pathetic.”
“Go visit a kennel. The dogs are very much taken care of when they are racing and afterwards with a 99% adoption rate after their racing career,” Fluharty added.

State lawmakers have tried but failed to end greyhound racing
In West Virginia, dogs have raced at Mardi Gras since 1985, and Wheeling Island transitioned from horse to greyhound racing in 1976.
State lawmakers have in the past considered ending greyhound racing by terminating the West Virginia’s Greyhound Breeding Development Fund. The Legislature passed a bill to end the state dog racing mandate in 2017, but it was vetoed by Gov. Jim Justice. 
In 2020, then Senate President Mitch Carmichael, R-Jackson, prioritized ending greyhound racing in the state, introducing legislation to eliminate the Greyhound Fund and decouple live dog racing from casino operations. He argued that greyhound racing — which he called a dying industry — was harmful for dogs, and that it should not be considered a priority for the state’s funding. 
But lawmakers who represented the Wheeling-area spoke out against it, saying it would devastate the area economically. The measure failed.
Earlier this year, separate bills were introduced by Republicans in the Senate and House of Delegates during the legislative session to end the state mandate for greyhound racing at casinos. 
Tracks wouldn’t have been required “to conduct a minimum number of live racing dates”, the bill said, in order to qualify for a video lottery or racetrack table game licenses.
Once a licensed track wanted to discontinue dog racing, the bills would have required the track to pay $250,000 to $1 million in live racing cessation fee that would go into a special revenue account. 
The funds would have been allocated to facilitate the care, adoption of or placement in no-kill animal shelters of whelped greyhounds that had been running at the tracks, according to the legislation. Sarras told West Virginia Public Broadcasting in 2022 that most of his dogs get adopted. 
Neither bill was taken up for a vote. 
Kathie Hess Crouse, R-Putnam, sponsored the House version. 
Del. Kathie Hess Crouse, R-Putnam
“As the delegate who represents the area where Mardi Gras Casino is located, I try to be responsive to requests for bills on this topic and mindful of all the entities involved,” Hess Crouse wrote in an email in June. “As such, what I was hoping to see would have been a step-down approach to the end of greyhound racing to be sure all the animals were properly cared for. I’ve not had any recent conversations about this issue, so I’m not sure what any potential legislation next year may look like.”
Sarras said support for the greyhounding racing industry is still strong in the Statehouse. 
“West Virginia doesn’t have a lot of jobs, so I don’t know why anyone would want to sponsor a job-killer bill that would take out five- to 7,000 jobs,” he said. 
Federal bill seeks to ban ‘cruel,’ ‘unpopular’ greyhound racing
In August, Rep. Salud Carbajal, D-Calif, along with a list of bipartisan co-sponsors, introduced the Greyhound Protection Act, a bill to ban greyhound racing in the United States permanently. The legislation would also prohibit gambling on live and simulcast greyhound races.
“Greyhound racing is a relic of an era long-past in the United States. It is cruel, inhumane, and thoroughly unpopular with the American public — which is why nearly every state in the union has already voted to outlaw it,” Carbajal said in a news release from Grey2K. 
Other states have outlawed greyhound racing, and a handful of states, including Alabama and Iowa, still permit, but have no active tracks. Seven states have passed laws to outlaw remote gambling on greyhound racing since 2022. 
“I think this issue is reaching a tipping point because you’ve seen so many other states act and outlaw greyhound racing,” Theil said. 
Some lawmakers who represent the Wheeling-area still don’t want to see the sport end. Sen. Ryan Weld, R-Brooke, has fought to retain greyhound racing. He adopted a fawn brindle greyhound, a retired racing greyhound who is a regular at the state Capitol. Weld has maintained that the greyhounds are treated well after visiting a kennel operated by Sarras.
Greyhound racing is still an economic juggernaut in Wheeling, according to Fluharty, who is an attorney. He is also president of the National Council Of Legislators From Gaming States.
“Total handle in 2023 was $260 million with a large portion from a national simulcast audience, showing the national reach. In 2023, Wheeling’s signal transmission fee totaled $8.87M, reflecting heavy out-of-state demand,” Fluharty said. 
“The federal ban is being pushed by a California representative who probably couldn’t find Wheeling on a map,” he added.
Theresa Bruner, president of the Federation of Humane Organizations of West Virginia, has been fighting for years to end greyhound racing in the state. 
“These dogs belong on couches and not on the race tracks,” she said. “We believe they’re exploited in a cruel way.”
The $15-17 million in required annual subsidy to the greyhound purse funds could be used to fix the state’s other glaring issues, Bruner said, like the financially-troubled Public Employees Insurance Agency. It shouldn’t be propping up the greyhound racing industry, she said. 
“The industry should be left to survive on its own. If it survives, it survives,” she said.

(Wisconsin Examiner photo)The news that $130 million in already-committed clean-energy funding for Wisconsin is on the chopping block is not abstract politics. It pulls real tools out of Wisconsin homes, schools, farms, and shop floors — right as our state is building momentum. The result is simple: higher bills, fewer choices, and lost jobs.
In a purple state like ours, climate action has succeeded because it’s kitchen-table common sense. It lowers costs, creates good local jobs, and protects the air and water families depend on. Our playbook is pragmatic — align smart policy with market innovation, center justice, and let businesses, workers, tribes and frontline communities lead together. Clawing back funds mid-stream breaks that compact and injects uncertainty just when we need reliability and speed.
What’s at stake here and now
Across Wisconsin, 82 clean-energy projects are moving forward: EV-charging corridors that support tourism and commerce from Superior to Kenosha; solar on schools and farms that cuts operating costs and keeps dollars local; grid upgrades that reduce outages for households and manufacturers. Clean energy already supports more than 71,000 Wisconsin jobs, with manufacturers, contractors and building trades poised to add tens of thousands more if the rules stay steady.
This is not coastal hype — it’s Menomonee Valley and the Fox Valley. Companies like Ingeteam in Milwaukee build components that power wind and EV projects nationwide. Give our manufacturers clear, predictable rules and Wisconsin will keep making core parts of the transition -— batteries, solar panels, wind components, EV chargers, and smart-grid equipment -— right here at home.
Schools and local governments are also using direct-pay to put solar on rooftops, electrify buses, and cut fuel and maintenance. Green Homeowners United and similar groups are helping thousands of households -— including many lower-income homeowners of color — tap rebates that reduce bills and carbon at the same time. These are the practical tools that stretch tight budgets and improve health outcomes in neighborhoods that have carried the burden the longest.
The real cost of policy whiplash
Rolling back incentives is a hidden tax on working families — up to $400 more a year on energy without the savings tools people are using now. With AI and data centers accelerating demand, the cheapest, fastest reliability gains come from efficiency, storage, and renewables. Cut those tools and we invite more price volatility and more outage risk — exactly what Wisconsin manufacturers, hospitals and farms can’t afford.
The “Big, Broken Bill” passed in Washington goes further, weakening EPA pollution standards and letting big polluters sidestep responsibility. That doesn’t eliminate costs; it shifts them to families in the form of asthma, missed school days and medical bills. It’s not fiscal conservatism to socialize pollution costs while privatizing short-term profits.
And for farmers, whose energy and conservation projects were finally penciling out with IRA tools, canceling support mid-contract leaves family farms holding the bag after planning in good faith. That’s not how you build durable rural economies.
Momentum that continues even if funds are cut
Here’s the other half of the story: Wisconsin’s transition won’t stop because some programs are attacked. Market forces, including  the declining cost of renewables and storage, efficiency that pays for itself and corporate and municipal sustainability commitments, continue to drive projects. Public-private partnerships, rural co-ops, tribal governments, school districts and village halls are working together to reduce risk, share data, and scale what works. That coalition will keep moving.
But let’s be clear: Clawbacks and moving goalposts slow us down and raise costs. They strand planning, freeze hiring and deter investment — especially in manufacturing corridors that depend on multi-year production schedules. If Congress wants to improve programs, fine. Just don’t pull the rug out mid-project.
Purple-state practicality: Results over rhetoric
Wisconsin’s approach is neither red nor blue; it’s results-based:

Lower bills and stronger reliability through weatherization, heat pumps, rooftop and community solar and batteries that keep homes and Main Street businesses running during heat waves and deep freezes.
Good local jobs in design, construction, electrical, HVAC, machining and advanced manufacturing.
Cleaner air from electrified school buses and efficient buildings, health benefits that show up in fewer sick days and lower costs.
Fairness by ensuring benefits land first where burdens have been heaviest.

We’ve also learned to say no when it matters and yes to better options. When a $2 billion methane gas plant was proposed, business and civic leaders asked basic questions: Is this the least-cost, least-risk path for ratepayers? Would it lock us into volatile fuel prices just as renewables, storage, demand response and efficiency are scaling? Pushing for a cleaner, more affordable portfolio wasn’t ideology. It was risk management.
A constructive path forward

Keep the tools that help Wisconsin build here, hire here, and save here. Don’t rip away commitments families, schools, farms and manufacturers are already using.
Provide certainty so manufacturers can invest in people and equipment. Certainty is economic development.
Target affordability and reliability: Expand programs that lower bills, reduce outages, and prioritize investments in communities that have waited the longest for cleaner air and safer housing.
Let locals lead: Support direct-pay and streamlined approvals for schools, municipalities, tribes and rural co-ops to deploy projects faster and cheaper.

Wisconsin has the talent, the supply chains — more than 350 in-state clean-energy companies — and the tradition of stewardship to lead the clean-energy economy. If we stay focused on trust, collaboration and measurable results, Wisconsin’s green momentum will outpace politics.
Don’t make Wisconsinites pay more to get less. Let’s build it here, power it here and prosper here.
John Imes is co-founder and executive director of the Wisconsin Environmental Initiative and village president of Shorewood Hills. He will speak Oct. 22 on the American Sustainable Business Network national panel “Purple State, Green Momentum” — how Wisconsin’s pragmatic climate playbook lowers bills, creates good local jobs, and protects our air and water.

(Jane Norman/States Newsroom)The U.S. Supreme Court will hear new arguments Wednesday over Louisiana’s congressional maps. State Republican leaders now want to get rid of a majority-Black district they created, and the Supreme Court’s ruling could have national implications.
Attorney General Liz Murrill questions key tenets of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, a landmark federal law that has been amended multiple times over the decades to prohibit racial discrimination in elections. Watching closely are Republicans in other states who have pushed to redraw their congressional districts to improve their odds of holding onto U.S. House seats – and their majority status – in next year’s midterm elections.
In Louisiana v. Callais, justices could set a standard for the degree to which race can be considered when drawing election maps. 
A group of non-Black Louisiana voters filed the lawsuit after the state legislature, at the direction of Murrill and Gov. Jeff Landry, approved a U.S. House map in January 2024 with two out of six districts being majority Black. A previous map, which a federal district judge rejected, had just one majority-Black seat in a state where Black residents account for one-third of the population.
The governor and attorney general preferred lawmakers maintain control in drawing new congressional district boundaries after the judge invalidated a previous version and threatened to have her court draw the lines instead.     
The Supreme Court was originally expected to rule on the Callais case earlier this year. But in a rare move, justices punted their decision to their next term. They also posed new questions for parties to answer: Did the legislature’s creation of a second majority-Black district violate the 14th or 15th amendments to the U.S. Constitution? 
​The 14th Amendment, in part, covers representation in Congress, and the 15th Amendment prevents citizens from being denied the right to vote based on their race.   
Since then, Murrill has gone from supporting the map with two majority-Black districts to questioning the constitutionality of Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, which prohibits voting laws or procedures that purposefully discriminate on the basis of race, color or membership in a language minority group.
How we got here: Louisiana’s redistricting case puts the Voting Rights Act on trial 

In a brief filed with the Supreme Court, Murrill argued Section 2, as it has been applied to Louisiana, is unconstitutional. 
“​​Race-based redistricting under Section 2 is principally unconstitutional because it inherently rests on a racial stereotype: that all voters of a particular race must — by virtue of their membership in their racial class — think alike, share the same interests, and prefer the same political candidates,” she wrote. 
To bring a successful case under Section 2, plaintiffs must prove the racial minority in question is politically cohesive.
The Trump administration has filed its own brief echoing Murrill’s arguments. 
Like Murrill, U.S. Solicitor General John Sauer argues the standard for determining whether a district complies with the Voting Rights Act is flawed and should be altered. The so-called Gingles test, which arose from a 1986 Supreme Court ruling, sets the standards for determining whether election districts meet federal standards. 



The Gingles test
Created by the U.S. Supreme Court in the 1986 case Thornburg v. Gingles, plaintiffs must show the existence of three preconditions to prove racial vote dilution:

The racial or language minority group “sufficiently large and geographically compact to constitute a majority in a single-member district”
The minority group is politically cohesive
The majority votes sufficiently as a block to usually defeat the minority’s candidate of choice




The Trump administration also argues that plaintiffs seeking judicial relief from a violation of Section 2 should be required to take state’s political motivations into consideration when offering alternative districts. For example, this could include drawing a district to not just keep an incumbent in their district but to ensure the incumbent’s victory. 
Michael Li, senior counsel for the Brennan Center for Justice, a progressive organization that follows redistricting issues throughout the country, said requiring plaintiffs to meet a state’s political goals is among the Trump administration’s boldest proposed modifications to the Section 2 framework. 
“Effectively, this is asking SCOTUS to gut the [Voting Rights Act] without saying you are gutting the [Voting Rights Act],” Li said. 
In addition to the Trump administration, 16 Republican state attorneys general have signed onto briefs in support of Murrill’s arguments in the Callais case. In the filings, Republicans argue in favor of a “colorblind” approach, in which states would not consider race in the redistricting process at all. 
Attorneys with the ACLU and the NAACP Legal Defense Fund representing Black voters, say the “colorblind” era before approval of the Voting Rights Act was marked by racial discrimination.
“It was an era ‘blind’ to race only in the sense that obvious, widespread discrimination went unaddressed by Congress and courts,” the attorneys wrote in a rebuttal to the Murrill and Sauer briefs. 
Press Robinson, the lead Black voter who sued Louisiana over its original, single-Black district  map, believes the state should still be subject to its Section 2 requirements. Robinson said he hasn’t observed sufficient progress in the 60 years he’s been involved in politics in the state. 
“It’s fairly easy to be arguing that things have changed to the point that there’s no need for special dispensation of Black voters,” Robinson said earlier this month in a news media briefing. “Has Louisiana really changed? I don’t see it. I don’t know what they’re talking about when they say that it has.” 
“Louisiana has only been a full democracy since the passage of the Voting Rights Act in 1965 when federal law finally guaranteed Black communities the right to participate equally in our political process,” ACLU of Louisiana executive director Alanah Odoms said at the same news conference. 
Attorneys for Black voters in the case called Republicans’ stance a “burn-it-all-down approach” and argued Louisiana would prefer no congressional or judicial oversight for its voting processes. 
“Let there be no mistake: That was the situation that prevailed in Louisiana and nationwide for the 100 years before the [Voting Rights Act],” the ACLU and NAACP attorneys wrote. “It was a time when Black voters and other voters of color were systematically excluded from the political process.”

Potential ‘head-spinning reversal’ 
Until the Voting Rights Act was enacted, many promises of Reconstruction era amendments to the Constitution were largely unfulfilled as Black voters were suppressed under racially oppressive Jim Crow laws. 
The Voting Rights Act has been amended five times to strengthen its provisions, though voting rights advocates said federal court rulings over the past decade have chipped away at the law. The most notable crack occurred in 2013 when the Supreme Court ruled Section 5 of the act was unconstitutional. The provision required Louisiana and other listed states and local governments to get federal government pre-approval for any redistricting plan or voting law. 
The redistricting cycle based on the 2020 census is the first in which Louisiana was not subject to this preclearance.
Murrill’s defection ended state Republican leaders’ strange bedfellowship with Black voters who challenged the 2022 version of the congressional district map. Both supported the 2024 map, but their alliance came to an end in September when Republicans and groups supporting Black voters filed opposing briefs, teeing up the arguments justices will make Wednesday. 
If the justices side with Louisiana and the Trump administration, it would reverse a precedent the court set just two years ago in in Allen v. Milligan, the Alabama case that required lawmakers there to add a second majority-Black congressional district. 
“If the Court decides to now undo that precedent, it would be a head-spinning reversal of itself,” John Bisognano, president of the National Redistricting Foundation, a voting rights organization, said in a statement.

Special session questions
There is no set date for when justices will rule on Callais, but it is likely to be next year before the end of June. 
In anticipation of the ruling, the Louisiana Legislature is considering a special session in the coming weeks to push back the qualification deadline for next year’s congressional elections. Doing so would give lawmakers enough time next year to adopt a new redistricting plan. 
In August, Gov. Landry directed lawmakers to set aside dates for another redistricting special session, but legislative leaders expressed reluctance to do so before justices made a decision in the Callais case. Depending on the court’s ruling, it’s possible Louisiana’s new U.S. House map could have two, one or even no majority Black districts.
Fair Fight Action, a progressive voting rights organization, predicts that if the Supreme Court sides with conservatives and hollows out Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, states could redraw up to 19 majority Black districts to make them competitive or safe seats for Republicans.",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/supremecourtoct92024-1024x7681742939759-1.jpg,,,2025-10-14 06:56:39.862711

The heroes are the foster parents who have big hearts, but not always the capability to host foster kids with a wide range of problems.
“Everyone can do something,” Gifford says. “The kids in foster care in North Idaho are our kids, and they need us to step up – each and every one of us. Not everyone can, or should, be foster parents or work with kids, but everyone can do a little something to support those that are doing it – bringing dinner, tutoring a child, providing diapers, helping prep curriculum, raise awareness donations. There are so many ways to be the village.”
As Gifford says, there’s nothing easy about caring for foster kids – many of whom are victims of abuse. Some troubled kids bounce around to multiple foster homes, going through a string of bad situations. But Gifford’s “village” and social workers do not quit on the kids, or the families.
There are success stories. Meet Katelyn Miller of Rathdrum and Tabitha Norris of Post Falls.
On Christmas Eve of last year, Katelyn took in a newborn boy (Sonny), and it was not for a short-term placement. She’s had experience working with foster children, which inspired her to say “yes” to welcoming Sonny. Katelyn’s 8-year-old son, JJ, was excited about getting a baby brother, but there were many things to work out.
“They said for me to bring a car seat,” she said. “How am I going to get a car seat? And clothing? What kind of formula is he going to be on? What special needs will he have?”
But Katelyn wasn’t doing this alone. The Village of Hope was there to address all those issues and even provide a crib months later.
“The Village of Hope has been amazing,” Katelyn said. “I’m so glad I answered the call on Christmas Eve, and he’s healthy and safe. He lights up my life in ways I never expected.”
Tabitha Norris and her husband, Paul, had a challenge of a different sort. In June, they adopted a 17-year-old boy from southern Idaho who had bounced around foster homes for more than a decade. And Tabitha has plenty of challenges of her own with advanced stages of muscular dystrophy.
“I think that has given me a huge heart for kids who are struggling with trauma and disabilities themselves,” she said. For her son, named Raymond Paul Norris, he now has stability in his life and a mom and dad who care. 
Raising a teenager is not easy in any scenario, but Tabitha says the rewards far outweigh the challenges. Raymond is being home-schooled during his senior year and enjoys basketball, baseball and rock climbing.
“He’s so joyful – so bouncy and fun,” Tabitha says.  “He has changed our lives. He is our hero.”
The Village of Hope has been with Tabitha and Paul through the entire journey, Tabitha says. “They have gone above and beyond, always asking how they can support us.”
Officially, Raymond has “aged out” of the foster-care system, but he’s now working as a junior volunteer with Village of Hope.
Gifford gladly celebrates success stories, but they are not typical in her world. She sees social workers who are overworked, foster parents who do not have enough training and families that are at risk.
“North Idaho has not caught up to offering affordable housing, and families are losing health coverage for their kids,” she says. “These families are at risk and we need to be doing more on the prevention side. We work with families to help kids overcome trauma and set healthy goals, but there are so many other odds that are stacking up against them.”
Gifford is correct. She has a nice “village” in place, but there’s much more that needs to be done.

Henry, The Marshall Project and Mina Corpuz",,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/10/14/mississippi-prison-chief-reopens-homicide-cases-following-news-investigation/,"Nearly 50 prison deaths will be examined, following a joint investigation by multiple Mississippi newsrooms.","The Mississippi Department of Corrections will review more than two dozen unprosecuted homicides inside its prisons, as well as deaths where causes were ruled as “undetermined,” following an investigation by several news sites, including Mississippi Today and  The Marshall Project – Jackson.
“All the deaths that we’ve had since 2015, we’re going back to revisit,” Corrections Commissioner Burl Cain told the reporting team. “There is no statute of limitations, as you know, on homicide.”
Cain’s comments follow an investigation by a team of Mississippi reporters that revealed at least 43 people died by homicide inside Mississippi prisons since 2015. Total murder convictions in those cases? Eight, including two guilty pleas that came after the news stories were published.
The prison homicide investigation involved reporters and editors from The Marshall Project – Jackson, Mississippi Today, The Clarion Ledger, Hattiesburg American and The Mississippi Link. 
A prisoner advocacy group said revisiting past homicides won’t address the key reasons for the deaths in the first place — chronic understaffing of security officers.
Revisiting past homicides is “sort of closing the door after the horse has left the barn,” said David Fathi, director of the ACLU National Prison Project. “What the commissioner also needs to do is figure out why this is happening and what to do to stop it.” 
Deaths officially categorized as homicides this year appear to have reached their highest level since 2020, when a gang war pushed that year’s total to at least nine killings.
Forty-one-year-old Aaron Harrison became the sixth person killed in a state prison this year when he died on July 3. A medical examiner later ruled that Harrison, incarcerated at East Mississippi Correctional Facility, was killed by blunt force trauma.  
A nurse practitioner at the prison noticed bruising on Harrison while treating him for a possible drug overdose before he died, according to an incident report obtained by the news reporting team. Court records show that no one has been charged in Harrison’s death, but it is not unusual for homicide investigations to take up to a year.
State Rep. Becky Currie, who chairs the House Corrections Committee, asked a legislative committee last month — as the reporting team was about to publish its investigation — to look into all prison deaths for the past five years. 
The Joint Legislative Committee on Performance Evaluation and Expenditure Review analyzes state agency programs and operations and can issue recommendations.
Even with recent deaths, she’s found that little information is shared with the families, the public and lawmakers when an incarcerated person dies. 
“How can you say you’ll keep people safe if you don’t know what they’re dying of?” Currie asked.
Internal investigations
The corrections department has its own criminal investigations unit and can refer cases to county prosecutors for further action.
Cain said the agency’s Criminal Investigations Division is now examining each death that was not referred to a district attorney’s office. About 25 people work for CID, which has been rebuilt since he took over corrections in 2020, he said.
“We’ve brought a lot more professionalism,” Cain said.
Each prison has an investigator who can respond quickly, and more investigators work out of the central office than before, he said. “That way we can keep the integrity and know what’s going on.”
He compared the investigators’ work on these homicides to working on cold cases. “They’re looking for answers.”
“We’re going back to visit all that to be sure that we haven’t left any stone unturned,” Cain said. “Every crime that is committed in the prison, no matter how small,” will be referred to a county prosecutor. “If he wants to throw it in the trash and not prosecute, that’s up to him.”
In the past decade, prosecutors indicted people in 16 of the 43 homicides, with eight guilty pleas. One case was dropped because the accused person died by suicide before his day in court. Another was dropped in light of evidence that supported the accused person’s claim of self-defense. The remaining six indictments, handed up between 2022 and June 2025, are pending trial. 
The commissioner shared similar comments during a Sept. 24 legislative budget hearing, but lawmakers did not ask him follow-up questions about the investigations. Among those in attendance were House Speaker Jason White and Lt. Gov. Delbert Hosemann.
When reached by the reporting team, the offices of Hosemann and White, along with the state auditor’s office, declined to comment. 
The state Senate Corrections Committee chairman, Sen. Juan Barnett, did not respond to requests for comment about the team’s findings and Cain’s remarks.

In addition to the 43 homicides, another 21 prisoner deaths since 2015 have been ruled “undetermined” by the state medical examiner’s office. That means medical examiners were not able to come to a conclusive answer about how a person died. An undetermined death could be a homicide, suicide, accidental, or a natural death. 
For example, Richard Weems’ 2022 death was ruled undetermined, but medical examiners noted his body showed signs of blunt force trauma. An incarcerated person told the Mississippi Free Press in 2023 that he saw Weems being beaten.
Asked if MDOC planned to review deaths marked as undetermined, Cain replied, “We’re going to look at all of them.”
Cain said prison security has been improved in recent years with more video cameras, six narcotic detection dogs, a drone detecting system and enhanced video on the prisons’ fences to stop drugs from being thrown over or dropped by drones. According to the U.S. Department of Justice, the abundance of illegal drugs in MDOC facilities has led to extortion and violence, the department’s 2024 investigation found. 
Staffing shortages lead to violence, advocates say
One of the key problems the news investigation identified is the chronic understaffing that leaves incarcerated people vulnerable to violence. 
Fathi called the staffing levels in Mississippi prisons “a five-alarm emergency.” 
Corrections spokesperson Kate Head said in a statement that staffing “is central to safety and security.” The department continues to address the shortages and strengthen staff accountability, she told the news team.
Since Cain took the helm in 2020, the starting salary for a correctional officer increased by about $13,000, beginning at $40,392. Still, it is hard to hire and retain staff for such dangerous jobs. 
About 30% of the funded corrections officer positions were vacant, Deputy Commissioner Nathan Blevins told lawmakers at the budget hearing in September. 
“No prison can operate safely with that kind of staffing,” Fathi said, “It’s not safe for the incarcerated people, it’s not safe for the staff… it’s not safe for anybody.” 
Homicides in the prisons often happened when corrections officers were not watching.
For instance, Ronnie Graham was killed at Central Mississippi Correctional Facility in Rankin County in 2021, but his battered body was not discovered by a corrections officer for at least five hours. In another case, Jonathan Havard was strangled to death earlier this year at Wilkinson County Correctional Facility. However, his body was only discovered after an unidentified parent called to tell the prison officials that he had been killed, according to prison records.
Compounding the staffing problems is the growing prison population. Since December 2021, the number of state prisoners has increased from about 16,800 to 19,300, returning to pre-pandemic levels. Cain said the increase is largely due to high rates of recidivism. 
About 47% of people released in fiscal year 2021 returned to prison within three years, according to state corrections data. 
“If we do a better job of getting them employable, then that’s the whole key to recidivism and not coming back,” Cain said in the legislative hearing. “Recidivism is killing us.”
Cain’s promise of new investigations into unsolved homicides sparked hope for a mother who lost a son. 
Janice Wilkins, the mother of Denorris Howell, who was killed in the Mississippi State Penitentiary in Parchman in 2020, said she is grateful that her son’s case will be reviewed.
“It means a whole lot to me,” she said. “Once they review everything, they should move forward.”

(Photo courtesy of the West Virginia Republican Party) For the second month in a row, I find myself writing about a sham press conference held under our golden dome in Charleston. 
Last Monday, Republican members of the Legislature gathered with West Virginia Coal Association President Chris Hamilton and Attorney General J.B. McCuskey to heap praise on President Donald Trump’s latest attempts to pretend coal will make a lasting comeback. Recently the administration announced it would open up millions of acres of public lands for coal mining and dedicate over $600 million for coal plant upgrades across the country. 
Too bad last week’s press conference to discuss the Trump proposal was short on actual plans, and too long on falsehoods and misconceptions to convince West Virginia voters that they’re doing something to help the mining industry, coal miners and West Virginia overall. 
Normally I’d use this space to explain why coal can’t revive in the way West Virginia officials want you to think. Lately there has been great local and national reporting about the cost of West Virginia’s reliance on expensive coal fired-power as well as the global rise in renewable energy. This week the New York Times reported that wind and solar produced more power in the world than coal for the first six months of 2025. 
Simply put, our elected officials are trying to score political points by misleading the public about the potential for coal to power West Virginia. Actually, the potential does still exist. But it will be at great expense to all of us who pay electricity bills. Even our utilities, Appalachian Power and Mon Power, don’t see a future in which coal power is king. Also, the $625 million investment they tout won’t go very far. It can cost tens of millions to upgrade aspects of a coal power plant. 
I’d rather spend the bulk of this discussing something McCuskey said that really struck a nerve with me. “And this president, for the first time in a very long time, can look at every single coal miner in the face in this country and say I respect you, I value you, and what you are doing is a patriotic duty that is designed to rebuild this country’s superiority on the world stage,” he said. 
I work on black lung policy in my day job, and I have the privilege of meeting and working with coal miners with black lung and their families. In case you didn’t know, rates of black lung disease are worse than it has been in decades. It’s a terrible, incurable disease, and the people I work with are advocating for stronger protections for the current and future generations of coal miners. 
I don’t agree that this president and the federal or state governments are able to look miners and coal communities in the face and say they value them. If so, why haven’t they passed legislation to raise the monthly black lung stipend for miners who are too sick to work? Just last month, West Virginia Watch published a commentary from the vice president of the Black Lung Association. She wrote about how the One Big Beautiful Bill has a tax break for coal mining that ironically will be worse for black lung disease because it will likely lead to less money going to the Black Lung Disability Trust Fund.  
Why is the Trump administration not fighting to preserve the silica dust rule that would protect coal miners? Silica is highly toxic and has been killing Appalachian coal miners (and other occupations that are exposed to the dust). The rule is currently on hold due to a lawsuit from the mining industry and the Trump administration hasn’t indicated that it’s interested in strongly defending it. That’s why coal miners and the Black Lung Association are going to rally in Washington D.C. today to demand action. 
Our state lawmakers, governor, attorney general and congressional representatives have all been mostly silent on actually trying to tackle black lung disease, which, again, is at its highest levels in years and it will likely get worse. Every year, the Legislature invites coal miners to come to the capitol for Black Lung Awareness Day. And every year, they fail to pass legislation to improve the state compensation system for miners with black lung. 
So when officials stand in front of the cameras to say they care about coal, I have to ask if they actually care about who is mining it. Even if it turns out that coal “comes back” and we have coal power plants for decades to come, what will they do to actually ensure the health and well-being of the coal miners? Starting with being honest to West Virginians, as well as making commitments to reduce black lung disease and mining accidents is a good start.

(Photo by Isiah Holmes/Wisconsin Examiner)Over $80 million in federal relief funds have gone to Milwaukee County residents and businesses impacted by the historic flooding in August. Local officials are urging residents to tap into the funds, with just one month left to apply for federal aid. Thousands of Milwaukee County residents were affected by the floods, which blanketed streets and parks in flood water and debris after a record-breaking thousand-year storm. 
“Federal assistance is a crucial resource to help our residents repair their homes, recover from flood damage, and take a major step toward normalcy,” Milwaukee County Executive David Crowley said in a statement. “But to unlock this funding you must apply. I know the process can feel overwhelming, representatives from our federal partners are available throughout Milwaukee County at Disaster Recovery Centers and Disaster Survivor Assistance locations to help you every step of the way. With only one month left to apply, I strongly urge everyone affected by the flood to start the application today. Don’t wait until the last minute.”

The deadline to apply for federal aid is Nov. 12, with residents able to apply at DisasterAssistance.gov, or by phone at 800-621-3362. Residents are also encouraged to visit one of the disaster recovery centers at the West Allis Senior Center (7001 W National Ave), or the Milwaukee recovery center at McNair Elementary School (4950 N. 24th St). A recovery center that had been located at the Wauwatosa City Hall closed Friday Oct. 10, after assisting more than 500 residents with Federal Emergency Management Agency applications over its two and a half weeks of operation, according to a press release. 
In the month since federal assistance became available, FEMA has distributed nearly $92 million to flood survivors statewide. Of that, just over $82 million has gone to 15,666 Milwaukee County residents. Additionally, the U.S. Small Business Administration has approved $10.2 million in disaster loans to Milwaukee County homeowners, renters and business owners. 
FEMA has also continued providing flood relief through the government shutdown. A spokesperson from the office of U.S. Rep.  Gwen Moore (D-Milwaukee) told the Wisconsin Examiner at the onset of the shutdown that FEMA will continue conducting essential duties, including payments to disaster survivors, debris removal, emergency protective measures and salaries for the disaster workforce.

A mailer targeting three justices up for retention pins blame for the map on the state Supreme Court. (US Government)A voting rights watchdog group called on a conservative PAC backed by Republican financier Jeffrey Yass to rescind and apologize for a campaign mailer falsely pinning blame on the state Supreme Court for an unconstitutionally gerrymandered congressional district map.
The Republican-controlled General Assembly’s 2011 congressional redistricting map drew national attention for its oddly shaped districts, including one nicknamed “Goofy kicking Donald Duck” because of its resemblance to the Disney cartoon characters. 
That map is featured on a mailer sent to homes across the commonwealth last month urging voters to “Term limit the liberal Supreme Court,” as Justices Christine Donohue, Kevin Dougherty and David Wecht run for retention next month.
The nonpartisan League of Women Voters of Pennsylvania was the lead plaintiff in a 2017 lawsuit challenging the legislature’s map. The case ultimately resulted in the Supreme Court ordering the state to use its alternative for the 2018 mid-term elections. 
“We litigated it, and the result was a court ruling that resulted in a map that was more fair, cleaner, more appropriate, more constitutional,” League of Women Voters of Pennsylvania President Susan Gobreski said in a call with reporters Thursday.
Gobreski and others say the mailer is misleading and threatens judicial independence.
“Everyone has the right to an opinion, but no one has the right to lie to voters and call it democracy,” Gobreski said. “They should really pull these mailers and apologize to voters.”
The mailer shows the 2011 map with two of its districts sprawling over multiple counties circled in red. Next to the map is the message “The liberal Supreme Court gerrymandered our congressional districts to help Democrats win.”
In fact, the court first ordered the General Assembly to produce a map that passed constitutional muster without putting partisan interests ahead of neutral lines that avoided splitting counties and municipalities. When the legislature and then-Gov. Tom Wolf, a Democrat, failed to agree on an alternative, the court provided its own.
The GOP challenged the court’s map in federal court but was unsuccessful in overturning it. The redistricting resulted in a net gain of three congressional districts for Democrats, changing the state’s representation in the U.S. House from a 12-6 Republican majority to a 9-9 tie.
With the election three weeks away, the League of Women Voters is urging voters to seek trustworthy information about the justices and the election from nonpartisan organizations like itself and the Pennsylvania Bar Association, which has an independent commission that evaluates every candidate for statewide judicial office. It has rated all three “recommended for retention.”
Dickinson College President John E. Jones III, who is a retired U.S. district judge, said judicial retention elections, which coincide with municipal elections, generally have low voter turnout and those who vote often know little about the judges or their records. 
Jones noted the only time a Pennsylvania justice has lost a retention vote was 2005, when voters responded to the midnight pay raise that the General Assembly approved earlier that year by broadly voting against incumbents. Justice Russel Nigro was not retained by a narrow margin, while Justice Sandra Schultz Newman was retained with 54% of the vote. Retention vote margins are typically in the range of 60% to 75%. 
“It had nothing to do with Justice Nigro’s bona fides as a justice, but rather the prevailing political climate,” Jones told the Capital-Star. “I’m concerned that if the three justices who are subject to the retention votes are simply unelected because of their party affiliations, then we’ve missed the point of what the retention elections are supposed to be.”
Donohue, Dougherty and Wecht were elected as Democrats in 2015, defeating three Republican nominees in the only election where three new justices have been elected in the court’s more-than-300-year history. A defeat in this year’s retention election would result in competitive elections in 2027 and a chance to swing the court’s ideological balance in favor of conservatives.
The mailer was paid for by Commonwealth Leaders Fund, a political action committee whose treasurer Matthew Brouilette is linked with two other groups spending money to influence the Supreme Court election. 
Yass, the founder of trading firm Susquehanna International Group, contributed $1.25 million to his pro-school choice Students First PAC this year, according to campaign finance reports. Last year Yass donated $16 million to the PAC, chaired by SIG Counsel Geoff Bushko. 
This year and last, most of the money flowed to Brouilette’s PAC, Commonwealth Children’s Choice Fund. The Children’s Choice Fund in 2024 gave nearly $12 million to Commonwealth Leaders Fund, much of which was spent during the presidential election, according to campaign finance records.
Commonwealth Leaders Fund has spent about $185,000 on expenses labeled “direct mail” or “mailing” so far this year, according to campaign finance reports, the most recent of which was due Sept. 15. Reports for the other groups, Commonwealth Partners and Citizens for Term Limits, whose names appear on ads and mailers about the retention election, were not available online.
A spokesperson for Susquehanna International Group who returned a call seeking comment from Yass said he had no comment. Commonwealth Partners, which administers the PACs, did not respond to a request for comment.
In recent years, spending in Supreme Court elections in Pennsylvania and elsewhere have set new records year upon year. Candidates in the 2015 election where Donohue, Dougherty and Wecht were elected spent $15.8 million. That was surpassed in 2023 when now-Justice Daniel McCaffery and his Republican opponent spent more than $19.5 million, which included nearly $4.5 million from Yass’ PAC. 
The same year, the Wisconsin Supreme Court race shattered the national record with more than $100 million in spending, including nearly $30 million from Elon Musk, the world’s richest man..  
The heavy political spending in Pennsylvania’s judicial elections perverts the intent of the retention process, said Deborah Gross, executive director of Pennsylvanians for Modern Courts, a nonprofit that advocates for court access.
Pennsylvania adopted its system of electing jurists and retaining them for subsequent terms after the 1967 constitutional convention, which modernized the commonwealth’s foundational document. It followed decades of criticism over the process of electing judges and justices, which had been in place since 1850.
The new system would combine direct election by the people with a nonpartisan, non-competitive re-election that spared incumbent judges the rigors of a campaign while allowing the public to decide on judges’ fitness to continue serving based on their prior term.
But Gross said the system wasn’t intended to take the judges’ interpretation of law into account.
“If someone is not doing their job properly, if they’re not showing up for court, if they’re doing bad acts, if they have judicial conduct issues. Those are reasons why someone should not be retained,” Gross said. “Judges are doing their jobs when they’re interpreting the law.”
Jones, who was appointed by President George W. Bush in 2002, presided over landmark cases challenging the teaching of “intelligent design” in public schools and Pennsylvania’s ban on same-sex marriage. Jones found both to be unconstitutional.
“It is problematic, I think, for jurists to be judged on one or two cases,” he said, adding that most voters don’t have the time or resources to consider the justices’ records in total. “They’re apt to potentially make a reactionary vote. It’s fueled by perhaps a misleading ad and just a lack of knowledge about the justices.”
The League of Women Voters of Pennsylvania is considering how to respond to the Commonwealth Leaders Fund mailing, Executive Director Amy Widestrom said, noting that some voters have already received mail ballots and are making their decisions.
In addition to the bar association’s ratings, the league and Pennsylvanians for Modern Courts hosted a “fireside chat” with the three justices that is available to view on YouTube. The league has also worked to aggregate trusted information about the judicial election.
“There’s a lot of really good nonpartisan information out there, and I know it’s hard to find, so we’re trying to consolidate it all into our website, and our partners are doing the same,” Widestrom said.",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/lossless-page1-1200px-Pennsylvania_Congressional_Districts_113th_Congress.tif-1024x681.png,,,2025-10-14 05:56:43.003040

(Photo by Mario Tama/Getty Images)As the federal government entered a shutdown on Oct. 1, 2025, competing narratives quickly emerged about the cause.
Some Republican lawmakers objected to Democrats’ push to include an extension of the expanded Affordable Care Act premium subsidies in a short-term funding bill and cited concerns about long-term spending. Democratic leaders countered that the subsidies are not a new demand but rather the continuation of a program that has helped keep record numbers of Americans insured since the pandemic – and therefore that the issue could not be delayed.
The result is a standoff that blends fiscal and policy disagreements – a hallmark of contemporary budget politics.
As experts in health law, we see this issue as simple but consequential from a legal standpoint. Congress authorized the enhanced subsidies in 2021, originally to cushion the economic fallout from COVID-19 for families, and extended them through 2025 in the Inflation Reduction Act.
Without new legislation, the subsidies revert to pre-2021 levels on Jan. 1, 2026 – which would lead to a jump in the cost of health insurance and would make coverage unaffordable for millions of Americans.
 Enhanced subsidies explained

Most Americans under age 65 get insurance through their employers, which the federal government subsidizes by making it tax-free. Medicare, the program for older Americans, and Medicaid, the program that mainly serves low-income Americans, are heavily supported by subsidies too.
But as of 2025, about 1 in 6 people under age 65 do not have access to this coverage, including many small-business owners and tradespeople, as well as part-time workers and those in the gig economy. For them, unsubsidized health insurance can be prohibitively expensive.
To address this affordability problem, the ACA provided for households earning between 100% and 400% of the federal poverty level to receive subsidies for purchasing policies on the ACA marketplace, effectively lowering premiums. The original law limited subsidies only to those making under 400% of the federal poverty level, which is, for a family of four in 2025, around US$128,000 per year. A family making $129,000 a year, however, would have to pay full price.
The American Rescue Plan temporarily made two major changes in 2021:

It removed the 400%-of-poverty eligibility ceiling, extending help to many middle-income families.
It capped the maximum household contribution at 8.5% of income for everyone, ensuring affordability regardless of income.

If these reforms expire in 2026, the Internal Revenue Service must revert to the older, less generous formula.
 What the subsidies accomplished

The enhanced subsidies drove ACA marketplace participation to historic highs – more than 24 million people selected plans for 2025, up from about 11 million in 2020. The Department of Health and Human Services found disproportionate enrollment gains among Black and Latino Americans, helping to reduce racial disparities in coverage.
For many low-income enrollees, mid-level plans – called silver plans in the ACA marketplace – effectively became free. Middle-income families who previously earned just above the cutoff gained meaningful relief, sometimes saving thousands of dollars a year.
 What happens if subsidies expire?

Analysts broadly agree that returning to the pre-2021 rules would mean large cost increases and coverage losses. On average, the premiums that Americans will pay for ACA marketplace plans would more than double. The Kaiser Family Foundation estimates that average annual out-of-pocket premiums for an individual would jump from about $888 in 2025 to $1,900 in 2026.
With these increases, millions of Americans will lose their health insurance coverage. The Urban Institute, a think tank, projects that 7.3 million fewer people would receive subsidized marketplace coverage and 4.8 million more would become uninsured.
This is highly consequential, as research shows that insurance coverage saves lives by ensuring access to care. Knocking nearly 5 million people off insurance may cause as many as 500 additional deaths per year.
Losses would disproportionately impact low- and middle-income families. Free premium plans would disappear. Those making below 250% of the federal poverty level could see their net premiums rise more than fourfold, while those between 250% and 400% would see their premiums double. What’s more, rural Americans, already under pressure from the state of the economy, face higher risks.

 The fiscal and policy trade-offs

On the flip side, making the enhanced credits permanent would add about US$350 billion to federal deficits between 2026 and 2035, according to the Congressional Budget Office’s estimates. Proponents argue that the cost is justified by reduced medical debt, fewer uninsured, greater household stability and ultimately saving lives. Short-term savings from cutting the subsidies would also lead to higher health care costs, longer-term. But critics worry it’s a broad and expensive way to support affordability, benefiting some higher-income households that could otherwise afford coverage, even though it would cost more than 8.5% of their income.
Another concern is how the subsidies affect price competition. Under the ACA, the government pays most of the difference between what a household is expected to contribute and the actual cost of a standard benchmark plan. That means if health insurance companies raise their premiums, those who receive subsidies don’t feel the effect of the premium increases, because the federal subsidy simply grows to cover it. That means companies have fewer reasons to compete on price.
 Legal and administrative constraints

Because the subsidies are written into the tax code, only Congress can extend them or make them permanent. The question of whether to renew them was already debated strenuously when Congress passed the big tax and spending package that President Donald Trump signed into law on July 4, 2025. By omitting the subsidies, the bill effectively raised health care costs for millions of middle-income Americans. States that run their own marketplaces may add some aid, but few can match the scale of federal support.
Administrative timing matters too. The IRS, health insurers and the online marketplace all need to know how the subsidy amounts will be calculated – in other words, which income limits and premium caps Congress wants to use. These figures determine how much financial help people get when they sign up for coverage. Late or temporary fixes can create confusion for both consumers and administrators.
 Options before Congress

Lawmakers have several options, each with different trade-offs.
A permanent extension would provide stability for consumers and insurers – but at the cost of higher long-term federal spending. A short-term renewal of one to four years could soften the immediate jump in premiums while giving Congress time to reassess the policy, but it would continue the cycle of temporary fixes.
Alternatively, a targeted approach might preserve the larger subsidies for lower-income households but gradually reduce assistance for higher earners so that they aren’t guaranteed a cap of 8.5% of their income for insurance. This would make the policy more fiscally restrained but less universal.
Some legislators have also proposed offsetting the cost of ACA subsidies by pairing an extension with savings elsewhere in the health system. Those savings could come from trimming what the government pays insurers to lower patients’ out-of-pocket costs or by reducing Medicare payments to doctors.
Each of these options reflects a different balance among affordability, fiscal responsibility and administrative simplicity. Together, they highlight how difficult it is to design a policy that meets all three goals at once.
 A structural challenge

The problem isn’t just political – it’s built into how time-limited programs like the enhanced ACA subsidies are designed. The subsidies have always reflected partisan divides, but their temporary nature makes those divides even sharper. Lawmakers limited them to a few years to keep costs down, but that choice now means Congress has to reopen the same debate every year.
When deadlines for renewing programs collide with larger funding fights, important benefits can lapse, not because lawmakers chose to end them but because the fights over broader spending leave little room for resolution.
In the end, it’s up to Congress to decide not only whether these subsidies continue, but whether big social policies like this should be settled through last-minute budget showdowns. For now, getting the government running and keeping health insurance affordable are part of the same fight.

I am a single mom — making ends meet often means adding a gig to your income.
I thought driving full time for a rideshare app might be the safety net I needed. It wasn’t about having what I needed, it was about having an option to make cash. Any time I turned to driving it was to supplement or be my full-time income because I needed immediate cash.
The advertisements on social media about the flexible hours, potential upside, and being your own boss are not close to the reality of the circumstances of your everyday rideshare driver. What I experienced was reflected in a later report that came out on driver and gig experience by Jobs with Justice. It narrated exactly what I had experienced — often driving around the city looking for a ride to just pay for the gas without rides that help pay for that gas.
Some days I drove for 14 hours straight without making minimum wage when I had to turn around and pay for car maintenance. As the report indicated, our reported mileage, income, hours and unpaid time add up, and across all three gig platforms it studies — Uber, Lyft and Doordash — it found that drivers were making around $5.49 an hour.

Read that again. Drivers are making on average $5.49 an hour.
This means that Uber and Lyft have created a second class of workers — unable to reach benefits, or any rights that workers do in other sectors, since rideshare companies call themselves “non-employers,” evading any responsibility over the people who work for them. There is no employer liability. Drivers are on their own, and making less than minimum wage. Minimum wage in Denver in 2025 is $18.81 per hour for non-tipped employees and $15.79 per hour for tipped employees. These corporate giants are making people work for one-third of the minimum wage in metro Denver. Seems like a crime, right?
Imagine chasing cash with your car when you have to worry about the constant fear that one complaint or algorithm change would end your income immediately.
I drove across Interstate 25 and even Lyfted across Summit County multiple times, during three winters, which left a tremendous cost on my car. When I had to replace my brakes, I was out of that income again.
One Friday evening I remember parking near Union Station in downtown Denver, waiting for a ping by my old office after being laid off. The first two hours of driving were filled with short trips: a half-mile drop, a quick run across the block, a drunk man who verbally accosted me, someone who puked in my back seat, each ride earning me around $6 or $7. Then a longer ride popped up, about 16 miles across town I’d get $13 for. Add in the mileage, gas and wear on my car, and that longer ride was hardly worth the time. By the end of six hours on the road, I had about $60 before expenses, well under minimum wage before subtracting gas, insurance, maintenance, and self-employment taxes.
Many days the promise of “flexibility” felt more like economic fragility.
National industry data shows that gig drivers’ earnings have declined in recent years, even as hours on the road have increased. In one analysis, drivers saw a 3% drop in average weekly earnings while logging more hours, a lose-lose equation. Federal regulators have even taken action against gig companies for advertising exaggerated earnings potential, underscoring what most drivers already know: The advertised $25 or $30 an hour is far from what most of us see after expenses.
Do the math. Suppose you gross $25 an hour on the app during a “busy” period. Subtract platform fees, gas, insurance, car depreciation and taxes. Then factor in the unpaid hours spent waiting for rides. That $25 shrinks fast, often into single digits an hour.
Denver is not unique. This is the reality of gig work across the state and the country. But here in Colorado, rideshare platforms are essential parts of our transportation system. Students, seniors and late-night workers depend on them. That dependence makes it easy to forget that behind every ride is a driver absorbing nearly all the risk with no protections from any employer, because Uber and Lyft are not considered employers and thus are unable to offer worker protections that those workers would otherwise have if they were not considered independent contractors.
Colorado has the opportunity to lead for our gig workers who are marginalized by these corporate giants and their anti-worker policies. Transparent earnings, caps on how much companies can take from a driver for a ride, portable benefits, better deactivation rules and support for cooperative models are all areas we know drivers are concerned with.
I eventually left driving full time. The physical and emotional toll was too high and I had to replace my brakes — a $700 job that can’t be done with my income as a driver. I am one of 248,378 gig workers who have been broadly defined as independent contractors and make up 12% of Colorado’s workforce. This workforce (potentially over 1 in 10 Colordans) does not have access to basic worker rights, let alone minimum wage.
It’s time that changes.

Mark Warner (left) and Tim Kaine of Virginia are co-sponsoring legislation to protect federal workers from evictions and loan defaults during the shutdown. (Official U.S. Senate photo by Rosa Pineda)As the federal government shutdown stretches into its third week, Virginia’s U.S. senators are backing a bid to shield federal workers and contractors from the fallout. Last week, Sens. Mark Warner and Tim Kaine joined 16 other Senate Democrats in introducing the Federal Employee Civil Relief Act, a bill intended to protect federal employees, federal contractor staff and their families from evictions, foreclosures, repossessions and defaults during a funding lapse.
The legislation would halt evictions or foreclosures, stop repossession of vehicles or other property, prevent negative credit impacts, pause student loan default consequences, and let workers stay current on bills and insurance premiums — protections that would remain in place for the duration of a shutdown plus 30 days afterward.
“Through no fault of their own, hundreds of thousands of dedicated public servants in Virginia have been furloughed or are currently working without pay. That creates real financial strain for families trying to keep up with mortgages, student loans, and other bills,” Warner said in a statement. “This legislation will help ensure federal workers and contractors aren’t forced to bear the cost of a shutdown they didn’t cause.” 
Kaine pressed a similar point: “During a government shutdown, federal employees and contractors are forced to work without pay, leaving many trying to figure out how they’re going to pay their rent, mortgage, car payment, or other bills. That’s why I’m introducing this legislation to help protect these federal workers and contractors from losing their home or defaulting on payments during a shutdown.”
The move comes as tens of thousands of federal workers and contractor employees across Virginia — and nationwide — navigate a precarious financial situation. In Richmond alone, more than 90 employees at the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) were furloughed without back pay when the federal shutdown halted Health and Human Services funding for nonessential operations.
Across Northern Virginia, which includes many suburbs home to federal workers, unemployment rates have risen as layoffs ripple through the region. Virginia’s unemployment rate has already ticked upward this year — reaching 3.6% in July — and in June it was the only state to record a monthly increase, according to data from Bureau of Labor Statistics. 
A Brookings summary of the DMV Monitor analysis shows that unemployment increases in the region have been particularly pronounced in the suburbs — Alexandria, Arlington, Fairfax and Loudoun counties are flagged as seeing the largest rises. 
 In Hampton Roads, a region especially dependent on federal and military presence, local officials have warned of reduced consumer spending and economic drag on restaurants, retailers and other businesses.
Virginia is particularly vulnerable: More than 147,000 civilian federal employees live in the state, and Northern Virginia is among the areas feeling the stiffest economic aftershocks of federal downsizing.
In Fairfax County alone, roughly 80,000 federal workers live in the area, and county officials have been preparing emergency resources to help families with food, rent and utilities.
The Senate legislation is backed by major labor groups, including the National Treasury Employees Union, American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE), National Active and Retired Federal Employees Association, UNITE HERE and others. 
Doreen Greenwald, national president of NTEU, framed the bill as a safeguard for civil servants who otherwise carry the burden of a political impasse.
“Federal employees have student loans, mortgages, car payments, and other financial commitments just like every other American. Those obligations don’t go away during a shutdown,” Greenwald said in a statement. 
“If passed, the Federal Employee Civil Relief Act will help civil servants across the nation have peace of mind when navigating the uncertainty posed when the government shuts down and their financial security is jeopardized. Federal employees serve the public daily. This legislation honors their service and ensures they aren’t penalized when circumstances arise that are no fault of their own.” 
AFGE President Everett Kelley added that “No public servant should be at risk of eviction, repossession, or losing health insurance simply because they are working without pay or furloughed.”
The shutdown began Oct. 1, after Congress failed to pass new appropriations, triggering the furlough of hundreds of thousands of workers and forcing many others to continue working without pay.
In an unprecedented step, the White House has also initiated mass layoffs — so-called reductions in force (RIFs) — rather than simply furloughing employees. That shift raises further risk for households that may lose employment entirely rather than simply enduring a pay interruption.
Amid the crisis, Virginia Democratic elected officials have responded sharply to the administration’s handling. 
Abigail Spanberger, the party’s nominee for governor, blasted mass firings of Virginia federal workers, saying she’s hearing from families “who are hurting because of the Trump Administration’s attacks on Virginia’s economy and workforce.” 
She criticized Republican leadership for refusing to oppose what she called reckless firings and pledged she would “never be afraid to stand up to the President when he attacks Virginians’ jobs.” 
Similarly, Democratic nominee for attorney general Jay Jones called the firings “reckless” and said he would act to stop any illegal terminations, accusing his opponent Jason Miyares of failing to stand up to Trump. 
At the legislative level, House Speaker Don Scott, D-Portsmouth, assailed Republicans for “hurt(ing) Virginia families by laying off workers on a Friday afternoon,” warning that “using people’s livelihoods as a partisan political bargaining chip is a cruel act.”
The Senate proposal is not the only effort underway. Some lawmakers have proposed paying federal employees working through the shutdown immediately, even while appropriations remain unresolved.
But back pay is now under renewed scrutiny. A White House Office of Management and Budget memo contends that the 2019 Government Employee Fair Treatment Act (GEFTA) does not automatically guarantee back pay after a shutdown unless Congress explicitly provides funds. Democrats strongly dispute that interpretation, arguing that previous practice and statutory purpose support retroactivity.
In the Senate, Warner and Kaine are banking on bipartisan concern for public servants to propel the civil relief act forward. Their effort is spearheaded by Sens. Brian Schatz, D-HI, and other Democrats. If passed, it would give affected workers a 30-day buffer following a shutdown to get back on track with bills and housing stability.
Whether the approach will gain traction in the divided Congress is uncertain — especially given the sharp standoff over core budget priorities.

Glenn Youngkin views data center infrastructure designed by Hyper. (Photo by Shannon Heckt/Virginia Mercury)As data centers continue to sprawl across Virginia — with hundreds already built and many more planned nationwide — the demand for the equipment powering these massive digital hubs is surging. Gov. Glenn Youngkin on Monday touted a Henrico company that can rapidly deploy hyperscale, AI, and colocation data center components.
Hyper, the Henrico-based manufacturer, cut the ribbon on its new headquarters, where engineers design electrical power distribution and cooling systems that regulate temperature and supply electricity to the racks housing the critical servers. 
The company’s technology uses a smaller, more efficient design than traditional cooling infrastructure and is engineered  to to minimize power loss throughout a data center’s system. It also touts its extensive U.S. manufacturing footprint as a way to ease supply chain challenges.
“(We) build it with the highest efficiencies of steel, copper, aluminum, so that there’s less loss through their distribution system, allowing more of the energy to go to the actual chips that do the work,” said Dennis Strieter, co-founder of Hyper. “Cooling’s the same way. We want to match the cooling with the actual output of the heat of the chip and we want those tied together through sensors so that we’re not over cooling the space and we’re not under cooling the space.”
Hyper’s model is to manufacture parts in 18 states across the country, ensuring components reach data centers quickly as construction booms nationwide. The company currently employs 40 people at its Henrico headquarters.
“We spend a lot of time focusing on on-time delivery, because right now, in the market, that’s what’s holding everybody up — they’re not getting the equipment to open the buildings on the day they promised their customer,” Strieter said. ”We’ve had to rethink the way that we designed products.”.
Data centers consume vast amounts of energy to cool the rows of server racks inside their buildings. While Hyper’s components are smaller and more efficient, it’s up to the data centers themselves to determine how to further reduce energy use as rack technology evolves.  
With Dominion Energy currently awaiting State Corporation Commission approval for a new rate class for data centers, lawmakers are examining how to expand Virginia’s energy capacity to sustain the fast-growing industry.
“We’ve got a lot of work to do on the policy front to make sure that data centers are able to take on their own power generation and are willing and able to take on the added cost of the infrastructure necessary for the big builds,” Youngkin said Monday. “We want more data centers here. It’s a big driver for our economic future and for our national security.”
On the energy side, some officials worry that not all proposed data centers will ultimately be built, potentially leaving the state with excess energy projects already in the pipeline. 
When asked whether there’s a possibility of an “AI bubble,” the governor said he remains encouraged by the strong demand for new data centers amid the rapid expansion of artificial intelligence across industries. He added that companies like Hyper will continue to play a vital role for decades to come.
“Huge supply with no demand, that’s what causes a crash,” Youngkin said “And in this case, there is giant demand, giant growth, and it’s being met with, of course, investment.”

(Photo by David Hansen for Rhode Island Current)Four months after millions of “No Kings” protesters rallied across the country against the policies of President Donald Trump and his administration, more peaceful protests are planned for Saturday, Oct. 18, including nine across Rhode Island.
That’s one more than the eight held in the Ocean State on June 14, when an estimated 5 million people participated in nationwide demonstrations under the “No Kings” label on June 14.
With demonstrations planned Saturday in the morning and afternoon, some might even consider joining in more than one, Robert Vitello, treasurer of the Newport Democratic City Committee, said. 
The Newport Democratic committee is arranging bus transportation from Aquidneck Island to Providence for the rally near the State House taking place from 1 to 3 p.m. 
Vitello told Rhode Island Current Monday that the group had filled at least one bus so far. Limited free tickets for a seat were available, but tickets can be reserved by donation through the end of Tuesday. 
“Many others are attending local events that are happening in the morning in Portsmouth, North Kingstown and other other towns, so people can attend both if they’re interested,” Vitello said via text message. 
Vitello participates in the committee’s weekly demonstrations near the Pell Bridge, to signal dissatisfaction with Trump’s administration. The bridge coalition gathers on Wednesdays and averages between 25 and 50 people, Vitello said.  
“The most amazing thing is the response from passing motorists, waving, giving us a thumbs up and honking their horns,” Vitello said. “We would be fooling ourselves if we thought that the constant barrage from the Trump White House isn’t taking [a] toll, but every day we get new supporters saying enough is enough.” 
A Sept. 18 press release from the national No Kings coalition organizing the protests describes the rallies as “a nationwide mobilization uniting millions of Americans in nonviolent protest against President Trump’s authoritarian actions and power grabs.”
Saturday’s protests were in the planning stages before the federal government entered a shutdown on Oct. 1, but the shutdown seems to have only added more fuel to organizers’ critiques of the Trump administration.  
National organizers bill the rallies as having “a shared commitment to nonviolent protest and community safety.” As of Monday, there were about 2,500 protests planned across the U.S. 
“I cannot sit by and watch what is happening to our country, from sending in the National Guard to our American cities to unleashing masked ICE agents who terrorize our neighborhoods, to using our U.S. Justice department to go after political adversaries,” Vitello said. “If you call these tactics for what they are, it is fascism, which is un-American.”
Groups involved in organizing the protests nationally include the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), the American Federation of Teachers, Common Defense, 50501, Human Rights Campaign and Indivisible. Home of the Brave, one of the groups involved in backing the No Kings events, launched a $1 million ad campaign in local and national newspapers to promote Saturday’s rallies, the Huffington Post reported Monday.
U.S House Speaker Mike Johnson criticized the protests in an Oct. 10 interview on Fox News.
“The theory we have right now, they have a ‘Hate America’ rally that’s scheduled for Oct. 18 on the National Mall,” Johnson said of one of the larger No Kings protests planned in Washington, D.C. “It’s all the pro-Hamas wing and the Antifa people, they’re all coming out. Some of the House Democrats are selling T-shirts for the event. And it’s being told to us that they won’t be able to reopen the government until after that rally because they can’t face their rabid base.”
The national No Kings coalition responded to Johnson in a statement.
“Speaker Johnson is running out of excuses for keeping the government shut down. Instead of reopening the government, preserving affordable healthcare, or lowering costs for working families, he’s attacking millions of Americans who are peacefully coming together to say that America belongs to its people, not to kings.



Here are where No Kings events are planned on Saturday

Sign up for their newsletter here.
The ongoing federal shutdown has eclipsed the final stretch of negotiations on an updated agreement to guide restoration of the Chesapeake Bay, leaving partner states to contemplate a less ambitious pact with scaled-back targets and modest cleanup goals.
Nearly all normally participating federal agencies have been absent from these deliberations since the Oct. 1 shutdown. The Chesapeake Bay Program’s management board met Thursday without that expertise to hammer out a proposal aimed at closing gaps identified by the public after a draft agreement was announced in July.
That draft agreement had drawn the ire of scientists, advocates and citizen groups for weakening legal accountability under the federal Clean Water Act and diluting the enforcement of the bay’s longstanding pollution limits, known as the Total Maximum Daily Load, or TMDL.
The last bay agreement was struck in 2014 by the six partner states—Maryland, Virginia, Pennsylvania, Delaware, New York and West Virginia—along with the District of Columbia, the federal government as represented by the U.S. Environment Protection Agency (EPA) and the Chesapeake Bay Commission.
 Scaled-back framework sparks concern

The new framework proposed in July cut the previous agreement’s 10 goals to four and 31 outcomes to 21. As Inside Climate News reported earlier, pollution targets were left blank, deadlines were pushed back as far as 2040 and oversight timelines were replaced with undefined “X-year” review periods. Several restoration goals were scaled back without explanation.
All that happened before the federal shutdown. But the impact of now largely shuttered agencies was visible during the meeting Thursday, with key federal staff absent and progress on the new bay agreement in question, people familiar with the negotiations told Inside Climate News.
Among the agencies whose participation was cut short by the shutdown are the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the U.S. Geological Survey and the National Park Service.
Only the EPA was present. The agency acted on behalf of the federal government, but several attendees told Inside Climate News that they felt the lack of the scientific and technical expertise the missing agencies would typically provide in shaping restoration targets.
A vote on the proposed target for waterbird conservation went forward without the input of the Fish and Wildlife Service, while other issues requiring input from the Department of Defense and Army Corps of Engineers were deferred, attendees told Inside Climate News. The EPA cast interim votes representing the federal government, but there was no way to know whether the outcomes would have been different if all partners were at the table.
“We won’t know until the shutdown ends whether decisions taken in their absence align with how all federal agencies would have voted,” Keisha Sedlacek, senior policy director at the Chesapeake Bay Foundation, said in an email. “We do know that Fish and Wildlife Service would have voted in favor of having waterbirds in the agreement, which EPA voted to remove.”
That target, which refers to tracking and protecting bird populations that rely on the Bay’s tidal and non-tidal wetlands, squeaked in with a 5-4 vote.
Gregg Bortz, a spokesperson for the Maryland Department of Natural Resources, acknowledged that “the inability to communicate with many federal agencies as we reach the end of the revision process is less than ideal.”
But he said in a statement that the federal shutdown has caused limited disruption so far because “the vast majority of the progress and discussions, and virtually all of the technical input, occurred prior to the shutdown.”
 Fear, funding cuts and fading ambition

Also clouding the negotiations were concerns over setting restoration targets that may prove difficult to meet if the Trump administration keeps cutting funding and states’ budgetary constraints persist. Draft revisions on Thursday included lower or unchanged goals for fish passage, wetlands, protected lands and public access, marking a retreat from the previous decade’s progress, several attendees told Inside Climate News.
As the session concluded, some attendees worried that even EPA’s participation could lapse if the shutdown continues, potentially delaying final adoption of the new bay agreement beyond the Oct. 28 target. If the proposal isn’t hammered out soon, the final agreement could get pushed to January, under new executive council leadership.
Kristin Reilly, director of the Choose Clean Water Coalition, said the shutdown and uncertainty surrounding federal funding have produced a cautious, scaled-back bay agreement.
“It seems like a big part of what’s driving some of the decisions in this agreement is fear,” she said. “There’s a fear of not achieving the targets that they set … and that’s reflected in what we’re seeing over the course of several outcomes and targets in the agreement.”
She pointed to wetlands as an example. The proposed target of 3,000 tidal and 3,000 nontidal acres falls below what scientists recommended. She added that while she was glad the waterbird target narrowly survived, “it was disappointing that it came down to such a close vote.”
If the agencies don’t return soon, Reilly warned, some jurisdictions may not feel comfortable moving forward on the agreement.
Sedlacek, the Chesapeake Bay Foundation senior policy director, said it remains unclear how deeply the shutdown will affect the agreement process. “For now,” she said in an email, “the restoration partners remain on track to have a final revised Bay Agreement ready for the Executive Council to approve on December 2. We should know better whether they can finish on time by … October 28.”
She said that while the management board’s latest language on protected lands and wetlands is “stronger than what was in the initial draft,” those goals “still need to be strengthened.”
Jon Mueller, former vice president for litigation at the Chesapeake Bay Foundation, said the absence of key scientific agencies could weaken the integrity and ambition of the agreement.
“My understanding is that some states and, in some cases, EPA, are suggesting the elimination of some of the non-nutrient targets,” he said, referring to goals not directly relevant to nitrogen, phosphorus and sediment reduction, such as outcomes for wetlands and fish. “However, federal agencies like NOAA have federal protection and scientific monitoring obligations and have, in the past, expressed interest in maintaining these targets. … Without their presence, their advocacy for maintaining robust targets will be lost.”
Mueller added that enforcement and permitting oversight, already weakened in recent years, could suffer further under the shutdown. “EPA Region II and III play a significant role in monitoring Clean Water Act point source permitting and enforcement within the bay watershed,” he said. “Even without the shutdown we have seen federal enforcement reduced either because of firings at EPA and DOJ [the Department of Justice] or because those are no longer priorities.”
He added: “Without federal oversight, states with delegated permitting authority—Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Delaware — are free to operate on their own.”
Bortz, the Maryland Department of Natural Resources spokesman, said the state views the current draft as an important update that reflects scientific progress since the last agreement, even if compromises were inevitable.
“Maryland did not get everything it sought in the current draft of the revised agreement, but neither did any other partner,” Bortz said. “As with any partnership, reasonable compromise is to be expected between six states, the District of Columbia, the federal government, and the Chesapeake Bay Commission working to meet a common goal.”
Asked about the impact of the shutdown to the process, a spokesperson for EPA emailed a brief statement: “EPA always spends according to the law. Congressional Democrats have chosen to shut down the government. If they want to re-open the government, they can choose to do so at any time.”",https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/GettyImages-2166526241-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-14 05:56:43.003040

(Photo by Lauren McCauley/ Maine Morning Star)If voters approve Question 2 on the November ballot, Maine would end up with two laws on the books that would make it possible to remove firearms from someone considered to be dangerous. 
While twenty-one states, including four in New England, have what is known as a red flag law, Maine is the only one that takes a different approach with its so-called yellow flag law. Both are forms of extreme risk protection orders, which are used to temporarily confiscate firearms from someone who poses a risk of danger to themselves or others. 
In November, Maine voters will be asked if they want the state to adopt a red flag law. If passed, the law would not replace the existing statute, but rather make both processes available for use in the state.
Gov. Janet Mills recently argued in an op-ed against the referendum that the co-existence of both policies would “create a new, separate and confusing process that will undermine the effectiveness of the law and endanger public safety along with it.”
But proponents see a red flag law as another tool for keeping Mainers safe that could work in concert with the existing policy without stigmatizing mental illness.
Five years into the yellow flag law
Maine’s existing statute allows law enforcement to take guns away from people after a mental health evaluation, whereas red flag laws — like the one proposed in Question 2 — allow family or household members to petition a court directly for someone’s firearms to be temporarily removed. 
Since Maine is the only state with a yellow flag law, it would be the only state to see these two laws exist in tandem. 
Michael Rocque, a professor of sociology at Bates College, said the potential for confusion lies in the fact that people still don’t know exactly what a yellow flag is. 
“If we passed the red flag law, I would imagine that that would sort of supersede the yellow flag law in terms of usage,” he said, arguing the nuance of Maine’s yellow flag law would encourage people to opt for the red flag process that presents as more streamlined. 
He pointed to a report from the independent commission that investigated the October 2023 mass shooting in Lewiston that underscored how confusing the yellow flag process was at that time. 
Use of Maine’s yellow flag law continues to be consistently high

In the aftermath of the shooting, some law enforcement officials said the yellow flag law was difficult to use. This testimony was followed up by a finding from the commission that the Sagadahoc County Sheriff’s Office had sufficient probable cause to both take the perpetrator, Robert Card II, into protective custody under Maine’s yellow flag law and start a petition to confiscate his firearms. 
While it is still time and resource intensive, Lt. Michael Johnston of the Maine State Police said changes made to the yellow flag law last year, as well as additional training for law enforcement, has made it less cumbersome. And there’s data to back it up. 
As of the beginning of this month, the yellow flag law had been used more than 1,100 times. Johnston said 81 of those occurred between 2020, when the law was implemented, and late 2023. More than 1,000 uses occurred in the past two years at a rate of 1.5 per day, he said. 
It takes time to adapt to a new law, but it gets smoother and easier to execute with repetition, Johnston said. And now that law enforcement has more familiarity and practice with the current law, Johnston argued that adding a new policy “could potentially detract, undermine or take away resources from a law” that he believes is working well.
Like Mills, he believes having both laws could create confusion, especially for families who may need to navigate these sorts of supports. 
“It could potentially muddy the waters when it comes to the relief that families are seeking,” he said. “Do they call law enforcement? Do they try to petition the court? Which process do they follow?”
Should mental health professionals be involved?
Critics have also taken issue with the absence of a mental health element in the red flag proposal, while supporters and industry professionals applaud it for separating violence from mental illness.
Maine Rep. Jennifer Poirier (R-Skowhegan), said mental health is “of the utmost importance here,” and the yellow flag law can connect people with the help and services they may need.
“No person of sound mind is going to want to harm themselves or somebody else… so we need to focus first on the root of the problem and that’s concerning mental health,” she said.
But Jack Sorensen, who does communications for the Maine Gun Safety Coalition and Question 2 campaign, argued that is a misunderstanding of the current law because the stipulated mental health evaluation “is a stamp of approval by a mental health professional that someone should have their firearms removed,” but does nothing to get them actual treatment.
Sorensen also said it’s a misconception that the mental health evaluation in the yellow flag process makes the situation safer because mental health challenges are not a precursor for violence. For this reason, mental health professionals such as the Maine Association of Psychiatric Physicians have voiced their support for Question 2. 
“All of us will experience a moment of crisis in our lives at some point. That doesn’t mean we are mentally ill,” Sorsenson said. “So, conflating mental illness with preventable gun deaths is not only misleading, but it’s dangerous. It’s dangerous because it overlooks the reality of a lot of lives that could otherwise be saved.”
But Johnston with the State Police said most of the scenarios that he’s seen the yellow flag law invoked either involve criminal behavior or, more commonly, a mental health crisis involving someone who is suicidal. 
“The overwhelming majority of them, they are not bad people, they are going through a difficult time,” Johnston said. “They are human beings that are having a hard time for whatever reason.”
Which one would be faster?
Both those for and against the red flag proposal agree that, in the case of someone posing a threat of danger, they shouldn’t be in possession of a firearm. But there are diverging thoughts as to which policy would contain those situations faster, as well as the value of involving law enforcement from the beginning.
Sorenson and the gun safety coalition say that it’s a good thing communities have had more success with Maine’s yellow flag law in recent years. But, he said, “the fact that it has been used more and more underscores the need for these types of laws and the need for a better, proven, more effective tool.”
He argued that the proposed red flag law would separate a dangerous person from their firearms more quickly and efficiently because families can go directly to a court to file a petition. 
Rocque, the Bates professor, argued the two policies could work in tandem. For example, in a case involving a threat of suicide, he said someone could use the red flag process to immediately remove the firearms and then follow up with the yellow flag process to get a mental health professional involved.
But critics question that reasoning since it relies on the availability of the courts and stipulates a 14-day window for a hearing to be held. Johnston pointed out that law enforcement works round the clock, while courthouses could be closed on weekends or have even more limited hours in rural areas. 
If someone came to law enforcement on a Saturday with a concern about a family member posing a risk of danger, for example, Johnston said that would require an immediate response. “Would we tell them to go to the court and petition? The answer is no,” Johnston said.
Early police intervention is a key feature for proponents of the yellow flag process. 
In her recent op-ed, Mills said the yellow flag “gets law enforcement involved early for good reason.”
Johnston also argued the existing law can better protect law enforcement since they are more aware of potential dangers from the start. Showing up to someone’s house to remove weapons after a red flag process has been initiated could require additional officers or resources, he said, because law enforcement would have less information about the situation.

(Photo by Ethan DeWitt/New Hampshire Bulletin)Winter ski season is on the horizon, but New Hampshire is still deep in drought, putting some snowmakers at the state’s mountain resorts on edge. 
With evolving technology and strategic snowmaking, the snowmakers said they expect to keep skiers on the trails this winter despite current water shortages. But like warming winters, recurring late-summer droughts are part of a larger climate change-driven pattern that has complicated the task of running a ski resort in the Northeast. While technology upgrades can help, experts said they also recognize that the industry is changing in ways that can’t be circumvented.
“Now we’re being limited not only by temperature, but potentially by water as well,” said Caitlin Hicks Pries, a Dartmouth researcher and associate professor of biology whose work studying snowpack has intersected with her love of skiing. However, she said, advances in technology — and, potentially, a mindset shift — can help for now.
As of Oct. 7, more than half of New Hampshire was in “extreme drought,” according to an Oct. 9 report from the U.S. Drought Monitor. This reflects a recurring pattern of dry periods in late summer that is driven by climate change, according to New Hampshire State Climatologist Mary Stampone.
Ski mountains across the state get their snowmaking water from different sources, some of which are more vulnerable than others to drought-driven water shortages, said Hicks Pries. A spring-fed lake, for example, will be less immediately affected by drought than a stream fed by mountainside runoff.
Regardless, most everyone in the industry senses the urgency of water conservation, said David Ulbrich, mountain operations director at Gunstock Mountain Resort in Gilford, who has also worked at ski resorts in Vermont, Maine, and New York. 
“We’ve definitely, as an industry, had to be smarter with how we’re using our water, because, yeah, we have run into these problems at almost every resort I’ve been at,” he said.
On Oct. 8, Ulbrich had just returned from checking on the runoff-fed stream that Gunstock will dam in late October to create a reservoir for snowmaking. After some morning rain, Ulbrich said he was relieved to find the stream running again after it had gone dry in late summer.
“You can’t take (water) for granted anymore,” he said.
To cope with this reality, coupled with increased temperature ups and downs midwinter that can melt snow off trails, Ulbrich and his crew have adapted their approach to snowmaking, spreading the effort out across the winter season. Traditionally, a snowmaking crew would make all their snow — maybe five feet on a typical trail — in one go at the outset of the season, he said. But this strategy risks losing all that snow, and labor, to a thaw or warm rain midwinter. So, when water is limited and thaws increasingly common, the team has adapted to making less snow at the beginning of the season, then returning to their trails later in the year to add more.
“It does make sense not to put all your snow eggs in one basket,” said Hicks Pries of this approach. But the method also requires more labor and time.
Snowmaking “is one of the most expensive things we have to do, as far as money and power go,” said Erik Barnes, general manager at Ragged Mountain Resort in Danbury. At Ragged, the snowmaking crew generally sticks to making all their snow in one go. They are aided by the fact that Ragged pulls its snowmaking water from a bog, which is generally a reliable source even in times of drought, Barnes said; this year, the driest since at least 1895, its water level is down only a fifth of an inch from its average, he said. 
Ragged is evolving in other ways, including by adopting high-efficiency snowmaking guns. These devices use compressed air to send water misting into the air, where it can freeze and be deposited on the slope as snow. More efficient snowmaking guns can accomplish that with less energy, less air, and less water, said Kris Blomback, general manager at Pats Peak, where the efficient guns are also in use. And making trails as smooth as possible is another way to lessen the amount of snow required for good skiing, Blomback said.
“The technology with the industry has really come a long way in the last two decades, and it’s good to see the commitment here,” Ulbrich said.
Yet, while efficient snow guns and other snow-maximizing measures are becoming an essential part of mountain adaptations, snowmakers are still limited by temperature. When it’s too warm, snowmaking is simply thwarted.
“It’s one of those things that, like, at a certain point, there’s nothing you can do,” Ulbrich said. “You know, at 32 degrees (Fahrenheit), there’s not much technology that’s going to help you make snow if things aren’t freezing.”
Some resorts engage in “snow farming,” using insulation to preserve heaps of snow through above-freezing temperatures so it can later be put to use for winter sports, said Hicks Pries. The technique is practiced at some locations in New England, but is more common in Europe, she said. 
As water scarcity and winter heat waves continue to challenge early-season snowmaking and snow retention, Hicks Pries said her research had led her to a new idea: What if the answer to preserving ski culture in the Northeast is a shift in timing?
“We are having less snow early in the season, less snowmaking weather early in the season,” she said. Meanwhile, though it’s more sporadic, precipitation is on the rise overall — and some preliminary climate data suggest that early spring months are becoming snowier, Hicks Pries said. 
“So, do we have to sort of rethink when the ski season is, and what’s realistic with our new climate?” she asked.
Adjusting to this shift in timing could involve accepting that some traditional ski weeks — like those around the winter holidays — have less reliable snow and may no longer be in the optimal skiing season. But maybe, Hicks Pries said, skiers could make up for that later in the year.
Adapted snowmaking schedules, like what Ulbrich described at Gunstock, seem to reflect the adaptations already taking place in the industry. Meanwhile, resort operators said they were optimistic ahead of this winter’s season that autumn rains would replenish their reservoirs.
“We’re still 45 plus days away from heavy-duty snowmaking so we still have some time for the storm clouds to reappear and right the ship,” Blomback said.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/snowmakingnew-1024x796.jpg,,,2025-10-14 05:56:43.003040

Ohioans who sell intoxicating hemp products are worried what the 90-day ban that goes into effect today (Tuesday) will mean for their businesses and customers.  
Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine recently announced a 90-day executive order that bans the sale of intoxicating hemp products that starts Oct.14. 
Intoxicating hemp products are items that contain THC that are sold anywhere other than licensed marijuana dispensaries including gas stations, smoke shops, and CBD stores, among others.  
Todd Hicks opened his new CBD store in Columbus days before DeWine announced the ban.

“It’s been heartbreaking,” he said. “Honestly, it’s been totally heartbreaking. I don’t know which direction to go.”
Hicks said he will likely have to close his new shop and let go of his three employees. 
“I can’t afford them,” he said. “Well, there’s nothing for them to do, right? They can’t sell the product. There’s no one going to be answering the door or coming to the door to actually buy the product. So I don’t need them.”
Children getting ahold of intoxicating hemp products is a parental issue, Hicks said. 
“They’re digging it out of their parents’ purse or something like that,” he said. “It’s not a sale issue.”
Mark Fashian, president of hemp product wholesaler Midwest Analytical Solutions in Delaware, Ohio, said the ban will put him out of business. He works with more than 500 stores around Ohio that sell intoxicating hemp products. 
“We typically will sell to smoke shops or gas stations or convenience stores or drive-thrus, and every one of those have a mechanism for carding anyone,” Fashian said. “There is definitely carding happening all over the place.”
He said those shops are worried about how the ban will impact them.   
“They’re just worried,” Fashian said. “They don’t know what to do. They don’t know what to do with their products.” 
Jim Higdon, co-founder of Cornbread Hemp in Kentucky, which sells its products in more than 300 Ohio retail stores, said the intoxicating hemp ban has caused lots of confusion.

“Our retailer and distributor partners are very unhappy,” he said. “… It’s really frustrating to watch the Republican Party be an anti-business party. … To see the governor and members of the legislature be anti-business on this front is very concerning when other states have been able to figure this out.”
Kim Bryant, a salesperson at Your CBD Store Marion, said the average age of their customer is 50 years old. 
“They want gummies for pain and gummies for sleep,” she said. “People want that instead of opioids or prescription drugs. … The older people, they have no desire to go to a medical marijuana or recreational marijuana facility.”
The store requires ID checks with every purchase, Bryant said.
“I would never, ever, sell anything to a minor,” she said. “I just feel like it’s unfair to the people that are doing all the right things when there’s one bad apple. … . This is a store that actually helps people.”
This ban includes THC-infused beverages, like the ones Collin Castore started selling at his three central Ohio breweries in March. The beverages contain five milligrams of THC. 
“A five milligram beverage is literally the equivalent of taking a puff off the average joint. It’s not rocking anyone’s world and throwing them into a psychedelic experience, 24-hour head trip. It’s just a slight altering of mood,” said Castore, who is the co-founder of Seventh Son Brewery, Antiques on High, and Getaway Brewing. 
These beverages have no alcohol in them and are “tested extensively,” he said. 
“We want this to be regulated,” Castore said. “Let’s keep low-dose THC beverages. Let’s just treat it the same as beer, and regulate it the same as beer, and everybody gets tax revenue from it, and we get to create jobs.”

Castore said their target demographic with THC-infused beverages is 35 to 55 year old women who want to take a break from alcohol — “not 10-year-old children.”
“I’ve really seen these beverages be a great way for some people who need to take a break from alcohol still have a way to relax after work or have a beverage with their friends and not feel excluded,” he said. 
There is a label on the cans saying the drinks are only for people 21 and older, and people are carded to purchase the beverages, just like alcohol, Castore said. 
The THC-infused beverages make up 10-15% of their wholesale business and about 5% on the retail side, Castore said. 
While it’s too early to put concrete numbers on how much revenue will be lost because of the ban, he said it won’t be good for business. 
“We’re gonna go from a year where we might have scraped by at breaking even to a year where we’re probably gonna lose money again, and it’s really frustrating,” Castore said. 
The craft beer industry has faced challenges this year navigating tariffs on aluminum, steel, and malted barley. 
“It just felt like we kind of had a win, and something that was working really well finally, and it’s just been yanked out from under us,” he said. 
Some people have turned to the THC-infused beverages as an alternative to alcohol, Higdon said.
“People are looking to reduce their alcohol consumption or have gone sober from alcohol and have found beverage products to be what they’re looking for, and taking these products away from those folks is particularly frustrating because they are gonna increase their alcohol consumption as a result,” he said. 
At least 32 states have some regulations on intoxicating hemp products.

Lawmakers see the potential for much-needed housing on church-owned land, but opponents worry local communities could lose their authority over neighborhood development. (Video screenshot courtesy of St. John's Lutheran Church)Growing up in a religious family, Florida Republican state Sen. Alexis Calatayud has seen how many church communities are no longer anchored to a single building in the way they used to be. Her small prayer groups take place over chats these days, not necessarily in person or sitting shoulder-to-shoulder in pews.
With churches in her Miami-Dade County district grappling with shrinking membership and aging buildings, Calatayud thinks those institutions can do good with their unused land, by acting as anchors of new housing rather than as bystanders in neighborhood redevelopment.
“When you look at someone sitting on a small church, on a 10-acre property with a dwindling congregation, the question becomes, ‘How can this entity continue to be the beating heart of the community?’” Calatayud said in an interview.
“I think it’s to create a village, where we can create more housing and even centralize other needs in the community on that land.”
This year, Florida enacted a measure, sponsored by Calatayud, allowing multifamily residential development on land that is both owned by a religious institution and occupied by a house of worship, so long as at least 10% of the new units are affordable. Some housing advocates believe the zoning override has the potential to unlock roughly 30,000 parcels statewide.
Florida’s new law is part of a growing movement known as YIGBY — Yes in God’s Backyard. Touted by many faith leaders, lawmakers and developers, the movement imagines a connection between a religious mission to serve and the very real hurdles of building affordable housing.
Housing advocates worry states can’t fill rental aid gaps if Trump cuts go through

If the U.S. is to meet the nation’s demand for new apartments, developers are going to need land, experts say, and parcels owned by faith-based organizations are starting to become a part of the solution for some states. At the same time, some skeptics question whether the movement could strip local communities of having a say in neighborhood development.
Places of worship are found in every corner of the United States. Land owned by faith-based organizations makes up 84 million square feet in New York City, for example, with enough land for 22,000 units on just the vacant lots and surface parking lots of those organizations, according to the Furman Center of New York University. Elsewhere, HousingForward Virginia says faith-based organizations own 74,000 acres in the state, nearly twice the size of Richmond.
California enacted what is considered the first statewide YIGBY law in 2023. It cleared the way for churches and other places of worship, as well as nonprofit universities, to create affordable housing on their land. It allows landowners to bypass public hearings, discretionary votes by city councils or planning boards, and certain environmental reviews so long as they meet affordability requirements, with at least 75% of the homes affordable for low-income households.
Several states — Arizona, Colorado, Kentucky, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New York and Texas — have considered YIGBY legislation this year, though none has passed. And a bill filed last month in Congress would allow rental properties to be built on currently unused church land with federal assistance.
Opponents of the Colorado bill frame it as state overreach on local zoning decisions and worry about a potential pathway for religious landowners to bypass Fair Housing Act protections for housing applicants who may not share that faith, according to a position paper opposing Colorado’s YIGBY legislation.
Beverly Stables, a lobbyist for the Colorado Municipal League, told Stateline that local governments worry YIGBY bills could undermine constitutional home-rule authority and saddle towns with unfunded state mandates.
“Our members have worked successfully with schools and churches on housing projects already,” she said. “The question is, what problem are we really trying to solve?”
The Rev. Patrick Reidy, an associate professor of law at Notre Dame who has studied the relationship between housing and faith-based organizations, says states and cities are eager to partner with faith-based organizations to use their land.










The decision to change the way church land has been used historically for decades or even centuries is not easy for a place of worship.


– The Rev. Patrick Reidy, professor of law and co-director of the University of Notre Dame’s Church Properties Initiative


It’s not an easy decision for faith leaders to switch the purpose of their land from a devoted congregation space to housing, he said.
“The decision to change the way church land has been used historically for decades or even centuries is not easy for a place of worship to make, so lawmakers should meet faith communities where they are,” said Reidy, who also is co-director of Notre Dame’s Church Properties Initiative.
“It’s more an understanding that the way places of worship approach housing is from a moral mission to serve, so things like financing, zoning and legal know-how to create housing requires some walk-through for faith-based organizations,” Reidy said.
“The real challenge is learning to speak each other’s language.”
‘Right in the middle’
Every afternoon at 3:22, members of St. John’s Lutheran Church in Madison, Wisconsin, pause what they are doing and pray. Whether they are working, at home, watching baseball’s Milwaukee Brewers or sitting in a temporary worship space, they pray at that exact time.
It isn’t random: “322” is the address where the German Lutheran church has stood downtown at East Washington Avenue and North Hancock Street — just a block from the state Capitol — for 170 years, the Rev. Peter Beeson said.
Congregation members no longer worship there because the site could be set for the biggest transformation in its history: trading in stained-glass windows and church pews for a 10-story high-rise that will combine a worship space with more than 100 affordable apartments.
Beeson told Stateline that the congregation moved out of the building in the fall of 2023 for a groundbreaking later that same year.
“Our current building was built in 1905, and was nearing the end of its useful life, with many additions and renovations over the years,” Beeson said. “And it made sense to sacrifice our existing building to build affordable housing plus worship and community space as a way of serving our mission — providing much needed affordable housing for 130 or so families, and providing a home for the congregation for the next 150 years.”
The number of new apartments is at a 50-year high, but states expect a slowdown

The congregation, founded in 1856 by German Lutherans, has evolved with the needs of its community.
The church hosted a men’s homeless shelter for more than 20 years, ran a drop-in center for people with mental illness and offered small-scale aid for residents seeking anything from bus tickets to steel-toed work boots to child care, Beeson said.
Before construction could get underway on the housing project, though, Beeson and the church ran into a familiar issue that constrained housing across the country in 2023 — rapidly increasing construction costs and skyrocketing interest rates.
Beeson said he isn’t deterred. Other projects have taken 10 to 15 years to break ground, he said. “So keeping that timeline in mind, we are right in the middle.”
He believes the project, which has received sizable donations from community members via GoFundMe, is a God-ordained mission to provide a service for its community.
“We are continuing to move forward with the project. There have been setbacks and challenges along the way,” Beeson said. “However, like God led the Israelites through the wilderness with a pillar of fire by day and a pillar of clouds by night, God continues to open doors and pave pathways to bring this project to completion.”
Ceding local control
The economic realities surrounding homebuilding are among many hurdles challenging congregations that want to develop new housing.
In states such as Colorado, local governments worried that a proposed statewide development measure that would give preferential treatment to faith-based organizations could undermine local control and even potentially open the door to religious discrimination.
“Not suggesting it from all entities,” said Stables, of the Colorado Municipal League, “but we were concerned about the potential for discrimination, and potential violations of Fair Housing Act requirements.”
Stables also thinks this year’s legislation was premature, just a year after Colorado lawmakers made sweeping changes to land use rules — including new laws removing parking minimums and encouraging transit-oriented developments and accessory dwelling units — that she said haven’t had time to take effect or be meaningfully implemented locally.
She also said the bill would have stripped local governments of zoning authority while offering no new resources. More than 200 municipalities opted into an affordable housing fund created through a 2022 ballot initiative, Stables said, but the legislature has been sweeping out some of that money for other budgetary needs, leaving cities under-resourced to deliver on those housing goals.
In the end, Colorado’s legislation passed the House but died in the Senate after supporters concluded it didn’t have the votes to pass.
Cities lead bans on algorithmic rent hikes as states lag behind

YIGBY supporters elsewhere have had to balance the tension between state goals and local zoning authority. A 2019 Washington law requires cities and counties to offer density bonuses for affordable housing on religious land — an incentive, but not a legal override of zoning laws.
In Minnesota, state Sen. Susan Pha, a Democrat, told Stateline she modeled some aspects of her YIGBY proposal off the California law. She also tailored aspects of her bill — such as a focus on middle-housing options like small studios — to find solutions that work specifically for her state.
Pha said some of her big battles have been around the allowances of small lot sizes, such as 220-square-foot studio units, which she said the state “really needs” in order to make a dent in its housing shortage.
“The obstacle really is zoning,” Pha said. “If we can change some of those zoning requirements, we could produce more affordable housing and leverage the space and the dedicated work these faith-based organizations already do.”
Pha’s bill failed to reach a floor vote.
Other YIGBY-like policies have passed in localities including Atlanta; Montgomery County, Maryland; and Seattle. Atlanta’s program aims for the creation of at least 2,000 units of affordable housing over eight years.
When New York City passed its City of Yes housing initiative in December 2024, it permitted faith-based organizations to convert underused properties into housing by lifting zoning, height and setback requirements.
Unlocking land, a bit at a time
In an interview with Stateline, Atlanta Mayor Andre Dickens pointed out that some of the city’s historic churches sit on prime land with underused parking lots that at one time were filled by many of the churchgoers’ cars.
Unlike many developers who might flip properties after short-term affordability requirements expire, Dickens said, churches may offer stability, since their mission is to serve “the least, the less and the lost” — meaning they might be less likely to sell off the property due to market pressure.
Atlanta is working with financial partners such as Enterprise and Wells Fargo to guide faith-based institutions that need that help, he said.
“Churches are usually on great corners, and they’re hallmarks of the community with land that’s underutilized, and their mission aligns perfectly with affordable housing,” Dickens said. “We’ve got churches that say, ‘Teach us how to develop. We have no idea what we’re doing.’”
The potential is vast, experts say. California faith-based organizations and nonprofit colleges own about 170,000 acres of land, equivalent in size to the city of Oakland, and much of it could be developed under the state’s YIGBY law, according to a 2023 report by the Terner Center for Housing Innovation at the University of California, Berkeley.
In North Carolina, congregations have had small successes. A Presbyterian church in Charlotte turned an unused education wing into 21 units of permanent housing, and an Episcopal church in Chapel Hill built three tiny homes on its property for a trio of formerly homeless residents.
Eli Smith, the director of the nonprofit Faith-Based Housing Initiative, argues that state YIGBY laws should ease affordability requirements for small infill projects such as those in North Carolina and allow them to get built more quickly. Otherwise, he said, small churches’ projects “can’t get off the ground.”
“Think of it as a cottage neighborhood tucked behind a sanctuary — people know each other, it’s beautiful, it’s meaningful,” Smith said. “The future of this movement isn’t in [high-rise apartment] towers; it’s in small, intentional communities that fit their surroundings.”

Amber Roldan/Georgia Recorder (file photo)Grab your ID and get ready to head to the polls: Tuesday marks the first day of early voting for the 2025 statewide and municipal election in Georgia.
This year’s Nov. 4 general election is set to include candidates for two seats on the state’s five-member Public Service Commission, the body that regulates utilities like Georgia Power and plays an important role in deciding how much Georgians pay for services like electricity and natural gas. 
Georgia offers three weeks of early voting, which for this election will begin on Oct. 14 and conclude on Oct. 31. Early voting is offered during the week and on some Saturdays at most locations, and will also be available on Sundays in some counties.
What is on my ballot besides the PSC?
The Public Service Commission election will be the only statewide office on the ballot this fall, but some cities and towns are also scheduled to hold municipal elections for offices like mayor, city council, and school board. Some Georgia residents will also be able to vote on local ballot initiatives. To find your sample ballot, visit the secretary of state’s My Voter Page tool online.
Where can I vote early?
Unlike election day voting, when residents must cast a ballot at their assigned polling place, voters are free to visit any early voting location in their county. The Georgia Recorder has compiled a list of early voting locations, which can be viewed in map or list form. Use the search function to more easily find early voting locations in your county.




What do I need to bring with me to the polls?
Voters in Georgia are required to present a photo ID, such as a driver’s license or U.S. passport, when voting in person or by mail. 
According to the secretary of state’s website, accepted forms of identification include: 

A Georgia driver’s license
A student ID from any of Georgia’s public colleges, universities, or technical colleges (private college and university IDs do not count) 
A valid employee photo ID from any agency, branch, department or entity of the U.S. government
A valid U.S. passport 
A valid U.S. military photo ID 
A valid tribal photo ID 

Voters can also present a free Voter Identification Card, which can be issued at any county registrar’s office or Department of Driver Services Office in Georgia.
Those who choose to vote absentee must also submit some form of identification, such as their driver’s license number, along with their ballot. If you don’t have a driver’s license or voter identification card, you can also include a copy of one of the other accepted forms of ID or another document — such as a utility bill or bank statement — that shows your name and address.

The tool, called Abridge, records conversations between doctors and patients during clinical visits and then uses a large language model to produce after-visit summaries.
Steven Zweibel, a physician at Hartford HealthCare and the medical director of innovation at the organization’s Heart and Vascular Institute, said Abridge has freed up his attention during appointments so that he can focus more energy on patient care, instead of furiously typing notes. 
“I wasn’t in front of my computer. I was just sitting there eye to eye with my patient. [It’s] the first time I can remember doing that since before electronic medical records,” he said, recalling his early impressions of the technology.
Once a patient consents to having their appointment recorded, the conversation is captured through either a secure smartphone app, laptop or computer. The technology is HIPAA-compliant, encrypted and built to protect patient information, a spokesperson with Abridge said in an emailed statement. The physician then reviews the notes, makes any edits and submits them directly into the patient’s electronic medical record.

Allen Hsiao, a pediatric emergency physician and chief health information officer at Yale New Haven Health, said nearly all patients agree to have visits recorded once he explains it helps him focus on them. Some ask about data security, and in the rare cases they decline, he said, physicians readily comply.
At Yale, the response to Abridge has been overwhelmingly positive. Over 1,100 physicians at the health system now use the app, and upwards of 80% of those who tried it decided to adopt it — a higher uptake rate by far than any other tool the health system has offered to physicians, Hsiao said. 
One colleague told Hsiao the app was “the best thing since the birth of my children.” Another reported that “the only thing that saves me more time everyday is my car.” Hsiao said Abridge is particularly useful in an emergency setting, where physicians often don’t get the chance to document visits until after the end of a long shift.

“You’re spending a lot of time after hours trying to remember the details from potentially dozens of patients you saw over your shift. You’re exhausted, and it’s probably not the best quality notes,” Hsiao said. “Abridge has really alleviated that.”
Both Hsiao and Zweibel said they’ve been impressed with the level of detail the app picks up during clinical visits. 
Zweibel said he once asked a patient whether he experienced shortness of breath when he climbed stairs. The patient said no, but then his wife, who was also in the room, said it seemed to her like he did. When Zweibel went to look at the notes Abridge produced, it pointed out that the patient did not report shortness of breath, but his wife disagreed.
Barry Stein, a physician and chief clinical innovation officer at Hartford HealthCare, said it’s important to weigh the risk of AI solutions when considering whether to bring them into a health care setting.
“As the excitement and the hype has built, there’s also been an increasing consideration for the risk,” Stein said. “We have to be cognizant of that in health care.”
When considering whether to adopt technology like Abridge, Stein said the key concerns were security and “hallucination” — a term used to describe a situation in which artificial intelligence produces false, incomplete or incorrect information.

Abridge’s security protocols met the standards at Hartford HealthCare, Stein said. Zweibel added that he’s never seen the technology put something in the note that wasn’t actually discussed between him and a patient. And if physicians ever doubt the content Abridge produces, they can click on anything in the notes, and the technology will take them back to the point in the original transcript where the item was discussed.
Like any organization figuring out how to deploy AI tools, the health systems wanted to make sure Abridge was the right fit. To do that, they used a gradual approach.
Hartford HealthCare started with an initial testing phase where 20-30 physicians from across different specialties tried two different products and provided feedback on their experiences, Zweibel said. Once they decided to move forward with Abridge, a broader scope of physicians was invited to use it. Everyone received training documents and a support team was available to immediately respond to any issues that arose. 
“This is huge for us and for provider wellness,” Zweibel said. “When you have a provider who’s happy, that shows in the care and then the interaction with the patient.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/2025_0918_SR_HHC-AI029-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-14 05:56:43.003040

(Photo by Dana Wormald/New Hampshire Bulletin)Every year, each town, village, and city holds local municipal elections where important issues like the town’s operating budget are decided and open positions within the town’s government are filled. 
Many of these positions are small but integral to the well-being of the town, like the town clerk or local moderators. The elections are often not as well attended, but they are just as important as the state and federal elections held every two years as many of the local officials who help safeguard our elections are nominated and elected during these meetings.
As someone who has a disability, a great deal of my life has been dependent on social services, many of which are funded by or even directly overseen by state officers. Accordingly, I decided as soon as I turned 18, I would try to participate when possible in my town’s elections. 
Unfortunately, by my early 20s my eye sight — which has always been diminishing due to a rare degenerative condition — started to prevent me from completing my ballot without assistance. I would always ask a moderator or another election official for assistance, and for a long time I did not realize how this might be a problem as I knew many of those officials from living in the town of New Hampton for the lion’s share of my 40 years of life.
When I heard about new accessible voting systems in the early 2000s that would allow a blind person to independently cast their vote, I got very excited, and immediately asked to be able to use it in local elections. But for over two decades the answer from my local election officials was always “that’s not available for the local elections” or “I’m not sure we can get that here; we’re a very small town.” This meant if I wanted to vote, I either had to rely on transcribing my vote for the ballot out loud in the public polling place, or do it at home with a family member. I began to choose the latter, until the accessible system finally came to my town post-COVID.
Now imagine if you go through this process year after year, properly filling out form after form, with no issues. And also imagine if after sending in all the correct information, your town clerk or moderator suddenly calls you to tell you “we can’t submit this.” That’s what is going to happen to countless voters within the state who rely on absentee ballots to cast their votes. For a variety of reasons, many people in New Hampshire vote using an absentee ballot. These voters are unable to vote in person, but still wish to fulfill their most sacred responsibility as a citizen of the great state of New Hampshire.
Recently passed voting laws make it harder to try to be a good citizen. Specifically, the recently enacted Senate Bill 287 makes absentee voting much more difficult. In addition to filling out and submitting a form to request an absentee ballot, you now have to return those forms with very specific forms of identification, including a copy of your photo ID. 
This is a problem because many people don’t have scanners and printers in their house. The alternative is to visit a notary, many of which charge a fee for the service. Voters who do not send a copy of their identification or have their request form notarized will not be able to vote with an absentee ballot. 
Perhaps the most frustrating part of all of this is that this was law enacted in the name of election integrity to prevent so-called “rampant fraud.” I won’t argue that there is no fraud, as there may well be a few unscrupulous voters out there who try to cheat the system. But there is no evidence of this fraud being widespread or rampant. 
These laws will not address any actual instances of voter fraud, but they do make absentee voting much more difficult for the citizens who are unable to vote in person on election day.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/warnerprimary-1024x749.jpg,,,2025-10-14 04:57:04.955962

(Photo by Amanda Mills/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.)Many people might not be aware of this, but a big majority of Ohio’s public-school students already receive free breakfast and lunch at school. 
Making free meals available to all students wouldn’t only produce benefits equal to the costs, it would produce social benefits with a net worth of about $520 million a year, according to an economic analysis released last Monday.
Lower-income Americans have lost significant ground over the past 40 years. In some ways, that trend might be accelerating.
More than 1 in 4 Ohioans are now poor enough to be on Medicaid, for example, and their access to education is diminishing.
Even adjusting for inflation, college tuition has tripled. Meanwhile, when also adjusted for inflation, the maximum available Pell Grant hasn’t budged.
Education is a powerful predictor of future earnings. Yet even after the pandemic, chronic absenteeism in Ohio schools sits at 25.6% — up nine percentage points from its pre-pandemic level in 2018-2019.
And more than half a million Ohio kids — 1 in 5 — are dealing with food insecurity. 
And the state’s schools reported that in the 2021-2022 school year, more than 26,000 of their kids “lacked a fixed, regular, and adequate place to sleep,” the Ohio Housing Finance Agency reported. 
The Columbus firm Scioto Analysis examined what would happen if a relatively modest step were taken to help the state’s children

Already, more than 60% of students whose schools participate in the national school lunch program are getting free meals. 
What would happen if the state just paid so all students could get them?
State Sens. Louis Blessing III, R-Colerain Township, and Kent Smith, D-Euclid, earlier this year introduced a bill that would extend free meals to all Ohio school kids. But it was assigned to a committee and died. 
At $300 million a year, the program was relatively inexpensive — given that the legislature’s Republican leadership found twice that amount to give the billionaire Haslam family to move the hapless Browns outside Cleveland city limits. 
Three days after receiving the gift, the Tennessee-based moguls bought a $25 million mansion — in Florida.
The Scioto Analysis study used the projected cost of the Blessing bill as a starting point and tried to compare the costs to the benefits.
An obvious benefit would be to ensure that more kids had access to healthy meals.
“… a study comparing schools that offered universal free school meals… to similar schools that did not offer universal free school meals found that children in schools with universal free school meals had lower household food insecurity,” the report said. 
“U.S. data found that universal free school meals provided through the Community Eligibility Provision would make 3% of previously food-insecure children in participating schools food-secure.”
Another benefit would be that if all kids got free meals, then no one would be stigmatized as poor for getting them. 
That one might be hard to measure, but anybody who’s been to school knows how cruel children can be. 
With a quarter of kids already chronically absent, the last thing they need is another reason to want to avoid school.
Other potential benefits are easier to quantify: Money and time saved by families, reductions in obesity, greater administrative efficiency for schools that don’t have to keep track of whose meal bills are paid, and improved lifetime earnings by kids who are well nourished and ready to learn.
The analysis said that last benefit would by far be the most valuable, determining it would create $552 million in annual economic benefit. 
In all, it said, universal school meals would create $52o million more in annual benefits than the program would cost.
“Based on the available research about the health, educational, and economic benefits of universal free school meals for students of all incomes — even those who are already eligible for free meals through existing programs — I believe universal free school meals are a worthwhile investment for Ohio,” Emily Cantrell, the policy analyst who wrote the report, said in an accompanying blog post.",https://ohiocapitaljournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/school-lunch-cdc-image-1024x681.jpg,,,2025-10-14 04:57:04.955962

(Photo by WEWS.)Ohioans will still be able to have and use “intoxicating” hemp, low-level THC products such as delta 8, during the state’s temporary ban — but it would be illegal to sell it.
Last Wednesday, Gov. Mike DeWine announced in a news conference a state of emergency starting today (Tuesday, Oct. 14) due to the “availability and abuse of intoxicating hemp products remains a serious threat to public health and safety.”
What is intoxicating hemp? What is delta 8, delta 9?
Delta 8 and 9 are cannabinoids produced by the cannabis plant, often manufactured by CBD.
Ohio doesn’t have an age requirement to buy them since it is .3% or less of THC.
Thus, hemp products can be sold almost anywhere in the state, and the government has no jurisdiction over them.
How long has hemp been legal?
Congress’s Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018 allowed for hemp products to be sold as long as they have .3% THC or less.
U.S. Customs and Border Protection issued guidance on their website that under the law, the Drug Enforcement Administration no longer has the authority to seize and criminalize sending or buying seeds with less than .3% THC.
The DEA has also given this statement to numerous attorneys around the country with the same advice, including specifically addressing cannabis.
What is this executive order? What does it apply to?
According to the order, all consumer products containing intoxicating hemp must be removed from public display by all retailers, no consumer products containing intoxicating hemp may be sold or offered for sale during the state of emergency and any retailer who has intoxicating hemp must segregate these units from other merchandise and hold them, or a portion of them, for law enforcement officers or officials of the department of agriculture.
The ban lasts for 90 days.
This means there is a full removal.
Any intoxicating hemp product that isn’t regulated by the state’s marijuana division must be pulled from smoke shops, breweries, convenience stores, or anywhere else they are sold.
This even includes unregulated hemp products sold in marijuana dispensaries, the governor’s team told us.
“This is specifically aimed at synthetic, intoxicating hemp products that can be sold to kids, have no quality control and are simply dangerous,” DeWine said during the press conference.
Can I still buy hemp products by mail?
Case Western Reserve University law professor emeritus Jonathan Entin explained that this is a tricky question.
“Typically, states don’t get to regulate out-of-state actors unless those actors are physically present in the state or the state can say, ‘You have sufficient practical contact with the state that we can regulate you,'” Entin said.
With regard to mail-order sales, the governor’s team said that online sellers must follow state law and not sell to Ohio residents.
If this is about public safety, why not ban alcohol, tobacco and marijuana, too?
All are regulated markets, DeWine and his team said.
“As far as alcohol, it’s totally, it has been regulated, historically, from the state of Ohio,” DeWine said. “We regulate it. The person who is serving that beer, they can lose their license if they’re serving to a minor — that’s the difference.”
Will this ban really last 90 days?
There is only one way it doesn’t.
“The executive order itself is unconstitutional,” Dakota Sawyer, who represents hemp sellers, said.
Titan Logistic Group, Fumee Smoke and Vape and Invicta Partners filed a lawsuit in the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas, saying DeWine is breaking federal and state law by restricting access to these products.
They add that he doesn’t have the authority to make this order, either.
The lawsuit asks a judge to block the state’s ban before it goes into effect.
Can I get in trouble for possessing hemp products during the prohibition?
No. The executive order only bans selling.
Retailers who continue selling intoxicating hemp could be fined $500 each day the products remain on sale. The state will have the authority to seize products if they are still available for sale.

(Anna Kaminski/Kansas Reflector)For decades, the U.S. Supreme Court has made clear that the First Amendment protects public employees from facing adverse employment consequences for their private expression about matters of public concern, such as the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk.
Meanwhile, it is equally well-established that such protections generally don’t apply to workers in the private sector.
But that distinction didn’t stop Senate President and Republican gubernatorial candidate Ty Masterson, along with fellow Republican gubernatorial candidate Jeff Colyer and Sen. Brad Starnes (R-Wichita), from urging the state Department of Education to fire government employee Katie Allen after she used her personal Facebook account to write the words “well deserved” in response to a post she saw in the aftermath of Kirk’s shooting on Sept. 10.
In a reality-distorting twist, it seems that these officials believe that Allen’s personal expression can be regulated not in spite of constitutional limits on regulation of such expression by government employees, but because she is a government employee.
Masterson told the over 2,500 followers of his “Official Account” on social media platform X that “anyone holding such a belief” about Kirk’s death “should not be employed by the state of Kansas and has no place making policy decisions for our children.”
“I urge Education Commissioner Dr. (Randy) Watson to immediately remove Allen from her position at the Kansas Department of Education,” he continued.
Meanwhile, Colyer wrote on X that KDSE “must fire Katie Allen for cause without delay,” and Starnes told the Kansas City Star that “students deserve better than educational ‘leaders’ who dehumanize people whom they disagree with.”
And after the education department terminated her employment, Masterson and Starnes crowed that they had “demanded her immediate firing and resignation” and that “thanks to swift action, she’s out at KSDE.”
Neither Masterson’s campaign, Colyer’s campaign, nor Starnes responded to a request for comment about whether their public statements infringed on Allen’s rights. But all three of them find themselves as potential witnesses in Allen’s lawsuit against KDSE and Watson filed on Sept. 24.
Although none of those power brokers are named defendants, the lawsuit suggests their statements loom large over Watson’s decision to end Allen’s employment in a manner she claims flies in the face of clearly established law.
 
Protected expression
The first step for Allen to prove her claims is to show that her Facebook comment was protected expression under the First Amendment.
The crucial point here is that even though Allen’s post surely offended the officials who called for her firing, offensiveness alone is not a license for government-sanctioned punishment.
This is because the U.S. Supreme Court has recognized a broad range of protected expression in this country, including hate speech and lies. Exceptions to that rule are very narrow but permit regulation for true threats and defamation.
Moreover, it is a foundational First Amendment principle that the government cannot regulate expression simply because it disagrees with that expression. But the officials’ public statements here make clear that they sought her ouster precisely because they disagreed with her point of view.
Here, Allen’s comment was an expression of opinion that did not even reach the threshold of hate speech, let alone true threats or defamation. Her expression was unquestionably protected.
 
Balancing rights
Another element Allen will have to prove to win her case is that the government’s interests as an employer did not outweigh her interest in freedom of expression.
Here, Allen’s comment was live for only a few minutes before, as she put it in the lawsuit, she “thought better of the comment” and deleted it.
Even though the comment was publicly available for only a short time, the lawsuit describes significant blowback against Allen, including that she received “actual or veiled threats” by telephone and email, such as an email titled “resign or die” in which the author threatened to “blow your f*****g brains out if you don’t resign.”
While Allen herself surely suffered, nothing in the documents filed in court so far indicate that KDSE was disrupted because of Allen’s post.
If the agency can’t show that Allen’s comments had a negative effect on its day-to-day operations or otherwise compromised the agency’s ability to perform its duties, it will likely have a difficult time proving that its interests outweighed Allen’s right to post on social media in her private capacity.
In the absence of facts to support a contention that Allen’s comments harmed the agency in a way that justified her firing, the door opens for Allen to argue the actual reason she alleges she was terminated: political pressure from public officials.
 
Motive to fire
It is here that various posts from state officials and candidates for office begin to add up to a paper trail in Allen’s favor.
Allen lost her job less than a week after posting her comment. All three of Masterson, Colyer and Starnes publicly called for Allen’s firing, and at least Masterson and Starnes took a victory lap after she lost her job.
Usually, proving elements in lawsuits requires discovery, but officials’ public statements here afford Allen a head start to argue that her firing was solely motivated by her comment.
 
Fired because of the expression
Finally, Allen must prove that the agency would not have made the same employment decision had she not posted her comment.
Again, the officials’ public statements are a treasure trove of intent. Before Kirk’s death, Allen was little-known. There is no evidence to suggest that she could have been fired for cause.
Meanwhile, these three officials’ public statements highlight the point that Allen’s comment, and likely nothing else, caused her to lose her job.
In their rush to censor private expression by public employees in the name of protecting the public, well-known public figures have done little more than bolster Allen’s case and increase the likelihood that taxpayers will ultimately have to cover attorney fees for litigation Allen should never have needed to file.
The First Amendment protects the right to speak out, even if that speech is offensive. Unless the people we elect start exercising better judgment — such as choosing not to disregard decades of precedent to advance short-term political goals — KDSE won’t be the last agency on the hook for constitutional violations.

Airports across the United States have been experiencing significant flight delays recently because of a shortage of air traffic controllers, who have been required to work without pay since a government shutdown began on Oct. 1, 2025. Reports suggest employees have been calling in sick in increased numbers. And since there was already a shortage of controllers before the shutdown, the impact has been severe, with thousands of flights delayed or canceled since the shutdown began.
The Conversation U.S. asked Brian Strzempkowski and Melanie Dickman, aviation experts at The Ohio State University, to explain how the shutdown is affecting air travel, what that means for passengers and air safety, as well as the air traffic controller shortage that has been plaguing U.S. airports for years.
 How is the shutdown affecting air traffic controllers?

Air traffic controllers are deemed essential workers, meaning they are still required to work while not receiving compensation – which they would typically then receive in a lump sum after the shutdown ends. President Donald Trump created some uncertainty around this by suggesting workers may not get their back pay without explicit authorization from Congress, despite having signed a law in his first term that makes it a legal requirement.
Working without regular pay, combined with the possibility that they won’t get paid at all, is resulting in real financial stress for air traffic controllers, who perform one of the most stressful jobs there is.
As a result, there have been reports of air traffic controllers calling in sick in large numbers. This happened in previous shutdowns as well. During the 2018-2019 shutdown, for example, sickouts started to happen around the two-week mark, roughly when the first paycheck was missed. Controllers, airport security employees, and other essential workers were calling in sick often so they could work another part-time job to pay their bills.
In the current shutdown, this appears to be happening sooner, less than a week after it began. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said around 10% of the controller workforce is engaging in this practice and threatened to fire these “problem children.”
 What does this mean for people about to take a flight?

Before the shutdown, there was already a critical shortage of air traffic controllers. Coupled with workers calling in sick in recent days, this has led to severe travel delays at many major airports, such as those in Atlanta and Denver, and regional ones, like those serving Burbank, California, and Daytona Beach, Florida.
A big question on travelers’ minds is whether this will affect air safety.
The air traffic control system is multi-layered and has redundancies built into it to ensure an incredibly safe environment. While controller shortages do begin to erode some of those redundancies, contingency plans are in place to help protect the system. For example, air traffic can be diverted away from affected locations or delayed, or the flight may even be be canceled before the plane leaves the gate.
As an example, Newark Liberty International Airport can accommodate approximately 80 aircraft departing or arriving per hour when the airport and airspace is fully operational. However, due to technical failures, staffing shortages and construction at the airport, capacity was limited to between 28 and 34 aircraft per hour in June 2025. Due to technology upgrades and procedural changes, that number was recently increased to between 68 and 72 aircraft per hour. By regulating the amount of traffic, the system can be protected to ensure the safety of every aircraft.
This was an example of high-level oversight in which the secretary of transportation was personally involved in seeking a solution to ensure air travel remained safe while trying to increase capacity.
 How does the US keep air travel safe?

On a more day-to-day level, the Federal Aviation Administration relies on the Air Traffic Control System Command Center, located about 40 miles away from Washington, D.C. This facility oversees the entire national airspace system and essentially “controls” the controllers. Air traffic professionals monitor staffing at air traffic facilities, weather conditions, equipment failures and unexpected disruptions to the system.
When an incident arises, such as Burbank Airport recently reporting that no controllers were available, the command center issues an alert stating that any aircraft inbound to Burbank must divert to an alternate airport, and any aircraft that has not yet taken off will be held on the ground.
Staffing shortages at other air traffic control facilities may require alternate plans, such as transitioning workloads from one facility with fewer controllers, to another that is appropriately staffed. There is a wide range of tools that the Air Traffic Control System Command Center can utilize to protect the system, but it all stems from the idea of managing the capacity. Flight delays and cancellations, while disruptive to individual travelers, are actually good from a system perspective, because they prevent congestion in the airspace.
 Why was there an air traffic controller shortage in the first place?

There has been a systemic problem with hiring of air traffic controllers for more than a decade.
Over the years, the FAA has fallen behind on training enough controllers to replace those who retire each year. In May 2025, we wrote about the FAA’s plan to utilize colleges across the country to provide the professional training for this career field. While it will take a little time for the students to matriculate through college and into the workforce, this plan will be a significant contributor to solving the controller shortage problem.
Meanwhile, the FAA Academy, which trains U.S. air traffic controllers, only has limited funding from the previous federal budget for current students. The shutdown means no new students can begin training. Depending on the length of the shutdown, the funding may run out as additional employees are furloughed. The ripple effects of a shutdown can remain for many months after the government reopens.
 What’s the government doing to end the shortage?

In July, Congress authorized over US$12 billion in funding to help modernize the air traffic control system.
Secretary Duffy is currently leading an effort to identify a contractor to implement the technology upgrades needed to modernize the system and make it more robust. Duffy has said an additional $19 billion investment will be needed to complete the task.
The editor’s note was updated to correct the number of flights canceled during the shutdown.

(Aaron Sanderford/Nebraska Examiner)The University of Nebraska-Lincoln is being pulled in two directions, risking its reputation, public trust and ability to serve Nebraska.
The danger is twofold: a budget process built on flawed data and sidelined governance — and a retreat from purpose into prestige-driven metrics.
On one hand, President Gold has set forth an ambitious “Odyssey to Extraordinary” that imagines Nebraska’s university system as transformative in teaching, research and community partnerships. It outlines bold investments in faculty, student success, cutting-edge research and statewide partnerships with the promise of measurable progress and transparent accountability.
On the other, Chancellor Rodney Bennett has been instructed to implement deep budget cuts that risk undermining the very mission they claim to serve. Facing a $27.5 million deficit, he proposed reductions framed as ‘right-sizing’ but based on flawed data. Though cast as part of the “Odyssey to Extraordinary,” this approach shrinks the vision and undermines its prospects for success.
Getting the data and process wrong
Simply put, the process used to identify programs for elimination was flawed. Faculty report the numbers justifying cuts were incomplete and often wrong. With omissions and misapplications erasing the very signals they were meant to capture, the evaluation is flatly unreliable. Even the arithmetic fails, ignoring revenue these units generate and trading human, reputational and strategic losses for what are, in reality, trivial savings.
Equally troubling is how these analyses were deployed. Faculty learned of them only at the semester’s start — sometimes just days before the public announcement — though the metrics had been in development for months. Administrators call the process ‘collaborative,’ yet faculty report they were shown finished outputs, not invited into the design. Promised qualitative data never materialized, and requests for underlying data have been denied outright, among other procedural missteps.
Together, these choices elevate control over collaboration, compromise the university’s integrity and may be
exposing it to governance, legal, compliance and reputational vulnerabilities.
The risk of prestige undermining purpose
The University of Nebraska is not without guidance for moments like this. The NU Board of Regents’ own governing policies lay out a clear vision of how faculty work should be understood and incentivized: scholarship must include discovery, integration, application and teaching, and it must connect research to Nebraska’s communities.
These are not aspirational. They are binding obligations, reinforced by associations, funders and Nebraska’s communities, all of whom increasingly reward collaboration, practical impact, and work that connects across fields.
Despite this common ground, the budget reduction plan moves in the opposite direction.
It reduces a broad vision to simplistic indicators modeled on the Association of American Universities (AAU), an elite club of research universities that Gold has made into a top priority. AAU metrics elevate prestige, with only token attention to teaching, engagement and community impact. By adopting them as the standard for budget decisions, the plan works against regents’ directives and risks undermining the qualities that make Nebraska’s top public-serving university responsive to the state and its communities.
This tension between purpose and prestige cannot be ignored. Iowa State University, a large, public-serving research university not unlike UNL, recently confronted it with a contrasting response. In 2022, after more than six decades of membership, it chose to leave the AAU to protect its commitment to affordability, student engagement and access. That choice did not slow ISU. It has posted five years of growth, up 21.5% since 2020 to over 31,000 students.
If Nebraska’s leaders are to pursue re-admission to AAU, they must show they can do so without hollowing out the very mission that makes this university indispensable to its people.
So far, though, the budget plan trades extraordinary vision for ordinary reduction, ironically by aiming cuts at programs that are anything but ordinary.
A better way forward
You can’t cut your way to excellence. Budget cuts are painful, but when data are obscured and shared governance sidelined, the damage spreads beyond those cut.
It weakens the ability to recruit and retain talent, exacerbates threats to job growth throughout Nebraska and ultimately drives long-term costs that outweigh any short-term savings.
That is why the current plan should be rejected and restarted. Nebraska deserves a process that is transparent, faithful to its land-grant mission and grounded in credible evidence. Its Carnegie ‘community-engaged’ designation is no side note. Ignoring it in the process discounts the university’s strengths in serving communities and sustaining its national leadership. Leaving teaching, engagement and public commitments out of evaluation confuses prestige with purpose and carries costs Nebraska cannot afford.

They have been scientifically studied, tested, and proven beyond doubt that they are safe and effective.  Vaccines work by training the body’s immune system, which fights against serious outside viruses and bacteria, into forming an effective defense against outside invaders so that a person does not contract the disease they are defending against at all, or experiences the disease in a milder form than if they hadn’t been vaccinated.
For example, measles is one of the most contagious viruses known to humankind, and spreads through the air to anyone nearby a person who is infected.  It most commonly affects young children, often requiring hospitalization, and about one to two of every thousand people infected die from the disease.  It can cause pneumonia, which accounts for over half of measles deaths.  Fortunately, measles can be prevented by a safe vaccine, usually administered in the mumps, measles and rubella (German measles) (MMR) vaccine which can offer lifelong protection. In fact, measles was all but eliminated from the United States until some misinformed people deferred vaccinating their children.
Vaccines not only offer protection for the person who receives a vaccine, but it also protects entire communities through what is called ‘herd immunity.”  This is when enough people in a community have achieved immunity against a particular virus or bacteria so that it becomes harder for the infection to spread to others, as well as harder for the offending disease to mutate into stronger forms of the infectious agent.
Unfortunately, some people have been misinformed about the safety and benefits of vaccines.  This misinformation is often spread by social media, and by individuals who lack the scientific background to understand how rigorously vaccines have been studied, tested, and found to be safe before being approved for use in people.
Today, due to political rather than scientific reasons, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has lost many of the world’s leading vaccine experts.  The government oversight of this agency is led by the Secretary of Health and Human Services, Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., who has long proffered false and misleading information on vaccine safety, and he has appointed people with similar viewpoints to a committee that determine what vaccines might be recommended and who should receive them.
Gov. Ned Lamont, and Dr. Manisha Juthani, the infectious disease specialist who is Commissioner of Public Health, should be commended for becoming concerned that the politicization of the CDC vaccine committee might make it difficult for Connecticut citizens to access the needed vaccines. 
They are respectful of the longstanding vaccine recommendations that have protected our state residents, including especially young children, the elderly, and pregnant women from mumps, measles, rubella, hepatitis B, flu, Covid-19, tetanus, and diphtheria, whooping cough, meningitis, certain types of pneumonia, and cervical and some other types of cancer. Under their leadership, Connecticut has joined the Northeast Public Health Collaborative along with Delaware, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York (including New York City), Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, and Vermont.  
The goals of the collaborative are “to protect the health and well-being of its citizens, to share the best scientific expertise, to strengthen the region’s readiness to address any public health threats, and to strengthen confidence in vaccines and science-based medicine.”  The intent is to do this by providing information based on science, data, and evidence and to work to assure access to needed vaccines.
We in the public health community– health care providers, professors in public health, and public health career professionals — fully support the state’s effort to assure vaccine availability to all residents, especially beneficiaries of public insurance programs like Medicaid.  We hope that commercial insurance companies in Connecticut follow the state’s lead and follow science-guided evidence to make certain that their beneficiaries also continue to have vaccine access.

I am running for re-election because I want to build a better future than the tomorrow I see on the horizon. In recent years, I’ve learned that steady progress, patching up neglected sidewalks, improving our public safety response, expanding green space matters more than loud headlines. Those small steps, done well, build trust.

Anthony Afriyie
During these two years on the town council:

We passed a local ban on street takeovers —protecting pedestrians, drivers, and first responders.
We committed $1 million to acquire and preserve open space, safeguarding the 401-acre Roosevelt Forest for generations to come.
We launched a major initiative to protect our Water Pollution Control Facility from future storms.
We stood tall in the face of a crisis by approving a $130,000 loan to replace boilers at Success Village, safeguarding the lives of hundreds of families.
We invested in the Stratford Library with a major upgrade to its heating, cooling, and lighting systems, ensuring a safe, comfortable, and energy-efficient space for residents year-round.

My goal is simple but vital: to keep Stratford safe, welcoming, and sustainable for every resident. 
Yes, we still have opportunities to work toward: blighted buildings, traffic congestion, budget pressures, and gaps in community services. But I believe we are close to turning the corner, and I am committed to helping lead us forward.
I seek re-election not out of ambition, but out of duty to serve with humility, persistence, and respect for all voices. The obstacles ahead are real, but so too is our collective strength to overcome them, together.
This election is not about me. It is about us. It is about choosing a future rooted in courage, community, and continuity. I’m asking for your vote, your feedback, and your partnership. Together, let’s keep building a town where our best days are ahead, not behind.

And now she has to add the chore of finding new Medicare insurance plan to her challenges.
Eyler, who learned recently that she will lose her Medicare Advantage plan with Aetna, is one of thousands of Maryland seniors expected to receive notice this month that their supplemental Medicare plans will no longer be available next year, sparking frustration, fear and confusion.
“I’m very happy with Aetna, I haven’t had any issues with them,” Eyler said. “I’m just frustrated with the state of Maryland that they can’t give the older people better insurance.”
Insurance carriers say that Maryland’s unique hospital system is costly for them to do business in, and several are reducing their coverage in the state or pulling out of counties entirely. But that leaves residents like Eyler forced to navigate finding a new health care plan for next year.
“I’m taking care of him,” she said of her grandson, “plus having to worry about all this insurance stuff. And I have to work because I can’t pay the bills without working.”
Maryland market threatens to push more Medicare Advantage plans out of the state

Dean Slaughter, a 70-year-old Annapolis resident, is tired of having to change Medicare Advantage plans year after year. He recently got a letter from Aetna as well, telling him that his plan will no longer be available in 2026.
“Now we get to sit down and do the dog-and-pony show – see what’s out there, which is not much to offer. The insurance companies are leaving the state of Maryland,” Slaughter said.
Industry experts say as many as 100,000 Medicare recipients in Maryland, like Slaughter and Eyler, will have to scramble to find a new health care plan by the end of the year or risk losing coverage at an age where many require costly medical care.
About a quarter of Maryland Medicare recipients use a supplemental program called Medicare Advantage that helps retirees use a private insurer for additional health coverage such as vision, dental and transportation assistance that the standard Medicare plans may not offer.
But there’s been a long-running problem that’s coming to a head: State officials and people in the health care industry say the Medicare Advantage market in Maryland is more expensive than in most other states because of Maryland’s unique hospital payment system.
In recent years, the state has offered insurers a grant to help cover some of their costs and encourage them to keep offering the coverage in the state. That grant is going away, however, and some insurance companies have shrunk their presence in the state as a result.
A spokesperson for Humana said that the insurance company will no longer offer one of its Medicare Advantage plans in five major Maryland jurisdictions.
“Humana has exited one Medicare Advantage plan in Maryland for next year,” according to the statement. “Beginning Jan. 1, 2026 … Humana Gold Plus SNP (HMO DSNP), will no longer be available in the following counties: Anne Arundel, Baltimore, Harford, Howard and Baltimore City.”
Humana says that those affected by the termination will maintain their current coverage through Dec. 31, 2025, but they will need to find new coverage during the Medicare Annual Election Period, which runs from Oct. 15 through Dec. 7, if they want coverage next year.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Aetna shrunk its Medicare Advantage coverage to just three counties next year.
“Each year, we assess our ability to meet the health care needs of our members and adjust our plans to ensure they can deliver an excellent and sustainable member experience,” a spokesperson for Aetna said in a written statement. “In 2026, in Maryland, we will offer Medicare Advantage in the following counties: Frederick, Harford and Montgomery.”
Part of the issue comes from Maryland’s unique Total Cost of Care hospital payment model, in which a state board called the Health Services Cost Review Commission (HSCRC) sets hospital rates. Under the current system, insurance carriers pay higher hospital rates than in other states and get reimbursed by the federal government for Medicare Advantage services at lower rates than elsewhere. Meanwhile, insurance carriers are unable to negotiate hospital rates under their plans.
As a result, it’s more expensive to use Medicare Advantage in Maryland than in other states, and Maryland seniors aren’t getting the same quality of benefits, a spokesperson for CareFirst said in a recent statement.
Insurers reducing their footprint in the state leaves residents like Jie Shen, a 68-year-old living in Cockeysville, having to look for a new plan. That often means finding new doctors and hospitals for health care services.
“This is getting very frustrating,” Shen said. “I just want to stay on one plan at this point. I don’t know which one to choose.”
While there is time to search for a new plan, Medicare Advantage recipients note that the options available in Maryland are dwindling as carriers pull out of the state.
“It’s a hassle,” Slaughter said. “All of a sudden, you’re working with people who don’t even know you, and it’s not the way I want it … I feel like I am a number, and a cattle in line instead of a person, and it’s degrading.”
Even those who will still have their plans in 2026 are worried about what may come down the pipeline later.
Bumps AHEAD: Trump administration evaluating Maryland’s authority to set Medicare rates

Sharon Vickers, 78-year-old resident of Pasadena, was relieved to hear that her Medicare Advantage plan with CareFirst will continue into next year.
“I was concerned. Especially since my husband has passed, not having someone to sit and talk about it and discuss it,” she said.
As many Medicare recipients do, she works with an insurance broker to help find appropriate coverage for her needs. The broker informed her that she would be “comfortable this year,” but that he couldn’t “guarantee anything for next year.”
But she feels that the Advantage plans are already too expensive for what they offer and may skip out on coverage entirely.
“I may be looking at one day not being able to afford health care coverage,” Vickers said. “I’ll do what I have to do when the time comes, and that may mean going without health care.”
Meanwhile, the Maryland model is undergoing a major transition this year, as state health officials and federal officials finalize new terms of the States Advancing All-Payer Health Equity Approaches and Development, or AHEAD, model.
Current negotiations appear to prompt the state to offer solutions to the stabilize Medicare Advantage. There may also be significant changes to the state’s Medicare rate-setting authority.
Shen, like other Medicare recipients, hopes something can be done so that insurers will stay in the state.
“I don’t know if the state can help, but that’s what I ask for,” he said. “They should do something.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/medicaidhealthinsuranceform-newsletter-1024x608.jpg,,,2025-10-14 06:56:39.862711

Ford/Maryland Matters)Tara Jackson, the one-time acting Prince George’s County Executive who was sworn in less than four months ago as interim Prince George’s County state’s attorney, will seek the position permanently.
Jackson announced her intentions to run for county executive last month on social media. An official launch is still being planned, but according to her campaign website, a fundraiser will be held Nov. 5 hosted by Floyd Holt and Barry Stanton, two former longtime county administrators — the job Jackson held before becoming acting county executive last year when Angela Alsobrooks left the office to be sworn in as U.S. senator.
When then-State’s Attorney Aisha Braveboy (D) won the county executive’s job in a special election this summer, Jackson was picked by the county’s circuit court judges to become acting state’s attorney. She began her legal career in the office as an assistant state’s attorney.
“From the courtroom to county leadership, I’ve led with fairness, integrity, and results. Prince George’s County deserves a State’s Attorney who has already proven she can deliver,” she said of her campaign.
But she won’t be campaigning alone. Prince George’s County Councilmember Wanika Fisher (D) is also planning to run for state’s attorney and will have two events this month.
The first one will feature public endorsements Wednesday from two union locals — United Food and Commercial Workers (UFCW) Local 400 and Local 1994. Fisher will be with Local 400 at the Giant Food store in Largo at 10 a.m. and then two hours later with Local 1994 at the New Carrollton Branch Library.

Fisher will host her official campaign launch Oct. 21 at Newton White Mansion in Mitchellville centered on four topics: social justice, criminal justice, public safety and advocacy. Fisher, who previously served in the General Assembly, is scheduled to be joined by state Sen. Nick Charles, House Majority Whip Jazz Lewis and Del. Adrian Boafo, all Prince George’s County Democrats. Former U.S. Rep. Al Wynn is also scheduled to attend, according to the campaign announcement.
“My career in politics has spanned over 20 years. I started advocating for safer sidewalks at age 12 and
have been involved with local politics ever since,” Fisher said in a statement. “I have served as an
Assistant State’s Attorney, a Delegate, and a Council Member. I am ready to continue bringing my experience and passion for justice to Prince George’s County as the next State’s Attorney.”
The primary election will be held on June 23, 2026, with early voting from June 11-18. Early voting for the general election runs from Oct. 22-29, 2026, and Election Day is Nov. 3, 2026.
That may seem like a long way off, but not to the candidates who are already lining up for federal state and local seats next year.
Congressional races getting crowded already
Shavonne Hedgepeth announced Monday that she will challenge two-term Rep. Glenn Ivey in the Democratic primary for the Prince George’s County based 4th District seat.
Hedgepeth, who works in capital planning for the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority, has not held office before but is stressing her civic and volunteer work in her campaign announcement. Her campaign focuses on reliably Democratic issues — economic and food security, school funding and protecting immigrant communities, among others — and said that while she “may not know every lever of government yet, … I know how to ask the right questions, build coalitions, and hold decision-makers accountable.”
In Ivey, she faces a two-term incumbent with extensive experience in federal and local government, including time as a Capitol Hill staffer and two terms as Prince George’s County state’s attorney. He reported having $295,990 in the bank as of June 30, the most recent report to the Federal Election Commission.
But Hedgpeth is not the only challenger. Jakeya Johnson, the executive director of Reproductive Justice Maryland, has also announced a primary challenge to Ivey. She has filed with the FEC, but has not reported any fundraising activity yet.
Johnson has not filed with the Maryland State Board of Elections — Hedgepeth has — but has until February to do so. Republican George McDermott has also filed for the seat.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
But the 4th District is among the least crowded so far, at least according to the elections board’s list of 2026 candidates.
The only incumbents to file for reelection so far are Rep. Sarah Elfreth (D-3rd) and Rep. Kweisi Mfume (D-7th). But Elfreth already has a Democratic and a Republican filed for her seat and Mfume has a Republican challenger in his heavily Democratic district, but could face a bigger threat from Baltimore City Councilmember Mark Conway, who filed recently paperwork with the FEC.
Seven people — two Democrats, two Republicans, two unaffiliated candidates and a Green Party candidate — have already filed with the state to run for the seat held by first-term Rep. April McClain Delaney (D-6th). She has not yet filed for reelection.
And in the 5th District, five candidates have lined up — four Democrats and an unaffiliated candidate — to either take on longtime Democratic Rep. Steny Hoyer, or run for his open seat should he choose not to seek a 22nd term in Congress. Guessing whether Hoyer, who will be 87 next summer, will run again is the parlor game of the moment for the politically obsessed in Maryland.

Other campaign announcements that have come over the transom in recent weeks, in brief:

Former St. Michael’s Town Commissioner George M. Walish announced a Democratic bid to unseat Rep. Andy Harris (R-1st), the only Republican in the state’s congressional delegation, in the Eastern Shore-based district. Walish announced Sept. 10 so has not yet filed a campaign report with the FEC, unlike the other Democrat in the race, Daniel Schwartz, who reported having $45,222 on hand in June. Harris reported having more than $325,000 in the bank.
Amar Mukunda, a veteran, son of immigrants and gun-control advocate, has filed as a Democrat for a House of Delegates seat in the already crowded District 39 race. The district incumbents — Sen. Nancy King and Dels. Lesley Lopez, Greg Wims and Gabriel Acevero — have all filed for reelection, but King, Lopez and Wims have not included the fiery Acevero on their slate, the Baltimore Banner reported last week. They have added Robert Wu, instead.
The three Republican incumbents in the Upper Shore legislative District 36 — Dels. Steve Arentz, Jay Jacobs and Jeff Ghrist — have filed for reelection as a slate. According to their announcement, they have the support of district Sen. Stephen S. Hershey, who is currently weighing the possibility of a Republican run for governor in 2026.
Two-term Wicomico County Councilmember Josh Hastings has filed as a Democrat for the legislative District 38B seat currently held by Del. Barry Beauchamp, a Republican appointed to the seat last year.

The storm tore homes from their foundations and sent them floating away. 
One woman was found dead in Kwigillingok on Monday, according to Alaska State Troopers.

The search for two more people unaccounted for in that community will continue, by boat and air, the state troopers said on a Facebook post. Search and rescue is being conducted by the U.S. Coast Guard, Alaska Army National Guard and Alaska Air National Guard, as well as state troopers. 
The storm damaged boats, roads, airports, and power and sewer infrastructure over a vast region, and damage assessments were not immediately available as emergency rescue efforts entered a second day. 
“We’re moving quickly. We’re moving as fast as we can,” said Gov. Mike Dunleavy at a news conference in Anchorage on Monday with state officials and the congressional delegation. 
Fifty-one people and two dogs were rescued in Kwigillingok and Kipnuk on Sunday, Troopers said, located on the Bering Sea coast. Those predominantly Alaska Native coastal communities saw the most severe impacts of the storm, with a storm surge of up to 6.6 feet above normal and high winds that inundated communities.
“Preservation of life is our top priority,” said Capt. Christopher Culpepper, commander of U.S. Coast Guard Sector Western Alaska and U.S. Arctic. 
“Several of these villages have been completely devastated,” Culpepper said. “Absolutely flooded, several feet deep, and so this took homes off of foundations. This put people in peril, where folks were swimming, floating, trying to find debris to hold on to in the cover of darkness, at nighttime.”

“And so as the sun broke on the first day, devastation became more and more apparent,” Culpepper said, referring to Sunday as the storm lifted. “Coast Guard helicopter crews, along with Army National Guard and Air National crews, particularly two pairs of rescue jumpers that also assisted … picked people up off their homes,” he said, and were taken to higher ground. Several people were medically evacuated to Bethel.
Some people trapped in floating homes early Sunday used their cellphones to call for help. Some of those calls reached the State Emergency Operations Center, said incident commander Mark Roberts. 
“The folks that were in houses that were floating and didn’t know where they were, was one of the most tragic things our folks in the state EOC have ever faced,” Roberts said. “And some of them called into the state EOC, and we just stayed on the phone with them to talk.” 
Members of the Alaska National Guard and Alaska State Defense Forces living in western Alaska, up to 80 personnel, have been activated, said Maj. Gen. Torrence Saxe, commissioner of the Alaska Department of Military and Veterans Affairs, which oversees the Alaska National Guard.
“This may end up being the largest off-the-road-system response for the National Guard in about 45 years,” Saxe said. 
Over 50 airports were impacted by the storm but largely cleared as of Monday to allow planes to land with emergency supplies and personnel. The coastal communities throughout the region are only accessible by small plane or boat. “There also have been numerous reports to us of roadway damage, boardwalk damage – boardwalks are the roads in this region – and then also the various power outages and lighting problems throughout the region,” said Ryan Anderson, commissioner of the Alaska Department of Transportation. 
More than 1,000 people were displaced from their homes across the region, according to estimates from the Yukon-Kuskokwim Health Corporation, the region’s largest healthcare provider. 
Roughly 400 people are sheltering in the local school in Kwigillingok, and 680 people in Kipnuk are at the school there, they said. Thirty seven homes in Kwigillingok were destroyed. 
Emergency supplies, including water, food, hygiene products, baby formula and bedding are being flown into coastal communities, according to a statement on Monday by YKHC.  “The need is great,” they said. The response effort is coordinated between YKHC, Alaska Native Tribal Health Consortium (ANTHC), the Association of Village Council Presidents and the state of Alaska, to assess and respond to community needs. 
Medical providers and prescription medications were being sent to Kwigillingok, Kipnuk, Tuntutuliak and Chefornak, they said, and plans were underway to evacuate about 40 people, including elders and pregnant women, to Bethel. 
Alaska State Sen. Lyman Hoffman, D-Bethel, said over 1,000 emergency meals had been delivered already to coastal villages, but those supplies would run out.

“They need additional food supplies, and it’s difficult to get people out there,” he said.
He said Kipnuk’s runway was still damaged, and planes could not land there. Power is still out there as well. “There has to be a short-term assessment done of those homes that are out there, whether they are livable or not livable … and needs to be made as quickly as possible,” Hoffman said. “Winter is coming.”
The state of Alaska has activated a multi-agency emergency response, and with the governor’s extended disaster relief declaration, residents and communities are eligible for recovery assistance, including temporary housing assistance. 
“We’ve had a few injuries; we’re moving into a higher-level care as needed, and then we’re moving right on in to support sheltering, and then right on into the next to support the ability for people to live in a safe, warm place through the winter,” Roberts said. 	
The Alaska Community Foundation has set up a fundraising effort, the Western Alaska Disaster 2025 Relief Fund, for affected communities. 


U.S. Sen. Dan Sullivan, R-Alaska, said he was communicating with officials with the Federal Emergency Management Agency, who would provide assistance. 
“FEMA right now is in direct contact with our state and local officials and has an incident management team on the ground and a FEMA search and rescue group pre-positioned on standby,” Sullivan said. “As we move into the recovery phase – and we’re not there yet – the federal agencies need to act very quickly. We’re going to be seeing freeze-up and very cold weather, probably quite soon. So they have committed to being very ready to move into that phase of operations once we get there.” 
Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, underscored the trauma residents are experiencing from this disaster. “When the waters subside, when the analysis is complete — we have many, many families (and) we have communities that are in trauma, that will be in shock over the loss and so, making sure that we have trauma specialists, if you will, that are culturally in tune with the region and with the people there is something that I think we all need to be challenged to think about,” she said. 
While the Trump administration has recently cut or frozen significant amounts of federal funding for rural Alaska, like for infrastructure and climate resilience initiatives, Murkowski said she will continue to push officials for federal support. 
“I think this disaster that we are seeing is yet one more reason why the delegation needs to lean in and make sure that the administration fully understands the value of what it means to to have a level of preparedness, to have a level of resilience in an area that is so exposed on our western flank,” she said. 
This week’s disaster came as the remnants of Typhoon Halong battered the region Saturday night into Sunday, sweeping north across the western Alaska coast. The National Weather Service reported hurricane-force winds up to 107 mph in the Kusilvak Census Area, 100 mph in Toksook Bay and 98 mph in the island of St. George in the Bering Sea.
The storm has now weakened over Canada and is moving east, said meteorologist David Kramer, but flood warnings are still in effect for the Kuskokwim Delta and western and northwest Arctic coasts through Tuesday.
Another storm is forecasted for the Kuskokwim River delta region early on Wednesday morning, with winds gusting up to 40 mph from the southeast, and water levels from one to three feet. 
“From the records that we set recently, over six feet, this is significantly less impact,” Kramer said. “The main concerns are high water levels, rough surf and the potential for some coastal erosion.”

(Photo by Christine Condon/ Maryland Matters)Maryland is the lead state, joined by 24 other jurisdictions, on a legal brief filed Saturday that calls the Trump administration’s attempted deployment of National Guard troops in Illinois “unlawful, unconstitutional and undemocratic.”
The 22-page brief, filed in the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, asks the court to reject the administration’s request to deploy guard troops in an American city, saying it violates federal law and usurps local government.
“President Trump’s use of the National Guard to patrol American cities without the consent of state leaders is an outrageous abuse of power based on politics, not public safety,” Maryland Attorney General Anthony Brown said in a statement announcing the filing.
“This is the fourth time in four months that the President has deployed the Guard to a city without approval from its leaders,” Brown said. “Without intervention from the courts, this unconstitutional, unlawful, and un-American politicizing of our military could become the new normal.”
The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment Monday.
The appeals court ruled Saturday that while the guard can remain under federal control, it cannot be deployed in Illinois as appeals continue. It follows a temporary restraining order issued Thursday by U.S. District Judge April M. Perry that would have enjoined both “the federalization and deployment of the National Guard of the United States within Illinois.”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
President Donald Trump (R) on Oct. 4 called for federalization of at least 300 Illinois National Guard members to protect federal property “at any locations at which violent demonstrations prevent the execution of Federal law or are likely to prevent the execution of Federal law based on current threat assessments and planned operations.”
The president began his push to deploy troops in June, when he ordered the guard into California after protests over immigration raids there. As of Oct. 6, California had filed 42 lawsuits against the Trump administration, according to CalMatters, a partner with States Newsroom.
In August, the president declared a “crime emergency” in Washington, D.C., and deployed National Guard troops and also took control of the city’s police department for about 30 days. District officials filed a lawsuit against the administration. A hearing is set for Oct. 24.
The Maryland-led amicus brief comes three days after a three-judge panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals allowed temporary federalization of the Oregon’s National Guard, but blocked those troops from being deployed in the state as the case remains pending.
Trump has also suggested sending troops to other cities, including Baltimore. Guard troops were deployed in Memphis last week, but they were under the control of Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee and welcomed as part of a federal task force, unlike the other cities where mayors and governors have actively opposed the deployment.
For Brown’s office, Saturday’s brief represented the 63 amicus brief filed this year in opposition to Trump administration actions. His office has also either led or joined in 38 lawsuits against the administration so far, according to the attorney general’s office.
By comparison, former Maryland Attorney General Brian Frosh said earlier this year that his office either led or joined in a total of about 95 suits against the administration during Trump’s first four years in office.
Besides Maryland and the District of Columbia, attorneys general from Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington also joined the brief, as did the governors of Kansas, Kentucky and Pennsylvania.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/HEADSHOT-197-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-14 06:56:39.862711

(Emily Reddy/WPSU)Penn State University’s Board of Trustees unanimously approved the sale of university-owned public broadcaster WPSU’s operating assets to Philadelphia-based WHYY. 
The vote Monday follows the board’s unanimous objection last month of a different proposal that would have transferred WPSU to the Philadelphia NPR and PBS affiliate. Members cited concern about the cost to the university without a guarantee WHYY would continue to operate the stations or retain employees.
WPSU was set to be the first public media organization to wind down operations by June 2026 following cuts made by President Donald Trump’s administration to the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, according to the Philadelphia Inquirer.
Chairperson David Kleppinger said the board of trustees received over 1,300 public comments and emails regarding the future of WPSU before Monday’s vote. 
“The overwhelming majority urged the university to reconsider the decision to wind down WPSU’s operations, or to move forward with a sale that would allow the station to continue under public broadcasting organizations,” he said.
Although he said there were a few who expressed differing views, the consistent theme across the comments was strong support for maintaining WPSU’s public media service. 
“Commenters emphasize WPSU’s importance to Penn State’s land grant mission, its educational and cultural value to children and families, especially in the rural areas of Central Pennsylvania, and its role in providing experiential learning opportunities for our students,” Kleppinger added. “Many also noted the station’s history of trusted local journalism and community engagement, and urged the board to find a sustainable path forward that preserves those contributions.”
Sara Thorndike, senior vice president for finance and business/treasurer, said the university currently provides about $3.4 million annually to support WPSU and that the university recently lost $1.8 million in federal funding.
In the proposed transaction approved Monday, the university will not have to pay a $17 million subsidy, which was included in the prior proposal. Instead, WHYY will first secure at least $8.36 million in outside financing.
The agreement allows Penn State to hear from others who might be interested in buying WPSU, but does not allow them to sign any other agreements while they are working towards a definitive agreement with WHYY. Thorndike said this also allows WHYY time to raise the funds needed to support WPSU.
“We can continue to use gifts that are needed in order for WPSU to operate over this next year, but we have agreed that we will not liquidate any of the endowments during that exclusivity period,” Thorndike said. 
Addressing a major concern for the board in its decision to reject the earlier proposal, WHYY has agreed to interview current WPSU employees for positions under the new ownership.
“If there are employees who are qualified for jobs that WHYY have determined are needed, employees will be hired into those positions if they so choose to move to WHYY,” Thorndike said.
WHYY also assured the board that it will continue to operate WPSU for at least three years. 
“This is in response to the board’s concern that if we sold all of the assets to WHYY for the dollar that they could monetize them,” Thorndike said. “That is not their intent, and they agree to keep WPSU open for three years, although they have indicated a desire to keep it going for much, much longer than that.”
WHYY can also not sell any non-core assets without the permission of Penn State. 
“There may be a need to do that, as they’re continuing to fund WPSU, but they will do that in partnership with approval by the university,” Thorndike said. 
Thorndike also noted that WPSU would still offer programs to students such as internships, work-study, and other supportive student curriculum.
WHYY intends to lease the on-campus space where WPSU is currently located, close to the university’s College of Communications. 
The agreement is dependent on approval by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) 
and WHYY will pay filing fees associated with the request, Thorndike noted. Penn State has indicated it wants to close the deal no later than June 30, 2026. 
In addition to PBS and NPR programming, WPSU provides local programming, news coverage, and community events in the region. WPSU-TV reaches 515,000 households in 24 counties of central Pennsylvania, and WPSU-FM serves more than 450,000 listeners in 13 counties in central and northern Pennsylvania.",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/penn-state-old-main-1024x747.jpeg,,,2025-10-13 21:56:16.672452

Then she hid under a Jeep, watching as “guys with black T-shirts” shot at the sidewalk in her hometown in the Mississippi Delta.
She was sure she was going to get hit in the explosion of gunfire Friday night in Leland at a block party following a high school homecoming football game. She did but was not seriously wounded.
“I got hit running across the street. I just kept running. I could see the bodies dropping as I looked back. … I could see the bodies. … Just three minutes of continuing fire,” Jackson, a 2016 Leland High graduate, recalled Monday.
“I could see people drop like something you see in a movie,” she said. “It was panic. Everyone was in survival mode. People running and getting trampled. Some guy was having a seizure near me. It was pure panic.”
Mississippi communities from Leland to Lorman are reeling from the chaos of gun violence that killed nine people and wounded more than a dozen during or after high school and college homecoming celebrations Friday and Saturday.
Leland became the site of the deadliest mass shooting in the U.S. this year when six people were killed and 20 were wounded in gunfire that erupted late Friday during a celebration downtown that included people who had returned to the small town to see friends and family.

“It’s sad that we’re now known for a mass shooting. It had nothing to do with the school or the students,” Leland nonprofit leader Jasmine Styles said Monday, hours before the community held a candlelight vigil to honor victims of the violence.
“The most we’re used to is kids stealing license plates off cars,”  she said. “The most we saw recently was kids setting off firecrackers at the tailgate, and people thought they were gunshots.”
Styles, who ran unsuccessfully for mayor, said she drove by downtown Leland on Sunday.
“It’s been taped off,” she said. “It looks like a cloud of gloom.”
The FBI Jackson office set up a digital media tips website where people with information can anonymously share cellphone video, photos or other information about the Leland shooting.
Elsewhere in Mississippi, two died in gunfire after the Heidelberg High School homecoming Friday night, including a pregnant woman. On Saturday, the Alcorn State University homecoming in Lorman ended in the shooting death of a 29-year-old Vicksburg woman and the wounding of two others.
The condition of a child shot in the abdomen in the tailgate area after the Jackson State homecoming Saturday in Jackson is unknown.
The Mississippi Bureau of Investigation is assisting local and federal law enforcement agencies in investigating the shootings. No arrests had been made by Monday in the JSU or Alcorn State shootings.
Washington County coroner LaQuesha Watkins identified the Leland victims as Oreshama Johnson, 41; Calvin Plant, 19; Shelbyona Powell, 25; Kaslyn Johnson, 18; Amos Brantley Jr., 18; and JaMichael Jones, 34.
Brekyra Fisher, 29, of Vicksburg, died in the shooting at Alcorn State, according to Claiborne County Coroner Kieon Neal. 
Maxine Greenleaf, vice president of marketing and communications at Alcorn State, said the victim was not a student. A university statement said the campus in rural southwestern Mississippi now has “heightened security measures in place.” 
“Our deepest condolences and prayers go out to the family and loved ones of the deceased,” the university statement said. “Our thoughts and prayers are with the injured individuals and their families as well.”
Anyone with information is urged to contact Campus Police at 601-877-3000 or MBI and Crime Stoppers at 888-827-4637 or MBITIPS@dps.ms.gov.
The student government associations at Alcorn State and JSU released a joint statement that they “stand together – united as one HBCU.”
“Our shared legacy as Mississippi’s two premier HBCUs calls us to uplift one another – not only in moments of celebration, but also in times of challenge.”
The Jasper County coroner’s office identified the Heidelberg victims as Mikeia McCray, 28, of Laurel, who was pregnant, and Chris Newell, 35, also of Laurel. 
“The town has never experienced anything like this before, and my heart goes out to those devastated by this tragedy,” state Sen. Juan Barnett, former mayor of Heidelberg, said Monday. “It brings tears to my eyes right now. It really hurts.”
Heidelberg Police Chief Cornell White said Monday the department and other agencies continue to investigate. The town is about 85 miles southeast of Jackson.
Tylar Jarod Goodloe, 18, was arrested Saturday by the Jasper County Sheriff’s Department in the Heidelberg shooting. He is charged with capital murder and possession of a deadly weapon on educational property. His bond is set at $2 million cash, according to the sheriff’s office. It wasn’t known Monday whether he is represented by an attorney.
Three other suspects were arrested Monday: 19-year-old Damarin Starks, charged with accessory after the fact and tampering with physical evidence; 19-year-old Jadarius Quartez Page, charged with accessory after the fact; and 19-year-old Jabari Deshaun Collins, charged with possession of a deadly weapon on educational property. 
Barnett knows what it’s like to have a loved one’s life stolen. While he was fighting in Desert Storm, his father was killed in Heidelberg in 1991. 
“People sympathize,” the senator said, “but the hurt is not the same.”
The East Jasper School District released a statement Saturday saying the violence marred what should have been a joyful evening.
“These actions are not representative of the values, strength, or character of our community,” the statement said. “East Jasper and Forever Blue and Gold Homecoming are a place and time where families come together, where neighbors support one another, where alumni come from far and near with excitement and anticipation, and where our schools are centers of pride and belonging.”
Community members on social media said McCray was a Heidelberg High School graduate from the Class of 2016. 
The school district said it has fully cooperated with local and state law enforcement during the investigation, but understands there will be “questions, concerns, and fear in the aftermath of this tragedy.” 

“While this brings no comfort to the families and friends impacted, please know that the safety and well-being of our students, staff, and community still remain our highest priorities.” 
Sen. Derrick Simmons, who represents Leland, called the shootings “just senseless gun violence.”
“What we are experiencing now is just a proliferation of guns just being in circulation.” 
Styles, who operates a pre-trial diversion program in Leland, echoed those thoughts..
“To my knowledge, nothing like this has happened in my 31 years of living in Leland,” she said. “How are they getting access to weapons and alcohol? There must be adults giving it to them.”
Jackson, one of the shooting victims in Leland, said her fondest memories growing up were from homecoming.
“Homecomings are usually filled with love. We have Block Party Saturday and Family Fun Day Sunday,” she said. “It’s always something people looking forward to. We wouldn’t do that to our own. We’re just as shocked as the rest of the world. Our homecoming’s been stained like that.”
She said she is not planning to go to any more homecomings in the Delta.
Everytown for Gun Safety for Gun Safety advocates for evidence-based solutions to end gun violence.
“I shouldn’t have to text my parents to tell them I’m safe every time there’s a shooting near my school,” said Eshah Green-Ortega, a volunteer with the Jackson State chapter of Students Demand Action. “It keeps happening on our campuses, at our celebrations, and in our communities. We deserve to feel safe learning and living our lives, and our lawmakers need to do their jobs and pass the basic gun safety laws that will keep us safe.”

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)A Utah lawmaker says he’s bringing back a proposal that would require public colleges to conduct a campus safety assessment after conservative activist Charlie Kirk was shot and killed at Utah Valley University. 
“Assessments need to be done,” said Rep. Ryan Wilcox, an Ogden Republican and chair of Utah’s school security task force. “Everyone understands that now.”

K-12 schools already must conduct similar reviews under a bigger 2024 school safety law bringing armed guardians into schools and assigning a statewide security chief. In the 2025 Legislature, Wilcox proposed requiring the assessments of colleges, too, but the state Senate rejected that component.
Wilcox told Utah News Dispatch Monday he’s spoken with most of Utah’s college presidents, and many have already ordered security assessments after Kirk’s assassination. But he said a state law is needed to make sure they keep up that scrutiny for years to come.
Wilcox declined to give details on the plan, but he’ll be teaming up with a new higher education task force that’s still being assembled and will focus on campus security.
The reviews are required every three years in Utah’s K-12 system, but Wilcox said he’s not certain whether colleges would follow the same schedule. 
At UVU, Kirk was killed Sept. 10 while answering a question just minutes into his speaking event in a courtyard. The sound of a single shot sent his audience running for cover and triggered a manhunt for the suspected shooter that lasted almost a day and a half. 
The college’s police department came under a microscope in the days that followed. Experts criticized the light security for the event, staffed with six UVU officers, and without assistance from deputies from the Utah County Sheriff’s Office.

Kirk was also scheduled to speak at Utah State University just three three weeks later, and the college held an event with other speakers in Kirk’s place, including Utah Gov. Spencer Cox. 
For that event, USU asked for help from nearby police departments and other Utah colleges. The University of Utah and Weber State University “were both able to provide some resources to them to help out,” said Keith Squires, chief safety officer at the University of Utah. 
Squires made the comment during a regular meeting of the school safety task force Monday at the state Capitol. The group didn’t talk about UVU’s security plan, but did discuss whether the campus police throughout the states have the resources they need.
In response to a question from Wilcox about whether his department is staffed, Squires said the University of Utah has made changes after Kirk’s shooting. 
“We all know that tragedy strikes, sometimes resources are made available, and the university’s allowed me to be able to put some things in place after assessing needs that I feel very good about,” Squires said, without elaborating. 
Wilcox said colleges should work with the wider community to keep large events safe, but local police departments and sheriffs can only help so much without stretching themselves too thin.
“This is the new reality: We do not have the resources that we need to pull that off consistently,” Wilcox said. “At some point, we’ve got to build that into the structure, into the plan, into the priority list, to make sure that that’s taken care of.”
