It was early 2002 when I traveled to the Natural State for a job interview with the Democrat-Gazette. I was in my early 20s, and Bill Clinton and the Razorbacks were the only two things I knew about the state when I flew in here.
By the time I flew out, I knew I was ready to move here.
Construction had barely begun on the Clinton presidential library at a site along the Arkansas River. There were few options for 20-somethings to go out on Friday nights, so we usually alternated between Flying Saucer and Midtown Billiards. Democrats controlled a majority in both chambers of the Legislature and nearly every statewide office.
The Arkansas I now call home is vastly different in many ways from the place I flew out to 23 years ago. Clinton’s library has been the anchor for development in Little Rock’s downtown, which has much more dining and drinking options than I first enjoyed. Republicans predominate throughout the state’s offices, and Democrats haven’t elected a candidate statewide since 2010.
Some things remain the same about the state. Its people continue to be welcoming. This is still a great place for covering government and politics. Above all, readers here are hungry for news about their state government and how it affects their lives.
That’s why I’m excited to join the Arkansas Advocate as its editor-in-chief.
In just three short years, the Advocate has distinguished itself as a key player in covering Arkansas’ biggest stories about politics, policy and government. That’s due to the leadership of Sonny Albarado, the Advocate’s first editor, and the talented team of journalists he’s led.
But the Advocate also benefits from being in a great state for political news, and a public that wants to know more about how their tax dollars are being spent. They want state government coverage that goes beyond what’s happening in legislative meetings, and election stories that go beyond horse race analysis.
There’s no shortage of news for us to tackle in the coming year, including a midterm election season that kicks off just a few days into 2026 with two key special legislative races. The fight over Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders’ plans to build a 3,000-bed prison shows no signs of slowing and could come to a head during next year’s legislative session. And the effects of the Trump administration’s efforts to overhaul social safety net programs like Medicaid are going to be felt throughout the state.
I was fortunate to cover Arkansas for 20 years for The Associated Press, and I’ve joined the Advocate because I believe in its mission to show Arkansans how state government affects their lives. That information is the best way for them to make informed decisions to help their communities.
The Arkansas Advocate will always be free to read, with no paywalls or ads. We are a nonprofit supported by the generosity of those who, like you, believe that quality journalism is the cornerstone of democracy.
I’m looking forward to leading our newsroom: Deputy Editor Antoinette Grajeda along with reporters Tess Vrbin and Ainsley Platt. I’ll be writing a regular news analysis to explore how the decisions made by elected officials affect readers’ lives.
Arkansas is fortunate to have a variety of news sources covering local and state government. In a time when other news organizations are retreating from covering local and state governments, it’s vital to have more outlets investing in that news. Transparency requires more eyes keeping watch, not fewer.
That’s why the Advocate is here, and that’s why I’m eager to get to work.",https://arkansasadvocate.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Demillo-in-DC-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-12-21 05:57:09.543864

But doing so has been complicated.,"The Thursday Victoria Woody got the phone call started out like any other in March 2024. She was at home working and preparing for a business trip, while her 9-year-old son was at school. Then the caller ID lit up — an investigator with the Connecticut Department of Children and Families was on the line with an extraordinary question: Was Woody willing to take in her sister’s five children that very day?
“I didn’t hesitate to say yes,” Woody said. “It was more, ‘Oh my god, it’s the middle of the workday!’” 
She ended her workday early and made a quick assessment of her home. Breakable objects were closed up in a box and placed in the laundry room. She emptied her spare bedroom and made note of what she needed: a mattress for one of the older kids and cribs for the three youngest, whom she called the “littles,” an almost 2-year-old girl, and 9-month-old twins. 
She’d need clothes, diapers, bedding, bottles, formula, food — much of which came flooding in within days with help from DCF and friends. Woody also had to undergo a background check by DCF right away, and then, in the coming months, complete a licensing process to care for the children. 
It also took Woody some time to absorb the enormity of what she was about to take on. “It’s just me! It’s me up against six kids,” she remembered thinking.

The decision to move the kids in with Woody is referred to as a “kinship” placement in DCF parlance. In these placements, children live with relatives or “fictive kin” — meaning a close family connection like a coach, neighbor or teacher. 
In 2019, Connecticut set a goal to increase its rate of kinship care placements to 70%, an aspirational figure set by former commissioner Vanessa Dorantes. That goal, which has no specified timeframe, was intended to build on progress the agency has made since 2010 to grow its kinship placement rate. The effort is based on extensive research showing that kinship placements often have positive effects in the long term, from improvements in a child’s mental health to better school attendance. 
“We fundamentally believe that children should reside safely at home with their parents, and when that is not possible, due to an unresolved safety factor, we want to do everything we can to keep that child within the familial system or with people that have a familial relationship with them,” said Ken Mysogland, DCF’s chief administrator of external affairs and a former director of foster care at the agency. 
For Woody, keeping the children together was critical. From the moment she got the call, it was clear in her mind that the children had to remain united under her roof, despite the fact that she hadn’t seen the older kids in years, and she’d never met the three younger ones. 
The oldest child, age 15, has Type 1 diabetes. The toddler was frightened and had trouble sleeping. The kids had been through a lot, and had moved from homes to shelters. At one point, they’d slept in a storage unit. 
“I knew that, no matter what, they needed to see that family is important and that at the end of the day, you have each other,” she said.
In 2010, only 17% of DCF placements were with kin in Connecticut. The vast majority went instead to licensed foster families or to congregate care.
Today, out of 1,900 licensed caregivers, 850 are kinship families, and 47.5% of children placed by the agency are in kinship care. 
Some states like Rhode Island have already surpassed Connecticut’s goal, with around 73% of children in kinship placements. But Connecticut is still toward the front of the pack nationwide, exceeding the national average of 39%. It ranks ahead of neighboring Massachusetts which has a 39% rate of kinship placement and much further ahead of states like Virginia, where only 17% of kids in foster care are living with kin. 
Mysogland said that the COVID-19 pandemic complicated the agency’s ability to meet its 70% target because of “an increase in the acuity of behavioral health needs of children, higher costs of living, community unrest, the opioid crisis, and other pressures that directly impact a family’s ability to care for their own children, leaving them with less ability to care for others’ [children].” 
At the same time, the agency is making progress on another one of its goals: reducing the number of children in DCF care. That number has gone from 3,740 in December 2019 to 2,953 in December 2025.
“We’re very proud of the fact that we have supports to keep children at home and prevent removal,” Mysogland said. 
But DCF’s emphasis on kinship care is not without its critics, who say they’re concerned that the favor DCF shows to kinship placements can result in placements with families that are not prepared to take on a child with complex needs, or result in a child being moved in some cases.

Road to kinship care
Getting to the nearly 50% rate has been a layered process, one that reflects changing attitudes and tactics within an agency trying to account for evolving national trends. 
Fifteen years ago, the 17% kinship care rate at DCF was low, but on par with rates across the country. That year, according to Mysogland, DCF Commissioner Susan Hamilton launched an effort to place more children with kin before her first tenure as commissioner ended. Hamilton recently took over the helm of the department once again, serving as acting commissioner following the departure of Jodi Hill-Lilly in September. 
The issue saw significant investment under the direction of Joette Katz, who took over as commissioner in 2011, at a moment when the agency was under fire for failures to recruit foster parents and an overreliance on congregate care in wake of a lawsuit against the agency.
My theory was, for starters, children should have breakfast in the morning with the same person who put them to bed the night before. That’s how I raised my children and that’s how all children deserve to be raised.joette katz, former dcf commissioner
Katz, who left her post as a justice on Connecticut’s Supreme Court to become commissioner under Gov. Dannel P. Malloy, had previously worked as a juvenile judge. But that didn’t prepare her for the complexities of DCF’s inner workings. 
“What I learned is that children were not being placed with kin,” Katz said. “Many children were being sent out of state, and far too many were being placed in congregate care.” 
Katz said that while those institutions weren’t poorly run, their employees worked multiple shifts, so the caretakers that children saw changed throughout the day. 
“My theory was, for starters, children should have breakfast in the morning with the same person who put them to bed the night before. That’s how I raised my children and that’s how all children deserve to be raised,” Katz said. 
The push to place foster youth with kin is supported by a large body of research. Generations United, a nonprofit that promotes family placements, points to research supported by the National Institutes of Health and the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development over the past two decades, as well as analysis of state level data. The findings were persuasive: Children in kinship placements tend to maintain more relationships because they often remain in the same communities and schools, living with people who share the same racial and cultural identity. Children in kinship care also have a lower likelihood of behavioral problems and mental health challenges. 
The picture isn’t entirely rosy — some research has found that children in kinship care have lower rates of adoption and reunification, for example. But children in kinship care have also seen improved educational outcomes, including better attendance and lower rates of discipline. Relatives often live in the same communities so kids in kinship care are more likely to stay put in the same school district. 
But some of the reasons for the better outcomes among children in kinship care are more subjective, and difficult to prove. For example, researchers theorize that being placed with kin may make the process of removal from birth parents less traumatic for some children, leading to fewer behavioral issues. Or, kinship caregivers may feel more personally involved and connected with a child than a typical foster parent, meaning a relative who already knows a child may be less likely to end a placement out of a sense of personal responsibility and loyalty. 
“What we know from national statistics is that children who are placed into kinship care do better, physically, emotionally, psychologically, educationally as compared to kids in other placements, because of the comfort that they feel living with those individuals with whom they’re already familiar,” Mysogland said. 
DCF is leaning into that success. Advocates say it’s a course correction after an era in which the agency didn’t put much effort into placing kids with family. 
The good part is that more kids are with family. But the difficulties are that sometimes the families are not equipped to handle some of the kids, and the resources given to families are not intensive enough for families to be able to parent the kids.martha stone, center for children’s advocacy founder
“I’ve seen (commissioners) come and go and have seen the pendulum swing back and forth” between reunification of families and taking kids away, said Martha Stone, founder of the Center for Children’s Advocacy in Connecticut, which brought the landmark “Juan F.” class action lawsuit. The case, filed in 1989, found the agency was poorly resourced and guided by outdated policies and resulted in the department being placed under federal oversight until 2022.
The swings toward removal, Stone said, come in response to egregious child deaths in the news. Katz came into office at a time when the pendulum was headed back toward family unification, and at a time when a national push was being made by the Annie E. Casey Foundation and others to emphasize kinship placements. 
“There’s been a mixed reaction to that, both in Connecticut and nationally,” Stone said. “The good part is that more kids are with family. But the difficulties are that sometimes the families are not equipped to handle some of the kids, and the resources given to families are not intensive enough for families to be able to parent the kids.” 
According to Katz, 40% of children were in congregate settings when she began at the agency. By the time she left, that had fallen to 6%. 
While a federal law in 1996 dictated that relatives had to be given preference when children were placed, that rule was ineffective for many families who, like Woody, were not previously licensed to be foster parents. 
Before her tenure, Katz said she heard that DCF had at one point been ordered to remove scores of kids from foster homes after an incident in which a child was injured. Katz said DCF employees from that era tended to believe that it was safer to place a child in an institution rather than in a foster home. “Well, we can’t have DCF in your house 24/7,” the thinking went. So, if a concern was raised about a child’s welfare, the safest thing to do was to swiftly take them out of the home.
To Katz, it was clear that removal was traumatic. “Really, children don’t have to always be removed to be safe.” Even children with needs, like psychiatric care, could be helped in the home rather than being removed. 
When children did need to be removed, it was common sense to Katz that they should go with kin whenever possible.
“It’s very traumatic for children who are having any experience with the system,” Katz said. To minimize the trauma, she said it made sense to place them with people they knew. “At least let them be with somebody — grandma, grandpa, somebody else who is part of their network and not a total stranger. And it was just that basic.”
Mysogland said the shift to emphasize kinship placements concerned some foster families. 
“At the time, there was some uneasiness in the foster care community because foster parents felt like they were now not as important as kin,” Mysogland said. But, Mysogland said, foster families are a critical resource and DCF needs new foster families, since there are many situations in which a child cannot be placed with kin. 
Dr. Tyreasa Washington, a social worker and scholar who studies the impact of kinship care on children and caregivers and teaches at Harvard Medical School, said the increased number of children in kinship care, in Connecticut and other states, is largely an acknowledgement of a robust body of research that indicates children placed with kin have the best outcomes. 
“Being able to maintain cultural ties with siblings, aunts and uncles, and have a connection with their birth parents, is better,” Washington said. “New research also says that there’s less of a chance for children to be reabused when they’re placed with kin.” 
Claire Kimberly, a senior policy analyst on child welfare at the policy research nonprofit Chapin Hall, said that federal policy moves over the past two decades have incrementally created more support for family unification and kinship care, and states like Connecticut acted accordingly. “There’s been research supporting it, and our policy makers are getting that research, realizing that kinship care is better overall, and then creating new policies based on that,” she said.
By the time Katz left DCF in 2019, more than 40% of children were in kinship placements. 
Overcoming Challenges
Today, that number sits still higher, at nearly 50%. Almost 40% of those kids are with relatives and the rest are with fictive kin.
But as Woody’s story illustrates, it can be challenging to suddenly ask a relative to take in children. Foster families go through a complex licensing process that requires them to apply and prepare their home for potential foster children. But kin are usually not previously licensed. 
In the pursuit to place more children with kin, DCF has tried to remove friction points to ensure that kin can say yes.
“As long as the individual passes a Child Protective Services check, a state police check and a home inspection that day,” a child can be placed in a kinship home immediately, Mysogland said. Then, the agency will do a lengthier fingerprint check, a longer home study, and help the family comply with licensing requirements. When possible, DCF licenses the family. The ultimate goal is always for children to be reunited with their parents. 
DCF also tries to provide families with whatever else they might need to support the child through ConnectiKIN, a voluntary program run through Wheeler Health and Family Centered Services of CT that connects kin with DCF resources they may need.
“They haven’t asked to do this, and they all of a sudden have kids in their home,” said Sharon Pendleton-Ponzani, the head of foster care services for the Wheeler Clinic, who helps run the ConnectiKIN program. “They may not have beds, they may not have cribs, they may not have enough food, they may not have a car seat.” 
ConnectiKIN, also called C-KIN, facilitates getting kin those items, along with access to services from DCF like therapy or babysitting. 
Pendleton-Ponzani said some of the biggest snags tend to be logistical — how to get a child picked up for school at a different bus stop, for example. 
“You fill out the paperwork, you’ve gotta get on the list, those types of things can’t immediately be solved. They take a couple of days, and that’s hard for families,” she said. To that end, C-KIN provides what they call “kinship navigators” to help a family fill out needed forms and resolve the issue. 
If we have a family that has raised their hand to say, ‘Yeah, I will care for this child,’ we will literally do everything we can to support them to make that placement work and make it successful.Ken Mysogland, DCF’s chief administrator of external affairs
It’s part of DCF’s effort to ensure more families say “yes” to caring for kin, if the obstacle standing in their way can be overcome. 
“If we have a family that has raised their hand to say, ‘Yeah, I will care for this child,’ we will literally do everything we can to support them to make that placement work and make it successful,” Mysogland said.
Mysogland also said that a history of interactions with law enforcement does not preclude a family from taking in kin. 
“For example, if you in your past maybe have been arrested for shoplifting, maybe motor vehicle violations, other somewhat minor criminal charges, we can take a look at that,” Mysogland said. If DCF determines that a past incident would not impact a person’s ability to safely parent a child, they can waive that licensing requirement. 
Some foster parents, like Doris A. Maldonado Mendez, say they have mixed feelings about the emphasis that DCF has put on these placements. Maldonado Mendez, who fostered and adopted children, is concerned about the agency’s willingness to overlook criminal charges, for example, when placements are made.
“Ultimately, bloodlines or the same zip code does not make for the ideal placement — especially once the child is settled and receiving services,” she said via email. Maldonado Mendez wrote that while she is by no means against kinship care, the emphasis on kin has left non-kin families feeling “dismissed, sidelined, and silenced.” 
Children in her care as a foster parent were moved to kinship placements and Maldonado Mendez, who has adopted foster children, said she was left to help them “reconcile the contradictions of a system that prioritizes placement over permanence.” 
Mysogland said that for DCF it’s sometimes necessary to move a child as a kinship placement is prioritized, because the agency believes it’s ultimately in the best interest of the child to be with kin. At times, that placement cannot be found at the moment of an emergency removal. 
At the same time, Mysogland said he did not want to diminish the role of foster parents. “We value all foster parents in our system and truly appreciate their dedication and commitment to our children. We hope that if a child transitions out of their home, they remain in contact with that child and their family given the significant role they have played in their life,” he said.
A federal rule change in 2023 has allowed states to come up with a different set of licensing requirements for kinship caregivers. Historically, many states placed children with kin on a two-tiered system, in which kin did not receive the same maintenance payments as other foster families. While kin were preferred, they were not adequately resourced. 
But according to Mysogland, Connecticut has always required kin to get licensed, and has always compensated them equal to non-kin foster families. Still, licensure has proved to be a barrier, because some kin who would otherwise be willing to take in a child don’t want to go through the process. 
As Connecticut attempts to move its kinship care numbers higher, researchers say that Washington State is among the places that can serve as an example. Washington’s child welfare agency has aggressively worked to improve kinship numbers, which stand at around 59% as of 2025, and they have taken advantage of the 2023 federal rule change to create a separate licensing track for kinship caregivers, which streamlines the process and requires less paperwork. 
“For foster care we had about 78 rules you had to do, and fill out all this paperwork, and an application, and we narrowed it down to about half, so 30 rules,” said Ruben Reeves, assistant secretary for learning for the Washington Department of Children, Youth and Families. Reeves said the department still conducts home studies and background checks on all placements, but it is trying to remove non safety-related barriers to ensure families can get foster support payments. 
Connecticut’s DCF is actively considering a similar option for its future kinship placements, according to Mysogland. Currently, DCF allows kin to take in child relatives in emergency situations, as in Woody’s case, while they apply for a license — as long as background checks and a walkthrough of the home are completed. And while Connecticut has not yet created a separate type of license for kin, DCF can exempt these families from some of the typical requirements — that a bedroom must have a window, for example, or that it be used for sleeping purposes only.

‘You made it vibrant’
When Woody’s nieces and nephews came to her home in the emergency placement, she went through that licensure process, including a medical course to manage one child’s diabetes and a CPR course. But to Woody, it wasn’t a meaningful barrier.
“The process was super simple,” Woody said. She said that DCF spread out the requirements over a few months so as not to overwhelm her. 
The main issue that frustrated Woody, she said, was workforce turnover at DCF. During the first four months of the children’s placement, she went through five caseworkers. “That was a huge challenge, because you didn’t really know who you were going to get,” she said. “One of them we were assigned for two weeks. I never even met him. It was insane.” 
Woody’s license only pertained to the specific children in her care. But now that her nieces and nephews are back with her sister, Woody is planning to become licensed to foster other children in the future, children who don’t have the option of going with kin. 
After taking in family members, she has an appreciation for why a kinship care placement, when possible, is a powerful tool for children and caregivers. 
“I knew the boys. I knew where their challenges were, where their struggles were. Even if I hadn’t seen them in three years, they still were the same kids that I knew and loved all those years. So I knew what they were going through. I knew what to expect. I knew their medical history,” Woody said. 
The younger kids, who Woody hadn’t met, were more of a challenge at first. “I still had to get to know them but once I did, I fell in love all over again with them,” she said. “Even after being back with their mom, they have a relationship with me. And they know that I’m always going to be there because I’m their aunt.”
When the kids left after a year, Woody sent her son to visit some relatives in Georgia. She knew how hard it would be for him to see their house — once full of cribs, toys, laughter and tears — empty and silent. 
Recently her nieces and nephews came for a visit. “My nephews were like, ‘Wow, the house looks so empty.’ And I was like, ‘Yeah, you guys built it. You made it vibrant.’”
Woody had her struggles, both during the placement and after. But she has no regrets about saying yes when she got the call.
“The only thing that matters is those kids, and whether you have them for six months, or you have them a year or two years, they’re not going to forget that,” she said.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/2025_1217_SR_KinshipCare_062-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-21 05:57:09.543864

The iconic 56-year-old blue-domed building is used less frequently than it could or ought to be, he says, or at least less frequently than similar spaces in other large American cities. That ties into a theme running through his book, which is about the history of downtown development, the search for investors and the struggle to make Wichita a destination city.
“This building, which is really the heart of the tourism industry in Wichita, is just completely empty,” Billingham says. “Here on a Tuesday afternoon, there are a few people that are walking in and out to do rehearsals, I think, for a performance. But other than that, it’s just me.”
Billingham, an associate professor at Wichita State University, has studied downtown Wichita for years. His book, “All-American City: Bluster, Boom, and Bust in Wichita,” will be released in March by the University Press of Kansas. I was given an advance copy to review. Full disclosure, I’m also a UPK author and, at this time last year, I interviewed Billingham for a column about the homeless in Wichita.
Billingham’s book is significant as the definitive cultural and economic history of the state’s largest city, but it’s also an interesting read. In it, you’ll find the story of how Wichita almost had a 299-foot Keeper of the Plains statue, more than six times the height of the iconic sculpture on the Arkansas River. The book also tells how investors known as the “Minnesota Guys” promised futuristic growth, bought up a swath of downtown, and were the darlings of civic leaders and local news media before their indictments for state securities fraud.
The topics Billingham writes about are of more than historical interest, because on the day I interviewed him the Wichita City Council unanimously approved a special election for March 3 on a 1% city sales tax. If passed by voters, the new tax would generate $850 million over seven years.
The plan, pitched by nonprofit Wichita Forward a few weeks ago, offers a buffet of initiatives: $250 million would go to renovating Century II and the exhibition hall, $225 million to public safety, $150 million to property tax relief, $150 million to housing and homelessness programs, and $75 million for a new performing arts center. Perhaps only in Wichita could somebody come up with a plan that cuts property taxes for homeowners and places a 1% tax on all retail, including food and groceries. That would make life harder for those least able to afford any kind of increase.
Wichita Forward was organized in September, according to public radio station KMUW, by a trio of local CEOs — Fidelity Bank, Hutton construction and design, and Thrive Restaurant Group. The organization met heavy public opposition and has refused to release survey data it says indicates the plan is what city residents want, reported the Wichita Eagle.
“What you have is this contrast that you see over and over again,” Billingham said.
One of the founders of the Wichita Forward plan said the city is 10 years behind its peers, while another claimed the city had momentum and it would be foolish to take the foot off the accelerator.
“At the exact same moment, you’re hearing those two basically contradictory impulses coming out of these people’s mouths — ‘We’re falling behind our peers,’ but ‘We have such great momentum,’ ” he said.
It’s that tension, Billingham said, that has driven and perhaps doomed development projects in the past. Overshadowing every effort in recent memory is what Billingham calls “the most intractable obstacle to realizing gentrification in downtown Wichita,” homeless people.
“This is not a problem that’s unique to Wichita,” he said, “but is bound up in all of these conversations for over half a century, how to deal with poverty and homelessness in the urban core.”
If you want to create a downtown that is amenable to investment and attractive to visitors, he said, the thinking goes that you have to figure out how to isolate or relocate or control or constrain the unhoused people who are viewed as detrimental to growth.
In Wichita, he said, homelessness is uncomfortably apparent because there is so little else that attracts attention downtown.
“Why does homelessness stick out as such a salient issue in Wichita? If you go to San Francisco or New York City or Chicago, you’re going to see a lot more homelessness,” he said. “You’re going to see a lot more people living on the streets than you do here. But you’re also going to see world-class tourist attractions. You’re going to have a tourist economy that thrives.”
Wichita has failed over the decades to incubate investments that would attract leisure and tourism trade on a large scale. The business class, Billingham said, has seized on the unhoused as being the problem, but simply relocating the homeless population isn’t necessarily the solution.
Among the themes woven through the book is the emphasis on boosterism in Wichita, something that Marshall Murdock — founder of the Wichita Eagle, in 1872 — practically made a religion of. Murdock boasted the town was “born booming” and came up with a host of hyperbolic nicknames for it. Billingham’s favorite is the “Peerless Princess of the Plains.”
This boosterism evolved into something Billingham describes as the “Potemkin City” strategy, in which economic reality is hidden behind a facade of marketing and false optimism. The challenge for any city attempting to market itself as a destination is to portray a sense of the authentic while also offering something that feels familiar to visitors.
For Wichita, that challenge is particularly steep because of its location.
“When you look at a map of Wichita, Kansas, it is not immediately clear that there ought to be a city here in the first place,” Billingham writes in an early chapter. “Isolated, remote, separated by more than 150 miles from any other substantial metropolitan settlement, Wichita appears in an aerial image of the landscape as simply the largest of a series of evenly spaced gray oblong blips against the green, yellow, and beige background of the unforgiving Kansas prairie.”
How would city leaders react to that paragraph?
“That’s the question that we’re going to find out in a couple of months,” Billingham told me. “That’s going to be true about a lot of things that are in the book. There are things people will have objections to. … The book is my book, and my interpretation of what the city is like. I came from the greater Boston area, and what I found (here) was just a completely different way of building a landscape than what I was used to.”
But Billingham says he has come to love his adopted city, and his study of Wichita’s downtown borders on the obsessive. When I walked with him last year down Douglas Street to Naftzger Park, he knew the history of just about every building along what was once considered the town’s skid row. He also knows the history of the city’s flag, which was adopted in 1937 after local artist and sign painter Cecil McAlister submitted it in a municipal contest. The flag languished in obscurity for decades until it gained popularity in the 1990s as a symbol of civic pride and the city’s art community. In 2004, the Wichita flag was ranked as the sixth best municipal flag in the country by the North American Vexillological Association. Now, the flag is ubiquitous on everything from bumper stickers to coffee mugs.
The flag is difficult to describe, but think of it as an off-center red-and-white vortex.
As the epigraph to his book, Billingham uses a verse from the most famous poem ever written about the city, Allen Ginsberg’s 1966 “Wichita Vortex Sutra.” The verse urges a traveler home, past the “newspaper language factory under the Union Station railroad bridge on Douglas to the center of the Vortex.”
I asked Billingham about the poem.
“Obviously, Ginsberg’s poetry is complicated,” he said. “And in that poem in particular, he was dealing with global issues, but he was in Wichita, which was really a cauldron of literary culture, especially in the Beat movement.”
And the vortex?
“So Ginsberg writes this poem as he is driving through the Kansas landscape and coming into the city of Wichita,” Billingham said. “And what he talks about is the vortex, the key image. I’m not a literary scholar, so you may not want to quote me too much on my interpretation, but the way I see it is the vortex he’s talking about is this vortex of political culture, political ideology, that is radiating through American society, a very conservative culture. And Wichita is at the heart of that conservative impulse.”
Billingham said that describes not only the past but the present.
“In many ways that’s still true today,” he said. “This is the cauldron of conservatism in American society.”
Billingham may be right about Wichita being the headwaters of the modern conservative moment, if only for the Kochs. But conservatism alone doesn’t describe the brand of “greed is good” politics coming from Wichita. You would have to call it “libertarian-conservative” or something similar, because Charles and David Koch were more taken with Ayn Rand than Ronald Reagan, who in 1980 they charged was too similar to the Democrats. Lily Wu, the current mayor of Wichita, is also a libertarian. Of the 100 largest American cities, Wichita is the only one helmed by a registered Libertarian.
Labeling an entire city, of course, is unfair. About 1 in 4 voters in Sedgwick County were registered Democrats in 2024. Only about 1 in 50 were Libertarians. Even using the shorthand of “the Kochs” is inaccurate because it was only brothers Charles and David (the latter now deceased) who were the money and influence behind right-wing movements such as the Tea Party. It doesn’t acknowledge the bitter feud waged over the future of the family business by Bill Koch, often called “the other brother.”
Koch Industries, a multinational conglomerate founded on petroleum refining, is the world’s second-largest privately held company, according to Forbes. The magazine reported Koch’s revenues at $125 billion this year — bigger than the GDP of most smaller countries.
As Bob Dylan sang, money doesn’t talk, it swears.
It might be fair to say that libertarians have had an outsized influence in Wichita, which has at least partially set the tone in national conservative politics. These thoughts are mine, not Billingham’s. But it was his talk of vortexes that got me to thinking about it.
My final question for Billingham was about authenticity. The quest for a sense of the authentic is a driver of regional economic development, a zero-sum game in which cities compete for a finite share of tourist income.
“I don’t think there’s one authentic Wichita,” he said. “Just like there is not one authentic any place. You have diverse subcultures. You have a lot of ethnic diversity. … You find a lot of authenticity in the neighborhoods of this city and in the working class parts of town. I don’t think there’s one authentic city, but what we really do need is to prioritize the lives and the challenges of our working class.”
To be sure, Wichita has had boom times, and that’s the reason its population is 400,000. The city’s long association with the aircraft industry contributed to that, rising in the early 20th century but faltering in recent decades. Civic leaders were faced with the task of diversifying the local economy, with mixed results.
In the book’s conclusion, Billingham calls for a rethinking of policy to require more from their corporate residents.
“What is needed, above all else, is a détente among city and state leaders (to) mutually agree to cool interregional competition by declining to dangle costly incentive packages in front of companies in the hopes of poaching corporate operations and jobs from their peers,” Billingham writes.
Unfortunately, unilateral disarmament by a single “virtuous leader” would be ill advised and reckless. He suggests the federal government step in with corporate tax and regulatory reform to protect the finances of local governments.
That’s unlikely to happen anytime soon, he says. Conservative anti-tax philosophy, neoliberal dominance and increasing antipathy to unhoused people dominate. But that isn’t a reason to abandon the dream of a better city — a better Wichita — for those who live and work in Murdock’s “Peerless Princess.”

Last week marked yet another birthday for Interstate 84 in Connecticut, first opened on December 16, 1961, a milestone that deserves candles, cake, and perhaps a moment of silence for every commuter who has ever thought, “How is this highway still not finished?”



Back in the 60’s, I-84 wasn’t just a highway.  It was a promise.  The sleek, modern “Yankee Expressway” would whisk drivers effortlessly from Danbury to Hartford and beyond.  Congestion would vanish, they said. Town centers would breathe easier, they hoped.  America would drive happily ever after, wouldn’t they?
Spoiler alert: ‘They’ were wrong.
The early 1960s were the golden age of highway hubris. The federal government was handing out interstate money like Halloween candy, and Connecticut happily obliged by deciding that U.S. Route 6, a perfectly serviceable road that inconveniently (at least to drivers) passed through towns, had to go.  
What better solution than a wide, limited-access highway careening over and through over hills, rivers, and Hartford neighborhoods and downtown alike? 
When the first 15-mile stretch opened between the New York line and Sandy Hook, officials celebrated as if traffic had been permanently solved.  It hadn’t even reached Hartford yet, but optimism was cheap, and costly concrete was plentiful.
By the time I-84 finally lumbered into the capital city years later, the damage was already baked in.  Entire neighborhoods were carved up in the name of progress. The highway bent, twisted, doubled back, stacked lanes on top of each other, and introduced a master class in left-hand exits, the traffic engineering equivalent of juggling chainsaws.  And we’re still debating how to fix all that… the topic for a future column, if not a thesis.
Consider the Waterbury “Mixmaster” where I-84 crosses Route 8, a traffic interchange so messed up that national traffic engineers hold it up as an example of what never to build again.  And that’s before the Connecticut Department of Transportation spends $3-5 billion to replace it.
And yet, every decade since the ribbon was cut brought the same response to the ever-worsening traffic: Just widen it.
Traffic backed up? Add lanes. Still backed up? Add more lanes. Still bad? Rebuild interchanges, add HOV lanes, re-stripe everything, and promise that this time it’ll work. This logic has been faithfully applied for more than six decades — making I-84 not just a highway, but a self-sustaining traffic experiment in futility.
So as I-84 blows out its birthday candles, it stands as a living monument to “induced demand,” the transportation principle politely explained in planning textbooks (yawn) and painfully experienced by anyone who’s crawled through Waterbury at rush hour (ouch):  the more road you build, the more traffic shows up to fill it.  Like magic. Or mold.
To be fair, I-84 has aged exactly as expected.  It’s constantly under reconstruction and needed repairs, perpetually congested, and somehow always remains essential despite being deeply flawed, much like Connecticut itself.
So happy birthday, I-84.  Sixty-four years young.  You were built to end traffic and instead, you’ve given us a lifetime of it.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/I-84.jpg,,,2025-12-21 04:57:16.374298

The senior was responsible for 318 yards of offense and three touchdowns, moving him into sixth place all-time in program history. His third-quarter touchdown pass to De’Zhaun Stribling was the 50th of his college career. He has thrown for at least one score in every game since he arrived in Oxford.

After the game, Chambliss took a minute to reflect on how different his life is compared to a year ago.
“This was definitely a dream of mine from when I was a little kid,” he said. “And now that we’re here, it’s time to embrace it and have fun. But, yeah, it’s crazy to think about how my life has changed since going from Division II Ferris State to Ole Miss and the SEC.”
Chambliss’ former team, Ferris State, clinched its second-straight championship Saturday with a 42-21 win over Harding in McKinney, Texas.
“Shout out to them,” Chambliss said Saturday with a grin.

The Mississippi contingent
Several of the Rebels’ biggest contributors Saturday were Mississippi natives, especially on the defensive side of the football:
• Sophomore Will Echoles, a former Houston Hilltoppers, led the Rebels with six total tackles, including one for a loss.
• Junior linebacker and Raleigh native Suntarine Perkins had four tackles, including 2.5 for a loss, and forced a fumble that Ole Miss recovered.
• Sophomore defensive end Kam Franklin, a Lake Cormorant product, finished the game with three solo stops and got in on one of the two Rebel sacks of Tulane quarterback Jake Retzlaff.
Echoles, who recently announced he has no plans to enter the transfer portal, said he is looking forward to playing in the Magnolia State for at least one more year.
“Home is home,” Echoles said. “Ole Miss is my home and I love the fans here. Why would I want to be anywhere else?”
Sumrall acknowledged ‘hard’ week

Tulane’s loss to Ole Miss capped a whirlwind December for Green Wave coach Jon Sumrall.
Just two weeks ago, the 43-year-old Huntsville, Alabama, native experienced the highest of highs — accepting the head coaching job at the University of Florida, a position that will reportedly pay him $44.7 million over six years.
And Friday, on the eve he was to lead Tulane into the program’s first-ever College Football Playoff, he announced that his father, George Sumrall, had died after a lengthy illness.
“He watched us today,” Sumrall said. “He’s probably got some questions about how we played, just like I do. I just don’t get to hear it from him tonight.”
A day of records

The win for Ole Miss makes this 2025 rendition of the Rebels the first in program history to record 12 wins, topping the 11-2 previous high set in 2023. The Rebels have also now won 12 consecutive home games going back to an Oct. 26, 2024 win over Oklahoma. It’s the third-longest active steak in all of college football.

The win advances the Rebels (12-1) to a second-round showdown with Georgia in the Sugar Bowl on New Year’s Day in New Orleans.

It was a game of firsts for Ole Miss: It was both the Rebels’ inaugural college football playoff game and the opening salvo for newly minted head coach Pete Golding, elevated from defensive coordinator after former coach Lane Kiffin bolted for LSU on Nov. 28.
“This is obviously an exciting night for our program, our fans and most importantly, our players,” Golding said. “You know, obviously, I think they’ve been through a lot over these last couple of weeks, and it was good to just get back on the grass, at home and in front of our fans, and get out there and play the game they love.”
And play they did. Despite the turnover and a three-week layoff, the first 12-win team in program history showed few signs of rust.
The Rebels went 75 yards in three plays on the game’s opening possession, taking a 7-0 lead on a 20-yard run by All-SEC tailback Kewan Lacy.
Their second drive went 60 yards in four plays, with quarterback Trinidad Chambliss scampering in from six yards out to put Ole Miss ahead 14-0 at the midway mark in the first quarter. That’s seven offensive plays, 135 yards and two touchdowns if you are keeping score. That start put to bed any concerns about offensive coordinator Charlie Weiss, back on loan after following Kiffin to LSU, calling the Ole Miss plays.

“I wasn’t worried about Charlie calling a solid game for one reason,” Golding said  “This whole time, anyone who talked about us has referred to ‘Lane Kiffin’s offense.’ So if we come out here and lay an egg, it was going to be because Lane Kiffin wasn’t here. So I knew he would want to come out here and show it was him calling these games and getting the credit for it.”
The two teams traded field goals in the second quarter, and Ole Miss took a 17-3 lead into the halftime break.The second half was more of the same.
Chambliss tossed a 13-yard touchdown pass to De’Zhaun Stribling on the Rebels’ first possession of the third quarter, and kicker Lucas Carneiro’s second field goal put the Rebels ahead 27-3 headed to the fourth quarter.As one-sided as the final score appeared, Tulane had a much better plan for the Rebels than it did in September.
The Green Wave rolled to 421 yards of total offense — much more than the 282 they gained in the first meeting — but almost all of Saturday’s production came on their own end of the field.
The Ole Miss defense also shut down their opponents when it mattered most. The Green Wave offense was 0-for-4 on fourth-down conversion attempts. Tulane’s outgoing head coach Jon Sumrall said that the determining factor.
“The yardage wasn’t that big of a discrepancy,” Sumrall said. “But the situational stuff wasn’t good for us. We went under center on third and fourth down twice with a yard to go, and couldn’t get it. Then we went into the (shot)gun because if we couldn’t sneak it, maybe we could get it on the perimeter, but we couldn’t.”
Tulane’s lone touchdown came with four minutes left in the game on a 29-yard pass against the Rebels’ defensive reserves. The Green Wave’s only trip into the red zone came in the second quarter and resulted in a field goal.

The Tulane defense offered less resistance. Chambliss finished with a crisp stat line — he was 23 of 29 for 282 yards and three total touchdowns — and Lacy’s 87 yards led a rushing attack that rolled up 151.
“I didn’t feel like the team was nervous or doubting ourselves or anything like that,” Chambliss said. “We didn’t face a whole lot of adversity today, if we’re being honest. We had a couple of drives we stalled out, and those could have been crucial, but other than that we were kind of rolling and I thought we really executed well.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/20185541/AP25355027380167.jpg,,,2025-12-20 23:57:19.199229

Rick Cleveland
In Pete Golding’s debut as the Ole Miss head football coach on this breezy sun-splashed Saturday, his Rebels did not disappoint. They out-blocked, out-tackled, out-ran and thoroughly out-played Tulane, which came into the game with an 11-2 record and as champions of the American Athletic Conference. The final score was 41-10 with the visiting Green Wave scoring its only touchdown late. The outcome was never in doubt after the Rebels scored touchdowns on their first two possessions and made it look easy.
Midway through the third quarter with the Rebels cruising, music blaring, thousands of red and blue lights flashing and many of the crowd of 68,251 dancing, this observer wondered to himself: “My heavens, what would Johnny Vaught think of all this?”
They didn’t have light shows, especially some produced by drones, back in the 1950s and ‘60s when the legendary Vaught was coaching the Rebels to six SEC championships and Top 10 finishes on an almost yearly basis. Hell, they didn’t have stadium lights. But count on this: Vaught surely would approve of these Rebels’ speed, strength and precision – and of the first 12-victory season in Ole Miss history. (Vaught also surely would remind you his team never got to play 12 games.)

On virtually every play that really mattered, the Rebels dominated. Tulane converted only five of 18 third and fourth down possession plays.
For Ole Miss, the usual stars shone brightly. Trinidad Chambliss passed for 282 yards and a touchdown and ran for two more touchdown. Kewan Lacy ran for 87 yards and a touchdown on 15 carries. A fleet of Ole Miss receivers – a dozen in all – made catches. Golding’s defense gave up some yards but stiffened when it had to. Tulane drove the ball into the end zone only once, but was quickly pushed back out. The Rebels were every bit as dominant as they had been back in September when they trounced Tulane 45-10 in this same stadium.

Really, the only anxious moments for the Rebels came in the second quarter when first Lacy and then Chambliss were helped off the field after injuries. The good news: Both eventually returned and seemed no worse for wear.
Many in the record crowd were surely eager to see what difference they would see in Golding’s coaching vs. that of the man he replaced, Lane Kiffin. Not much, turns out. The most obvious difference might have surfaced in the second quarter when, leading 14-3 and facing fourth down and four yards to go at the Tulane 25, Golding chose to kick a field goal. History tells us Kiffin far more times than not, would have gone for the first down. Lucas Carneiro booted the 42-yard field goal.
Asked it about afterward, Golding said, “The book is going to say it’s still a two-possession game, right, but I coach defense and now the field goal makes it a two-touchdown lead. That’s different to me. … And we keep the momentum. That’s where I’m different than the book.”

Translation: Golding figured they could have played until until Christmas and Tulane wouldn’t have scored two touchdowns against his No. 1 defense.
Ole Miss fans, many wearing “Golding Era” buttons, cheered loudly when Golding was shown on the Jumbotrons walking onto the field. In the fourth quarter, with the outcome long since decided, those same fans chanted, “Golding! Golding! Golding!” Moments later, another chant began: “F- – – Lane Kiffin! “F- – – Lane Kiffin! F- – – Lane Kiffin!”
In a post-game interview Ole Miss co-defensive coordinator Bryan Brown was asked what differences he sees in Golding now that he’s the head man.
Said Brown, “Well, his room is bigger now.”

Translation: Golding hasn’t changed.
“He still controls the room,” Brown said. “The guys believe in him. He’s a great coach and a great motivator.”
Joe Judge, the quarterbacks coach and former New York Giants coach head coach, was asked a similar question.
“He’s Pete,” Judge answered. That’s what makes him special. He’s not going to change. That’s why I wanted to stay here and work for him. That’s who he is.”
And Golding, the former Delta State walk-on safety, is now 1-0 as a head coach that “one” was one of the biggest victories in Ole Miss history. His team played fast, physical and soundly – one five-yard penalty and just one turnover.

We’ve recently had a front row seat to this […],"EVERY SAFETY NET in this country has been stitched with holes just wide enough for many of us to slip through. 
We’ve recently had a front row seat to this playing out again. From the billions cut from Medicaid in the sweeping tax and spending bill enacted last summer to the use of SNAP food assistance as a bargaining chip during the government shutdown, the most vulnerable among us continue to be political collateral.  
Poverty is once again being weaponized. And poor people, particularly Black and Brown families, are once again the target. 
There has always been a war on people considered “poor” in America. It is a quiet war, fought with red tape and policy, with silence and forgetting. Its casualties do not lie in foreign fields but on city corners, food lines, and in empty refrigerators. It is the same war that began when this country decided that liberty was a privilege for the landholder, poverty was a moral failing, and human beings could be owned or treated as three-fifths of a person. 
When Lyndon Johnson announced the Great Society in 1964, it was a vision of what this nation might finally become if it chose justice over cruelty. Medicare, Medicaid, Head Start, food assistance, and fair housing were each weapons in the fight against want and in expanding access to the American Dream. But from the moment the Great Society was born, there were those who plotted its undoing. The ink was barely dry before they called it waste. They said it bred dependency, not dignity. The war on poverty, they said, had failed. But the truth is, it was never allowed to win. 
For Black people, this war began long before Johnson ever spoke. It began when our ancestors were enslaved and made to build the wealth that would later be called America. The promise of 40 acres was not simply broken; it was buried.  
The Homestead Act of 1862 opened the nation’s vast lands to settlers and dreamers, but for the freedmen, the gates were guarded by violence and greed. Speculators claimed the best soil, railroad companies took the rest, and when Congress passed the Southern Homestead Act of 1866 to give freedmen a foothold, it offered only swampland and sorrow. What was left to us was labor, not land. 
Public universities born from those same lands through the Morrill Land Act of 1862 became the country’s proudest institutions, yet the children of the enslaved could not enter their gates. It took a second Morrill Land-Grant Act in 1890 to even speak our name, to build parallel schools for a segregated nation. And still, the funding came in trickles, never torrents. America harvested the work but not the worth. 
When the soldiers returned from the Second World War, the GI Bill offered them a ticket into the middle class, a home, an education and a future. But Black veterans, the men who bled for democracy abroad, were told their skin disqualified them from that dream. They were excluded from the banks, denied at the universities, and redlined out of the neighborhoods where their children might thrive. 
Redlining was a blueprint for exclusion. The government mapped out and marked literal red lines around Black neighborhoods, declaring them too risky for investment. And when those neighborhoods finally became desirable again, the same institutions returned to reclaim them. They called this revitalization but gentrification is the new face of a familiar theft. The cycle repeats: disinvestment, neglect, rediscovery, and removal.  
Dr. King knew this war. He knew it when he marched with the sanitation workers in Memphis, men carrying signs that said, “I AM A MAN.” He knew it when A. Philip Randolph called for a March on Washington for freedom and for jobs. King’s dream was never a naïve fantasy of colorblind harmony; it was an indictment of economic cruelty. He understood that poverty was a decision and a deliberate choice to value profit over people. 
And then came the Reagan ‘80s. The administration did not just cut welfare; it turned it into a weapon of shame. It gave the war on poverty a new enemy: the “welfare queen.” She was not real, but she was powerful, conjured from the nation’s oldest fear, the myth of the undeserving Black woman. (And to make matters worse, the woman whose case was the foundation of this fearmongering trope wasn’t actually Black).  
The story of her Cadillac and her food stamps was about narrative. It turned public compassion into contempt. It told the white working class that “the poor” were not victims but thieves, that the problem was not exploitation but excess and fraud. It gave a moral gloss to greed and dressed cruelty in the guise of common sense. It also gave poverty a race, gender, and ethnicity. 
And here we are again. Decades after King’s death, the same battle lines remain. The same moral cowardice dresses itself in a new language. The same myths about laziness and dependency are whispered about those who rely on food assistance, those who turn to Medicaid, and those who need the social safety net that has been frayed and starved. 
With the Medicaid cuts it calls for, the so-called “big, beautiful bill” that promised prosperity offers only pain. On top of those cuts, subsidies to help low- and middle-income Americans who obtain insurance through the Affordable Care Act are set to expire at the end of the month. Our collective acknowledgment through these programs that health should not be a luxury is under siege.  
Meanwhile, threatened with cuts and conditions that would harm those who need it most, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) was held hostage in the recent government showdown over spending. Though the shutdown has ended, the message was clear: food assistance is a political pawn, not a moral commitment. SNAP is now not just an acronym but a four-letter word. 
SNAP provides food assistance to 42 million people. It serves as a lifeline for families who might otherwise go without food. Nearly 40 percent of those who rely on it are children, proof that this program feeds futures as much as it fills plates. It is, in essence, a benefit of democracy, an echo of the Great Society’s original promise in its war on poverty. 
But the social contract has been broken. It is the same old war, wrapped in new rhetoric. 
The cruelest part of this war is that most cannot see it. Or worse, some refuse to acknowledge it. Poverty is a product of deliberate design, yet it is cast as personal failure. Those who rely on public assistance to feed their children are told they should have worked harder, dreamed smaller, and known better. But this has never only been about poverty. It is about race, about history, about a nation that wages war on its own and calls it policy. The war on poverty has always been, in truth, a war on Blackness and a hazing of all those who are different and dare call themselves American. 
Yet even in the wreckage, we Americans keep building. We build out of memory, out of faith, out of the fragments this country leaves us. We build kitchens that feed when policy starves. We build churches that remember when history forgets. We build movements that refuse to die.  
The Great Society was once a promise that America might learn mercy. That promise still waits for its fulfillment. To end this war, we must close the empathy gap: the distance between what this nation says it feels for the working class and what it owes them. We must tell the truth about who we are and what we have done. 
We must decide, finally, that the so-called “working poor” are not a burden on this nation. We must see ourselves when we see our neighbors, friends, and family. They are the ones holding it up. They are not the problem. They are the evidence of America’s unfinished promise as well as the blueprint for how we can still fulfill it.

RUTLAND – Rutland City’s Police Commission said Saturday that the police chief would retire early, in an announcement that follows the disclosure of an internal affairs probe that criticized the actions of the police department in a vehicle pursuit that resulted in the death of a young officer.
The action follows news articles earlier this month by VTDigger and other media on the probe’s finding as well as reporting by Seven Days that Police Chief Brian Kilcullen had known about the report but had not discussed its findings with the police commission, the civilian body that provides oversight of the police department.
The report, which was shared with the police chief in March, only came to public attention after it was filed in court in November by the lawyer representing a Salisbury man charged with murder in the death of the officer during the high speed chase.

The police commission did not say Saturday after a special meeting whether the chief’s decision to retire early was based on the fact that he had not shared the report much sooner with members. 
“That’s a question for him,” Pat Brougham, commission chair, told VTDigger after the meeting. She added of the chief, “We appreciate all of his service.” 
Kilcullen was not present at the announcement Saturday. Following the meeting, he could not immediately be reached for comment
The internal report on the investigation concluded that the death of 19-year-old Rutland City Police Officer Jessica Ebbighausen in 2023 was “preventable” if police had followed proper procedures.Tate Rheaume, the Salisbury man driving the vehicle being pursued by police, is being held in jail without bail awaiting trial on a murder charge in her death.

The report on the internal investigation came to public attention after David Sleigh, the lawyer for Rheaume, filed it in Rutland County Superior criminal court in late November in connection with his defense.
The lawyer said he had been unaware of the report until conducting interviews with Rutland police officers as he prepared to defend his client in the murder case. Rheaume slammed nearly head-on into the cruiser driven by the young police officer who died.
Rheaume, 22, who was also injured in the crash, has been held without bail since April of 2024.
Kilcullen’s retirement is effective March 1. In the meantime, the commission Saturday named Rutland City Police Commander Matthew Prouty interim police chief, with Kilcullen assisting him in a “limited capacity focused on supporting a smooth and orderly transition,” according to a statement from the commission.
Prouty, according to the statement, will be responsible for the “operational oversight” of the department.
Kilcullen was hired as police chief in Rutland in 2015. His current contract, last extended in June, was set to expire in 2027, according to Brougham.
The police commission made its announcement that Kilcullen would be retiring early after meeting in executive session Friday and earlier Saturday.

Recently I reported on the revival of freight service into the village of Gilman, where trains are soon expected to travel on tracks that have lain dormant in residents’ backyards for decades. It’s a project with unclear implications for economic change and quality of life, not only in Gilman but in neighboring towns. It’s also exactly the kind of story that requires patient, long-term reporting and a presence on the ground.
As VTDigger’s Northeast Kingdom reporter, I focus on infrastructure, land use, economic pressures, environmental concerns and the creative ways residents are shaping their futures. Your contribution ensures these stories become part of Vermont’s broader understanding of itself.
With less than two weeks left in the year, we still have $327,638 to raise to meet our goal. We’re grateful to the 2,181 members who have already contributed and hope you’ll join them today.

It’s probably also true that if the only tool you have is a chainsaw, everything looks like it needs to be cut.
Many of us remember an image of Elon Musk wielding a chainsaw, celebrating the many triumphs of the Department of Government Efficiency. Yet, often the actions taken by DOGE proved to be less than triumphant and only rarely led to efficiency.
Unless you’re one of those people who knows how to use a chainsaw to carve a bear statue out of a tree trunk, the chainsaw isn’t known for its precision. In the case of DOGE, its accomplishments didn’t lead to efficiency so much as they often led to court where many of its actions were overturned.
Despite the department’s dubious history, according to two candidates for the Republican nomination for governor of South Dakota, a DOGE-like entity is just what’s needed to cut the fat in state government.

News and commentary on statewide races and ballot questions.

“One thing that we’re focusing on is doing a South Dakota DOGE, actually cutting state expenditures and then passing that savings on to property taxpayers,” Speaker of the House Jon Hansen told KELO.
Not to be outdone, Aberdeen businessman Toby Doeden told KELO, “There is abuse. I guarantee it. And my DOGE is going to find it.”
Let’s just take a moment to consider this. Both candidates believe there is waste in government. Both believe he is the guy to root it out. Both seem to think that they can cut enough fat out of state government to offer some relief to property taxpayers.
So they have both chosen to cut the state bureaucracy by … wait for it … adding to the bureaucracy with a new Department of Government Efficiency. Unless they repurpose a state department that already exists, these candidates will be adding to the state’s expenses before they can start whittling away at any fat in the budget.
The state departments that would appear in the crosshairs of Doeden or Hansen already get a pretty good going-over by the Legislature. During the legislative session, each department is quizzed twice — once in the House and once in the Senate — about its intentions for the coming year.
Then the Appropriations Committee weighs in, ultimately deciding how much money the department needs. Calling for the creation of a DOGE clone is an insult to legislative oversight.
It’s notable that the other two candidates for the Republican nomination, Gov. Larry Rhoden and U.S. Rep. Dusty Johnson, have yet to get on the DOGE-for-South Dakota bandwagon. Too often in Republican primaries, voters are given a choice of candidates who agree with each other on major issues. Finding a way to cut property taxes, through a DOGE-like entity or some other way, will give voters a distinct choice in the primary.
If, to fulfill some campaign promise, Doeden or Hansen must create their own version of DOGE, the new governor would do well not to follow the Musk/Trump model. If we learned anything from watching the slash and burn techniques employed by DOGE, it’s that chainsaws are best left to lumberjacks. Government waste should be cleared away with a scalpel.
Too often, South Dakota’s GOP candidates for governor act as if following the example set by President Donald Trump marks the sure path to victory. Maybe that’s true in heavily red South Dakota. However, following the example the president set with DOGE is just a sure path to chaos.",https://southdakotasearchlight.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/GettyImages-2200924488.jpg,,,2025-12-20 08:56:17.459158

‘Five days before Christmas, a white mob carried out a quadruple homicide at Mississippi’s “Hanging Bridge” — an incident so horrific it helped inspire a national conference on lynchings.
Authorities had charged sisters Maggie and Alma Howze and brothers Major and Andrew Clark with murder, allegedly over a pay dispute with the women’s boss, but before a trial could take place, a dozen vehicles surrounded the jail, manned by a single deputy. 
The mob abducted the four and took them to a bridge over the Chickasawhay River, one mile north of Shubuta. The next morning, citizens awoke to see four bodies swaying from what locals called the “Hanging Bridge.”
Walter White, who had survived the 1906 Atlanta Race Massacre that killed dozens and wounded scores of others, was working for the national NAACP when he heard what happened in Mississippi. He came to investigate. His light skin enabled him to pass for white.
He uncovered allegations that this boss had sexually abused the sisters, who were both pregnant at the time of their deaths. Major Clark planned to marry Maggie Howze, and he reportedly told the boss to stay away from her. White also discovered that Clark’s purported confession in the case came after authorities put his testicles in a vise. He later published what he learned in the NAACP’s report, “Thirty Years of Lynching.”
Twenty-four years later, dawn brought the sight of two more swaying bodies. Two young Black teens, Ernest Green and Charlie Lang, as young as 14, were lynched at the same site after they were accused of attempting to attack a 13-year-old white girl. Some reports say they were whistling at her or chasing her. The white mob didn’t investigate. They abducted the teens and hanged them from the bridge.
Black newspapers published photographs of the teens’ corpses, and the Justice Department launched what is believed to be the first federal lynching investigation in Mississippi. The killers walked free, but the injustice helped fuel the “Double V” campaign led by Black newspapers. Black soldiers would help win World War II and return home for a second push for victory, this one over Jim Crow and mob violence aimed at African Americans.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/16154859/Shubuta-Bridge-MS-Department-of-Archives-History.jpg,,,2025-12-20 08:56:17.459158

AI has not crept but crashed into our lives, and it has its benefits. Yet there are three big reasons we should be wary of how it is being developed, and how quickly.
First, while AI can provide a good summary or outline on a topic or a welcome reassuring presence, it also can present fiction as fact or as garbled and simply weird when it takes on a topic or a relationship. For example, those relying on ChatGPT for medical advice run into its contradictions and misinformation, and some of those who use it for companionship have found it can take a dark turn. 
Second, President Trump recently signed an executive order to empower the federal government to challenge any state-generated AI laws it deems “onerous or excessive.” This should raise red flags, especially since the tech bros, or “broligarchs,” who engage in AI initiatives are aligned with Trump’s agenda.
Third, AI has turbo-charged the proliferation of data centers (more than 600 in Virginia alone and growing, according to a July 2025 report). These massive centers suck up water and electricity in vast amounts, often with unproven water-savings schemes, in drought-prone areas and without real oversight. Many communities have been forced to accept these intrusive, noisy, polluting, resource-draining behemoths.
One might ask whether data centers at least bring economic opportunities to these residents in terms of jobs. Let’s let AI itself respond: “AI data centers employ surprisingly few people directly for operations, typically dozens to a few hundred per large facility.”
Further, the billions of dollars tech bros, corporations and their investors are pouring into the centers are potentially destabilizing our already damaged U.S. economy, creating a worrying financial bubble. Meanwhile, growing dependence on AI keeps stretching water and electricity resources in communities and in the U.S. as a whole.
What does this all mean for Vermonters? Our state government has tried to anticipate AI proliferation and was the first in the nation to create a division focused on AI ethics and implementation. But the changes and challenges are coming quickly. Here’s what you can do now:

Encourage Governor Scott to resist Trump’s executive order trying to prohibit the state from regulating AI. Call him at (802) 828-3333. 


Encourage Scott and the state legislature to ban or at least set a moratorium on the development of any AI centers in Vermont. (There are already legislators aware of and open to these measures, and Bernie Sanders is speaking out for such a moratorium at the national level.)  
Be aware that we must protect Vermont water as this essential resource sadly becomes a commodity elsewhere in the U.S. Louisiana recently wisely backed out of selling water to Texas, whose leaders have allowed data centers into long-term-drought areas, have not protected the water sources that did exist and have failed to address a looming crisis until it is upon them.

This story was originally reported by Jessica Kutz of The 19th.  Meet Jessica and read more of their reporting on gender, politics and policy.
When Cara Romero’s daughter was 11, she became interested in dolls. Romero, who is an enrolled member of the Chemehuevi Indian Tribe in Southern California, began to think about doll culture more deeply and what it can convey to the next generation.
Romero’s husband grew up collecting G.I. Joes, and her mother-in-law had her own Victorian-style porcelain doll collection. For Romero, though, her daughter’s doll phase reminded her of the Native American dolls she grew up seeing at truck stops along I-40.
The dolls were often dressed in plastic pony beads and fake buckskin that parroted the Native American Halloween costumes she knew all too well as dehumanizing stereotypes. So Romero, who is a photographer and artist, set out to create a series of photos that broke down these tropes.
Each photograph in the “First American Doll” series features a life-sized doll box that she designed and crafted, where she poses the women with objects that represent their families, traditions and unique stories.
She wanted her daughter to be proud of her heritage. “I come from a community where women are allowed to have a voice, allowed to be really strong,” she said. “So [I was] wanting to pass down good self esteem and a strong sense of self and identity,” she said. “That’s what we aim to do as moms.”

She started the series with artist and powwow dancer Wakeah Jhane, who is of Kiowa, Comanche and Blackfeet descent. While the Plains Tribes that she is from are the models for stereotypical dolls and costumes, Romero’s photograph captures her intricate buckskin regalia, which was made by her family. Also on display are her moccasins and a fan.
“You can see the stark contrast between what she’s wearing and the Halloween costumes that  people portray Plains people as,” she said. “I really wanted to kind of own it and be like, “You guys even have this wrong.’”
She has since published nine photographs for the series, the most recent featuring Fawn Douglas, an artist, activist and enrolled member of the Las Vegas Paiute Tribe, who is posed with handcrafted baskets and a gourd rattle made by her family. The box is bordered by a Las Vegas playing card motif.
The current day symbolism and high fashion lighting communicates that these women are also contemporary, Romero said. “When artwork, and specifically photography, is devoid of modern context, it does something psychologically, it perpetuates [this idea] that we’re gone and only living in history.”
Naming each of the pieces after the models was also meant to humanize Indigenous women in a way that they weren’t in historical photos. “A lot of times in the ethnographic photographs, they didn’t even say their name,” she said. “We don’t know who they were.”
Some of the photographs from the series are currently traveling the country as part of Romero’s first solo museum exhibition, titled: “Panûpünüwügai (Living Light).” They will be on display next at the Phoenix Art Museum in Arizona starting in February.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-16-055806-1024x680.png,,,2025-12-20 07:57:20.337615

Dozens of members of the tribe, which has been pushing for recognition for more than a century, watched from the Senate gallery as the chamber passed the National Defense Authorization Act, which included the measure, by a vote of 77-20. The House passed the legislation last week, so it will now head to the president’s desk for his signature.
The issue had held up President Donald Trump’s federal judicial nominations for Mississippi for months.
The provision recognizing the Lumbee was supported by Trump, who signed an executive order to advance the tribe’s recognition in January. Sen. Thom Tillis, a Republican from North Carolina, said passing it is the most memorable part of his Senate career.
“We’re literally repealing law that was passed by racist members of this institution in 1958 that made it impossible for (the Lumbee) to get recognized through the administration,” Tillis, who is retiring next year, told NOTUS. “We’re going further by saying they are federally recognized, and they deserve it, and God bless them for being so patient. I would not have been.”
The Lumbee Fairness Act is buried more than 3,000 pages deep in the NDAA for fiscal year 2026. The provision federally recognizes the 55,000-member tribe — which previously only had state-level recognition — and provides the path for Lumbee tribal members to access federal benefits for Native Americans. It also designates several counties in North Carolina as being on or near an Indian reservation: Robeson, Cumberland, Hoke and Scotland.
“There’s been a lot of people who’ve worked on this, and we’re just striving to this point and wanting to see this take place, and I’m just overwhelmed. I’m full of joy. Our people are happy, a lot of tears right now, and we’re thrilled,” John L. Lowery, the chair of the Lumbee Tribe, told NOTUS.
“I just want to thank everybody who’s helped us get here — Sen. Tillis, many others. And I want to thank our ancestors. Our ancestors started this. They saw a vision a long time ago. Thank God we’ve been able to see it fulfilled,” he added.
Sounds of sniffling filled the hallways outside the Senate chamber as Tillis led members of the tribe down the stairs from the gallery after the vote. Some members were crying, some shared hugs.
Tillis has been at the forefront of efforts to get the tribe recognized through congressional action over the past two years, including sponsoring a standalone Senate bill and trying to block Mississippi judicial nominees in an effort to persuade Senate Armed Services Committee Chair Roger Wicker to put the tribe’s recognition in the NDAA.
Trump and his administration have been enthusiastic about recognizing the Lumbee Tribe. Vice President JD Vance joined as a co-sponsor of Tillis’ bill to recognize the tribe in September 2024. While Trump had signed a related executive order, the tribe couldn’t be recognized by an executive order alone, but it could be through an act of Congress.
“I love the Lumbee tribe,” Trump said before signing the executive order. “This is their first big step, right? They were with me all the way. They were great, North Carolina.”
The tribe resides in one of the swingiest states in the nation, which Trump won in the 2024 election by about three percentage points. North Carolina’s other senator, Sen. Ted Budd, has worked with Tillis on legislation to get the tribe recognized.
“I’m very, very pleased at the result,” Budd told NOTUS.
On the 2024 campaign trail, Trump traveled to Robeson County and pledged his support to the Lumbee’s recognition.
“I heard that, and I pursued that, and the president is fulfilling his promise when he signs this into law tomorrow afternoon,” Tillis said. “We’ve had a lot of people go down there. We had Biden go down there. We had people in the Obama administration go down. When they were controlling all of Washington, they didn’t deliver. This president is the reason why we were able to get the environment to get this done.”
Tillis said that the White House counsel, along with the director of legislative affairs, James Braid, was influential in getting the legislation across the finish line.
“We’ve had dust-ups from time to time, but we were all moving like a well-oiled machine,” Tillis said. “It’s been decades that [the Lumbee have] been trying to do it here, let alone a century that they’ve attempted it before they got the ear of some members of Congress.”
Though Tillis is close with the tribe now, and often wears a bolo tie to Senate votes that members of the tribe made and gifted to him, he was not always supportive of the tribe’s recognition, he said.
“I was, I think, the first member of the Senate in modern times that refused to co-sponsor the Lumbee recognition bill in my first Congress because … I’ve got to be convinced you’ve got a case before I’m willing to do it,” Tillis said. “I spent the time, I understood what they were going through — embarrassed that I didn’t really know that history well — and then committed to them.”

Vermont’s Education Secretary Zoie Saunders says the state is “really on the cusp of something very special,” as lawmakers gear up for what will be a critical legislative session in determining the future of public education reform.
In an interview with VTDigger, Saunders acknowledged the difficulties ahead. Act 73, a law passed this year, sets in motion generational change to how local education is governed and funded in Vermont.
A key part of that reform, however, depends on lawmakers agreeing on a plan to consolidate the state’s 119 school districts when the session begins in January. Without an agreed upon plan, the reform envisioned in Act 73 is uncertain.
Saunders urged lawmakers and residents of the state to “stay the course.”
“There’s no doubt that our lack of scale and our challenges with funding are creating obstacles for us to deliver on our statutory responsibility to our students of providing them a world class education,” she said.
This interview has been edited for length and clarity.

VTDigger: I’d like to start by just asking where we go from here. You and the governor both criticized the task force for failing to come up with a map that adheres to Act 73. Now we’re in this period of uncertainty without an agreed upon map. Is your office working on a map to put forward? 
Zoie Saunders: I think the characterization of being critical of the task force is really misapplied. The feedback was that the task force did not deliver on the charge, which was to put forward district maps. So, that does create additional work for the Legislature this session.
Act 73 always required the General Assembly to select the maps. The redistricting task force was created to provide an opportunity for the separate body to review and put forward recommendations, but that vote was always going to be the responsibility of the General Assembly. So, we’re moving into the legislative session without the Redistricting Task Force putting forward maps. That means the General Assembly will need to spend the time putting forward a map that they can vote on to move forward Act 73.
My role as the secretary of education is to provide input and subject matter expertise on the policy considerations. And ultimately, my role is implementing law established by the General Assembly. So, we have provided input all along the way, and really that input has built upon the educational priorities expressed by the General Assembly in law and has built upon the studies that the General Assembly has done.
VTD: How do you plan on being on the front foot come Jan. 6 when the legislative session starts? What role does the Agency of Education have in moving this forward?
ZS: I think it’s important to provide context to understand how Act 73 came into being, and the level of bipartisanship and data-driven decision making that has been part of this process all along the way.
So, if we recall, the General Assembly actually first commissioned a study to evaluate the need to move towards a more efficient system that would produce greater quality, and that was through the Picus and Odden study, using an evidence-based model. The leadership of the General Assembly asked the governor to bring forward a plan to help address the systemic issues in our education system and ensure that we could also bend the cost curve as we are delivering higher quality.
(The study) also evaluated the express priorities that have been codified into law over the last 15 years, but we have struggled to implement (them) well because of issues with scale and resourcing. Those included expanding access to pre-kindergarten, expanding access to career and technical education, providing wraparound support for students, ensuring that we could increase teacher pay, particularly in our rural and high-needs communities, where teachers are paid considerably less than their counterparts in more affluent parts of the state.
That resulted in Act 73, and the role that we played as an agency is the role that we continue to play. We are the subject matter experts in education matters statewide.
We consistently said throughout the process, you have to focus on funding, governance and quality together. That’s really what makes Act 73 different from any prior education reform efforts.
The singular focus on redistricting really belies the complexity and the intent of this law, which is saying we need to keep all those pieces together.
VTD: If lawmakers were to move forward with the task force’s proposal, does that present problems in implementing Act 73, given its emphasis on voluntary mergers?
ZS: The plan put forward by the task force does not represent anything new. Districts have always had the ability to voluntarily merge. Districts have always had the ability to share services.
In fact, the model that continues to be referenced for (Boards of Cooperative Educational Services) began prior to the BOCES law being established, because school boards within their current purview are able to establish shared resources and to enter into contracts collaboratively to deliver on the needs of their students.
So what’s put forward does not represent anything new, other than it provides some additional requirements to add another layer of complexity on top of the existing status quo. And what I mean by that is it’s adding another layer that they’re calling a cooperative education services area that would need to have additional staffing and another board, which creates an additional governance complexity, which is what we’re actually trying to avoid.
When we were contemplating the original proposal, we identified that larger districts are able to ensure that the dollars go further for students, that they can help to provide the specialized resources that are needed, and to realign funding in a way that is going to be in the best interest of student learning.
If you ask any superintendent or principal or educator in our state, they will share the challenges of providing educational quality because we don’t have scale. When we talk about moving towards statewide graduation requirements, which is part of Act 73, we are moving in that direction because we know that there is such great variability when it relates to educational rigor across our state. And that’s not to say we don’t have bright spots — there are great districts and schools and students that are achieving academically.
But what we’re talking about with Act 73 is that there is such tremendous variability and inconsistency, and because of that, we are not giving every student a fair shot to achieve academically and to pursue their passions and be ready for success after high school graduation.
So it’s really important that we think about scale in relation to delivering quality, to ensure that students gain access to those important inputs. I’m talking about access to academic courses, access to enrichment opportunities, access to after school clubs and sporting opportunities. It also means that they have access to a high quality teacher, and we know a part of that is dependent on teachers getting compensated at appropriate levels and getting the support that they need.
Scale is really critical when we talk about the ability to actually deliver on education quality objectives that are set forward within Act 73, and we’ve had a number of focus groups with students — what we hear students asking for is meaningful opportunities to deepen their learning.
It’s really profound that we’re hearing that pretty consistently from students across the state. 
VTD: Why does the foundation funding formula hinge on consolidation. Why can’t we apply that formula onto existing governance structures?
ZS: Our existing governance structures have great variability when we describe the number of students served, so that can be either from as small as 100 students to as large as 2,000 students. Each of those districts is required to deliver on some pretty onerous compliance requirements to operate a district and operate a school, and many of the expenses need to go to overseeing that.
And so when you think about the need for that level of administrative compliance, there’s great duplication across systems, and it also limits our smaller districts and having the resources to bring on content experts and reading coaches and curriculum experts who can really support with the design delivery and continuous improvement of teaching and learning.
There are opportunity costs that come with keeping our current system, and that results in short changing our smaller districts by not enabling them to take advantage of additional resources.
VTD: When you unveiled your first proposal last January, your estimate was that the state would save around $180 million annually. Is that still the current estimate, or are there updated estimates on the expected cost savings?
ZS: Ultimately, the final cost of the foundation formula will depend on decisions that the General Assembly makes.
Act 73 calls for a larger study to finalize the base and the weight amount included in (the foundation formula), so some of those decisions continue to be outstanding. But what is really clear, and what we see consistently in other states that implement a foundation formula, is it creates a way for us to be really transparent around how we fund education.
It is predictable year over year, and it comes with policy choices. There is cost modeling based on the funding put forward in Act 73 that shows considerable savings year over year compared to our existing trajectory.
So, yes, there has been cost modeling at every iteration of the foundation formula that’s been contemplated that proves a cost savings for taxpayers. As the formula is finalized in the Legislature, there will be more details around how that translates into budgeting. We have already, as an agency, built sample budgets to show how those dollars can be applied and represent a very generous amount when compared to other states.
VTD: I’ve heard a lot of fears that consolidation could be really disruptive to educators’ lives. Is there a potential for consolidation to result in job losses at school districts? What sort of impact could we see?
ZS: I think the fears that you’re describing are fears that community members have now within our current system. Despite the increase in cost and the increase to property taxes, districts across Vermont are having to cut staff. They’re having to cut programs, and that’s being done in a haphazardness way, and is not resulting in ensuring more equitable opportunities for students.
As we talk about the next phase of planning — you mentioned disruption — there’s a tremendous amount of disruption currently in our system because of the fact that it’s quite unpredictable, and there are system challenges that our superintendents and our school boards cannot overcome because of the way that we’re organized and structured.
Moving into larger districts, moving towards a foundation formula, is important to ensuring that we can actually deliver on those education quality objectives. There does need to be a process in place to ensure that that transition does not result in the disruption that you’re describing.
VTD: Vermont consistently ranks as one of the highest spending states on public education. Why?
ZS: I think our lack of scale does contribute to the cost. We also have a very unique funding formula, and that results in tremendous variability in per pupil spending across our state. That gap in per pupil spending is as wide as being as low as $9,000 per student to as high as $18,000 per student, so there’s tremendous variability.
The way that our funding system is structured, it is designed to promote taxpayer equity. However, in practice, what we’re seeing is that our highest need communities and lower income communities tend to spend less per pupil than our more affluent communities.
So, even communities that are making budgeting decisions to cut their budgets or hold their budgets steady, those community members could still see an increase in their property taxes because of decisions that are made in other communities across the state of Vermont. So it creates a lot of instability. 
When you think about specific cost and how lack of scale contributes to cost, that comes in the form of challenges with recruiting teachers and sometimes having to contract for services that might cost three times the amount that it would (cost) to actually hire a qualified educator to deliver special education services, for example.
We talk to a lot of districts that are larger and are able to better create a continuum of support for their students, because they can pool their resources in ways to be more targeted with how they help to deliver special education services, for example. So our lack of scale contributes to higher cost, but that doesn’t translate necessarily into higher quality opportunities.
VTD: You’ve taken on a difficult task in going against this idea of local control. Vermont has a very unique culture in that regard. Has that been difficult to navigate for you? Has that made for tough conversations?
ZS: We must acknowledge that we are contemplating a large-scale change in Vermont, and any time a state is endeavoring to do this level of transformation, there should be tough conversations. We should be engaged in debate. We should be in dialogue. Vermonters do have many questions. Educators have questions, and it’s important that we’re noting those questions, that we’re responding to them and continuing to have that dialogue.
I understood that I would need to facilitate many challenging conversations, and when you enter difficult conversations, it’s important to always assume positive intent, to also focus on the facts and to identify and name where there’s agreement, and sometimes name where there’s disagreement, so that gives us a path forward to continue the conversation and move in a way that will be productive for the state.
While there’s been a lot of hard conversations, what I have found in my engagement in Vermont is that there is a shared sense of responsibility and a shared focus on doing whatever is right for kids and for our students.
VTD: What is your inspiration here? What or who do you look toward? Is there a model of public education or a model of public education reform that you look to? Or is there a leader or expert in education you’ve taken your cues from?
ZS: It’s an interesting question. Everybody who goes through their education training learns about John Dewey. He’s really the grandfather of public education and is from Vermont. I always think about education being a debt due to future generations, and that’s part of the service of being an educator, and certainly being in this role as a secretary of education is really ensuring that we’re making the right decisions to support and prepare the next generation.
I think when states often face a financial crisis, or they face, you know, a challenge with their education and performance, they pretty consistently diverted dollars away from public education, and we’re taking the opposite approach in Vermont. We are doubling down on public education as the great equalizer.
VTD: There are a lot of feelings right now in public education, from general uncertainty, to fear, to a sense of optimism. How are you feeling about the future of this effort to reform public education? And what would your message be to those in public education who are feeling that uncertainty or fear?
ZS: My role as secretary of education is to ensure that every child has access to a substantially equal education. And leading the Agency of Education, I am committed to that mission every single day, which is why you see that we have made some really meaningful changes in how we are prioritizing our work at the agency and how we are organizing our teams.
We know that some of the barriers to our success are some of the systemic challenges that we face, including lack of scale, variability of funding, the inability of certain districts to offer the array of programming that we expect in our education quality standards. So, while it’s challenging to move forward with Act 73, because it represents a significant amount of change, and change can be hard, it is really of paramount importance that we stay the course. That’s going to help us ensure that we can meet our statutory obligation to all students.
I would encourage Vermonters to stay engaged, to stay engaged in the dialogue, to stay focused on the opportunities ahead of what we can do for our students, because I think we’re really on the cusp of something very special in the state of Vermont.
I think we’re in a unique position because of our size, because of the community connections. We can be more agile than other states, we can be more responsive to the needs of our students and the needs of our community, and we’ve outlined a plan forward to achieve that. 
And while change is hard, there’s also a lot in this work that’s very inspiring and motivating, because it’s going to set us up to ensure that every single student in our state can take advantage of an excellent education that prepares them to be successful after high school. And that’s where we’re headed.

(Paul Morigi/Getty Images for Fortune/Time Inc)OMAHA — On Jan. 1, Warren Buffett starts his second retirement.
The first was in 1956, when he returned to Omaha from a year and a half in New York City working for his investment mentor, Benjamin Graham. Buffett planned to quietly earn his fortune using Graham’s investment lessons and his own nerdy ability to spot “cigar butt” companies that had more value than anyone else realized, yielding a few guaranteed “puffs” of profit.
Back then, Warren’s family members and a few friends had other ideas: If you’re doing so well with your own money, how about doing the same with ours?
Investing for friends
His brief retirement ended. He formed some small investment partnerships, a modest start to an unprecedented career of capitalistic success that created a trillion-dollar company named after a defunct textile company whose specialty was making silky linings for men’s suits. No matter that men now rarely wear suits or care about linings.

Nearly 70 years later, Berkshire Hathaway attracts millions of investors, turning thousands of them into millionaires, and brings thousands of them to Buffett’s hometown of Omaha each spring in what is, for other companies, the most mundane of group events: a corporate annual shareholders meeting.
“Looking back I feel that both Berkshire and I did better because of our base in Omaha than if I had resided anywhere else,” Buffett wrote in his letter this fall to shareholders.
It’s not something in the water, as he often speculates lightheartedly. But it’s hard to argue that his story, unmatched in free enterprise history, would have taken the same course elsewhere.
How did it happen?
The early partnerships seemed so odd that mainline financial advisors warned clients away. Buffett bought and sold stocks without telling his investors what he was doing, because he didn’t want others copying his money moves. He simply told his partners at the end of the year what their money had earned.
Most people with money to invest shunned him. No blue-chip stocks? Secret investments? No dividends? Bah!
But some who met him in person believed his investment philosophy and gave him their money to manage, trusting his honesty despite his secret ways. Those who kept their money with Buffett to this day are, as the phrase goes, “comfortable.”
Reporter Robert Dorr wrote the first local story in 1966 about Buffett’s investment success finding those bargain investments, headlined “Investor at 11, Warren Buffett controls $45 million fund at 35.”
Changing approach
Buffett’s investing philosophy changed when he met and spent hours talking with fellow Omahan Charlie Munger, who had moved to California. Through those discussions, Buffett and Munger developed a practice of investing in great companies at reasonable prices, with the idea of big profits over the long term. Buffett had ended his partnerships after running out of “cigar butts,” and many of his investors followed him into Berkshire, his new investment “vehicle.”
Another major turn came when Buffett bought an insurance company, National Indemnity, from Omahan Jack Ringwalt in 1967. Insurance became Buffett’s biggest single business, unleashing a river of cash to invest in a wide range of businesses, from chocolates to electricity to railroads to windmills to couches.

To learn about reinsurance — the business of taking on risks from other insurers — Buffett read Omaha University library books on the subject, a place now known as the University of Nebraska at Omaha. Those library books are still there, but the checkout cards marked with “Warren Buffett” and the dates have long since been replaced by barcodes. He also hired a reinsurance expert, George Young of St. Louis.
When Berkshire’s stock became publicly traded, Buffett had new rules to follow. If he made a big investment in a company, he had to tell everybody. Same thing if he sold shares. His annual report included details about Berkshire’s holdings, which now included some entire businesses.
The mainline investment public took notice, and Berkshire’s shares, previously traded privately here and there, moved to the New York Stock Exchange. News coverage helped prompt thousands of investors, including large index funds, to buy Berkshire shares.
Known beyond investing
The noninvesting public learned about him, too. World’s richest man. Ethical businessman stepping in to solve the Salomon Brothers scandal. Philanthropist who gave away his money rather than setting up a family dynasty. Folksy philosopher who once advised, “Invest in yourself.”
The first Berkshire meeting in Omaha was in the employee lunchroom at National Indemnity. After moving to bigger and bigger venues, the meeting ended up in the city’s largest sports arena.
As the meetings grew, Buffett added a separate in-person session for hundreds of foreign shareholders, because they had traveled so far, answering questions mostly about how he viewed their countries as investment locations. He held annual press conferences for the dozens of reporters who came but forbade cameras until the cell phone took over.
The meeting’s exhibition hall sideshow sold chocolate bars, work gloves, auto insurance, mattresses, plastic ducks, campers, books and other company products. All in Omaha.
In the recent letter, Buffett named the fellow Omahans who helped him along the way. Besides Ringwalt and Munger, who died in 2023 just short of 100 years old, he listed wives Susan Thompson Buffett and Astrid Menks and business friends Stan Lipsey, Walter Scott Jr., Don Keough and the Blumkin family. He praised Omaha’s public school system, attended by his children and many of his grandchildren.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Retirement talk
At the May 2025 meeting, Buffett announced his retirement as CEO and named Vice Chairman Greg Abel to succeed him. He’ll remain as chairman and available for advice but won’t be on the stage at the 2026 annual meeting, May 2.
Shareholders can be assured Buffett still cares about them. After all, his investments have created shares with a market value of $1.08 trillion. These days, Berkshire owns $270 billion worth of stock, lots of it in blue chips. To name just a few of the ABCs, there’s Amazon, American Express, Apple, Atlanta Braves, Bank of America, Capital One, Charter Communications, Chevron, Chubb and Coca-Cola.
Over the past 64 years, Berkshire has accumulated 64 businesses. A few of the better-known: Burlington Northern Railroad, GEICO, Fruit of the Loom, MidAmerican Energy, NetJets, Pampered Chef, Nebraska Furniture Mart, Helzberg Diamonds, Borsheim’s, Johns Manville, Duracell, Brooks Sports and Dairy Queen. He lists them in broad categories: insurance and reinsurance, utilities and energy, freight rail transportation, manufacturing, services and retailing.
Not to mention accumulating $380 billion in cash, currently available for investing or purchasing.
Lasting work
Buffett also built a corporate structure that he believes will be a lasting model for Greg Abel and Berkshire’s board of directors. That is, a big insurance arm with steady flows of cash for more investments and purchases.
And there’s this: Through family foundations and the Gates Foundation, Buffett has given away Berkshire shares that today are worth $224 billion. He still has about $150 billion left.

At 95, Buffett wrote that he is finally feeling the effects of age, citing declining balance, hearing, vision and memory, as well as general energy. Years ago, he had charged his three children with telling him if he was losing his “marbles.” But he made the decision himself. Difficulty seeing, especially, is hard to bear when your primary waking activity has been reading.
Buffett wrote that he feels generally good, comes to the office five days a week and works with wonderful people. Take it from a fellow retiree: He’ll find out that whatever course his retirement takes, it’ll be different from his usual job.
His final words to shareholders:
“Remember to thank America for maximizing your opportunities. But it is – inevitably – capricious and sometimes venal in distributing its rewards.
“Choose your heroes very carefully and then emulate them. You will never be perfect, but you can always be better.”

(Photo by Isiah Holmes/Wisconsin Examiner)According to the Eastern District of Wisconsin’s Interim U.S. Attorney Brad Schimel, freshly appointed to his position by President Donald Trump, the federal trial of Milwaukee Judge Hannah Dugan had nothing to do with politics. “There’s not a political aspect to it,” Schimel told reporters after Dugan’s felony conviction on charges she obstructed U.S. immigration agents as they tried to make an arrest inside the Milwaukee courthouse. “We weren’t trying to make an example out of anyone,” Schimel said. “This was necessary to hold Judge Dugan accountable because of the actions she took.”
Schimel didn’t say whether Dugan’s very public arrest and perp walk through the courthouse was also necessary, along with the social media posts by Trump’s FBI director Kash Patel and Attorney General Pam Bondi, crowing about the arrest and sharing photos of Dugan in handcuffs. 
There is no doubt that the Dugan case was highly political from the start. 
As a coalition of democracy and civic organizations in Wisconsin declared in a statement after the verdict, Dugan’s prosecution threatens the integrity of our justice system and “sends a troubling message about the consequences faced by judges who act to protect due process in their courtrooms.”
But Schimel is right about one thing: Dugan’s trial this week was mainly about “a single day — a single bad day — in a public courthouse.”
That narrow focus helped the prosecution win a conviction in a confusing mixed verdict. The jury found Dugan not guilty of a misdemeanor offense for concealing Eduardo Flores-Ruiz, the defendant she led out a side door while immigration agents waited near the main door of her courtroom to arrest him. At the same time, the jury found Dugan guilty of the more serious charge of obstructing the agents in their effort to make the arrest. The two charges are based on some of the same elements, and Dugan’s defense attorneys are now asking that her conviction be overturned on that basis.
An observer watching the trial from afar with no inside knowledge of the defense strategy might wonder why Dugan’s defense team didn’t enter a guilty plea on the misdemeanor charge and then strongly contest the felony obstruction charge as an outrageous overreach in a heavily politicized prosecution. That might have led to a more favorable mixed verdict, in which the jury found that Dugan was probably guilty of something, but that it did not rise to the level of a felony with a potential penalty of five years in prison.
I’m no expert, but daily reports from the trial this week gave me the strong impression that things weren’t going well for Dugan as long as witnesses and lawyers focused on a blow-by-blow account of the events of April 18. Witness testimony described an agitated Dugan, whose colleague, Judge Kristela Cervera, testified — damagingly —  that she was uncomfortable with how Dugan managed the federal agents she was outraged to find hanging around outside her courtroom. 
It’s not surprising that the jury agreed with the prosecution that Dugan was not cooperative and that she wanted to get Flores-Ruiz out of her courtroom in a way that made an end-run around the unprecedented meddling of federal immigration enforcement inside the courthouse. Like other judges and courthouse staff, she was upset about the disruption caused by ICE agents stalking people who showed up to court.
But, as Dean Strang, a law professor at Loyola University Chicago School of Law and a long-time Wisconsin criminal defense lawyer, told me in April just before he joined the defense team and stopped talking about the case to the press, “Whatever you think of the actual conduct the complaint alleges, there is a real question about whether there’s even arguably any federal crime here.” 
The government’s behavior was “extraordinarily atypical” for a nonviolent, non-drug charge involving someone who is not a flight risk, Strang added.
The handcuffs, the public arrest at Dugan’s workplace, the media circus — none of it was normal, or justified. When Bondi and Patel began posting pictures of Dugan in handcuffs on social media to brag about it, “what is it they are trying to do?” Strang asked. His conclusion: “Humiliate and terrify, not just her but every other judge in the country.”
The Wisconsin Democracy Campaign, Voces de la Frontera, and Common Cause-Wisconsin agree with that assessment, writing in their statement reacting to the conviction that Dugan’s felony conviction threatens the integrity of our justice system as a whole, and undermines the functioning of the courts by scaring away defendants, witnesses and plaintiffs who are afraid they might be arrested if they show up to participate in legal proceedings.
But that big picture perspective was not a major feature of the defense’s closing arguments, which relied heavily on raising reasonable doubt about Dugan’s intentions and her actions during a stressful and chaotic day.
That’s frustrating because, contrary to Schimel’s assertions, the big picture, not the events of “a single bad day” is what was actually at stake in this case.
One of the most distressing aspects of the Dugan trial was the prosecution’s through-the-looking-glass invocation of the rule of law and the integrity of the courts.
The federal agents called to the stand, the prosecutors in the courtroom, and Schimel, in his summary of the case, made a big point about the “safety” of law enforcement officers. 
Repeatedly, we heard that immigration agents prefer to make arrests inside courthouses because they provide a “safe” environment in which to operate. 
In his comments on the verdict, Schimel emphasized that Dugan jeopardized the safety of federal officers by causing them to arrest Flores-Ruiz on the street instead of inside the courthouse: “The defendant’s actions provided an opportunity for a wanted subject to flee outside of that secure courthouse environment,” Schimel said.
This upside-down view of safety has become a regular MAGA talking point, with Republicans claiming that when citizens demand that masked agents identify themselves or make videos of ICE dragging people out of their cars, they are jeopardizing the safety of law enforcement officers — as opposed to trying to protect their neighbors’ safety in the face of violent attacks by anonymous thugs. 
Churches, day care centers and peaceful suburban neighborhoods are also “safe” environments for armed, masked federal agents. But their activities there are making our communities less safe. 
Assistant U.S. Attorney Kelly Brown Watzka, delivering the prosecution’s closing argument, told the jury it must draw a line against judges interfering with law enforcement, or else “there is only chaos,” and that “chaos is what the rule of law is intended to prevent.”
But chaos is what we have now, with federal agents terrorizing communities, dragging people out of courthouses and private residences, deporting them without due process and punishing those who stand in their way in an attempt to defend civil society.
The real question raised by Dugan’s case is whether we believe the “safety” of the agents making those dubious arrests matters more than the safety of our communities, and whether we want the courts to be able to exercise any check on their exercise of raw power.

Brad Little gives his annual State of the State address on Jan. 6, 2025, on the House floor at the Statehouse in Boise. (Pat Sutphin for the Idaho Capital Sun)We are starting to see the human cost created by fiscal mismanagement by our state political leaders. And, unfortunately, based on reports from the governor’s budget office it looks like only the beginning of this self-inflicted wound on our great state.
On Wednesday, Superintendent of Public Instruction Debbie Critchfield announced that she is backing off her top legislative priority — asking next year’s Legislature to increase funding for Idaho’s 33,000 special education students by $50 million. This is a program that serves our state’s most vulnerable students. 
The Legislature’s own Office of Performance Evaluations reported earlier this year that an $82 million gap exists in the program, not including charter schools which would push the shortage to $100 million.
In September, Critchfield’s chief of staff, Greg Wilson, told the media, “This is the one area that deserves the Legislature’s attention, the governor’s attention.” 
Idaho may need to find $600 million to $1 billion for next year’s state budget

Now it won’t get any attention. Why? Because the Legislature and Gov. Little have created a fiscal crisis that could soar to between $600 million and $1 billion next year, according to Lori Wolff, head of the governor’s Division of Financial Management. 
After Critchfield announced the decision to walk back the request for special ed funding, she wrote superintendents saying she would tap existing funds to do something as a “bridge” until “state revenue can support a sustainable solution.”
But the problem is she can build a “bridge” this year, but it won’t lead to anywhere because the Legislature and governor have erased their revenue base so much it may take years for the state to recover and if we have real recession we will be deeper into a hole.   
It’s not just K-12 public school students who are feeling the pinch. On Dec. 1, the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare eliminated funding for the state’s Assertive Community Treatment program because of the deficit. The program serves hundreds of Idahoans with the most serious mental health issues. For these Idahoans, it is the “treatment regime of last resort” and prevents them from long-term hospitalization.
The reason for cutting the funding: The budget crisis facing the state.
Now four families have filed a lawsuit in federal court to force the state to restore the funding. The families are getting support from Idaho law enforcement. In a letter to the governor and Legislature, the Idaho Sheriffs’ Association said, “We know from the history of the mental health system in Idaho (that) when these services are reduced or eliminated, we see an increase in crisis events, emergency room utilization and incarceration in county jails.” 
Gov. Little has already ordered a 3 percent cut in state budgets to cover an expected deficit in this year’s budget. Besides the cut to this critically needed mental health program, the 3 percent holdback has reduced funding for post-secondary education by $13 million at the time we need more skilled and educated workers in our state.
So far, Gov. Little has not imposed budget cuts on K-12 education, but given the gargantuan projected budget deficit we face next fiscal year, it may be only a matter of time before our elementary and secondary students face reduced support too. That comes at a time when Idaho still has the lowest per pupil expenditure in the country.
Idaho has had to reduce budgets before because of economic downturns like the Great Recession of 2008. This made sense because the whole nation had gone through one of the most challenging economic crises in history.
But the fiscal crisis our state now faces is self-inflicted by the $4 billion in lost revenue the governor and Legislature have given away over the past five years, including $453 million in tax cuts last winter.
New report shows 5 years of Idaho income tax cuts have reduced state revenue by $4 billion

This year’s reduction in the state’s revenue base included a constitutionally questionable $50 million voucher tax credit so students can attend private and religious schools. By creating this tax credit, the governor and Legislature created a new taxpayer-supported school system at a time when they are not even meeting the constitutional mandate to fund a uniform and thorough public-education system for our more than 300,000 Idaho kids.
State leaders like Gov. Little, Superintendent Critchfield and legislative leaders are treating this budget crisis like any other economic downturn which has required budget cuts. They wring hands and say the only solution is cutting money for education and mental health services and not fully funding K-12 education.
But this is not the typical budget crisis caused by a national economic downturn. This crisis is caused by decisions the Legislature and the governor have intentionally made. Decisions that are not fiscally responsible and are quite different from the good, old-fashioned conservative values of previous legislatures and governors like Phil Batt. 
The governor and Legislature dug us into this hole. They have the power — and responsibility — to dig us out of it by reversing some of the financial decisions they made last session and doing no more harm like complying with the big, beautiful federal tax bill. A good start would be repealing the $50 million subsidy they are giving to private and religious schools.
That decision alone would help close the funding gap for our special education kids who could use the money. It is a small step, yet an important one toward fully supporting the programs that our people, students, and business community depend on for a healthy and prosperous state. And a step toward more fiscally responsible management.

But the accuracy of the list that tracks defendants eligible for court-appointed attorneys has come under scrutiny as the commission overseeing Maine’s public defense system works to shrink caseloads and improve efficiency for both courts and defense lawyers.
“We’re at the point of the list where it’s small enough that the accuracy of that list has become more critically important,” Freyla Tarpinian, the new executive director for the Maine Commission for Public Defense Services, said during a monthly commission meeting on Wednesday.
There are still about 300 people waiting for representation — roughly the same number as this summer. The number of adult criminal defendants waiting for state-appointed counsel exceeded 1,000 last December. It fell to 487 in April and continued to decline as a combination of public defenders and private attorneys were able to take cases off the list. 
“Three hundred is not an insurmountable number, but if that number is not accurate — and we don’t know from day to day who is on that list, who should be on that list, and who needs to be off that list —it’s causing more of a problem,” Tarpinian said.
Clerical errors have made it unclear which defendants actually need lawyers, they said. Attorneys attempting to accept new cases have sometimes discovered that those cases were already assigned, leading to wasted hours of work. In other instances, people entitled to a lawyer were accidentally omitted from the list, jeopardizing their constitutionally guaranteed right to representation.
Taylor Kilgore, who sits on the commission, told Tarpinian that the list has had issues with inaccuracy since at least the beginning of the year. 
But Tarpinian and several defense attorneys at the meeting said that because the list is manually generated with input from several courts, human error is expected. 
“There doesn’t seem to have been a solution at this point,” Tarpinian said. “I’m worried about it.”
Robert Ruffner, a defense attorney and director of the Maine Indigent Defense Center, said the list “isn’t as accurate as it should be” because the courts do not have enough staff.
Since a Maine Superior Court found the state guilty of violating defendants’ Sixth Amendment right to counsel last year, the state has worked to reduce the number of people waiting for attorneys by expanding the public defense system and contracting with private defense attorneys. However, the commission faces a $13 million budget shortfall and will not be able to pay their rostered attorneys, who take up a bulk of indigent defense cases, past April unless the Maine Legislature approves additional funding.",https://mainemorningstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/GettyImages-1483489085-700x467-1.jpg,,,2025-12-20 05:58:09.860923

(Photo by Clay Wirestone/Kansas Reflector)The glass of beer sits before me. Amber and the slightest bit cloudy, it rests underneath a modest cap of foam.
I mull over this glass because I’m not a beer enthusiast. It’s probably fair to say that my taste in alcohol runs toward the fruity seltzer. (Make all the gay jokes you want, I’ve probably made them myself.) But I’m a big believer in that chilled glass of beer, served at a restaurant or bar. It’s doesn’t beg to be chugged. It’s not a shot of forbidding fluid in a tiny glass. It’s no mixed drink that will turn you tipsy almost instantaneously.

Little things
Small essays on simple subjects.

No that glass of beer is a drink to nurse, meant to while away the hours as you converse with a friend, browse a book or scroll through your phone.
By the sip, a glass of beer refreshes. After a fuller swallow, it fans out into a complex mixture of bitter citrus flavors. I’m writing about India pale ale style brews here, in case you couldn’t tell, because I’m a bearded man of a certain age.
Some evenings, I can spend nearly two hours working my way through a single glass, glancing up every now and then and enjoying a pleasant surprise when I see how much of the liquid remains. I’ll just have another sip, I think to myself. Then I take a phone call or send an email and the delicious cycle begins again.
I seldom have more than one beer. That’s probably because I find that heady mix of flavors a little much for multiple drinks. After two or three frosty glasses, I feel as though I’ve had an unpleasant run in with some sourdough.
But the single glass of beer, that works on its own. It’s a unit of time and memory and gastronomy.
When shared with friends, beer transcends my personal preferences. Sourdough be damned, we’ll have more than one. The beer serves as a conversation marker. You have the first glass when you’re all settling in and talking about what’s been happening in your lives. When the conversation grows more serious or intellectual, you order a second drink. You might consider a third when you move into the second hour of conversation, this being the drink that finally tips you over from relaxation to perhaps revealing an unguarded opinion or anecdote.
When it comes to a fourth beer or beyond, I must respectfully draw the curtain closed and allow readers to imagine for themselves.
Here in Lawrence, Free State Brewing Co. makes some exceptional indie beers. Free State was also Kansas’ first legal brewery in more than a century when it opened in 1989.
My favorite of their offerings depends on time of year. In summer, they produce a basil-laced lager known as Garden Party. For most other months, I drink their decidedly hoppy Yakimaniac.
Beyond those favorites, I don’t discriminate among craft beers. I find big national brands too watery for my taste, but good luck to those of you who enjoy them. While interning at the Philadelphia Inquirer I was introduced to the Pennsylvania-based Yuengling lager, so I enjoyed seeing the brand arrive in Kansas a couple of years ago.
Please drink responsibly this holiday season. I don’t want these modest words to move anyone toward bad decisions. Remember, you can always have a diet soda.
But perhaps that’s a column for another time.

(Courtesy of Cassie Mallette/University of Nebraska at Omaha)The sex trafficking industry is one of the most serious and fast-growing challenges facing Nebraska’s law enforcement officers.
Once thought to be an issue limited to major metropolitan areas, trafficking now reaches deep into Nebraska communities — from Lincoln and Omaha to our rural counties and small towns along the I-80 and I-29 corridors.
As the founder and director of Innocence Freed, a Nebraska nonprofit dedicated to supporting female victims of sex trafficking, I’ve seen firsthand how this unthinkable crime devastates survivors, their families, and the fabric of our local communities.
Traffickers are constantly adapting, using technology to recruit, groom and exploit victims in increasingly sophisticated ways. But for the first time in decades, we are witnessing a shift. Artificial intelligence (AI) is giving Nebraska law enforcement and victim-service organizations a powerful new set of tools to stay a step ahead of traffickers — and we should embrace that progress, not shy away from it.
One example already making an impact is the use of AI-driven facial recognition to help identify missing Nebraskans who may be featured in online ads or exploitation networks. When used responsibly, this technology allows investigators to match images with missing-person databases far more quickly than any manual process, helping speed up recoveries and focusing limited resources where they’re needed most. In a state where many local agencies are stretched thin, these time savings can directly translate into lives saved.
AI is also proving invaluable in tracing the financial trails left by trafficking operations, many of which run through Nebraska due to our central location and major transportation routes. Trafficking networks frequently rely on subtle payment patterns to hide their activities. AI systems can detect anomalies and suspicious transactions that even seasoned investigators might miss. This type of data analysis can give Nebraska law enforcement a clearer view of how networks operate, who is funding them, and how they move money — ultimately leading to stronger prosecutions and more dismantled trafficking rings.
The promise of AI in this fight is real: faster investigations, more victims identified and more traffickers brought to justice. To be clear — AI will never replace the compassion and determination of Nebraska’s law enforcement officers, social workers, advocates and community partners. But it can be one of the most transformative tools we give them.
That’s why it’s critical that Nebraska and the federal government pursue policies that support — not hinder — the responsible use of AI in law enforcement. Poorly written regulations could slow deployment, add unnecessary costs or limit access to lifesaving tools for agencies that already operate on tight budgets. Instead, we should focus on smart, balanced policies that protect privacy while ensuring AI remains accessible to those fighting on the front lines across our state.
As Nebraska continues to confront the evolving threat of sex trafficking, we have a responsibility to use every tool available to protect survivors and stop the people who exploit them. By strengthening collaboration between Nebraska’s innovators, law enforcement agencies and advocacy organizations, we can build a more effective and compassionate response to this crisis.
Sex trafficking is fast-moving and adaptive. Nebraska must be just as fast — and even more determined. With the help of AI, we can turn the tide against traffickers and offer more hope, healing and freedom to the women and children who deserve nothing less.

(Photo by Tasos Katopodis/Getty Images)President Donald Trump launched the opening salvo in North Carolina’s midterm elections Friday night at a speech in Rocky Mount, blasting Democratic Senate candidate Roy Cooper as “radical left” and praising Republican Michael Whatley.
Speaking for more than an hour to a crowd of several hundred in Rocky Mount, Trump called Cooper a “disaster.” He condemned the former governor as weak on crime and blamed him for the painstaking recovery process in Western North Carolina following Hurricane Helene.
“People were sitting in the mud, but I helped rebuild your state, and I didn’t get any help from the Democrats,” Trump said. “Not your governor, not your man who’s running for Senate against Michael Whatley — who’s phenomenal.”
The president invoked the death of Iryna Zarutska, a Ukrainian refugee in Charlotte who was fatally stabbed on the city’s Blue Line transit system this summer — blaming Cooper for policies that led to her assailant’s release. He also attacked Democrats over a subsequent stabbing on the same transit line earlier this month.
“He’s radical left, you don’t want him. He doesn’t represent you. Look at the crime — look at what’s going on with all the crime here,” Trump said. “You gotta get Michael Whatley. It’s gonna be so important, he was so great.”
In a statement after the rally, Jordan Monaghan, a spokesperson for the Cooper campaign, pointed to Cooper’s track record as the state’s attorney general as evidence of his public safety credentials.
“Roy Cooper is the only candidate who spent his career prosecuting violent criminals and keeping thousands of them behind bars as attorney general, and signing tough on crime laws and stricter pretrial release bail policy as governor,” Monaghan said.
The president focused heavily on the economy in his remarks, taking credit for its successes and laying blame for its failures on former President Joe Biden. He said since his inauguration, North Carolina has added 53,000 jobs, including 8,000 in construction. (Gov. Josh Stein said earlier this month that 33,000 jobs had been created in the state since January.)
Trump also declared the first year of his second term “the most successful year of any president in history,” pointing to recent successes negotiating lower drug prices, working to abate inflation, and growing jobs numbers to make the case that voters should elect a Republican majority in Congress once again in 2026.
According to government data released Thursday, inflation lowered from 3% in September to 2.7% in November, but economists told CNN that the drop was “likely the result of shutdown-related distortions of economic data.” Similarly the delayed jobs report this month, showed unemployment at 4.6%, the highest since September 2021. 
“They’re the ones, of course, that caused the highest inflation in the history of our country, which led to the highest prices in the history of our country,” Trump said. “I inherited the mess.”
He later joked about media fact-checking of that statement, which he also made during a White House speech on Wednesday, telling the crowd he shouldn’t say in the history of the country — “It’s not the worst in history, it’s the worst in 48 years.” In fact, inflation under Biden reached a 40-year high, and prices have continued to rise under Trump.
At various other points in the long and winding speech, Trump attacked Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) and Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.), lamented the decline of North Carolina’s furniture industry, praised the passage of federal recognition for the Lumbee Tribe, and touted his $1,776 “freedom dividend” for members of the armed forces.

Besides Trump, Whatley gave the longest speech of the night, laying into Cooper ahead of their anticipated 2026 midterm matchup.
“This is a man who over the course of his career has fought harder for criminals than he did victims,” Whatley said, criticizing Cooper for cashless bail and pretrial release policies. “We don’t need to reimagine law enforcement. We need to back the blue, and we need to enforce the law.”
“We need you one more time,” Whatley said. “Because if the Democrats win the House, if the Democrats win the Senate, we are going to go right back to investigations and hoaxes and impeachments.”
Cooper, Whatley said, would provide a vote against Trump “every single time” if elected. “I’m gonna cast a vote for the America First agenda. I’m gonna cast a vote for you.”
But first, Whatley would have to win the crowded Republican primary. He faces Michele Morrow, who was the Republican nominee for NC Superintendent of Public Instruction in 2024, as well as Don Brown, an author and ally of former Trump National Security Adviser Michael Flynn.
Vouching for Whatley, Trump pointed to his performance running the president’s three campaigns in the state, as North Carolina campaign chair in 2016, state GOP chair in 2020, and Republican National Committee chair in 2024. “We won the state all three times, and it was like a rock.”
Trump also took aim at Rep. Don Davis (D-N.C.), a top GOP target in 2026 after his district was redrawn to favor Republicans by 10 points, telling voters he “betrayed North Carolina” by supporting Biden’s policies.
“Don Davis voted against no tax on overtime. He voted against no tax on tips, and he voted for the largest tax increase in American history,” he said. “I’m good at politics — I’ve never even heard of this guy, so he hasn’t made a big impact.”
A spokesperson for Davis did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Trump, however, did not endorse any of the Republicans vying for the nomination to face Davis, though several contenders, including Laurie Buckhout, state Sen. Bobby Hanig, and Carteret County Sheriff Asa Buck were in attendance. 
He shouted out Buckhout as being “unbelievable” since joining his administration to assist the Department of Defense with cyber policy.
Supporters of the president who attended Friday’s rally voiced skepticism about Cooper, though said they knew little about Whatley beyond Trump’s support for him.
“I don’t really know a lot about him other than I probably will vote for him,” said Chuck Herring, a voter from Wilson. He added that he would not be surprised if Cooper won the race because of his popularity as governor.

Wayne Lucas, a Trump supporter from Nash County, knows Cooper better than most others at the rally Friday — he and the former governor were a year apart at Northern Nash High School and even faced him in Little League baseball growing up.
“He was like a chest up taller than any other player,” Lucas said with a laugh. “He looked so [much] older that the coach had to keep his birth certificate with him.”

‘This is only going to hurt Americans.’ Scientists, California state officials say the Trump administration’s plans to dismantle a key climate science hub will put public safety at risk. 


California officials and researchers across the country are sounding the alarm about the Trump administration’s plans to dismember a global hub for weather, wildfire and climate science: the Colorado-based National Center for Atmospheric Research.  
Russell Vought, President Donald Trump’s director of the Office of Management and Budget, posted Tuesday on the social media platform X that the National Science Foundation will be “breaking up” the science institution, which he called “one of the largest sources of climate alarmism in the country.”
The move comes as Trump clashes with Colorado Governor Jared Polis. But scientists warn that dismantling the federally-funded science center will endanger Americans even beyond the hundreds whose jobs are now at risk in Colorado.
“I’m alarmed. I’m worried. I’m upset. And I think we need to connect the dots between attacks on science and what it means to the safety of Americans,” California’s Natural Resources Secretary Wade Crowfoot told CalMatters. 
Vought said in his social media post that “any vital activities such as weather research will be moved to another entity or location.”
But the research fields aren’t easily disentangled, and experts say weather science can’t withstand the cuts to critical climate research. In California, weather extremes highlight the high stakes as an atmospheric river storm looms and the one-year anniversary of Los Angeles’ climate-fueled catastrophic wildfires approaches.
State climatologist Michael Anderson said that the National Center for Atmospheric Research has worked with California agencies in the past on projects to improve precipitation predictions and snowpack modeling. 
Losing the science center, he said, “will set the nation back in being able to respond to extreme weather events.”
The research institution, often referred to as NCAR, is managed by a nonprofit consortium of 120 colleges and universities. It shares tools including aircraft and supercomputers, as well as expertise and research vital to understanding and predicting wildfire behavior, smoke exposure, storms, floods and drought — with implications for public safety, agriculture and more.
“Gutting NCAR is putting American lives and property at higher risk of fire, because we’re not going to have the information that we need in order to really understand it and address how fires are increasing in a warming world,” said Jennifer Balch, a preeminent fire scientist at the University of Colorado Boulder, whose own work has investigated California and other Western states’ increasingly devastating wildfires. 
Balch spoke as high fire-risk weather in December forced a power shutoff to her Colorado neighborhood, leaving her family to cook their breakfast on the grill. 
“Undercutting our science community like this is only going to hurt Americans,” Balch said.

Craig Clements, chair of the Department of Meteorology and Climate Science at San José State University, said that the next generation of scientists would lose vital training opportunities if the research center were dismantled. 
“They get to have hands-on experience with state of the art research, aircraft, facilities and researchers,” he said. 
Clements said he was in shock that this was even being proposed. “How are they going to do this? Is this really going to happen?” he said. “It’s going to devastate atmospheric science research worldwide — not just California, not just the U.S. It is the leading atmospheric science institution in the world.” 
Gov. Gavin Newsom’s office called this research “life saving” in a news release Friday. 
“Unfortunately for the American people, Trump’s Budget Director, Russell Vought — also known as  “a right-wing absolute zealot”— is targeting the Center to line the pockets of Big Oil,” the statement said. “Despite what the Trump administration hopes, extreme weather does not take the day off.” 
Crowfoot told CalMatters that the move is just one more example of the Trump administration attacking the science that keeps Californians safe. 
“One that had us scrambling this fall was cuts to the federal funding for the California Nevada River Forecast Center,” Crowfoot said. California’s emergency storm and flood efforts rely on the forecast center to guide decisions such as where to pre-position emergency rescue teams.
Crowfoot said there were such large personnel cuts that the state has been racing to fill the gaps as the rainy season takes hold. Gutting the atmospheric research center, he said, will force a similar scramble as universities and others try to maintain data, tools and expertise in its absence. 
“Federal data and science and information is critical. What we’re experiencing across the country is this alarming adjustment to the loss of this information — and it’s happening on a weekly basis,” Crowfoot said.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/031223-Cutler-Flood-LV_17-CM.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-12-20 01:58:10.305193

Kim Reynolds appointed two new Iowa Board of Regents members, she announced Friday: Steve Lacy, a former media executive and Peter Cownie, a former state lawmaker. 
Reynolds said Lacy was “an accomplished executive” for his work at Meredith Corp., now People Inc., where he turned an “Iowa-grown publishing company into a national media conglomerate.” 
“He has demonstrated the ability to operate a highly functioning private organization—an essential asset as he steps into this new role working alongside other regents with the goal of propelling our state universities into the next generation of educational excellence,” Reynolds said in the release.

Lacy served as the CFO then CEO and later chairman at Meredith from 1998 until he retired in 2020, according to the release. Lacy, who has a master’s degree from Kansas State University, then went on to become the chair-CEO advisor at Vistage Worldwide, an executive coaching organization. 
Lacy has served on advisory council for the University of Iowa’s Center for Intellectual Freedom and said he has “enjoyed helping develop and successfully launch” the university’s new center. 
“I appreciate the opportunity to serve on the Iowa Board of Regents and sincerely thank Governor Reynolds for considering me,” Lacy said. “I am anxious to work with the Board of Regents to advance higher education in Iowa.”
Cownie served in the Iowa House of Representatives from 2008 to 2018 as a Republican from West Des Moines. 
In his professional life, Cownie was president of Junior Achievement of Central Iowa — a nonprofit organization that works to give students work readiness, entrepreneurship and financial literacy — from 2008 until 2013. 
He then went on to the Iowa State Fair Blue Ribbon Foundation, where he served as executive director. 
Reynolds said Cownie had a “strong background in business leadership, community engagement, and strategic planning.” 
“His experience and commitment to public service will be a valuable asset as the Board of Regents continues its important work to ensure our universities remain accessible, affordable, and focused on student success,” Reynolds said in the release. 
Cownie, who received a master’s degree from Drake University, said he was honored by the appointment to the Board of Regents. 
“I look forward to working to ensure our Regents institutions are providing a world class education for our students while also growing our economy in Iowa,” Cownie said.
Lacy and Cownie fill slots on the board left open by the resignation of former president of the board Sherry Bates and by David Barker, who left in May to serve as the assistant secretary for the U.S. Department of Education. 
The governor’s appointments require confirmation from the Iowa Senate.

Wes. Moore came to the defense of his Governor's Redistricting Advisory Commission Friday, one day after it was pilloried by open-government groups for voting in a closed meeting to move ahead on redrawing congressional maps. (Photo by Christine Condon/Maryland Matters)Gov. Wes Moore defended his redistricting advisory commission Friday, one day after the commission met behind closed doors and voted to proceed toward redrawing congressional maps in what one member called a “pre-ordained” decision.
“I’m very proud of the work that the commission is doing,” Moore said Friday. “They have run the most transparent and above-board redistricting advisory commission inside this entire country.”
In a brief meeting Thursday evening, the Governor’s Redistricting Advisory Commission voted to ask the public to submit new congressional district maps, and said it would hold two more meetings, that were not immediately scheduled. It came even though a special session of the General Assembly, where many thought redistricting might have been taken up, came and went this week.
The legislature reconvenes on Jan. 14, leaving it just six weeks to do any redistricting before the Feb. 24 candidate filing deadline for 2026 elections.
The vote occurred during an unannounced meeting that was closed to the public, frustrating good governance advocates and drawing a stern rebuke from Senate President Bill Ferguson (D), a commission member who opposes the governor’s midcycle redistricting push. Ferguson argued that the outcome of Moore’s commission was “pre-determined.”
When asked about the unannounced meeting, Moore deferred to the commission, which is led by Sen. Angela Alsobrooks (D- Md.). But he argued that “none” of the commission members “feel that this was a pre-baked process.”
“This commission is a bipartisan group of leaders who have heard from people all across the state and will continue [to hear} from people all across the state,” Moore said.
Redistricting commission votes behind closed doors to move toward redrawing maps

So far, the commission has held five virtual meetings, during which hundreds of Marylanders have chimed in about the concept of redistricting before the next Census. But it has yet to discuss actual maps.
Thursday, Alsobrooks announced that the commission will release the submitted maps after Christmas, and then hold two additional public meetings to gather feedback.
Alsobrooks argued that Maryland must enter the redistricting fight in response to President Donald Trump’s (R) effort to convince Republican-led states to redraw their Congressional district maps to favor the GOP.
“At a moment when other states are moving aggressively to redraw maps — and with some already signaling they want the Supreme Court to weaken or effectively nullify key protections in the Voting Rights Act — Maryland cannot afford to sit on the sidelines,” Alsobrooks said in a statement released by the governor’s office Thursday. “We have a responsibility to move forward so the next Congress reflects the will of the people and can serve as a real check on this President.”
Republicans hold only one of Maryland’s eight seats in the House of Representatives, and neither of Maryland’s two Senate seats. Statewide, Democrats outnumber Republicans by about 2 to 1, meaning Maryland Democrats are already overrepresented in Congress.
Ferguson has argued that the potential reward for Democrats — who could gain one additional seat by redrawing the maps — does not outweigh the potential risks, such as losing a seat, or opening the door for court challenges that could jeopardize Maryland’s current maps.
“I agreed to participate on behalf of the Senate of Maryland because we were tasked with hearing from Marylanders as to whether to move forward with mid-cycle redistricting. The cumulative oral and written testimony received to date demonstrates by a large margin that Marylanders oppose mid-cycle redistricting,” Ferguson said in a statement released before Thursday’s hastily called meeting.
“Moreover, we did not engage in a thoughtful, informed conversation that would have included, at the very least, testimony from the Office of the Attorney General, or our State and local boards of elections. Pushing forward a pre-ordained recommendation outside the public eye is irresponsible and lacks transparency,” his statement said.
In polling recently conducted by the University of Maryland, Baltimore County, state residents paying attention to the issue were almost evenly split on whether or not to move forward.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
In the poll, 40% of the respondents who said they were following the redistricting debate do not like the idea and feel that it should not be done. Another 7% said that although they liked the idea, it was the “wrong thing to do.”
By comparison, 24% said the state should do it, and another 21% said that although they didn’t like the idea, it is “necessary” to redistrict.
But overall, Marylanders ranked redistricting the lowest on a list of priorities that was topped by the cost of health care, the quality of K-12 education and reducing crime. Only 27% rated redistricting as a “high” priority.
“Being able to defend our democracy and have fair and competitive maps — that is something that is a priority for the people of Maryland,” Moore said Friday. “I’m really thankful that this bipartisan commission has, I think, done not just a good and admirable, but a very transparent job of making sure that the people’s voices are heard. I do not understand how you can suppress democracy and do it under the blanket of defending Congress.”
Asked about whether he was determined to redistrict because of a push by national Democrats, Moore was forceful.
“I don’t listen to party bosses. Party bosses don’t determine how I move,” Moore said. “This is a Maryland process.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/DSC02759-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-20 08:56:17.459158

(Photo by James Brooks/Alaska Beacon)A years-old mistake by the Alaska Department of Motor Vehicles voter registration program has endangered the citizenship of two prominent Kodiak residents and could cause them to be deported, according to a newly filed lawsuit in Alaska’s federal court.
The suit, filed Thursday by Eva Benedelova and Pavel Benedela in the U.S. District Court for the District of Alaska, says U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services canceled their citizenship oath ceremony because they were erroneously registered to vote in Alaska when they updated their driver’s licenses in 2022. 
USCIS is overdue on a decision about their citizenship, the suit claims, and it asks a judge to order final action.
Attorney Margaret Stock, who is representing the couple, said there’s a bigger issue at stake: Many more Alaskans may unknowingly be facing the same problem.
According to a timeline provided by the Alaska Division of Elections, between 2022 and 2024, “less than 50” Alaskans, “mostly non citizens,” were “being registered to vote through DMV online transactions such as address updates, license renewals, etc.” despite stating that they were not U.S. citizens and did not want to register to vote.
The Division of Elections admitted the error involving the Kodiak couple, apologized, and wrote a letter saying that Benedelova and Benedela did nothing wrong. The couple never voted and immediately canceled their voter registration when they discovered the problem.
Alaska Senate President Gary Stevens, R-Kodiak, and Rep. Louise Stutes, R-Kodiak, submitted a letter of support for the couple. The office of U.S. Sen. Dan Sullivan, R-Alaska, has also been working on the case and advocating for the couple. The couple’s employer, North Pacific Seafoods, backs them too.
“The errors in 2022 and 2024 were committed by the Alaska DMV, not by these upstanding individuals,” wrote Dave Hambleton, President of North Pacific Seafoods.
Despite that support and extensive documentation about the error, USCIS sent a letter to Pavel Benedela on Dec. 5 stating that the federal agency is seeking further evidence and that “false claims to U.S. citizenship and voting violations … even renders an alien deportable.”
The couple have two children who have grown up in the United States, Stock said. If either one of them becomes a citizen, the children will, too. If they don’t, all could be deported.
“It’s an insane situation,” Stock said. “It shouldn’t be happening. It’s not right. It’s unjust. The state’s at fault, and they shouldn’t be punishing these folks because of errors made by State of Alaska employees.”



What to do?
When someone is registered to vote in Alaska, they will be sent a voter card. If someone receives a voter card in error, including if they didn’t register to vote, the Division of Elections advises the recipient to contact the division and cancel their registration.



According to the complaint, the delay in the Kodiak couple’s citizenship application appears to be due in part to a federal policy implemented by USCIS in May 2025 that requires the agency’s headquarters to approve all matters where an applicant has been registered to vote in the United States.
“By the way, blanket policies like that are unlawful,” Stock said.
According to a timeline of events provided by the Alaska Division of Elections, the errors affecting the Kodiak couple and an unknown number of other Alaskans took place at the DMV between 2022 and 2024.
Alaska law allows people who update their driver’s licenses — or get new ones — to automatically register themselves to vote. 
It’s supposed to be an opt-in process, but in 2022, an update to DMV’s system “cause(d) online transactions with DMV to automatically opt-in people who don’t select either yes or no,” an act that sent voter registrations to the Division of Elections, the division’s timeline states.
In the case of Benedelova and Benedela, someone along the process — likely a state employee — filled out the voter registration form in their name, copying their signatures without their knowledge or consent.
“I confirm that Mr. Benedela and Mrs. Benedelova did not specify on any DOE document that they are U.S. citizens,” wrote elections supervisor Ryan Wilson on Dec. 12. “Additionally, your signatures on the voter registration forms are a digital copy of which neither of you was aware of its use.”
Stock said that while Benedela and Benedelova are the only people who have come forward publicly about the issue, she is aware of others in the same position.
“I can tell you that I know other people the same things happen to, so it’s not just a one-off with these two people,” she said.
Stock said that in her career, she’s seen many examples of people mistakenly registered to vote because of a lack of understanding about what a citizen is, but this case is something different.
“The creepy thing is that the registration form says you’re not allowed to use an electronic signature on it, but the state’s been doing that anyway. … We have a copy of their voter registration form, and the state created that on their own, without the immigrants’ knowledge, and submitted it and checked off that they were US citizens. Some employee of the state is really doing bad things, basically,” Stock said.
A spokesperson for the Alaska Department of Administration, which oversees the DMV, did not answer questions by the deadline for this article on Friday.
The Division of Elections, which has been examining the issues for years, provided detailed documentation and explanations, as well as an apology it sent the couple. 
According to its timeline of events, Benedelova was registered to vote through the DMV process in September 2022. 
The division became aware of noncitizens being registered to vote by the DMV in 2023 or 2024 and worked with the DMV to reword their forms and change the process so people who opted out did not have their information sent to the division.
An additional question was also added to the process: “Are you a U.S. Citizen?”
Despite those changes, the effects of the erroneous process appear to be lingering. This summer, the U.S. Department of Justice asked Alaska and other states to provide copies of their voter rolls in order to identify noncitizens who may have illegally participated in state or local elections.
The data provided by the division and obtained by the Beacon via a public records request included an inactive voters list with 541 people whose records were tagged as “NC” for non-citizen. 
Among those 541 people were Benedelova and Benedela, who had canceled their registrations in 2024 immediately after learning they had been erroneously registered.
At the time the record was released, the director of the Division of Elections said to treat it cautiously because some people might have been erroneously labeled.
“When we have gone in there and looked and contacted them, we have found that usually it was a mistake,” she said.

Town Manager Jeff Schulz is no longer an employee of Northfield. Charlie Morse, the town’s selectboard chair, confirmed that Friday was his last day.
The five-member selectboard passed a severance agreement at a special meeting Wednesday. Morse was the lone dissenter on the 4-1 vote taken in executive session, according to the meeting minutes.
Unlike prior board meetings, the meeting was not streamed remotely and a video is not available on its Youtube page. Town officials have not said why.
Schulz, who has been on leave since Dec. 5, did not immediately respond to comment. Board members have not shared any details of the severance package despite multiple queries this week.
A longtime employee, Schulz submitted a letter to the board in October announcing his plan to retire or resign next year. As rumors swirled in the community about his impending departure last week, Schulz denied he was leaving.
“I am not sure where you got that information. That is false. I am going on vacation this Friday,” he wrote in an email on Dec. 4. He has not responded since.

Ken McCann, administrative assistant for the town, whose voicemail replaced Schulz’s earlier this week, said he is filling in. 
“I will be working more or less directly for the Select Board until an interim town manager has been hired,” he wrote in an email Thursday.
The Washington County town of about 5,900 — home to Norwich University — has contracted with Vermont League of Cities and Towns to find an interim manager and start the search for a permanent town manager, Morse said in his statement.
Schultz’s departure comes on the heels of the town’s former police chief Pierre Gomez’s resignation at the end of October.
One of three police chiefs of color in Vermont, Gomez reported facing racial harassment since he moved to town two years ago. Gomez said today he filed ethics violations against Schultz this year that he said were substantiated by the board.
Selectboard members have not responded to multiple queries about these alleged ethics violations. The board is also working to fill the policing gap in town since Gomez left, Morse said in the statement.
“Our surrounding neighbors and State Police are well aware of our law enforcement needs and are working with (Vermont League of Cities and Towns) to arrive at a remedy for the near future. This is a demonstration of professionalism of neighbors helping neighbors,” he wrote.
He did not share further details. By 8:30 p.m. Friday, the town’s website had already listed the town manager position as vacant.

Deficits starting in 2028 are driven by required education spending. (Chart by Department of Legislative Services)Maryland could be in for some belt-tightening in an effort to contain a series of projected budget shortfalls, including a $1.2 billion gap forecast for the fiscal 2027 budget.
The joint Spending Affordability Committee Thursday adopted a recommendation to cut the projected deficit in half by cutting ongoing spending by $600 million.
“I think the theme of these recommendations is that we’ve got to be prudent,” said Sen. Jim Rosapepe (D-Prince George’s and Anne Arundel), the joint committee’s Senate co-chair and the vice chair of the Senate Budget and Taxation Committee. “We’ve got to be conservative, and that’s why I’m supporting it.”
The committee also adopted a recommendation to leave the state’s rainy day fund untouched. Using the fund — even a portion of the fund — would be a one-time move.

The current balance of 8% of general fund revenues is about $800 million more than the 5% required by law. But analysts and lawmakers note that bond rating agencies are already skittish about the state dipping into the account, and worry the state’s higher-than-required reserves are not enough compared to peer states.
Another recommendation called on the governor to fill only “mission critical” vacancies and increase others to meet turnover goals. The recommendation stopped short of asking Moore to implement a hiring freeze.
Thursday’s vote fell along party lines, with the committee’s three Republicans rejecting the recommendation. Del. Jefferson L. Ghrist (R-Upper Shore) suggested the recommendations did not go far enough.
“Obviously we’re very concerned about our structural deficit,” said Ghrist. “If we don’t make the appropriate cuts to the structure of government that matches the deficit by making these one-time cuts, the only thing we’re really doing is kicking the can down the road to a time and place where, looking at the graph — it’s going to be much worse than it is now.”
House Minority Whip Del. Jesse T Pippy (R-Frederick) and Sen. Johnny Ray Salling (R-Baltimore County) also voted against the recommendations.
The governor is not required to follow the recommendations of the committee but typically does.
Lawmakers and Gov. Wes Moore (D) start the 2026 legislative session next month facing a nearly $1.6 billion structural budget deficit. Three quarters of that — about $1.2 billion — is a cash shortfall.
The forecast released by the committee last month was a gut punch following a fiscally trying 2025 legislative session.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
The news since that November meeting has not improved the state’s fiscal situation in a significant way.
A week ago, the Board of Revenue Estimates projected general fund revenues for fiscal 2027 would inch up from $27.102 billion in September’s estimates to $27.111 billion in December — an increase of just $9.1 million.
Legislative budget analysts pointed to “weakness in the sales tax” collections as well as uncertainty related to federal fiscal policies.
“The reality is that we’ve got problems because we got a big problem in Washington,” Rosapepe said Thursday. “We had … the longest government shutdown in history just a month ago. We may have another government shutdown in January. We’re never sure when the Trump administration is going to come through with money that it is supposed to provide us from the federal government.
“We saw what they tried to do with SNAP benefits during the shutdown,” he said. “So the risks caused by the Trump administration to the people of Maryland and to the budget of Maryland are huge.”

To start the year, legislators and the governor faced a $3.3 billion deficit for fiscal 2026, which started July 1. A final spending plan used one-time cuts, fund transfers and $1.6 billion in tax increases to plug that hole.
When it was all said and done, the compromise budget agreed to by the House and Senate closed the deficit and was supposed to leave the state in a good place for fiscal 2027, with what was expected to be about a $300 million surplus.
The solution was meant to get the state through the final year of the term. But lawmakers and Moore knew then — as now — that tougher challenges awaited starting in fiscal 2028 through fiscal 2030.
In those years, the state would see the structural deficit explode, driven by increased spending required by the Blueprint for Maryland’s Future education program.
And while the out-year gaps projected a year ago are smaller, they increase from $1.5 billion in fiscal 2028 to $3.4 billion in fiscal 2030.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_3264-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-12-19 20:57:24.420882

Wes Moore (D) signs an executive order Friday that includes a range of potential solutions to energy generation and transmission issues in Maryland. (Photo by Christine Condon/Maryland Matters)Gov. Wes Moore (D) signed an executive order on energy Friday, with a focus on streamlining state procedures to attract new energy generation to the state.
Moore acknowledged during Friday’s news conference that the executive order would not lower Marylanders’ rising energy rates in the short term. But by attracting more power developers to the state, the goal is to eventually bolster energy supply and lower bills, he said.
“There is no governor who can turn around and say, ‘Energy prices are down,’ because there is no governor who is forcing energy prices to spike. No governor can lower prices,” Moore said. “But here in Maryland, we will do everything in our power to bring relief to the people.”
Moore’s order includes a to-do list for state agencies, including his Energy Administration. For example, by late 2027, state government will develop an inventory of sites that could be ripe for power development. Brownfields and industrial sites are to be prioritized, according to the governor’s order, and state government should entice developers with grants and technical assistance.

Moore also established a new energy sub-Cabinet, made up of his department secretaries, and led by the newly minted director of the Maryland Energy Administration, Kelly Speakes-Backman. The governor also created a Maryland Energy Advisory Council, made up of legislators, utilities, the regional grid operator PJM, consumer advocates and more.
The sub-Cabinet will serve as the “nerve center for driving energy policy in the state,” Moore said Friday, and the advisory council will “give experts from throughout the state and the region a stronger voice in Maryland’s energy decisions.”
Moore’s order comes just a few days after the legislature overturned many Moore vetoes during a special session, including a bill that created a strategic energy planning office for the state.
Moore opposed the creation of that office because it would have been funded by utilities — which would use ratepayer dollars. By contrast, his new sub-Cabinet and advisory council can be funded using existing state resources, administration officials say.
PJM remains in the crosshairs
During his remarks Friday, Moore again had stern words for PJM Interconnection, the operator of the electric grid that includes Maryland, Washington, D.C., and a dozen other states. Moore called PJM “a multistate conglomerate led primarily by a board consisting of big business executives,” and he argued the entity’s policies are to blame for rising prices.
Environmental advocates have faulted PJM for a logjammed queue of power-generation applications that has slowed renewable energy projects hoping to come online. PJM argues that it is clearing the backlog, and it also recently created a fast-track for “shovel-ready” projects.
“We cannot build a 21st century economy on an energy market that continues to block new supply,” Moore said Friday. “The system’s incentives are upside down.”
Climate study, energy planning, data center bills become law after Moore vetoes are overriden

Moore’s order requires his MEA to work with the Public Service Commission “to advocate for market reforms at PJM.”
Earlier this week, PJM held a major energy auction, which cleared at a price 1.3% higher than the previous auction. PJM estimates that the auction will have little effect on bills, but the effect would have been significant if it weren’t for a cap imposed on the auction at the request of Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro (D) and other governors, including Moore. That cap will lift for the next auction, held next summer, unless further action is taken.
But more alarmingly, the auction — which covers the 2027-2028 delivery year — did not procure quite enough energy to meet a standard set by PJM. That occurred largely because of projections that large data centers will demand a significant amount of additional power from the grid by 2027.
PJM officials said during a news conference Wednesday that they expect conditions to improve by that year, because of new restraints placed on data centers, among other reasons, meaning the energy supply procured during the auction will come closer to reaching the proper standard.
Maryland climate and consumer advocates argued in a news release that PJM is to blame for the imbalance in the auction.
Brittany Baker, Maryland director of the Chesapeake Climate Action Network said this week’s auction is “another example that PJM’s failure to connect clean energy to the grid is driving up our energy bills.”
“PJM is trying the same thing over and over, and they keep getting the same result, higher energy prices for all of us,” said Del. Lorig Charkoudian (D-Montgomery), in the news release.
Transmission lines and power affordability programs also a focus
The governor’s executive order also includes provisions focused on power transmission infrastructure.
Moore requested that the Maryland Public Service Commission require transmission owners to study advanced transmission technologies before they approve the construction of new lines.
Moore appoints PSC members, but the body is a state agency that otherwise acts independently to regulate the state’s electric and gas utilities, such as Baltimore Gas & Electric, Pepco and Potomac Edison.

Moore’s request comes amid an ongoing fight, led by rural Marylanders, against a transmission line, the Maryland Piedmont Reliability Project, that would run through Baltimore, Carroll and Frederick counties.
Opponents of the line have long argued that grid officials should have considered technological upgrades to existing infrastructure, before proposing an entirely new line that would disrupt homeowners and natural lands.
Moore also directed his administration to create an inventory of state-owned rights-of-way, such as highway medians, that could be used for power lines or energy-storing batteries, and create a streamlined permitting process for those sites.
Several provisions simply call on Moore’s administration to petition the PSC, asking it to consider certain policy changes for utilities and transmission owners.
In his order, Moore requests that the commission evaluate the efficacy of utilities’ budget billing programs, which allow customers to make even monthly payments for their energy, and avoid seasonal price spikes.
Moore’s order argues that the commission should “assess whether current practices adequately protect customers from large true-up balances and clearly disclose program terms, risks, and benefits,” among other topics.
Under the order, Moore’s Energy Administration will also deliver a new report on the state’s energy assistance programs for ratepayers, due in 120 days.
“For a lot of people, what I was just talking about might sound very technical, but I know for that family who that bill is about to arrive, and they don’t know why it just doubled, policy stops being technical. Policy gets real personal real quick,” Moore said. “And that is what this administration thinks about every single day.”

(Alixel Cabrera/Utah News Dispatch)Saying that “selling national parks was never on the table,” Utah Sen. Mike Lee is no longer proposing a change to federal legislation that drew heavy criticism from conservation groups, his office said Friday.
Lee, A Republican, had proposed removing part of a spending bill requiring that national park lands be maintained as federal lands. The Coalition to Protect America’s National Parks shot back, saying the move could “green-light the selling off, transferring and giving away of national parks.” 
Over the summer, Lee attempted to add a mandate for the sale of some public lands, excluding national parks and national monuments, to Republicans’ megabill. He backed down after outcry from hunting and recreation advocates.

On Friday, Lee spokesperson Jordan Roberts said the senator filed a new amendment late Thursday that would keep intact the section he previously sought to remove.
“I categorically oppose selling national parks,” Lee, chair of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, said in a statement to Utah News Dispatch. 
Lee said the U.S. Department of the Interior had called his attention to the section at issue, saying it “would permanently freeze Park Service boundaries, blocking routine land exchanges Congress has long approved, such as past legislation returning sacred lands near Denali to the Doyon Alaska Native Corporation.”
Lee continued: “That was the concern. Selling national parks was never on the table.”
Some advocates see it as a repeat of recent history. 
“Once again, Mike Lee is retreating with his tail between his legs after trying to make it easier to sell off and dispose of our public lands,” said Kate Groetzinger with the nonprofit Center for Western Priorities. “But given that the appropriations bill is not signed yet, we’re going to be keeping a close eye on it.”
Utah hosts invite-only meeting on national parks and neighboring communities 

Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, chimed in to defend Lee Thursday on the social media site X, saying Lee sought to take out a provision “that would have unintended consequences for routine Park Service actions.”
“Senator Mike Lee is not trying to sell Park Service lands or ‘end the Park Service as we know it,’” the post reads. “Those who are claiming that should know better and need to knock it off.” 
Linda Mazzu, a retired superintendent at Bryce Canyon National Park, joined conservation groups in voicing concern Thursday.
Mazzu said after layoffs and buyouts earlier this year, staffing at the park service is down 25%. The agency is also staring down $1.2 billion in cuts under the White House’s proposed 2026 budget.

Bigger shifts may follow. In May, Interior Secretary Doug Burgum told a House budget panel that there is no plan to remove any of 64 “crown jewel” national parks. But he said some of the more than 400 other park service sites could be managed by state or local authorities. 
A draft of the Interior Department’s strategic five-year plan listed the return of “heritage lands and sites to the states” and efforts to “assess and right-size monuments” among five “key strategies” for the agency. 
Mazzu said she’s concerned about the future of smaller sites like Utah’s Golden Spike National Historic Park, that are managed by the park service and less visited than Utah’s “Mighty 5” national parks.        
“There are so many small places that might just be a historic house,” Mazzu said. “But it captures a huge part of the history of our country.”

(Photo by 4nadia/iStock / Getty Images Plus)LACEY — Washington Gov. Bob Ferguson unveiled a plan Friday to steer $3 billion into preserving the state’s roads and bridges and building three new ferries over the next decade.
Ferguson would raise the money through borrowing, with the sale of bonds backed by proceeds from a slew of new and increased taxes and fees lawmakers approved this year. This included an increase in the state’s gas tax.
As envisioned, there’d be roughly a billion dollars apiece for paving highways, painting and repairing bridges, and adding three vessels to the Washington State Ferries fleet.
Ferguson announced the proposed investments in a press conference Thursday at a state Department of Transportation maintenance facility in Lacey.
“These investments are not going to fix every single aging bridge or address every road statewide, not close,” Ferguson said. “But the neglect we’ve seen over years means we have a big backlog.”
“Climbing any mountain starts with the first step,” he added. “That’s what we’re doing here.”
Here are a few things to know about the governor’s plan.
Concrete preservation
Transportation officials have repeatedly warned that state infrastructure is in the early stages of critical failure. The problem stems from a lack of money to keep up with repaving, repairing aging bridge spans and responding to emergency fixes.
It is estimated 40% of the state’s lane miles, about 7,900, were due or overdue for paving in 2024. Of those, 670 miles got paved. Of Washington’s 3,427 spans, 10% are more than 80 years old. 
Recent closures have underscored the consequences when routes are severed.
The Fairfax Bridge over the Carbon River, a gateway to Mount Rainier, has been permanently closed since April due to deterioration. The state transportation department is considering rebuilding a new bridge there, or tearing down the existing bridge and building nothing new.
Republican lawmakers plan to push a bill in the next legislative session to replace the bridge. Ferguson on Friday didn’t commit to a path forward for the future of the route.

The White River Bridge, connecting eastern King and Pierce counties, was closed for two months recently after an overheight truck significantly damaged it. Though this closure wasn’t due to deferred maintenance, Ferguson said it shows what happens when a vital link is out. The closure forced lengthy detours, inconveniencing residents and hurting businesses.  
State preservation dollars paid for the emergency repairs to reconnect the cities of Buckley and Enumclaw.
“Infrastructure means access, access to everything that we rely on in a day of instant demand,” Enumclaw Mayor-elect Anthony Wright said.
Ferguson also highlighted seven lane closures on the Tacoma Narrows Bridge between January 2024 and September of this year for repairs to the 75-year-old suspension bridge.
“They were closed last weekend because of old bridge joints making the bridge move too much, causing cracked pavement and other breaks,” he said. “We can expect more closures unless we replace those joints.”
Earlier this year, the Legislature approved a two-year $15.5 billion budget with $900 million for preservation. 
Ferguson’s funding plan, which would need to be approved by the Legislature, includes $1.1 billion dedicated to bridge preservation, $164 million for paving projects next summer and another $756 million for paving over the next decade.
Senate Transportation Committee Chair Marko Liias, D-Edmonds, applauded the governor’s proposal.
“We cannot ignore that Washington’s infrastructure is aging,” Liias said in a statement. “Funding for preservation and maintenance must be a long-term budget commitment, not a one-time decision.”
For the current budget, Ferguson would increase spending on preservation by $300 million.
“The deterioration that happens when we delay preservation work leads to costly construction or replacement, which can often be three, four, five times more expensive than if we’d simply timely resurfaced or rehabilitated structures,” the governor said.
New ferries, old ferries
Ferguson wants to keep the state on course to electrify its ferry fleet. The plan is to convert six existing vessels to hybrid-electric power, build 16 new plug-ins and add shore charging to 16 terminals — all by 2040.
Only one conversion is done. Neither new boats nor electrified terminals are expected to be operational before the end of the decade. Projects are taking longer and costing way more than expected, making the mid-century goal appear increasingly unattainable. 
In July, the state awarded a $715 million contract for up to three hybrid electric ferries to a Florida shipyard. Two vessels are locked in under the deal. The state must decide by next summer whether to exercise an option on the third. Money for that contract is already set aside.
Under the governor’s plan, most of the $1 billion that would be raised in the next decade would go to build three more vessels. There would also be money to maintain the existing fleet, including extending the service life of boats that are more than 60 years old.
“I certainly view our ferry system exactly like that bridge that connected those communities down there at Enumclaw and Buckley, so that’s why we’re going big on the ferry investment as well,” Ferguson said.
Flood response
Record flooding this month has wreaked havoc on the state’s transportation infrastructure. SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Parts of U.S. 2, a major east-west crossing over the Cascades, could be closed for months due to washouts that have destroyed sections of the highway, Ferguson said this week. 
The state has signed an emergency 30-day, $800,000 contract to repair a 12-mile stretch over Stevens Pass, but the state doesn’t have a date set for reopening. 
This immediate work on U.S. 2 will focus on clearing debris, repairing drainage features and stabilizing the roadway to open this winter, but “it will not completely restore the road to as it was,” state transportation department spokesperson Lauren Loebsack said in an email Friday.
“This will not be the final repairs and that will be a separate project possibly (in) Summer 2026,” Loebsack wrote.
Emergency repairs on parts of the east side of U.S. 2 are also in development, according to state transportation officials.
Several other highways also need major repairs due to the recent flooding and storms. 
It’ll take time to understand the full scope of that road damage. 
“This is a 10-year plan, and the storm was just this last month,” said state Transportation Secretary Julie Meredith. 
A bill filed Friday would use state carbon auction proceeds to cover costs of repairing damaged infrastructure. If climate change was a factor in the severity of the storms, then it is appropriate to use Climate Commitment Act funds to respond, said state Rep. Andrew Barkis, R-Olympia, the top Republican on the House Transportation Committee.
In the coming weeks, the state will be seeking a major disaster declaration from the federal government to unlock federal recovery funding for individuals, local governments and the state.
Paying the bill
The new initiatives won’t require tax hikes, Ferguson emphasized. The state funding will come from bonds repaid with revenue streams the Legislature passed last session.
Despite handwringing over a shortfall in the state’s operating budget, Ferguson called the transportation budget “healthy.”
Incurring new debt in this manner will not be an easy sell in the Legislature, where a supermajority of 60% is required to pass a bond bill.
Lawmakers were adamant earlier this year that the new and higher taxes they passed were needed to cope with budget pressures from flagging gas tax revenues and soaring construction costs on projects.
In the same session, the Senate passed a bill authorizing up to $7 billion in bonds for highway projects and improvements, and potentially ferries. It lapsed in the House without a hearing.
“We are in a fiscally constrained situation,” said Rep. Jake Fey, D-Tacoma, chair of the House Transportation Committee. “He’s right about two of the areas that need to get addressed: ferries and preservation and maintenance. I’m excited about having a conversation about that with him.”
Barkis said he’s opposed to the added borrowing.
“We do have the capacity, but it’s not the right thing to do,” he said. “I think he’s going to have trouble getting it through the Legislature.”
What’s next
On Monday, the governor will release his supplemental funding proposal for the operating budget. That blueprint, along with ones for capital and transportation spending, will serve as a template for lawmakers when they begin their 60-day session Jan. 12. The funding will build upon the two-year budgets Ferguson signed earlier this year that took effect July 1.

Alander Rocha/Georgia RecorderGeorgia regulators unanimously approved a massive expansion of the state’s power grid Friday, approving Georgia Power’s request for nearly 10,000 megawatts of new energy capacity despite concerns over transparency and the potential financial risk to ratepayers.
The vote by the Public Service Commission greenlights a plan that relies heavily on new fossil fuel infrastructure, with five new natural gas plants to meet surging demand from the growth of data centers. While supporters argued that the expansion is needed to keep growing the state’s economy, the hearing was dominated by debate over whether the utility has provided enough evidence that an agreement between commission staff and Georgia Power allows at least $8.50 per month in “downward pressure” on residential rates.
Following the vote, Georgia Power celebrated the decision, saying that the new revenue from large customers will directly benefit families.
“We know every dollar counts. This plan means more money stays in your pocket while we power Georgia’s future,” said Georgia Power’s chief Kim Greene. “Unlike any other market in the country, we’re doing things differently here in Georgia to capture and serve this projected unprecedented growth. Large energy users are paying more so families and small businesses can pay less, and that’s a great result for Georgians.”
Commission Chair Jason Shaw said after the hearing that the commission did its “duty” to ensure companies coming to Georgia have power.
“Our job is to deal with growth,” he said.

But opponents of the power expansion criticized commissioners for potentially failing to protect residential customers from the cost of building massive power infrastructure largely to power data centers, which includes the addition of five new methane gas-burning units at plants Bowen, McIntosh and Wansley. Critics have argued that there is no guarantee the forecasted demand will come to fruition. 
“Today, commissioners chose to put this $60 billion risk on the backs of everyday Georgians, not Georgia Power. They had the chance to meaningfully protect existing customers, and they did not,” said Bob Sherrier, a staff attorney for the Southern Environmental Law Center, in a statement.
Critics also questioned the morality of the decision in light of the utility’s financial performance. Southern Company, Georgia Power’s parent company, reported earning $1.7 billion between July and September of this year, an increase from the same period last year.
“We’re being asked to risk our health and wellbeing so Georgia Power shareholders can get richer. It’s immoral and unjust,” said Codi Norred, executive director of Georgia Interfaith Power and Light.

Abe Scarr, energy and utilities program director for Georgia PIRG, which is a public interest research group, said that if the projected demand from data centers fails to materialize or cover costs, ratepayers will face long-term consequences.
“If the demand doesn’t show up, if data centers fail to cover their costs, and when gas prices spike again, Georgia Power customers will be left holding the bag for decades to come,” Scarr said.
Environmental advocacy organizations filed a motion Wednesday aimed at delaying the decision until Georgia Power provided the data behind its projections, specifically the math supporting a promise that the new industrial usage would help lower residential rates.
“This motion right now is not about whether their math is right or wrong. It’s about showing their work,” said Jennifer Whitfield, an attorney with SELC, to the commission. Without seeing the calculations, she said the public is forced to accept Georgia Power’s promises on faith.

The motion to delay was ultimately denied Friday. Brandon Marzo, representing Georgia Power, dismissed the interveners’ concerns, telling the commissioners that Whitfield was “confused by the facts” and that the necessary information was already available in the record.
Marzo framed the massive capacity request as an urgent response to economic expansion.
“The state is growing, commissioners,” Marzo said. “The load is coming.”
He insisted that the influx of large industrial customers would benefit residential ratepayers by spreading costs over a larger base. He said that Georgia Power’s projected $8.50 monthly savings for the average customer.
Commission staff came to an agreement with Georgia Power but warned that the years 2029 through 2031 would be critical for monitoring progress to ensure that Georgia Power’s promised $8.50 “downward pressure” pledge would materialize.
“It will be the responsibility of this commission to observe, to engage and if needed to act,” said commission attorney Chris Collado.
Environmental and consumer advocacy groups remained skeptical. Sherrier reminded the commission of past promises that ultimately fell short, saying that similar promises were made that the costs of the Plant Vogtle nuclear expansion would not be passed down to ratepayers. He advocated for the staff’s original recommendation of “conditional certification,” which would have approved resources only after contracts with new customers were signed.
“If they’re wrong and the load doesn’t commit, conditional certification ensures that we don’t have to pay for those resources. We don’t have to pay this round,” Sherrier said.
Curt Thompson of the Sierra Club echoed these concerns, saying that “no amount of alleged downward pressure on rates can ensure that the customer bills won’t go up.”",https://georgiarecorder.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/DSC06778-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-19 19:57:46.459231

The Idaho Supreme Court on Friday scheduled oral arguments in a lawsuit challenging the state’s new private education tax credit.
Each side will have 30 minutes on Jan. 23 to make arguments and answer questions from the court’s five justices, according to an order from Chief Justice G. Richard Bevan.
The lawsuit seeks to block the state’s first private school choice program from taking effect. In September, a coalition that includes the Idaho Education Association, the Moscow School District and advocacy groups filed a petition asking the court to declare House Bill 93’s “Parental Choice Tax Credit” unconstitutional.
The tax credit offers non-public school students up to $5,000 — or $7,500 for students with special needs — to offset tuition and other education expenses.
The coalition of plaintiffs has argued that the program violates a provision in Idaho’s Constitution that directs the Legislature to “establish and maintain a general, uniform and thorough system of public, free common schools.”
In a Friday statement, the coalition said, “We welcome the opportunity to definitively address a deeply flawed law that tries to bypass the clear constitutional mandate to establish and maintain a single, uniform system of public schools funded by taxpayers.”
Attorney General Raúl Labrador’s office is representing the Idaho State Tax Commission, the agency responsible for administering the tax credit. The Legislature also intervened in the lawsuit, hiring private attorneys to defend the legislation that Republican lawmakers passed in February.
The application period for the tax credit is scheduled to go live Jan. 15, eight days before the Supreme Court arguments. It’s unclear whether the court’s schedule will affect the application period.
Idaho Education News asked the Tax Commission to comment Friday afternoon.

Residents evacuated from Packwood, Wash., during the Goat Rocks in 2022. (Photo by Jared Wenzelburger | Oregon Capital Chronicle). Calling rising wildfire insurance rates an “urgent challenge,” a Headwaters Economics and Columbia Climate School report released this month points to potential approaches to address the financial burden on Montana property owners.
Nationwide, property insurance rates are rising — but they’re doing so even faster in areas with “climate-related perils” according to a report published by the U.S. Treasury Department at the beginning of this year.
Non-renewal of policies is also an issue and that same Treasury report found that in areas with “the highest expected losses from climate-related perils,” non-renewals of property insurance coverage were more common.
The Headwaters report looks at five strategies that could be employed to help communities in high-risk areas find insurance. These approaches include community risk pooling, ideas pulled from agriculture insurance and large-scale state reform.
According to the state’s insurance commissioner, James Brown, the state could see the fifth-highest state increase in property insurance increases this year, citing a National Association of Realtors report. Montana policy holders paid a little more than $4 billion in premiums in 2013, that number in 2022 was almost $7.4 billion, according to the National Association of Insurance Commissioners. 
He pointed to escalating fire risk in a May letter as part of the problem.
“First, wildfires have become more frequent and intense. Nearly 70% of all wildfires recorded in Montana have occurred since 2000,” Brown wrote. “These longer-lasting, more destructive fires dramatically increase the risk to homes, pushing insurance rates higher. Second, Montana’s scenic appeal and lifestyle continue to attract new residents, inflating property values and replacement costs — thereby driving up premiums.”
He went on to write that half of all properties in Montana are “at risk of catastrophic wildfire damage.”
‘Ability to financially rebound’
About 75,000 acres burned in Montana this year with one main residence, according to the state’s Department of Natural Resources and Conservation. Fires involving large numbers of structure losses — such as the Eaton and Palisades fires around Los Angeles earlier this year — have become more common and the economic losses are staggering.
Montana has seen some fires that have destroyed homes, including the 2021 fire in Denton and the Bridger Foothills Fire in 2020.
According to a 2023 Department of Interior report, the annual burden of wildfires on the U.S. Economy was between “$71 billion to $348 billion in 2016 dollars ($87 billion to $424 billion in 2022 dollars).” The same report said there are “huge” data gaps around “property damage, loss of life, and healthcare costs.”
Tens of millions are spent on fire suppression and mitigation in Montana each year and nationally, suppression costs consistently ring in at well over a billion dollars annually.
But even with the suppression and mitigation efforts, communities can struggle when faced with a fire disaster.
“As the protection gap expands between those with insured losses and those without, a community’s ability to financially rebound is weakened, municipal revenue flows including property taxes may be diminished, and significant federal investment may be needed to offset recovery and rebuilding costs,” the Headwaters report reads. 
It also cautions that no single strategy will solve all problems and goes on to say a, “layered, adaptive, and equity-focused framework,” will be needed to address insurance issues caused by wildfires. Additionally, the report does not cover renters nor the “unique” experiences of Native Americans living on tribal reservations.
“Land inside reservations may have unique ownership structures and be subject to federal oversight in ways that interfere with private sector insurance coverage, and tribes have long contended with additional administrative barriers to public support systems,” the report reads.
‘Reducing their own risk’
The report suggests five “new pathways” for insurance in the state, which are: voluntary certification programs, community-based catastrophe insurance, parametric policies, FAIR state plans (insurance of last resort), and state regulatory reform.
The report discusses the benefits and drawbacks of each approach, as well as examples from other states that have utilized some of those ideas. FAIR plans have been implemented in Florida, for example, while parametric policies essentially model agricultural drought insurance.
Voluntary certification is the idea that’s gained the most traction, said Kimi Barrett, a lead wildfire research and policy analyst at Headwaters. Barrett, along with Columbia Climate School’s Lisa Dale, authored the report.
Voluntary certification, where citizens do specific things to reduce fire risk on their property in tandem with others in their community, leans into the idea of home and community hardening, an approach conservation groups applaud. 
Some scientists have argued the root of the wildfire issue is actually a structural ignition problem and that losses could be lessened by better building codes and materials.
These types of policies have mostly been done in western parts of the country.
“It’s modeled off of what hurricane mitigation is required in places like Alabama and elsewhere, where it’s essentially a fortification of a home to that hazard,” Barrett said. “And in doing so, demonstrating to insurance providers that the risk has been reduced enough to meet criteria for insurance retainment moving forward.”
Colorado has modeled this policy, passing a statewide fire code this year that made a home-hardening inspection mandatory at point of sale. The report also found there are potentially psychological factors to consider within the voluntary certification program.
“Shifting residents’ current expectations of external support, including home protection from firefighters, disaster relief from FEMA, and insurance as a buffer from loss will take a concentrated effort,” the report reads. “When homeowners accept personal responsibility for reducing their own risk, they may find the costs associated with home hardening to be more acceptable. Fostering this mindset change will take significant public outreach.”
‘A house in the country’
However, population trends show that people keep moving to and building in fire-prone areas.
According to the Montana Environmental Information Center, the number of new homes built in wildfire-prone areas doubled between 1990 and 2020.
Areas like the Bitterroot and Flathead Valleys are particularly vulnerable, even as southwestern Montana has exploded in population. Grass fires in Montana are a concern too, as evidenced by the fire that swept through Denton in 2021.
“Everyone wants a house in the country, right? It’s beautiful, and yet we created the imperfect storm,” Dominick DellaSala, a conservation scientist, said to the Daily Montanan. “Because now the climate has shifted, the Forest Service can’t possibly put out all these fires that are increasing in speed, intensity and acres burning where all these houses were built. So what do we do about it?”
The state Legislature is looking at the broader issue of property insurance rates in an interim committee and there’s a wildfire study bill as well. Those discussions could end up becoming legislation during the 2027 Legislative session, and the hope from the Headwater Report’s authors is that it helps inform these discussions.
It’s also important to note what insurance companies are looking for, Barrett said.
“Insurance is spending money on homes getting damaged and destroyed by wildfire,” Barrett said. “What they need to see is risk reduction ahead of a wildfire to those homes and communities placed in high risk areas, and that forest treatments and fuels reduction of landscapes alone, will not get them there, nor will suppression and response. It requires addressing the built environment at the same level that we currently address suppression and forest treatments.”
Insurance advocates have pointed to low amounts of hazardous fuels work being done under the Trump Administration — possibly as much as a 38% drop in annual average of acres treated — and are looking to see more done.
“We’ve seen more evidence and more informative reports for policyholders and homeowners about what they need to do to help protect and defend their home and make sure that they’re safe,” said Jayson O’Neill, an insurance advocate. “We aren’t seeing this sort of same urgency from our regulators and our state insurance commissioner and our state legislators.”

Faith Winter’s blood alcohol level was above the legal limit when she died in a car crash the night before Thanksgiving, according to the Arapahoe County Coroner’s Office.
Winter, a Broomfield Democrat, died during a multi-vehicle car crash on Interstate 25 south of Denver on Nov. 26. She rear-ended a Ford F-350 that was stopped in the left lane of northbound traffic, according to an Arapahoe County Sheriff’s Office press release Friday. Immediately before that crash, another three-car crash occurred along the same section of the highway.
Winter was the only one in her car. Her cause of death was determined to be multiple blunt force injuries sustained in the crash.
Faith Winter remembered for life of service during memorial at Colorado Capitol

Winter’s blood alcohol level was 0.185% at the time. The threshold to be charged in Colorado with driving under the influence is 0.08%.
No criminal charges will be filed related to crash, the sheriff’s office said. That determination was made “after a thorough review of the evidence in coordination with the 18th Judicial District Attorney’s Office,” according to the press release.
The Ford F-350 did not have visible rear taillights but was driving with “due regard,” according to the sheriff’s office.
Winter died at the scene. The sheriff’s office determined that she was at fault for the crash.
In 2024, Winter stepped away from her legislative duties to get treatment for alcohol use disorder after she appeared intoxicated at a community meeting in Northglenn. It prompted a Senate Ethics Committee inquiry, and she was found to have failed chamber standards about promoting public integrity.
At her funeral earlier this month, loved ones remembered Winter as a champion for women interested in public service and elected office, as well as a committed mother to her two children.
A legislative vacancy committee will meet next week to determine who will replace Winter in Senate District 25.

(Pat Sutphin for the Idaho Capital Sun)Idaho’s DOGE Committee will recommend repealing Medicaid expansion and eventually eliminating the state funding for the Idaho Commission on Hispanic Affairs. 
Lawmakers on the task force, named for the now disbanded federal Department of Government Efficiency, met Friday for their last meeting before the 2026 legislative session convenes Jan. 12.  
The task force cannot pass legislation, only create recommendations for the rest of the Legislature to consider. Lawmakers are approaching the legislative session with a projected $40.3 million deficit for the fiscal year. 
 Many services are protected by law, Medicaid expansion targeted for repeal to cut costs

Taskforce member Rep. Heather Scott, R-Blanchard, said Friday that eliminating Medicaid expansion “seems like a simple no-brainer.” 
The program was approved via ballot initiative in 2018 to expand Medicaid eligibility to those who didn’t qualify for traditional Medicaid but didn’t earn enough to qualify for premium tax credits to be able to afford private insurance through the state health care marketplace. 
Task force members on Friday heard from Idaho Department of Health and Welfare Deputy Director of Medicaid Sasha O’Connell, who gave an overview of cost-cutting measures the agency has already taken in response to the projected deficit, including a 4% cut to the rate paid to physicians who provide care to Medicaid patients and the mental health service cuts done by private state contractor Magellan in November. 
She explained that under a combination of state and federal regulations, there are very few cost-cutting measures the health agency is able to do without some legislative changes. 
“I can tell you sincerely that we are doing everything that we can, but that we face several limitations,” O’Connell said, “and so when we cannot reduce rates, what that means is that we need to consider service cuts to attain those budget hold backs.” 
While a number of services are considered “optional” under federal regulations, such as home-and-community based services for people with disabilities, many of those services are protected in state law, O’Connell said. 
Medicaid expansion insures more than 85,000 Idahoans, as of numbers provided Dec. 12. The benefits under the program are 90% covered by the federal government, with the state paying the remaining 10%. 
The expansion program costs around $91.7 million in state general funds, O’Connell said. However, the program also partially funds other services, such as a portion of the state hospital funding and the home-and-community-based services through a tax on hospitals incurred based on the number of expansion patients that hospital services. 
If Medicaid expansion were repealed, State Hospital North and State Hospital South would lose nearly $28 million, she said, and home-and-community based services would lose $38.3 million.

Task force co-Chair Sen. Todd Lakey, R-Nampa, said he never supported Medicaid expansion and that the option should be “explored” by the House and Senate Health and Welfare committees, due to the “complexity of the issue.” 
Rep. Josh Tanner, R-Eagle, made a motion to recommend repeal of the program.
“It’s up to the germane committees on how they handle it, but I think our recommendation would be to repeal Medicaid expansion,” Tanner said.
Sen. Carl Bjerke, R-Coeur d’Alene, argued that expansion “wasn’t working.” 
“I want to do things that are actually going to support our constituents, actually provide access and provide better care. That’s what I want, and I don’t see that what we’ve done with the expanded Medicaid has done any of those things,” Bjerke said. 
The committee’s lone Democrat, Sen. Carrie Semmelroth of Boise, said she wasn’t sure the committee had enough information to determine if a repeal would “ensure fiscal responsibility.” She noted that prior to expansion, there was a catastrophic fund, to help cover costs to treat indigent patients but the fund was eliminated with the implementation of Medicaid expansion.
Rep. Dustin Manwaring, R-Pocatello, said he would be supportive of directing Health and Welfare to contain costs in Medicaid without fully recommending its repeal. 
“I don’t know if it’s an all-or-nothing,” Manwaring said. “There may be some other things we can do to contain costs without a full repeal of Medicaid expansion. So when we use that language, I think we’re painting a little bit too broadly.” 
Manwaring and Semmelroth were the only no votes on Tanner’s motion to recommend repeal.

 Committee considers removing state funding for Idaho Commission for Hispanic Affairs

Annette Tipton, executive director of the Idaho Commission for Hispanic Affairs, told task force members that the state office is “modest but mighty,” serving as a bridge between state government and the state’s Hispanic community. 
The general fund budget request for the commission is around $85,000 for fiscal year 2026, which would cover the only two full-time employees, the director and her administrative assistant. 
Lawmakers questioned why the state should be providing public money for the commission,

likening it to “DEI,” which stands for diversity, equity and inclusion. 
“How do you justify within a Hispanic Commission, a separate, specialized commission that’s doing something when, realistically, we are all Americans?” Tanner asked. “And that is what we should be working for, that is what we should be standing on and not to me, this more seems like a DEI type thing.” 
Tipton said that the commission was formed in the 1980s, when “DEI wasn’t even a thing.” She said the programs, such as the student leadership program, is open to all students and has shown a positive correlation with graduation rates and higher education enrollment rates. 
She said enrollment in that program is about half Hispanic and half non-Hispanic. 
“Everything this office has done has impacted not only our Hispanic population, but the population at large,” Tipton said.
Tanner and committee members expressed support for Tipton as the agency’s new director and the commission, but questioned if state funds should still be used.

The commission has also raised about another $85,000 in non-taxpayer dollars, Tipton said. 
Scott asked if the commission could do its work as a private nonprofit. 
Tipton said the success in fundraising and of the commission is largely in part because of its affiliation with the state government. 
“I believe that a lot of the success that we’ve had over the last three decades has been because we are associated with the state of Idaho,” Tipton said. “That state of Idaho reputation is invaluable.”
During public comment, Caldwell Police Chief, and immediate past president of the Idaho Police Chiefs Association, Rex Ingram spoke in support of the commission and its work. 
Ingram noted that nearly 14% of the state’s population is Hispanic and around 40% of Caldwell’s population is. He said effective policing in the state necessitates strong relationships and communication, including with the commission. He briefly noted the conversations around the Wilder raid, in which the FBI made around five arrests for illegal gambling and federal immigration authorities arrested more than 100 people who were at the horse track that day. 
“This is a critical flashpoint in time, in our country and in our state,” Ingram said, “Where we need to continue building these relationships to enhance that dialogue with a community that is a little bit broken right now. And so I would just say that, as a member of the (Idaho Police Chiefs Association) and the current chief of police, a lot of our issues stem from crimes involving underserved, underprivileged communities, and the Hispanic community is not immune to that.” 
Tanner made a motion to explore removing general funds from the commission in a phased approach. 
“I don’t know if it would be a one-year, a two-year or a three-year thing, but I think moving away from that and getting that organization to go back out into the community and raise its funds is an important message that we’re sending to the rest of the communities out there within the state of Idaho.” 
Tanner’s motion passed with only Semmelroth voting against it.

Ramsi Woodcock, the professor, filed the lawsuit in November, seeking to be returned to his teaching duties as a full-time tenured professor. His suit also challenges the use of a widespread but controversial definition of antisemitism in in university disciplinary actions and by the federal government. The definition was adopted by the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance’s (IHRA) in 2016.
UK administrators said they reassigned Woodcock from his teaching duties and began an investigation into his conduct last summer after learning of an online petition he circulated that called for military action against Israel. He was also barred from entering the UK College of Law building on the Lexington campus. 
U.S. District Judge Danny Reeves, who was appointed to the bench by President George W. Bush, heard testimony from Woodcock and two other UK employees. 
The immediate question before the judge is whether to return Woodcock to teaching next month when a new semester begins. Reeves said he became “more skeptical” after continuing to hear questions from Woodcock’s attorneys. At one point, the judge said Woodcock’s lawyers “haven’t shown me a nickel’s worth of harm” that has occurred to Woodcock amid his removal from the classroom. UK is continuing to pay Woodcock his salary and benefits.

After the hearing concluded, Woodcock said he was glad to have a chance to “tell my story” in court. 
UK spokesman Jay Blanton said in a statement to the Kentucky Lantern that Reeves had been “well prepared and asked thoughtful questions” throughout the hearing. 
“We were pleased to defend the university’s decisions to investigate Professor Woodcock and to reassign him during the investigations,” Blanton added.
UK is hoping to dismiss the case entirely. In documents it filed, the university said its investigation into accusations against Woodcock is still ongoing and it may take action in the matter in the future, whether it be returning him to the classroom or disciplinary action. 
UK sent Woodcock a notice of investigation in July after the administration became aware of the online petition and was told Woodcock spoke about genocide in Gaza at an academic conference and during another university’s panel discussion. Additionally, the letter alleged Woodcock “spammed” Listservs “with your personal viewpoints concerning the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.” The letter says four professors who said they heard him speak at academic conferences or were on the Listservs reported the statements. 
Later, UK sent an amended letter in September saying that four students “some of whom are Jewish” also notified UK that Woodcock in his official capacity was calling “for violence against Israel, the genocide of Israeli people who are predominantly Jewish, and the ultimate destruction of Israel.” One report alleged Woodcock made “anti-Semitic and anti-Israeli remarks during an optional lecture,” while another said he shouted “Free Palestine” while in a car with UK law students.
Kentucky professor’s lawsuit challenges Trump administration’s definition of antisemitism

Reeves asked if Woodcock had impeded the investigation by not cooperating with the university’s appointed investigator, Farnaz Farkish Thompson, a partner of McGuire Woods based in Richmond, Virginia. 
Woodcock was questioned by both sides about returning a university-issued laptop to UK amid the investigation. He said that he had not used the laptop for a few years because of technology issues with it and instead used a personal computer for academic work. When the university asked for the laptop back, he realized some personal files related to his family were on the device, and he wanted further clarification on the privacy of those files. 
Another issue raised during the hearing was Woodcock and his attorneys not responding to 40-some written questions posed by Thompson earlier this month. Bryan Beauman, one of UK’s attorneys, said that most of the questions posed by Woodcock’s counsel to him were similar to questions Thompson had asked. 
However, Woodcock’s attorneys have raised concerns about the ability of Thompson to be an unbiased investigator, and said so in a letter to her, as she was listed as a contributor to Project 2025, which was created as a guiding document for the Trump administration leading up to the 2024 presidential election. Among its goals for the U.S. presidency, the document calls for supporting Israel. 
Woodcock’s attorneys also called two witnesses to testify, the interim dean of the College of Law, James Duff, and Sarah Mudd, the executive director of the Office of Equal Opportunity and Title IX Coordinator at UK. 
Mudd’s testimony largely focused on when she learned of the investigation and its process. Duff became the interim dean of the college on July 1, shortly before UK announced its investigation of Woodcock. 
In answering questions from one of Woodcock’s attorneys, Gadeir Abbas of the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) Legal Defense Fund, Duff said it was “for Woodcock’s and students’ benefit” that administrators barred Woodcock from the law building pending the investigation, in case the allegations against him were proven true. Duff also said it was a “collaborative process” to begin the investigation into Woodcock, involving the university’s general counsel, Provost Robert DiPaola and President Eli Capilouto. 
Besides the immediate question of returning Woodcock to classes for the spring semester, the lawsuit questions the use of the IHRA’s definition of antisemitism in university policies and laws. 
Under a Kentucky resolution enacted by the legislature and signed by Gov. Andy Beshear earlier this year, Kentucky’s public universities and colleges must employ the IHRA definition by January in policies “to combat antisemitism.” 
Woodcock is also asking Reeves to order U.S. Secretary of Education Linda McMahon “to refrain from requiring or using the IHRA definition of antisemitism in enforcing Title VI.” Title VI of the 1964 Civil Rights Act prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color or national origin as a condition of receiving federal funding.
Critics, including the American Civil Liberties Union, say the definition conflates antisemitism with criticism of Israel, leading to unconstitutional violations of free speech rights. The definition’s author has said it should not be used to “sacrifice free speech.”
Ahead of Friday’s hearing, Republican Attorney General Russell Coleman’s office filed a motion to intervene in the case on behalf of the state to defend the new law on antisemitism and higher education.

Roughly 50 people bought a $2.97 ice scraper and promptly walked to the other side of the store to return it in an effort to stall the store’s operations. Organizers with ICE Out of New Jersey said the purchase symbolizes that people want to “scrape ICE” out of the Garden State.
Ana Paola Pazmiño, executive director of Resistencia en Accion, said the message is “loud and clear.”
“If ICE doesn’t have a warrant, they should not arrest anyone in stores and in the parking lots. We want Home Depot to do something, to pass a policy, to say something,” she said.

Similar protests clogging store checkouts have popped up in Los Angeles and New York City to denounce immigration action at Home Depot locations.
A Home Depot spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment. The retailer has said it does not coordinate with federal immigration agents.
“We aren’t involved in ICE activities, and we aren’t notified when they are going to happen. We’re required to follow all federal and local rules and regulations in every market where we operate,” it said in a social media post last month.
For years, day laborers have gathered at hardware stores looking for jobs or to buy materials for work. But these locations have now become hot spots for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents to arrest and detain migrants without working papers. 
A contractor who was buying building materials was followed out of the Ewing Home Depot on Dec. 7, pulled over, and detained by federal immigration authorities about a block away from the store, said Pazmiño. 
A manager at the Ewing Home Depot told protestors on Friday that he wouldn’t kick people out as long as they were buying or returning items and weren’t being disruptive with other customers. He declined to comment further.

Police showed up to the demonstration as protestors urged shoppers to boycott the retailer. Officers eventually urged protestors to leave the property, and, while walking to their cars, the demonstrators sang chants to the tune of “Feliz Navidad.”
“We don’t want no more deportations, we don’t want no more deportations, we don’t want no more deportations in Home Depot parking lots,” they sang.

(Keila Szpaller/The Daily Montanan)Hamilton Sen. Jason Ellsworth will be charged with misdemeanor official misconduct stemming from a $170,000 contract he procured for a friend and business associate in his final days as Senate President, according to the Montana Department of Justice. 
Prosecutors in the Montana Attorney General’s office filed the misconduct charges against the Republican lawmaker on Thursday, alleging he acted outside of his lawful authority and requesting the court suspend him from office pending final judgement. 
“Ellsworth violated the ethics rules governing the use of public funds by obtaining services over $100,000 with the State of Montana without advertising, entertaining open bids, and having it reviewed by the Department of Administration before the contract was secured,” the DOJ said in a press release. 
Ellsworth’s actions late last year were first reported by the Montana State News Bureau in the early days of the 2025 legislative session and became a dominant narrative throughout lawmakers’ time in Helena. 
Ellsworth was part of a minority group of moderate Republicans that repeatedly upended Republican leadership throughout the session, leading to calls to oust him and his peers from the party and leading to accusations that Democrats were protecting him during investigations into his misconduct to push through their agenda.  
Ellsworth could not be reached by phone or text on Friday but maintained throughout the legislative session that he hadn’t done anything wrong. 
The charges filed by DOJ stem from a Senate vote in February to temporarily suspend an in-house ethics investigation and refer the matter to the Department of Justice, a chaotic move that displayed the division between Senate Republicans and showed the power wielded by a Democratic minority.
While Ellsworth was ultimately punished by the state Senate, the justice department hadn’t issued any updates on their investigation until this week. 
In the filing, attorneys with the AG’s office ask Lewis and Clark District Court to suspend Ellsworth from office without pay, and allege he committed official misconduct, a charge that could lead to a $500 fine or six months of jail time. Ellsworth is termed out of the Senate, and will not run for re-election next year, and was suspended from any interim committee assignments earlier this year.

 Ellsworth’s road to court

During the waning days of the previous legislative interim, Ellsworth served as head of the Committee on Judicial Oversight and Reform, which proposed a series of bills aimed at changing aspects of the state’s judicial system. 
Ellsworth had asked the committee to hire an outside consultant to conduct an analysis of the committee’s 27 bills and assess their effectiveness. The committee rejected the idea, but Ellsworth signed a contract with Bryce Eggleston of Agile Analytics, someone he has “close financial and business ties” with, according to court filings.
Ellsworth and Eggleston also signed two separate but nearly identical contracts, splitting the bills to be assessed between them and keeping the dollar amount under $100,000 — a move that avoided scrutiny under the state procurement process. 
While the Department of Administration ultimately signed off on the contracts, when they came to light and drew questions from lawmakers, Ellsworth moved to cancel the contracts despite maintaining he had done nothing wrong.
A multi-week investigation by the Senate Ethics Committee led to several votes in the Senate to expel Ellsworth, which failed, and a final vote to remove him from all standing and interim committees and cut off his access to the Senate floor and legislative spaces. 
This week’s filings revived accusations of partisanship and politicking during the session from lawmakers in leadership positions. 
Senate President Matt Regier, a Republican, accused moderate Republicans and Democrats of blocking the vote to remove Ellsworth from office. 
“I am once again grateful to the bipartisan majority of the Senate who voted to uphold the integrity of the legislature and remove Jason Ellsworth from office, even though we fell short of the two-thirds threshold needed to remove him,” Regier said in a statement.” The only reason Ellsworth is still a state senator is because most Democrats and nine Republicans, including Sen. Shelley Vance (R, Belgrade) and Sen. Wendy McKamey (R, Cascade/Great Falls), voted three different times to keep him in office instead of removing him for his years-long pattern of unethical and potentially criminal activity. I applaud Attorney General Austin Knudsen for taking corruption in government seriously.”
But minority leader Sen. Pat Flowers said the charges show that the Senate vote to refer the criminal investigation to the DOJ was the right action. 
Flowers led the move in February to temporarily suspend the ethics investigation into Ellsworth and refer the matter to the DOJ, a move that Republican leaders in the Senate said was aimed at protecting the minority’s agenda. 
Ellsworth and eight fellow Republican senators had continually joined the Democratic minority in blocking priorities of the more conservative Republican majority. 
At the time, Flowers had said the internal investigation had become too distracting to the Senate’s work, and taking it to an outside entity would help take the politics out of the issue. 
The filed charges “support our original assessment that there were pieces of the charges from the Legislative Auditor that were criminal, and there were some more ethical considerations,” Flowers to the Daily Montanan on Friday. “It made sense for us at the time to segment those out and send the criminal stuff to the attorney general …I think shows we had good instincts on our part.”
“We work for the people and we answer to the people, ultimately, and I think this reinforces that the voters should expect transparency and accountability, and they’ll get that from us as legislators and from the Department of Justice,” Flower added.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Ellsworth-4-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-19 17:58:59.475544

(Kansas Reflector screen capture from KU Health System on Facebook)TOPEKA — A Kansas school district dismissed classes on Monday three days earlier than planned after reporting a “tremendous amount of sickness” that appeared to be spreading at a high rate. 
Dexter Schools, USD 471 in Cowley County, announced in a Facebook post that it would cancel school and all activities starting Tuesday. The second quarter was supposed to end Thursday. 
“Not only are we concerned with student and staff sickness, now we don’t want to continue to spread the sickness and end up with students taking it to their extended families (grandma and grandpa) over the holiday break,” the post said.
The Kansas database tracking influenza, COVID-19 and other respiratory infection visits to hospital emergency departments did not show a big jumpover the past few weeks, but there was an uptick.
Dana Hawkinson, medical director of infection prevention and control for the University of Kansas Health System, said the state trends for influenza match what has happened in the last two to three years. 
“The overall trends of the influenza activity, as well as with RSV (respiratory syncytial virus) and COVID, right now continues to be low, but it is increasing,” Hawkinson said. “It has been increasing over the past couple of weeks, so we are seeing more testing and more percentage of positive tests as well. This is nationally, but also at our institution as well.”
The school district’s post didn’t specify what type of illness was going around and Kansas Reflector’s call to the district office Friday went unanswered. Hawkinson said rhinovirus has been more prevalent so far this season, with more cases than COVID-19, influenza or RSV. 
Rhinovirus is a virus that causes the common cold, and it can cause complications for people with conditions like asthma and other underlying medical issues, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 
As flu season moves forward, Hawkinson encouraged people to get flu, COVID-19, RSV and other appropriate vaccines. 
The flu vaccine each year is developed in the spring months, using data from countries in the Southern hemisphere during the winter months to extrapolate which viruses could be prominent in the United States, Hawkinson said. 
It can take months for production to occur, and, occasionally, researchers will discover they excluded a predominant virus from the shot, he said. Typically, the shot includes three to four different viruses. 
This year, the CDC reported that an influenza A variant, referred to as subclade K, is making the rounds this year, and some media have called it a “super flu.” 
Hawkinson said variants are a consistent part of the influenza season and vaccines help.
Vaccines may not stop someone from getting the flu, but data shows people will experience a  reduction in the severity of symptoms and decreased the risk of going to the hospital, he said. 
“The vaccine is to protect you and build up your immune system so that when you do get infected, you have that immunity there to help fight off the virus,” Hawkinson said. 
The influenza vaccine is not a live virus, so it will not cause illness in anyone who gets it, he said.
Already this flu season, two children have died from influenza-associated illness nationally, the CDC reported.  
Vaccines for flu, COVID-19 and RSV are important tools to fight the annual spike of viruses and stop the spread, Hawkinson said. 
The mRNA vaccine for COVID-19 is safe, he added, and three recent studies underlined that it is effective.  One study of young people who contracted COVID-19 infections showed the vaccine reduced by 75% the risk of going to the hospital or an emergency room. 
Another large study conducted over four years in France showed the COVID-19 vaccine reduced risk of death from severe COVID and also reduced death from all causes, Hawkinson said.
A third study showed that pregnant mothers who got the COVID-19 vaccine were less likely to go to the hospital, experience severe illness or be placed in intensive care if they contracted COVID-19, Hawkinson said. They also were at a lower risk of having a preterm birth, he said.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Screenshot-1185-1024x689.png,,,2025-12-19 17:58:59.475544

“We're able to really just provide this amazing opportunity for these individuals that are looking to just make a change in their life,” said a Valley Vista vice president.

On Wednesday, Valley Vista reopened the doors of its previously shuttered Vergennes facility and nearly doubled the state’s capacity for low-level substance use residential treatment services. 
The 27 new beds at the Vergennes location will offer less-intensive treatment for people who do not need around-the clock medical monitoring. These lower level services include recovery-focused counseling, peer support services, and aid to find housing and employment, Valley Vista’s Vice President of Medical and Clinical Services, Kevin Hamel, said.
Advocates have long identified a critical void of resources for people exiting inpatient treatment that need more support before returning to independent living to prevent relapse.

Already, Valley Vista has filled seven of the 27 beds at the co-ed Vergennes facility and added 13 new staff positions to operate the facility, Hamel said. There is no time limit on stays at the Vergennes facility so that people have time to build a foundation of support before moving to a sober living community or independent living, he added. 
“It’s really about giving them additional treatment towards addiction, while helping them to kind of just navigate the next steps of their life, and helping them to reintegrate into the community,” Hamel said.
Facing financial hardship, Valley Vista closed its Vergennes women’s facility in the spring of this year and consolidated services to its Bradford location, cutting 20 staff positions. The organization had stopped accepting methadone patients several months earlier because of the high costs of treatment. 
When the Vergennes location closed, Valley Vista’s co-owner said he recognized the potential of re-opening the facility for “step-down” services. 
Valley Vista still maintained a lease on the Vergennes property, so the Vermont Department of Health saw an opportunity to fill vacant space and expand Vermont’s recovery support infrastructure, Kelly Dougherty, Vermont’s deputy health commissioner, said. 
The Department of Health made offering both high and low-level recovery services a requirement for residential treatment organizations to receive grants this fall, Dougherty said. 
“We really wanted under the same sort of organizational umbrella — if possible — for people to be able to seamlessly step down to this lower level of care if they were receiving services in the higher level of care,” Dougherty said.
Valley Vista had been offering some low-level care at the Bradford location since October, but opening the Vergennes facility means that the organization has dedicated beds and space for people needing a lower level of treatment, Hamel said. 
Recovery House Inc. in Rutland County is the only other organization the state works with that provides residential treatment and has 28 beds for low-level recovery, said Dougherty.
To support the Vergennes facility’s reopening, Dougherty said the state directed $500,000 to Valley Vista through a federal Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration block grant for site set up and room and board payment. 
The state is also now covering lower-intensity substance use treatment under Medicaid at a higher reimbursement rate, said Dougherty, and allotted $500,000 toward Valley Vista’s Medicaid reimbursement for services and beds. 
Dougherty said that the state plans to track utilization patterns of the Vergennes facility before any plans to roll out more low-level residential treatment beds. But, she said the Department of Health is working with partners to address the continued gap in residential housing for sober-living communities.
The state’s partnership and local support has been valuable in reopening Valley Vista’s Vergennes location and expanding services to support the continuation of care in the state, Hamel said.
“We’re working within our community and with our allies to make sure that we’re able to really just provide this amazing opportunity for these individuals that are looking to just make a change in their life,” Hamel said.

(Photo by Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)ERIE — The trial of former Neosho County prosecutor Linus Thuston ended this week when jurors couldn’t agree on whether he had lied under oath about meeting secretly with off-the-books confidential informants.
Thuston faced felony charges of perjury and misdemeanor charges of witness intimidation in the case. Brandon Bell, a Lawrence attorney, did not disclose if he would seek a retrial. Bell didn’t return a phone call from Kansas Reflector.
The trial began Monday with jury selection in Erie, a town in Neosho County with a population of about 1,000 people. A handful of prospective jurors reacted in surprise when they learned Thuston would be the defendant.
Many of the prospective jurors said they knew Thuston personally. They had socialized with him, knew his son, lived next to him, taught him in high school, or had family members who had either received legal services from or been prosecuted by Thuston.
A woman said she harbored ill feelings because Thuston had refused to prosecute her abusive husband. The judge excused her from service and told her she was welcome to stay or leave.
“I don’t want to be in the same room,” she said as she headed to the door.
A man said he held a grudge because Thuston had called his wife “the worst teacher he ever had.” He was also free to go.
But most jurors asserted their ability to make a decision based solely on the facts presented in court, setting aside their personal experience or what they had read in news coverage.
Bell, the special prosecutor, asked if they knew someone who thinks they can talk their way out of anything.
“This case,” he said in opening arguments, “is about trying to lie your way out of trouble.”
Thuston is from Neosho County and has practiced law in the area for more than 30 years. He held the elected position of county attorney from 1996-2000 and again from 2012-2024. He retired last year, shortly before pleading guilty to minor financial crimes.
For years, he was surrounded by controversy. There were concerns about his willingness to hand out diversions for serious crimes, including in child sex cases, and a lack of accounting for how he used the diversion money. The sheriff reported that Thuston sexually extorted about 50 women into providing nude photos in exchange for legal services through his private practice. Thuston also prosecuted about a third of the women, the sheriff said. In 2022 and 2024, Thuston received minor disciplinary action from a state panel for ethics violations involving a conflict of interest and telling a woman she owed him oral sex.
None of those concerns resulted in criminal charges.
Instead, it was his testimony in a drug case last summer that landed him in legal trouble.
The trouble, as Bell put it, began on July 25, 2023, when Thuston went alone to meet a woman in her car. The woman then began sharing information with others about police activity and pending drug busts. Police believed Thuston had shared the confidential information with her.
Thuston offered a different explanation under oath.
“When the defendant is asked, ‘What is going on with you and this woman in this car, and then information starts getting out about confidential investigative information,’ the defendant claims, ‘I was meeting this woman as a confidential informant,’ ” Bell said.
Under scrutiny from attorneys, Thuston claimed to frequently meet with off-the-books confidential informants. When pressed, he identified several men he had met with alone to gather information. He claimed information from two of the men led to the arrest and conviction of a drug dealer.
“That’s not the end of the story, though,” Bell said.
He said Thuston “tried to get ahead of it.” He said Thuston called two of the men he had named and tried to convince them they had been an informant. Alarmed, one of the men called the sheriff’s office, which then opened an investigation.
“Honestly, if the defendant hadn’t made those phone calls, we probably wouldn’t be here,” Bell said.
According to a charging affidavit, which was made public over Thuston’s objections after Kansas Reflector petitioned the court for its release, all of the men Thuston named while under oath denied ever being an informant for Thuston.
“The defendant had a choice, and intentionally chose to lie,” Bell said.
Robert Myers, a defense attorney from Columbus, represented Thuston in this week’s trial. Myers asked the jury pool to consider whether they had ever had a conversation with someone — such as a spouse — who maybe remembered things a little bit differently than they did.
Myers offered a one-minute response to Bell’s opening remarks.
“You need to listen to the details of those witnesses and what’s actually said, not how it’s interpreted, not how I perceived it, but what actually transpired,” Myers said.
Michael Hole, who lives in Chanute, testified Monday that Thuston falsely identified him as an informant.
Hole lived next-door to a suspected drug dealer. He said Thuston approached him during an Easter egg hunt and asked if he would testify against his neighbor.
“I told him, not no, but f*** no,” Hole said.
Hole said Thuston had sent him to prison about 25 years ago, and that he doesn’t talk to cops.
“I said, ‘Dude, I’m not going to testify. I don’t give a f***,” Hole said.

The prominent Laramie County Republican has worked in Wyoming politics for more than four decades. She will finish her first term in the U.S. Senate in 2026 and isn’t up for another go-around, she said in the announcement.
“In the difficult, exhausting session weeks this fall I’ve come to accept that I do not have six more years in me,” Lummis, 71, said. “I am a devout legislator, but I feel like a sprinter in a marathon. The energy required doesn’t match up.”
The move opens a coveted slot in Wyoming politics and could impact which Republicans run for downballot races. Another seat without an incumbent in 2026 is governor, as Mark Gordon has already served two terms. 
State Sen. Eric Barlow, R-Gillette, announced his bid for governor in August. Several other notable Wyoming politicians have either expressed an interest in running for governor or are rumored to be mulling the possibility. They include U.S. Rep. Harriet Hageman, who sought the job in 2018, Secretary of State Chuck Gray, Senate President Bo Biteman and Speaker of the House Chip Neiman. Brent Bien and Joseph Kibler are also candidates. All are Republicans. 
With the Senate seat newly open, it’s not clear if any of them will now consider a congressional bid. 
Pioneering pol
When Lummis won a seat in the Wyoming House of Representatives in 1979, she became the youngest woman to be elected to the Legislature. She served 14 years in the body as both representative and senator. 
Along with managing gubernatorial campaigns, Lummis also worked in executive branch roles, including director of State Lands and Investments and state treasurer. 
She moved to the U.S. Congress in 2009 when she was elected as Wyoming’s lone representative, succeeding Republican Barbara Cubin. In that role, she co-founded the House Freedom Caucus. When she was elected to the U.S. Senate in 2020, she became the first woman to represent Wyoming in the body.

As a lawmaker, Lummis championed cryptocurrency, limited government and American energy dominance, strongly advocating for Wyoming’s extraction industries. She has consistently sided with President Donald Trump on policy matters. 
Lummis has “served Wyoming with integrity, independence and unwavering dedication,” Rep. Hageman posted Friday on X. “From the ranch to the halls of Congress, she built one of the most distinguished careers in our state’s history, strengthening both Wyoming and [the] nation through her service.”
Wyoming’s other U.S. Sen., John Barrasso, also praised Lummis as a “straight shooter and a trailblazer.
“From Miss Frontier Days to the Wyoming Legislature to the U.S. House of Representatives and the U.S. Senate – Cynthia has never stopped fighting for the people of Wyoming,” Barrasso said in a statement. 
Change of heart
In March, Trump endorsed Lummis for reelection, which suggested she would run again.

In her Friday statement, Lummis confirmed that deciding to retire represents a change of heart. She thanked colleagues like Hageman along with Wyoming and Trump.
“I am honored to have earned the support of President Trump and to have the opportunity to work side by side with him to fight for the people of Wyoming,” Lummis said. “I look forward to continuing this partnership and throwing all my energy into bringing important legislation to his desk in 2026 and into retaining commonsense Republican control of the U.S. Senate.

Academic work and hands-on training will be included in the program, the release stated, focused on the cores of advocacy, employment, disability, business and working with people. The degree program will train students to be able to gain employment at agencies handling community rehabilitation or mental health, government programs, school systems and corporate human resources branches.
With both full-time and part-time paths to the degree available, the release stated students can also select “emphasis areas” to tailor their program, in topics including advocacy, counseling, deaf culture, human resources, leadership and youth services.
Students hoping to further their education after earning their degree can specialize in school counseling, rehabilitation counseling or clinical mental health counseling and forge a “strong pathway” into graduate programs in areas like occupational therapy or counseling, the release stated.
If a student wants to join a “state vocational rehabilitation or nonprofit agency” once they’ve earned their degree, they can apply to receive as much as $10,000 in “additional scholarship funds.” Money for the scholarships comes from a Rehabilitation Services Administration grant, the release stated.
“Every state in the country has a critical workforce need for rehabilitation professionals, and this program offers the flexibility to customize a student’s emphasis in pursuit of any number of highly in-demand careers,” said Matt Bruinekool, director of the National Rehabilitation Institute at Drake University, in the release.

BURLINGTON — An Afghan man held for 105 days without access to counsel or family was released Friday after a federal judge granted bond.
A long-haul truck driver living in Oregon, Enayetullah Walizada, 29, had been transporting food from Vermont to California when he inadvertently took a wrong turn that led him out of the United States and into a Canada border crossing. He was detained Sept. 5.
U.S. District Court Judge Christina Reiss ordered Walizada’s release on his own recognizance, finding no evidence of him being a flight risk or a danger to himself or the public.
“This is great. He’s free. He can go home,” said Nathan Virag, an immigration lawyer at the Association of Africans Living in Vermont.
Virag had filed a habeas petition in federal court soon after Walizada’s detention in September challenging the legality of his detention and represented him in court Friday.
This is the first time a federal judge in Vermont has held a bond hearing for an ICE detainee, which is typically held in immigration court, said Emma Matters, a staff attorney at the Vermont Asylum Assistance Project, which offers legal support to immigrants.
Given the backlog of cases in immigration court and the escalated crackdown on refugees, filing the habeas in federal court is a tool to fight back against prolonged and unlawful detentions like Walizada’s, she added.

The judge’s decision “protects him against further violations of his Fifth Amendment rights. So they can’t just pick him up at any time of day and re-detain him,” she said. It would not, however, protect him from being removed during the asylum process he is waiting on. 
Walizada is among the 200,000 Afghans resettled in the United States through military efforts “Operation Allies Welcome” and “Operation Allies Refuge” after the fall of Kabul in 2021, Virag said in court. The lawyer said Walizada has employment authorization, a pending asylum case and no known criminal history.
On Sept. 5, Walizada was following Google Maps directions when he inadvertently crossed the U.S.-Canda border. When he tried to re-enter the U.S. at Derby Line in Vermont, he was detained by the Canada Border Services Agency, according to court documents. William West, a supervisory U.S. Customs and Border Protection officer, said he did not have a passport on him, his parole had expired and he “did not have any lawful status to be in the United States.”
He was subsequently held at the port of entry for six days before being transferred to the Northwest State Correctional Facility in St. Albans, Vermont, court documents state. 
Walizada’s lawsuit challenged the lack of due process and sought immediate release from the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement custody.
Federal respondents claim that Walizada signed a notice that placed him in “full removal proceedings.” 
An immigration court hearing is scheduled for Dec. 30, according to Matthew Greer, assistant U.S. Attorney.
The court decision comes in the wake of the Trump administration pausing all asylum decisions after an Afghan national was charged with the deadly shooting of a National Guard member in Washington D.C. last month. He has since pleaded not guilty.
Immigration advocates are concerned about the administration’s recent crackdown on legal immigration and particularly of Afghans resettled in the U.S.
Walizada said in the lawsuit he was not allowed access to legal help for the first seven days of his detention despite his counsel’s “repeated attempts to contact him during this time.”
On a rainy Friday afternoon, he stepped out of the courthouse all smiles, and made his first phone call to his wife in Afghanistan.

State inspectors allege that in September, a Walmart gift card belonging to a resident of REM Iowa’s care facility on 33rd Avenue in Cedar Rapids was found to have been “spent fraudulently and no receipts could be located.”
Also that month, it was determined that at least four McDonald’s gift cards belonging to a different resident had also been spent fraudulently. The inspectors later determined the facility’s program supervisor had kept resident gift cards inside an unlocked cabinet within an unlocked office during the months of June, July and August, 2025.

Previously, the office and cabinet were locked, but the program supervisor stopped locking them once it “became too much of a hassle,” inspectors reported.
The facility was cited for failing to ensure all allegations of abuse, neglect and exploitation were reported to the Iowa Department of Inspections, Appeals and Licensing in a timely manner and was fined $500.
Other Iowa care facilities fined recently by the inspections department include:
— REM Iowa-Birch Cottage in Shelby was fined $500 for failing to provide nursing interventions to meet a resident’s needs after a 44-year-old male resident of the home died due to a bowel obstruction that contributed to acute respiratory failure. According to inspectors’ reports, the man was breathing heavily the morning of Sept. 19, 2025, and at one point began convulsing and having seizures.
An ambulance was summoned at which point, inspectors said, the resident “acted normal, answered questions, and jumped up from the chair onto the cot” to be taken to a hospital. While at the hospital, the man’s heart stopped and he was pronounced dead at 10:40 a.m., about two hours after the incident at REM Iowa-Birch Cottage.
 — Stratford Specialty Care in Hamilton County was fined $500 for improper use of physical restraints. The incident involved a nurse who had placed two dining room chairs behind the wheelchair of a male resident as he sat in a common area so he couldn’t move or tip the wheelchair backward. The facility was cited for failing to report the matter in a timely fashion and failing to immediately separate the nurse, who was later suspended, from the resident.
— Sunrise Hill Care Center in Traer was fined $500 for failing to conduct a timely employee background check for any findings of abuse or criminal convictions. Inspectors alleged an employee of the home underwent a background check in January 2025, but wasn’t hired until mid-April of 2025. By law, background checks are to be performed within 30 days of an individual being hired.

Cody Roberts’ attorney contends state statutes ‘could not be clearer and more precise’ and that hunting and ‘capture’ of predators like wolves is legal ‘in any manner.’ 
The post Wolf captor wants judge to toss case as Congress mulls ban on striking wildlife with snowmobiles appeared first on WyoFile .","Cody Roberts, the man who brought an injured wolf into a bar and posed for photos with the muzzled animal, should have his felony animal cruelty charges dismissed instead of having to stand trial, his attorney argued in new court documents.
Robert’s legal counsel, Robert Piper, made that request Friday while filing an amended motion to dismiss the indictment against his client. The seven-page legal document makes the case that Wyoming carved out an exemption in its animal cruelty laws for animals classified as predators, such as wolves. 
The statutes, Piper wrote, “could not be clearer and more precise.” After enacting animal cruelty laws, the Wyoming Legislature “likely” realized that “such a broad prohibition would impact animal husbandry and agriculture throughout the State.”
Then state lawmakers added a “specific, clearly enumerated exception,”  establishing that “[n]othing in this article may be construed to prohibit…[t]he hunting, capture, killing or destruction of any predatory animal, pest or other wildlife in any manner not otherwise prohibited by law.”
Piper, who did not respond to an interview request, added emphasis to the words “hunting, capture” and “in any matter.”

The legal argument Robert’s attorney makes was posed earlier by the Wyoming Game and Fish Department, which stated that “animal cruelty laws … do not apply to predatory animals” in an April 2024 press release. The state agency’s initial response to the incident provoked widespread outrage. Wardens fined Roberts $250 for possession of warm-blooded wildlife instead of forcing him to make a mandatory court appearance and face possible stiffer penalties.
Sublette County Prosecuting Attorney Clayton Melinkovich disagreed with wildlife officials’ interpretation of state law. In July, he convened a grand jury. A month later, that 12-person panel indicted the Daniel resident on a charge of felony cruelty to animals, a crime that could put him in prison for up to two years.
Melinkovich declined an interview for this story, but the county attorney confirmed that he will respond to Piper’s motion to dismiss charges.

Sweetwater County District Court Judge Richard Lavery has scheduled a Jan. 28 hearing to consider the matter. If the case proceeds, Roberts, who pleaded not guilty, is set for a March trial. 
Developments in the legal case against Roberts aren’t the only reason he’s been in the news this week. 
The tactic Roberts allegedly used to acquire the wolf — running it down and striking it with a snowmobile in an act sometimes called “wacking” — is again coming under fire from federal lawmakers. Although prohibitions on the Wyoming recreational tradition have been attempted on the state level several times, lawmakers have not had an appetite for bringing an end to a practice that some members of the livestock industry say they need to pursue predators. 

Running down coyotes and other predators with snowmobiles is a common and accepted enough activity in Sublette County that a resident once made and marketed apparel celebrating the tactic. (Screenshot from Instagram)

Out-of-state members of Congress have also taken on the issue. In September 2024, Rep. Nancy Mace, R-South Carolina, was the lead author of a bill dubbed the Snowmobiles Aren’t Weapons Act. 
Wyoming’s delegation, including U.S. Sen. Cynthia Lummis, opposed Mace’s bill. “With all due respect to my southern colleagues, we do not need members from districts that do not even drive snowmobiles trying to regulate our western way of life,” Lummis said at the time.
Although the Snowmobiles Aren’t Weapons Act died last Congress, a bipartisan group of federal lawmakers on Thursday introduced a bill of the same name establishing penalties for “any person who intentionally uses a motor vehicle to harass, pursue, hunt, shoot, wound, kill, trap, capture or collect a mammalian predator species on Federal land.” 
“Using motor vehicles as weapons against wildlife has no place on our federal lands,” U.S. Rep. Mike Lawler, a New York Republican, said in a statement. “This legislation makes clear that intentionally harassing, hunting, or killing animals with motor vehicles is unacceptable and will be met with serious consequences.”
In a November court filing, Piper suggested that Roberts may attempt to distance himself from the brutal form of hunting that members of Congress now target. “In fact, the Defendant anticipates that one or more witnesses of the State may offer testimony that the said grey wolf was not struck with a snowmobile,” the attorney wrote.

Tyrone Broomfield (center) looks through paperwork during a July 26, 2024 Board of Corrections meeting in North Little Rock. (Mary Hennigan/Arkansas Advocate) Arkansas inmates will no longer receive books, newspapers or magazines directly under a new policy approved by the Board of Corrections Friday.
The Arkansas Board of Corrections approved the change, which a Department of Corrections spokesperson said takes effect on Feb. 1. Prison officials said the restriction was needed in order to tamp down on contraband being smuggled into prisons.
Critics say such restrictions, however, severely limit access for people in prison to reading materials since the offerings in prison libraries and on prison-issued tablets can be limited or outdated.
The board approved the policy with no audible dissent.
Arkansas prisons already banned certain materials. Books with a map of the state or with the word “escape” in the title are prohibited, according to a Freedom of Information Act request the Arkansas Advocate filed earlier this year, and prison libraries are also prohibited from having physical magazines or newspapers.
Donations of books by nonprofit groups or local libraries to prison libraries will still be allowed under the new policy, according to Department of Corrections spokesperson Rand Champion. The new policy only restricts how books are brought into the prisons, without banning physical media outright.
BOC Chairman Benny Magness said the change was necessary to prevent drugs and other contraband from making its way into prisons during the meeting. “K2 is killing our inmates,” he said.
Division of Correction Director Dexter Payne said 50,000 books were available via the tablets. Almost all people housed in ADC facilities have a tablet — only those in “punitive isolation” do not.
Board member Lona McCastlain expressed concerns about continuing to ensure people in prison have access to the books they wish to read, saying it was important the board emphasized books would still be available.
“They can’t be brought in by Joe Blow off the street. We can get them. As long as they’re available, they’re not banned,” she said.
The American Civil Liberties Union of Arkansas criticized the move.
“This is an unnecessary and dramatic restriction on prisoners and their rights,” said Holly Dickson, ACLU of Arkansas executive director. “Rather than restricting rights to cut costs, and exacerbating the overcrowding crisis, Arkansas needs to ensure we have sufficient staff and funding to provide constitutional conditions and care for all who are imprisoned.”
This is not the first time Arkansas has restricted how those in prison obtain books. According to NPR, Arkansas was one of a number of states that prohibited nonprofits from sending books to people in prison who had requested a specific title, only allowing the organizations to donate books to prison libraries.
Prison-issued tablets often do not bridge the gap when access to physical books is curtailed, according to the Prison Policy Initiative, a nonprofit dedicated to “exposing the broader harm of mass incarceration.”
“Prisons often claim that the addition of tablets behind bars will increase access to books, despite other book bans they have implemented,” the organization said on its website. “Unfortunately, though, because of limited and outdated ebook selections, tablets are not living up to their potential and likely aren’t even filling the emerging book-gap.”
The Department of Corrections does not have a list of books available on its Securus tablets on its website, so it is unclear how up-to-date its book offerings are.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-12-19 22:15:00+00:00,CT Mirror,CT bear management listening tour draws ‘passionate’ responses,Chris Polansky | Connecticut Public,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/12/19/ct-bear-management-listening-tour-draws-passionate-responses/,The Department of Energy and Environmental Protection says a series of listening sessions yielded productive feedback from residents.,"The Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection (DEEP) says a series of listening sessions on bear management yielded productive feedback from residents on how to live with the animals.
“No one has the same two experiences with bears,” said DEEP Deputy Commissioner Mason Trumble following the final stop on the listening tour.
“Certainly bears bring out passionate ideas from many different folks, and we saw that in many of these listening sessions,” Trumble said. “However, I think by and large the comments were respectful. I think folks were appreciative of the chance to engage with us on the issue, and, quite frankly, we were appreciative to hear from a wide variety of folks as well, which we think will ultimately help us serve the people of Connecticut better.”
The four town hall-style listening sessions were held in Burlington, Derby, Sharon, and West Hartford. The sessions come amid a rise in human-bear conflicts and bear home entries across Connecticut.
At the West Hartford event, held Tuesday at the Elmwood Community Center, many of the roughly 100 attendees expressed a desire to coexist peacefully with bears.
Johnathan Hayhow of Vernon is a deaf hunter who said he sees more bears than deer when he is out in the woods. He said that sometimes they will walk right up next to him, showing no fear of humans. DEEP hosted a listening session in West Hartford on December 16, 2025 to receive resident feedback about their experiences with bears in the area. Credit: Tyler Russell / Connecticut Public
“I just want to protect the bears, really,” said Kathy Arky of West Hartford, who attended the forum wearing a shirt with black bears on it. “I just love them so much. I should be afraid of them, [but] I’m not afraid of them. I’ve had many encounters with them.”
Arky said she believes the solution is in communication and education. Her ideas include early childhood education on how to remain bear-safe and pamphlets to be handed out to new residents moving into towns with active bear populations. Arky said her neighborhood has a text chain they use to share bear sightings.
Others in attendance advocated for a hunt. Connecticut and Rhode Island are the only New England states without legal bear hunting.
Mark Salinas of Harwinton said he raises goats and chickens. He said bears go after his livestock and damage his fences, at great expense to him. He believes a legalized hunt would help keep the bear population in check and reduce human-bear conflicts.
“As it stands under current law, the bear population is just going to keep rising, and that probability for me gets worse and worse and worse,” Salinas said. “And I’m paying for the privilege so that no one else – you saw the emotions, they run high – but I am paying to assuage everyone else’s emotions, and so are my neighbors.”
According to DEEP, human-bear conflicts and bear home entries are far more common in Connecticut than in any other Northeast state. According to the agency’s 2025 State of the Bears report, “Massachusetts has more than two times the number of bears Connecticut does, yet Connecticut has a much higher number of reported conflicts.” In 2023, Massachusetts had 645 conflicts; Connecticut had 3,093.
DEEP supports the introduction of a hunt, though bills proposing one have not passed in the Connecticut General Assembly.
The agency says state residents should “be bear aware” by taking steps like using bear-resistant trash cans, removing bird feeders, using electric fencing, and scaring away bears loitering around your home.
“Our goal is to keep bears wild,” Trumble said. “So we want to make sure that bears stay out of your backyards, out of your trash, bird feeders, and especially your home.”

Bay State officials announced Friday they are entering contract negotiations with four companies to procure nearly 1,300 megawatts of battery storage. More than half of the storage would come from the largest bidder, the Trimount project in Everett.  
There, project developers have already begun remediation work and removed 21 of 22 old oil storage tankers that have been idling for years on the site, from which the Encore casino and Boston’s skyline are in view. It’s part of a larger effort to reshape the 100-acre property in Everett, including apartment complexes and an entertainment district. 
“This whole area has been an energy complex for 100 years,” said Hans Detweiler, senior director of development for Jupiter Power, the project developer. “It’s just a really nice harmony. This is super important for the community. And it comes at an inflection point that the region is about to face.” 
The Massachusetts Department of Energy Resources together with the state’s largest utilities — Eversource, National Grid, and Unitil — launched a push earlier this year in response to last year’s climate law to build out battery storage, which are facilities with the capacity to store all forms of energy when electricity demand is low and release it during times of high demand.  
That’s particularly helpful for renewable energy sources, which are relatively cheap but aren’t always deployed most strategically. Battery storage also can avoid the need for so-called peaker plants, which are often expensive and polluting oil and gas generators that start humming during the hottest and coldest days of the year to provide additional power. 
“Energy storage allows us to fill in some of those peak-demand hours without having to build new infrastructure, so we can have economic growth without needing to have infrastructure growth,” said Amy Boyd Rabin, vice president of policy and regulatory affairs at the Environmental League of Massachusetts. “One of the constant complaints that you hear about renewable energy is, ‘What happens when the wind doesn’t blow or the sun doesn’t shine?’ Energy storage is the answer to that, because it allows us more generally to line up the supply and demand with each other so that they fit really well.” 
The winning bids selected Friday through the state’s procurement process are just the start of its swing to lock in 5,000 MW of storage by 2030. The four projects selected, out of 13 total bids, will create 1,268 MW of storage capacity, though that’s shy of the 1,500 MW the state and utilities had sought to solicit in this round of bids. In addition to Everett, the three other projects are in Somerset, Chelsea, and Oakham. 
“Storage is one of the most effective ways to meet demand, improve grid reliability, and lower costs,” DOER Commissioner Elizabeth Mahony said in a statement. “The projects selected today through a robust procurement process will diversify Massachusetts’ energy supply, lower costs for residents and businesses, and avoid future costly infrastructure upgrades.” 
The Trimount project, which would be one of the largest in New England, promises to transform one of the state’s most polluted sites into a catalyst for a greener electric grid that can rely less on fossil fuel-based forms of power. The location, conveniently adjacent to a major Eversource substation along the Mystic River, will allow the batteries to quickly shoot electricity into the congested Boston area. And the batteries, Detweiler explained, will be kept in temperature-controlled, enclosed containers to avoid the weakening that can occur in cold weather. 
Jupiter Power is operating and developing a host of energy storage projects around the country. Trimount will be paying at least $50 million in taxes to Everett over 20 years, Detweiler said, though that wasn’t enough to satisfy former Everett Mayor Carlo DeMaria, who fought the project through its permitting process and argued it wasn’t in line with his vision for the city’s economic revitalization. The city’s new mayor, Robert Van Campen, didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. 
Battery storage projects across the state — including the one in Oakham selected on Friday — have faced opposition from local communities concerned about the batteries catching on fire. 
Trimount said in its bid that the project is able to avoid or delay $2.2 billion in transmission upgrades otherwise needed to meet rising energy demand and sits at a critical landing point for future offshore wind generation to be dispersed across the region. It’s planned to start operating in 2029. 
Detweiler said the battery facility purchases energy on the wholesale market and makes money both when it’s sold back on to the grid and, critically, through Massachusetts’s clean peak credits. That program is intended to incentivize projects like these that can dispatch energy when it’s most needed — but, he said, there was no certainty what those clean peak prices would be. 
This procurement paves the way for long-term contracts that make it easier to finance these large battery storage projects. These contracts will need approval from the Department of Public Utilities. 
“Projects like this present such a contrast,” Detweiler said on a tour of the Everett facility earlier in December before the project was chosen, pointing out the city skyline in the distance from the contaminated oil storage field. “You can feel the evolution.”",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_9936-scaled.jpg?fit=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-12-19 17:58:59.475544

(Jeffrey Coolridge/Source NM)Lawmakers on New Mexico’s Legislative Education Study Committee this week endorsed two potential bills that would require additional credentials for math teachers and expanded resources for literacy instruction.
In total, the committee endorsed eight legislative proposals during its Santa Fe meeting ahead of the 30-day regular budgetary session starting Jan. 20. Under state law, the upcoming session focuses on budgetary items, so some of the legislation will require a special message from Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham in order to be considered.
Lawmakers discussed the math and literacy instruction proposals at length. The math instruction bill would amend established state law to require people seeking an elementary or secondary license with an endorsement in math to complete “six hours of mathematics methods courses.” 
According to the presentation, the bill would also require the Public Education Department to create an instructional leadership framework for districts to implement during the 2027-2028 school year; establish state-wide processes for math screening between kindergarten and third grade; and create individualized student support plans and interventions. 
PED would have until Dec. 31, 2026 to complete the rulemaking process.
The Literacy Instruction and Supports bill would establish the High-Quality Literacy Instruction Act, expanding reading supports, particularly for schools and individual students struggling with reading proficiency; require literacy instruction and interventions be “grounded in the science of reading;” create a system for assessing reading progress and involving parents; and allow PED to make instructional coaches available for support.
LESC Director John Sena described the bill as “cleanup” following passage of literacy education legislation during the 60-day session this year. 
“This bill is somewhat similar to the math bill,” Sena said. “I think the most substantial difference in this bill is that it does not really touch higher [education] very much. You all passed some higher ed provisions last session to require educator prep programs to use science of reading reading and structured literacy.”
Rep. Joy Garratt (D-Albuquerque) said she was concerned about the “read-at-home” portion of the literacy bill and noted that parents of English Language Learners may not speak fluent English themselves. She added that encouraging biliteracy should also be a priority.
“I think someplace we have to start adding the joy of reading, because that’s getting overlooked,” she said. “I believe that if the parents are going to read with them, the parents should really read with them in their home language.”
Committee members discussed several other proposed bills that would enhance accountability of individual school board members through suspension for misconduct or other violations; increase public school employers’ share of health insurance premiums; add attendance provisions for students with “severe medical conditions;” amend teacher preparation requirements and how teacher resident stipends are calculated; clarify current restraint and seclusion practices in schools; and codify the Office of Special Education within the New Mexico Public Education Department.
The committee also voted not to endorse a proposed Universal Income Pilot Program. According to the presentation, the bill would appropriate $80 million to the Department of Health to establish and study the impact of distributing $1,500 a month to low-income pregnant residents and their families through the first year of the baby’s life. Soules and Rep. Yanira Gurrola (D-Albuquerque) introduced a similar bill during last year’s session, but it died in committee.
Committee members agreed that further discussion and vetting is needed for such a pilot program. However, a vote to not endorse does not mean the bill cannot be introduced by a legislator.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/mathclass-1024x759.jpg,,,2025-12-19 17:58:59.475544

(Photo by Sara Wilson/Colorado Newsline)Immigrant rights activist Jeanette Vizguerra went before a judge Friday for a bond hearing at the detention facility in Aurora where she has been detained for nine months.
Immigration Judge Brea Burgie, citing the complexity of the case, did not immediately make a decision and will release a written order soon.
U.S. District Judge Nina Wang ordered the bond hearing to occur earlier this week.
Vizguerra, a prominent activist originally from Mexico, has been held at the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention center since March. She has a pending habeas corpus petition in federal court over her arrest and detention, arguing that she was targeted for arrest because of her constitutionally protected political speech against the Trump administration.

Vizguerra rose to national attention during the first Trump administration when she took sanctuary in a Denver church to avoid deportation. She was arrested this year as the Trump administration undertook aggressive mass deportation efforts that have faced repeated rebukes by federal judges.
In September, her lawyers claimed that her prolonged detention goes against legal norms and precedent and that she should be released on bond while her case progresses.
Wang wrote in her order that the federal government must prove that Vizguerra is a flight risk or danger to the community to justify continued detention. Government lawyer Shana Martin said that Vizguerra’s past criminal conviction demonstrates Vizguerra’s “inability and unwillingness to follow the law” and “lack of respect for authority.” Vizguerra entered the country without authorization in 1997 and was convicted of having a fake Social Security card in 2009, which prompted the deportation efforts against her.










What the government has said, is they don't like Ms. Vizguerra. What the government has shown is they have treated her differently than almost any other noncitizen in the United States, in the way they targeted her.


– Laura Lichter, lawyer for Jeanette Vizguerra


In the 16 years since then, however, Vizguerra has received bond and multiple stays of removal with that conviction, her lawyer Laura Lichter said. The conviction for a “common status-related necessity” of using a false Social Security number to work and obtain housing, Lichter said, does not indicate flight risk or danger, and the government made that same determination multiple times before.
“There is no evidence during any of that time that she was at risk of flight. Or that she was a danger,” Lichter said. “There’s no history of failures to appear, and again, going back to the burden of proof, what the government has said, is they don’t like Ms. Vizguerra. What the government has shown is they have treated her differently than almost any other noncitizen in the United States, in the way they targeted her.”
Lawyers said the government did not bring any new evidence showing why Vizguerra should not receive bond and did not meet the legal burden to keep Vizguerra at the ICE detention facility.
“At the end of the day, all the government had were just kind of playground level insults about who Jeanette was and what she stands for, none of which was actually backed up by solid evidence in the record,” Lichter said after the hearing.
The bond hearing started over two hours late. Journalists and supporters were originally blocked from entering the court by officials with GEO Group, the private company that runs the facility, who said they had a directive from ICE to close the hearing to media. A Colorado Newsline reporter was ordered to leave by a GEO official and threatened with action from the Aurora Police Department for taking a photo of courtroom access rules posted in the lobby. Eventually, press was allowed into court and onto the court livestream.
Immigration court hearings are open to the public, but individual judges can limit attendance or close hearings at their discretion. Burgie at the start of the hearing affirmed that press was welcome.
Vizguerra’s supporters gathered on the sidewalk outside the facility during the proceedings.
“Her record speaks for itself,” Lichter said. “Her support speaks for herself, and we expect to see a positive decision hopefully in the next few days.”

The Board meets in December to approve figures which Gov. Kevin Stitt will use to craft his executive budget. That budget is a starting point for lawmakers, who will then craft one the state will use for the upcoming fiscal year. 
Stitt, who chairs the board, said the reduction was attributable to a smaller amount in available cash to spend.
With recent tax cuts and the creation of additional tax credits, revenue is still going up, Stitt said.
Stitt said he was “very, very pleased where we are at.”
Total recurring revenue is up about $338 million, or 3.2%, compared to fiscal year 2026, according to figures provided by the Board of Equalization.
Stitt has championed reducing the state’s income tax and the elimination of the state sales tax on groceries, something lawmakers approved. He said every time he cuts taxes, critics say “the sky is falling.”
“Revenue keeps going up,” he said.
Senate Appropriations Chair Chuck Hall, R-Perry, said the state’s economy is strong, but revenue growth is slowing.
The Board of Equalization meets again in February to determine how much lawmakers will have to spend.
“Although these are early budget estimates and subject to change in the coming months, all signs indicate that state revenues will remain relatively flat, which will limit the Legislature’s ability to make major new investments next year,” Hall said.
State agencies have asked for more than $1.5 billion in new funding, Hall said.
That is “unrealistic” given the state’s financial outlook, Hall said.
Stitt said he will be advocating for mostly flat agency budgets when lawmakers return to the Capitol in February.
“I certainly always am looking for lower taxes,” Stitt said. “I don’t have any specific things right now, but we’re still working through what our agenda is going to be.”
The state’s Constitutional Reserve Fund, also called Rainy Day Fund, has slightly more than $1.3 billion in savings, while the Revenue Stabilization Fund has nearly $449 million.

(Photo by Emma Murphy/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — After three months without a fully functioning campaign finance system, the Oklahoma Ethics Commission on Friday voted to immediately terminate the vendor’s contract and to authorize pursuing legal action. 
The Commission terminated the contract with RFD and Associates and authorized the Attorney General’s Office to seek legal remedies against the company. The board also voted to reinstate the original Guardian system operated by the previous vendor, Civix. The Commission voted to enter into a $217,000 contract with Carahsoft, a partner of Civix, that lasts three years. 
Within hours of the vote, the original campaign finance system was once again operational and accessible to the public. 
The Commission said it voted to terminate RFD and Associates’ contract after repeated delays in launching new software, including a public-facing portion of the system which allows people to examine lobbyist and candidate expenditures, track campaign donors and view who intends to run for office. The Commission was appropriated a total of $2.2 million for the project to replace Guardian. 
The ongoing issues also left candidates, lobbyists and political action committees unable to submit some reports and documentation amid the approaching 2026 election cycle.
The old Guardian system was initially taken offline in September and was set to launch in October, but officials said there were “unforeseen” delays in the data conversion process. The new system still appeared largely inoperable heading into Friday’s meeting. 
Scott Glover, the chief operating officer for RFD and Associates, declined to comment immediately following the Commission’s vote as he left the meeting quickly after the vote. 
Civix did not immediately return a request for comment. 
Lee Anne Bruce Boone, executive director of the Ethics Commission, previously said the timeline for replacing Guardian wasn’t set by the Commission as Civix had established the shutdown date for the old system, and RFD and Associates had committed to replacing it within the established window.
She said Friday afternoon that the switch back to Civix isn’t necessarily a permanent fix, but it will provide sufficient time to seek legal remedies and pursue next steps. 
Bruce Boone said Civix had experienced a change in leadership, which made it possible to continue the old partnership.
“We are signing a 3-year contract, knowing that we cannot do anything to change the system or explore an opportunity next year during the election cycle,” she said. “We must ensure all our focus is on transparency over the next 12 months. After that, this gives us two additional years to find a more permanent solution.”
Oklahoma Attorney General Gentner Drummond said in a statement Friday that he will work to hold RFD and Associates “accountable to the law.”
“I take very seriously my role to ensure that taxpayer dollars are spent fairly and appropriately,” Drummond said. “My office stands ready to take legal action to recover damages, hold those responsible accountable and work with the Ethics Commission to ensure the public has a reliable means to access campaign finance reports.”

(Photo by Eleonora Bianchi /The New Bedford Light)This story first ran in The New Bedford Light. Read the original version here. 
The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers on Thursday approved Vineyard Wind’s long-pending request to continue using the New Bedford hurricane barrier to transport major turbine components. Though not a new permit approval or issuance, the action appears to mark one of the only approvals from a federal agency to an offshore wind project since President Donald Trump’s day-one permitting freeze, which was struck down earlier this month
The Army Corps, an agency under the Department of Defense, manages the barrier. Years ago, it issued a Section 408 authorization to Vineyard Wind, allowing the project to send heavy lift boats and wide barges through the barrier’s 150-foot-wide opening.
Vineyard Wind was allowed an extension last year, which was set to expire on Dec. 31 — before the project could finish its installation campaign. Now, the project has through June 2026 to send vessels through the barrier for turbine installation, though the project may wrap up well before then.
A denial from the Army Corps wouldn’t have stopped the project from finishing buildout. Still, it could have added time and costs to the already delayed project, which was devising plans to use a Rhode Island port if necessary, according to a source.
The language in the Army Corps’ Dec. 18 approval letter mirrors the language from last year’s, except for the new date: “The District has reviewed the reasons provided in support of your subsequent extension request and agrees that, based on those reasons, an extension of time to June 30, 2026 is warranted, will not impair the usefulness of the New Bedford Hurricane Barrier, and will not be injurious to the public interest.”
Vineyard Wind did not immediately respond to a request for comment. With this approval in hand, the project has managed to get by largely unscathed amid Trump’s offshore wind crackdown, which hit a legal road block this month.
On Dec. 8, federal judge Patti B. Saris ruled that Trump’s day-one offshore wind memo, which froze permitting, was unlawful.
Saris issued her judgment Thursday: “Each Agency Defendant’s decision to implement section 2(a) of the Presidential Memorandum … by not issuing new or renewed approvals, rights of way, permits, leases, or loans for onshore or offshore wind projects pending the completion of a comprehensive assessment and review of Federal wind leasing and permitting practices … is hereby declared unlawful and is vacated in its entirety.”

The judgment does not include further information on how her ruling will be enforced. It is still unclear what relief this will bring to specific projects awaiting permits. Her ruling does not require permit approvals, just that agencies process permit applications and make a decision within a reasonable time, as required by the relevant laws.
The Conservation Law Foundation said the judgment requires federal agencies to start processing permits again. If they don’t, the states can return to the court to seek further relief.
ClearView Energy Partners, a D.C.-based research firm, has said the Trump administration is taking a “bifurcated approach” and allowing “only a handful of advanced-stage offshore wind projects to finish construction and come online as the industry’s most favorable near-term outcome.”
Vineyard Wind has one turbine left to install, as well as several sets of blades. The project shipped its first turbine through the hurricane barrier in September 2023.

,WyoFile,2025-12-19 21:50:18+00:00,WyoFile,"Gray hopes to revisit what failed in 2025, presents new slate of election reform bills","Noah Zahn, Wyoming Tribune Eagle",,,,,https://wyofile.com/gray-hopes-to-revisit-what-failed-in-2025-presents-new-slate-of-election-reform-bills/,"

After only a few of the 45 election bills made it to the governor’s desk in 2025, the secretary of state is back with more election reforms for 2026.
The post Gray hopes to revisit what failed in 2025, presents new slate of election reform bills appeared first on WyoFile .","CHEYENNE—After only a few of the 45 election bills proposed during the 2025 legislative session — many by Secretary of State Chuck Gray — made it to the governor’s desk, Gray is back with more proposed election reform bills ahead of the 2026 budget session.
On Thursday, he hosted a news conference at the Wyoming State Capitol to discuss his top five legislative priorities.
“As Wyoming’s Secretary of State and Wyoming’s chief election official, I will continue our work on conservative, election integrity reforms,” Gray said in a news release. 
He said Thursday that the current conservative majority provides a “moment of tremendous opportunity to take action on these reforms.”
The legislative push comes after a strenuous 2025 session, during which Wyoming lawmakers filed 45 election-related bills, making up about 8% of all proposed legislation, according to previous reporting from WyoFile.
Despite this effort, many of the most extensive measures championed by Gray and sponsored by Wyoming Freedom Caucus members died in the Wyoming Senate. Gray noted that while six of 10 of his administration’s 2025 priorities advanced, the remaining four were “held up” by the Senate, and these items form the core of his 2026 agenda.
Gray expressed his disappointment with Senate leadership for halting the passage of bills that had garnered strong support in the Freedom Caucus-dominated House.
His 2026 agenda focuses heavily on reviving previously failed election reform bills, with some new proposals.
1. Requiring pen-to-paper ballots as default
The first priority centers on mandating pen-to-paper ballots as the default voting method in Wyoming. While 22 of the 23 counties already operate this way, Gray noted that Laramie County, the largest county, uses electronic ballot marking devices that cast votes using barcodes.
Gray said this mechanism lacks transparency for the voter because it is unknown to the naked eye if the barcode accurately reflects what is filled out on the ballot.
“I can’t read barcode. I haven’t met anybody who could read barcode, and the argument that the clerk often gives is ‘Well, the ballot marking device prints out a piece of paper with the names of the votes.’ It misses the point a little bit,” he said.
Gray said that mandating the physical oval marking ensures the vote is cast by the readable oval, not the unreadable barcode. 
Gray linked this proposal directly to an executive order from President Donald Trump, taking a step toward implementing that order in Wyoming. A similar bill passed the House with a majority in the 2025 session, but was ultimately shot down in the Senate.
Election software companies like ES&S maintain that both hand-marked paper ballots and machine-marked paper ballots are secure vote-casting methods.
2. Banning drop boxes and ballot collection
This priority addresses two measures intended to tighten procedures for handling ballots after they leave the voter’s possession. Gray seeks to explicitly ban both ballot drop boxes and ballot collection.
Gray argued that drop boxes lack statutory authorization and proliferated only during the government’s response to COVID-19.
“I believe it is important that we take immediate action to explicitly ban ballot drop boxes,” he said.
For ballot collection, which is the gathering and submitting of completed absentee or mail-in voter ballots by someone else, Gray seeks an outright ban.
“Wyoming must take action to ban ballot harvesting,” he said. “We’re one of a handful of states that does not have an explicit ban on ballot harvesting.”
In previous legislative meetings, opponents argued that drop boxes are a secure and convenient voting option, particularly for rural residents. Both the ballot drop box and ballot collection bills passed the House in 2025 before dying in the Senate.
3. True photo ID for voter ID
Gray aims to change Wyoming’s Voter ID law by requiring that all forms of identification presented for voting include a photograph.
As a state lawmaker, Gray was the lead sponsor of the 2021 voter ID statute, but he noted concessions were made that he wants to now improve upon. Specifically, he seeks to remove identifications from the statute that lack photos — such as Medicare and Medicaid cards — which are currently acceptable.
“You’re trying to prove that the person who is coming to the polls … is on the voter list, that that is the same person that they’re claiming to be, and if you don’t have a photo on the ID, how are you going to do that? So, clarifying this requiring photo ID for voter ID is common sense,” he said.
Bills to revise acceptable identification by repealing the use of Medicare/Medicaid cards and student IDs passed the House in 2025, but failed to meet deadlines in the Senate.
According to data from AARP Wyoming, more than 300 people used the Medicaid ID to vote last year, and voters over 50 have had the highest statewide percentage voter turnout every year since at least 2010.
“Gray would like to eliminate that and all student IDs. His mistaken belief is anyone can get to a WYDOT station for a free state ID,” AARP Wyoming Director of Communications and Legislative Affairs Tom Lacock wrote in a statement. “We push back on that and use the example of those in nursing homes. Those who are homebound, but would still like to vote on Election Day. We have offered other options outside of Medicare. The Secretary has not and is unwilling to consider anything different.”
4. Hand tabulation for recounts and audits
This measure seeks to institute hand tabulation verification of voting machines for recounts and audits. Gray stated that many Wyoming residents are distrustful of electronic voting machines and need verification methods.
“It’s common sense that you shouldn’t just trust everything that a machine spits out,” he said.
The proposal would implement mandatory hand recounts in races decided by a narrow margin (within one or two percentage points) or allow candidates to request a hand recount. 
Gray reminded those at the news conference that the bill to enable candidate-requested hand recounts passed the House in 2025, but was held by Senate leadership.
5. Banning dual citizenship voting
The fifth priority is a new initiative aimed at amending the Wyoming Constitution to require all qualified electors to be solely United States citizens, effectively banning dual citizenship for voting and holding office. Gray said this measure “is in line with the intent of the state’s founders when they drafted the state constitution.”
Gray noted that currently, dual citizens are legally allowed to vote under Wyoming law, leading to constituent questions.
“It’s pretty common sense that, to vote in Wyoming, individuals would need to swear allegiance to the United States of America and the United States only, period,” he said. “And clarifying that dual citizenship is not allowed for voting is a very important clarification.”
Though county clerks have previously expressed budgetary concerns to the WTE amid increased election requirements compounded by continued decreases in funds from property taxes, Gray said he is “all ears” regarding the needs of county clerks and will continue to seek grant funding to support necessary programs.
The Wyoming County Clerks Association did not respond to a request for comment prior to publication.
“The time for action is now. We can’t dither and delay. We need to bring through these election integrity priorities,” Gray said in conclusion, noting that passing a budget during the 2026 budget session remains the ultimate priority ahead of election reform bills.

(Photo by Matt Riley/University of Virginia)The University of Virginia’s Board of Visitors on Friday chose Scott Beardsley as the institution’s 10th president, despite calls from lawmakers, UVA faculty and community organizations and Gov.-elect Abigail Spanberger to suspend the months-long search.
Spanberger and others had asked for the board to pause its process until appointees to fill the body’s vacant seats could be nominated and confirmed by the governor and General Assembly, starting in January. 
The school’s last president, Jim Ryan, resigned in June as the U.S. Department of Justice pressured the school to end DEI initiatives. Beardsley’s term begins Jan. 1, according to a release from the university.
“We are confident that Scott’s leadership, vision, and commitment to the UVA community uniquely position him to serve as president at this moment,” the board said in a Friday statement. “He understands the breadth of the university’s responsibilities across education, research, healthcare, athletics, and public service, and he brings a steady, unifying approach grounded in respect for shared governance and academic excellence.”
Board members selected Beardsley, who is the dean of the UVA Darden School of Business, because of his work leading Darden to record academic rankings, expanding student access and strengthening faculty excellence, the statement said
Beardsley also led major capital initiatives, including for UVA Northern Virginia, and invested heavily in hiring and retaining faculty.
The new UVA leader spent 26 years at the global management consulting firm McKinsey & Company, rising to senior partner. He also oversaw global learning and leadership development and served on McKinsey’s global board.

“I am deeply honored to be named the 10th president of the University of Virginia, an institution with a historic legacy shaped by visionaries and dedicated members of the University community,” Beardsley said in a statement.

“As president, I embrace the responsibility of carrying forward that legacy while advancing UVA’s mission and ensuring we are prepared for the evolving landscape of higher education and health care.” Beardsley added that he is committed to excellence and “bringing a results-driven and student-centered approach” to the university.
The board also recognized Ryan, former president, for his seven years of service. Ryan, whose resignation came after multiple DOJ civil rights investigations, recently shared his account, claiming that Rachel Sheridan and Porter Wilkinson, the rector and vice rector, collaborated with the DOJ and Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s office to pressure him to step down during the federal agency’s investigations.
Members also thanked interim president Paul Mahoney and the search committee, which included students, faculty, staff, alumni, and other members of the UVA community.
“Today’s election of the 10th president reflects the input of many across our community, who support and care for UVA as we do,” the board stated. “Together, we will move forward with unity, purpose, and pride in this extraordinary institution.”

Entergy Louisiana plans to spend $3.2 billion on a power plant to run the center, plus additional money on a related gas plant in south Louisiana and transmission lines. (Meta)Louisiana regulators have adopted a new rule that suspends certain consumer protections if utility companies need to quickly build power plants for certain industrial developments, including data centers, that require massive amounts of electricity. 
The rule change also directs these large-scale customers to pay for half the cost of these new power plants, meaning regular ratepayers could be on the hook for the remaining cost.   
In a 4-1 vote Wednesday, the Louisiana Public Service Commission adopted the rule, which creates a streamlined approval process that would drastically reduce the time it takes to greenlight utility projects primarily geared toward data centers. The lone dissenting vote came from Commissioner Davante Lewis, D-Baton Rouge, who expressed concerns that the proposal could hurt consumers. Lewis has argued that the commission should focus on making energy less expensive for household customers rather than the wealthiest companies in the world, like Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram that is building the world’s largest artificial intelligence data center in Northeast Louisiana. 
Commissioner Jean-Paul Coussan, R-Lafayette, authored the directive in step with Gov. Jeff Landry’s economic development agenda of courting big businesses with state government grants, tax breaks, expedited permitting and industry-friendly regulations. 
Coussan said his directive creates a “lightning speed” path for certain power plant proposals brought before the Public Service Commission, echoing the title of Landry’s Sept. 16 executive order to fast-track state agency permitting. In a phone interview Thursday, he said it lets the commission more easily replicate the quick approval process it used for Entergy Louisiana’s construction of a power plant with three natural gas-powered turbines to run the massive data center Meta is building in Richland Parish, which the commission signed off on in August.
This week’s commission vote suspends the competitive bidding requirement that’s meant to ensure ratepayers get the best deal available on new power plants. Generally, competitive bidding requires multiple contractors to submit estimates of what it would cost them to complete the job. The estimates are then published and voted on at an open meeting. 
Government entities opt for open bidding on most public works contracts to make the process transparent, avoid conflicts of interest and help ensure qualified contractors are hired.    
The new Public Service Commission rules still require approvals at open meetings, though there would be no need to accept multiple bids. 
Coussan said the commissioners would still act as a backstop on any proposals that seem overpriced. Any utility using the “lightning speed” avenue must still demonstrate that the proposal is using the “lowest reasonable cost,” he said.
“This could cut our regulatory process down from, say, two years down to eight months,” Coussan said. “This is not a rule in place that can be exploited.”
He referenced the recently truncated timeline in which the commission waived its normal rules in special consideration of Meta’s needs. The commission approved construction of the Entergy power plant for its Northeast Louisiana facility in August despite intense public opposition to the shortened eight-month timeline, considered very fast in the energy regulatory sphere.
The three gas turbines that Entergy is building for Meta’s AI data center will have the capacity to generate 2,200 megawatts of electricity, more than twice what the entire city of New Orleans uses during peak demand hours. Electricity from the power plants is dedicated specifically to Meta’s data center, though it will be connected to the larger electric grid and could, if needed, sell power to other customers.
Because of this setup, Meta agreed to pay 100% of the cost for all three turbines that would have otherwise been added to the monthly bills of Entergy Louisiana customers.
Critics of Coussan’s directive include the Louisiana Energy Users Group, a trade coalition of 26 large industrial and petrochemical companies. The group’s attorney, Randy Young, said at Wednesday’s meeting that allowing companies with large power needs to cover only half the cost of new power plants is too lenient and places other ratepayers at risk of having to pay for the remaining cost even if they aren’t using the power plants. 
“If you need new generation and you wanna waive the [competitive bidding] requirement, commit to paying the full cost of whatever generation you need — not just half of it,” Young told the commission.
Utility companies will only be able to use the commission’s new lightning approval track for projects with forecasted electricity demand the utility can’t supply without building the additional proposed power plants. The rule also requires the utility to have a 15-year contract in place to sell the electricity to its new customer, up from the 10 years Coussan initially proposed. He agreed to the change to assuage some of the concerns of critics who said ratepayers would have to bear the electricity costs if the contract isn’t renewed. 
Logan Burke, executive director of the Alliance for Affordable Energy, said the Public Service Commission has long guaranteed utility companies the right to earn an annual profit on their investments, meaning they make money on new power plants and other additions to their infrastructure by passing along the cost to ratepayers. The previous rules are meant to protect consumers from such impacts, she said.
“Competitive bids are not meant to slow the process,” Burke testified. “They are made to ensure we are all getting the most reasonable deal for every ratepayer dollar.”
Coussan said expediting power plant approvals is meant to spur economic growth and bring new jobs to the people of Louisiana. 
The Meta data center is expected to create about 500 direct jobs. 
“I’m trying to create jobs and create a positive national perception of Louisiana for business,” Coussan said. “We have cheap and abundant energy sources like natural gas and the workers to deliver it.”
The Public Service Commission can only use the new rule with a written endorsement from the Louisiana Economic Development agency that verifies the project’s power needs. It requires utilities to give the commission a 60 days advanced notice if they intend to pursue expedited approval, and the commission has to take a final vote on the proposal within eight months. 
Young, the Louisiana Energy Users Group lawyer, asked commissioners to consider more flexible criteria that would allow fast-tracking approvals on a case-by-case basis. Lewis proposed an alternative that he said would provide a similar level of flexibility to balance expedited approvals with consumer protections, but it was sidelined indefinitely after his colleagues heard and approved Coussan’s. 
An eight-month timeline to approve a power plant for a data center stands in contrast to the four-year delay and regulatory hurdles the commission placed on Young’s group when they made a similar request for new energy. Young asked commissioners in June 2024 to let his members buy solar energy from an independent, non-utility company. At that time, the group’s members had been waiting over four years for the commission to vote on the request, which most of the state’s utility companies had opposed.
The commission gave Young its approval but with several big caveats — the group is only allowed to buy a maximum of 500 megawatts and the electricity must be transmitted through a utility’s power lines, letting the utility companies approve or deny the third-party agreements and ensuring they still get a cut of the electricity sales.",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/La_meta_render-1024x512.jpg,,,2025-12-19 16:57:52.718445

(Photo by Nathaniel Herz/Northern Journal)A couple of months ago, I was reporting on the typhoon that hit Western Alaska and stopped by a news conference convened by Gov. Mike Dunleavy.
I was there to ask him about long-term plans for protecting vulnerable coastal villages. But the governor diverted my focus by talking about Donald Trump and the president’s concern. The previous week, Dunleavy said, “I was texting him at one in the morning, his time, about this disaster.”
A normal person probably wouldn’t react strongly to this statement; after all, the two Republicans are politically allies and have something of a bromance, with Trump calling Dunleavy his “friend” and advancing a slew of pro-development actions that align with the governor’s agenda.
But my brain is tuned to resonate at a very specific frequency: that of Alaska Statutes 40.25.100 – 40.25.295, otherwise known as the Alaska Public Records Act.
Which is why Dunleavy’s comments grabbed my attention. The executive branch often uses various statutory exemptions and legal maneuvers to withhold certain correspondence and records — namely, asserting a “deliberative process privilege” to shield internal, unvarnished communications within agencies.

But because the president exists outside state government, that deliberative privilege, presumably, wouldn’t apply — offering me, potentially, a look at Dunleavy’s unvarnished communications with the leader of the free world. The next day, I requested copies of all of Dunleavy’s text messages with Trump since early this year.
Two days later, I was summoned to the governor’s office in downtown Anchorage to collect the response: four flash drives loaded with tens of thousands of messages between Dunleavy and Trump, detailing political machinations and covert activities to ward off Chinese influence operations inside Alaska. Working with reporters from the Anchorage Daily News, Alaska Public Media and the Nome Nugget, I reviewed —
Okay, yeah…no, that’s not actually what happened. Ten business days after making my request — the deadline under the public records act — I got an initial response: a legally authorized extension so that the state could “consult with legal counsel to ensure that protected interests of private or government persons or entities are not infringed.”
Fair enough, I thought — reasonable that Dunleavy’s office might want to be cautious about releasing texts to and from the president. I was less generous when, 10 business days later, I got my next response: an early morning email asserting that the state didn’t have to respond within any particular timeline because I was requesting not “public records” but “electronic services and products involving public records.”
Such requests, for electronic services and products, fall under a different area of the public records law, without deadlines.
“Text messages and the work required to provide them in a readable and transferrable format are computer-related: searching for, extracting, duplicating, and transferring texts require software,” Guy Bell, the employee in Dunleavy’s office who handles records requests, wrote in an email. “We will make every effort to respond within the next few weeks.”
I did not find this argument compelling. I responded to Bell half an hour later explaining that I thought this was a bad faith delay tactic and that such a legal position should have been asserted when I first made my request, not a month later. Please let me know by the end of the day, I told Bell, whether the state would reconsider this determination, or I would be considering my legal options. (This is reporter-speak for: I think you’re staking out an indefensible legal position, and if you stick to it, I’m gonna sue.)
The governor’s office did, in fact, reconsider its position, which I was informed was “out of courtesy” to me and “to avoid litigation.”
It obtained one more 10-day extension directly from Dunleavy’s attorney general, a process laid out in state regulations.
Then, last week, Bell sent me another email — this time, with attached screenshots showing the trademark blue and gray bubbles of iPhone messages. At the top: a “DT,” denoting the initials of the president of the United States. (Also at the top: an indicator showing that the governor of Alaska has 145 unread texts.)

There were just six substantive texts from the governor to the president, half of which were information about the typhoon and thanking Trump for the federal government’s response. Another message praised the president’s unofficial state of the union address in March — ”Fantastic speech Mr. President!” — and the other two were broad appeals about big proposed projects favored by Dunleavy: the Ambler mining road in Northwest Alaska, and the state’s massive natural gas export development.
“Mr. President,, thank you very much for all that are doing for this country and my great State of Alaska!” one said. “Thank you for your help on our large natural gas pipeline to help our Asian allies and Alaska. This would be an absolute game changer for Alaska and the Pacific. Anything I can do to help you move your agenda forward please let me know. Your friend Governor Mike Dunleavy, Alaska”
The screenshots showed just one set of responses from Trump, to the typhoon related texts and a photo that Dunleavy shared of evacuees crowded into a military transport plane. “Give them all MY LOVE. Wow! President DJT”, one read. “GOD BLESS ALASKA! DJT” said another.

Dunleavy agreed to talk with me briefly about his messaging relationship with the president.
Trump, Dunleavy said, gave him his phone number, and no, he was not going to share it with me. Dunleavy did not text with Democratic former President Joe Biden, he added; with Trump, “it’s great to be able to have a positive relationship with, arguably, the most powerful person on the planet that can make some good decisions for Alaska.”
“I try not to abuse or overuse the positive relationship,” he added. “He’s got lots going on, so I try not to bother him.” But, Dunleavy said, “whenever we’re dependent on the federal government for something,” like typhoon relief, “I wanted to give him a heads-up that that was happening.”
Even critics of both Dunleavy and the president acknowledge that the governor’s proximity to Trump, as shown by the texts, can advance Alaska’s interests in situations like the typhoon aftermath.
“I hate to praise Dunleavy, but this gives us the opportunity to say: We have the right person in the right place in the right time for this particular emergency,” said Anchorage Democratic Rep. Andrew Gray, who reviewed the text messages. “I don’t believe that Donald Trump is good for America. But if Donald Trump is the president, and our governor has this direct line of communication to him, I think that there are definite benefits to the state.”
I had one lingering question, though: whether I was really seeing all the messages that the governor and the president exchanged.
I’d heard that Dunleavy and Trump communicate fairly regularly; the messages that were released gave the impression of much rarer exchanges. But the screenshots, I noticed, also seemed fairly tightly cropped. And I know that in the past, the executive branch has withheld messages from me that fit my public records search terms but are deemed “transitory” or personal — which would allow them to exempt those records from their response.
The basis for that position is a Palin-era Alaska Supreme Court decision holding that public records, as defined in state law, are only those preserved or appropriate for preservation by agencies for their informational value, or as evidence of the way government functions.
“Not every record a state employee creates, and certainly not every state employee email, is necessarily appropriate for preservation” under the law guiding Alaska’s management of public records, Justice Bud Carpeneti wrote in his 2012 opinion.
In his email, Bell described the screenshots as “the records responsive to your request for all of Governor Dunleavy’s text messages sent to or received from President Donald Trump.”
Notably, he did not describe the screenshots as “all of Governor Dunleavy’s text messages sent to or received from President Donald Trump.” So, I emailed him back with a question: Were any messages between the governor and the president withheld on the basis that they were transitory or otherwise deemed to be “non-record communications”?
Bell’s response: “As the public records officer for the office of the Governor, I have confirmed and assure you that we have provided you all the text messages related to state business.”
At that point, I called Bell and told him that I would describe his answer as not, actually, an answer to my question. He was very polite, but he did not share additional details.
Sure: I can accept, as a plausible argument, that it doesn’t make sense for the state to permanently archive and maintain every single email sent by every employee at a state agency.
But what about at the level of a chief executive-statewide elected official — for whom the personal, in fact, is often political? And what if a message doesn’t meet the state’s legal standards for preservation, but still exists because it hasn’t been deleted? Should the state not provide it to the public on what’s, effectively, principle? How can a member of the public contest the state’s assertion that a record is “transitory” or “personal” if agencies won’t even confirm that messages have been withheld, or how many have been withheld?
Those are all questions worth considering, I think, and questions that lawmakers should also be actively pondering. I asked Dunleavy for his opinion — if he thought the public should have access to all of his correspondence with Trump.

“If it touches on state business, we have laws in place that dictate that would be open to the public, which is the form of government we have. I don’t disagree with that at all,” Dunleavy said. But, he added, what about some hypotheticals: “If I text the president to say happy birthday, is that state business? Some would argue it’s not. If I text the president, ‘Good luck to [son] Barron [Trump] going to university,’ is that considered state business? I don’t think it is.
“You’re a reporter, and you want information, which is part of the job,” Dunleavy said. “But I think as a human being, you would also say to yourself, ‘Yeah, he’s probably right. Some of those things really aren’t state business.’”
Sorry, gov: I’m not a normal human being — I’m a guy who gets a kick out of badgering public agencies to adhere to meticulous legal standards for transparency.
It’s the other human beings out there — readers, lawmakers, the Alaska public — who can decide if the governor is right.

In a report published on Friday, the Joint Legislative Committee on Performance, Evaluation and Expenditure Review, or PEER, found staffing shortages overseen by VitalCore Health Strategies, the Kansas-based private company that receives hundreds of millions in taxpayer dollars to provide medical care in Mississippi’s prisons under a contract with the Mississippi Department of Corrections.
The report, which focuses on dental care in nursing homes and prisons, also found that the Department of Corrections, beyond looking at staffing levels, could not produce any documentation showing it was monitoring VitalCore’s compliance with the lucrative contract awarded to the company. The findings suggest that Mississippi prisoners have been put in harm’s way by the government entities in charge of their care.
“The lack of monitoring lowers MDOC’s ability to hold VitalCore accountable for providing services and increases the possibility for inmates to receive insufficient care,” the report said.
The combination of shortcomings increased the risk of untreated medical needs and limited Mississippi’s ability to hold its contractor accountable, even as MDOC sought millions of dollars in financial penalties for staffing shortfalls — all of which has been previously reported by Mississippi Today.
Friday’s report follows numerous installments in Mississippi Today’s Behind Bars, Beyond Care series, which has documented alleged routine denial of health care in state prisons. The series includes reports of potentially thousands of people living with hepatitis C going without treatment, an untreated broken arm that resulted in amputation and delayed cancer screenings. The series has also provided an inside view of discontent among high-ranking officials inside the prison system, with one ex-corrections official turning over private communications between former colleagues showing them lamenting the quality of care provided by VitalCore.
The watchdog report also reveals the department is in the process of finalizing a contract through the Mississippi State Personnel Board to hire an external contract monitor to assist with keeping tabs on VitalCore. This means that MDOC plans to outsource its role in ensuring VitalCore provides the care it’s paid to provide.
The report said MDOC reviewed the findings and elected not to provide a formal response. Spokespeople for MDOC and VitalCore did not immediately respond to requests for comment from Mississippi Today about specific findings in the report.
Those findings included the revelation that VitalCore’s staffing hours for dental professionals fell below contractual requirements every month from January to June 2025, with unfilled hours ranging from 31% to 57%. Dental directors filled only 43% of required hours, dentists 59%, and dental assistants 69%—all below contract standards.
These staffing shortages “decrease the likelihood of high quality dental care for inmates and increase the likelihood of overworking the dental professionals on staff,” the report said.
VitalCore blamed the unfilled staffing hours on employee “paid time off, sick time, military leave, staffing vacancies, and statewide dental professional shortages.” The company also claims there has been no reduction in dental services or any delay in providing care. But the legislative watchdog said the high percentages of unfilled staffing hours for dental professionals put “the contractor’s ability to provide quality dental care for inmates in question.”
The shortages have likely multiplied the workload for the current dental staff, the report added.
The watchdog also confirmed a Mississippi Today report from May, which revealed that MDOC requested over $4 million in paybacks from VitalCore due to staffing shortages. The agency requested back $500,000 specifically due to a shortage of dental professionals.
MDOC seeks money back from VitalCore if the required number of staffing hours falls below 90% for physicians, dentists, psychologists, nurse practitioners, and physician assistants and below 85% for all other staff positions.
But other than monitoring VitalCore’s staffing levels, MDOC could not provide the watchdog with any documentation showing it was holding VitalCore accountable for potential failures to meet the terms of its contract.
The report found insufficient, inconsistent, mislabeled and missing data in VitalCore’s dental care records, which leaves oversight officials in the dark about whether prisoners are getting the dental care they need.
For example, dental sick call data was stored in a PDF format that wasn’t suitable for analysis, requiring manual counting and increasing the risk of error, the report said. Dental records were sometimes missing from patient charts, despite MDOC policy requiring such classification.
While the report acknowledges that Mississippi prisons have done enough to maintain accreditation, the lack of oversight “casts uncertainty on the quality of dental care VitalCore is providing to inmates and the internal mechanisms VitalCore utilizes to ensure quality.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/06081606/MSprison-cells-1.jpg,,,2025-12-19 16:57:52.718445

Colleton County residents and other opponents of the $6 billion project packed the auditorium of the county civic center Thursday, voicing their concerns and seeking more information on the project that is in the early phase of development. Such massive energy hogging centers are facing pushback nationwide even as more are planned to power technical advancements being driven by artificial intelligence.
The first hurdle the developers of the nine-building campus face is securing a zoning exception for the property that would allow for a more industrial use. The project is proposed for a timberland tract about four miles southeast of Walterboro.
Only Ken Loeber, co-founder of the Charlotte-based development firm Eagle Rock Partners, spoke in favor of the project.
“The AI race that our country is in with other countries around the world is real,” Loeber said of the need for the center.
Opponents took up the remainder of the three-hour meeting, which grew rowdy at times with chants, heckling and multiple threats by the board to end the meeting if the disruptions continued. In addition to residents, opponents included environmental activists, a state senator and a Democratic gubernatorial candidate.

The ACE Basin
At the heart of the matter is the campuses proximity to South Carolina’s beloved ACE Basin.
The 350,000-acre undeveloped estuary named for the Ashepoo, Combahee, and Edisto rivers that feed it is home to nine federally endangered species, including peregrine falcons, wood storks and leatherback turtles. There are also six species federally designated as threatened and 30 other state protected species.
“The most significant conservation achievement in the state of South Carolina, I’d dare say on the entire East Coast, is the protection of the ACE Basin,” state Sen. Chip Campsen, R-Isle of Palms, told members of the county zoning board.
While the site does contain about 235 acres of wetland, Loeber said the campus would impact just 1 1/2 of those wetland acres with roads needed to access the property.
Meanwhile, the Ashepoo River lies about six miles south of the data center site. Residents were worried about how much water the center might pull from the river and groundwater system that they also rely on for their own homes and farms.
“To the extent that they use any water at all it will pose a great risk to the Ashepoo River system and the ecology of that river system,” Campsen said.

“Rural South Carolina is under attack by for-profits who seek to steal God’s gift to us — our water — right out from underneath our feet,” added Mullins McLeod, a Democratic candidate for governor who grew up in Walterboro.
The answer to the water use question, according to Loeber: about 12,000 gallons of water a day, the equivalent of 14, four-bedroom homes.
It amounts to a tenth of 1% of the 4.2 billion gallons available in the county annually.
“So the amount of water that we’re using every day is not billions and billions of gallons,” he said. “That is the way data centers in the past might have been developed. It’s not the way the modern data center is used.”
The center accomplishes this by continuously recycling the water it uses to cool the hundreds of thousands of servers it stores. That means the center operator would only have to fill the cooling tanks once. Most of the daily water usage would be from an estimated 500 employees hired to operate the facility, Loeber said.
A gigawatt of power
While this type of system is less water intensive, it can be be more power intensive.
Loeber told the SC Daily Gazette he estimates the center will need 1,000 megawatts of electricity.
That would take up nearly all of Santee Cooper’s share of a 2,200-megawatt, natural gas-fired power plant that the state-owned utility company is seeking to build, in partnership with Virginia-headquarted Dominion Energy, in nearby Canadys.
By comparison, other large data centers in the state operated by tech giants, such as Google and Meta, use about 200 megawatts each.
The $5 billion Canadys gas plant and a $431 million natural gas pipeline needed to power it have only just started the state and federal permitting process. Operations won’t begin until the 2030s, so it would likely take power providers at least that long to produce the amount of energy this proposed gigawatt center needs.
Loeber went on to tell the zoning board that his company is developing this project speculatively meaning it does not have a specific tenant lined up at this time. However, data centers of this size often appeal to those same major technology users, such as Amazon.
Other concerns
Colleton County residents, both those that have lived in the area for decades and newcomers, raised concerns about how the data center would impact the landscape, as well as the value of the homes where they had planned to spend their retirement years. One man suggested a data center is better suited for an industrial area, rather than chasing cheap, rural land in an area traditionally used for agriculture.
“The main question is why here? Why now? The answer is not here, not now, not ever,” said Richard Burke, whose parents live near the site.
Another woman called into question the jobs and pay being promised by the developers.

Loeber said about 30% of the 500 permanent jobs would be in IT. Another 30% would be facility management and maintenance jobs, ranging from entry-level to highly technical. The last 30% would be security personnel, plus another 10% of administrative workers.
But Shannon Wait said her experience working at one of Google’s data centers in Berkeley County was not the opportunity she expected. For the two years she was there, Wait said she and others were kept on as temporary workers rather than full-time employees, earning $15 an hour on contracts that she had to renew every three months.
“I was constantly on the job hunt,” she said.
Residents also worried about how quickly the project seemed to be moving, with one man calling it “governance run amok.” The request came about a month after the Colleton County Council amended its zoning code to make exceptions for data centers.
The zoning board took no action, saying it would vote on the request at an unspecified future meeting.
In addition to the rezoning request, the center still needs to complete numerous county and state level permits for noise, construction, water use and permission to drill wells. It also will need a study from electric providers to determine when there might be enough power on the grid to meet the center’s needs.

But Waterbury now faces a bigger task: making sure this doesn't happen again.,"Waterbury officials gave residents the all-clear Thursday to resume drinking the city’s water following an unprecedented six-day outage. But the city now faces an even more formidable task: ensuring that such a crisis does not happen again.
Already, the head of Waterbury’s water department has announced an emergency effort to identify and replace a number of stuck or broken valves that have been identified as critical weak points in the system.
The cost of that effort — which comes on top of $30 million the city has already spent on upgrades to its water system this year — has yet to be determined, but officials say they don’t intend to wait until next year’s budget cycle to begin the work. By focusing on valves at key intersections, officials say they hope to be able to prevent future problems from becoming widespread.
“I don’t think anyone can stand here and tell you that in any water system there’s never going to be a break or a leak or a problem,” said Waterbury Mayor Paul Pernerewski. “But if we can contain it in a much smaller area, it’ll make a big difference.” 
Over the last week, Pernerewski and his staff have described the citywide outage as an almost-freak occurrence, brought on by a cascading sequence of events.
It began last Wednesday, when a 12-inch-wide pipe near the intersection of Thomaston Avenue and Manville street started leaking, which forced street closures but otherwise caused no wider disruptions in water service. While crews went to work to fix the leak, however, they discovered there were no valves that could cut off the flow of water into the area.
On Friday, the pipe burst. The resulting flood of water washed away the soil under an adjacent high-pressure main that normally delivers 10 million gallons of water a day to the East End and other areas of the city. Without ground supporting it, the larger pipe caved under the weight of the street, sending torrents of water to the surface and hurling rocks and chunks of asphalt in all directions.
The location where the break occurred was just south of an another section of pipe that was undergoing maintenance, which prevented workers from quickly establishing a bypass to keep water flowing from one end of the city to the other.
By Friday evening nearly the entire city of 115,000 people, along with the neighboring towns of Watertown and Wolcott, was without water.
“It was kind of the worst thing you could imagine, and it all happened,” said Bradley Malay, the city’s superintendent of water. 
The outage forced Waterbury schools to close for several days and prevented restaurants from serving food and drinks. Thousands of residents lined up for bottled water that had to be shipped in from out of state.
Despite the fluky nature of the break, it exposed the broader fragility of the city’s water system, some of which dates back over a century. The leaking pipe that kicked off the crisis, for example, was laid in 1901.
Experts said this week that Waterbury is hardly alone when its comes to the challenge of maintaining its vast underground network of aging pipes, gaskets, pumps and valves. Both in Connecticut and across the country as a whole, many public water systems rely on infrastructure that is in desperate need of replacement.
In a report released earlier this year, the American Society of Civil Engineers graded that nation’s drinking water infrastructure a C-minus, and said that around $670 billion was needed to bring public systems up to a state of good repair. Current levels of funding would only cover slightly over half that amount, the report said.

“It is definitely a challenge,” said Betsy Gara, executive director of the Connecticut Water Works Association. “At the same time, there’s a lot of pressure to keep rates low, and that makes it difficult sometimes for utilities to move forward with their capital budget.”
In Connecticut, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency estimated in 2021 that the state’s long-term needs for drinking water infrastructure amounted to more $4.9 billion, most of which was necessary for maintenance of transmission and distribution lines. That includes the cost of replacing thousands of lead service lines, which can potentially leach toxins into customers’ water.
In order to help water utilities manage those costs, the Connecticut Department of Public Health manages a revolving fund to provide low-interest loans for water infrastructure projects. Since the program began in 1996, it has invested nearly $542 million in 341 projects, according to a DPH spokesperson. 
Craig Palta, the president of the Connecticut Water Company, an investor-owned utility, said the pressure to keep water rates low — particularly in municipal-owned systems — has resulted in deferred maintenance that makes large, disruptive breaks more likely to occur.
In some parts of the state, he said, pipes are being replaced at such a slow rate that many could remain in service for hundreds of years.
“A day of reckoning is coming or is happening,” Palta said.  “And with Waterbury, I believe it’s happened.”
Speaking to reporters earlier this week, Malay was careful to avoid directly criticizing his predecessors at the Waterbury Water Department, which he has led since January. However, he described the catastrophic failure of the Thomaston Avenue main as a wake-up call for the city. 
“I think this has shown us that when, throughout the years and over the decades, you just let things kind of fall into disrepair because they were working, it’s not the correct approach,” Malay said. 
Following an earlier incident in October in which a separate water main burst on nearby Huntingdon Ave., sending a geyser shooting 40 feet into the air and disrupting service for about 1,500 residents, Malay said he began developing a capital improvement plan for next year to address some of the city’s most pressing water infrastructure needs.
The events of the last week led Pernerewski and Malay to expedite those plans.
While attempting to isolate the outage and restore service to parts of the city, Malay said the water department discovered several malfunctioning valves that need to be replaced in order to give the system an added layer of redundancy. 
In addition, once the work to repair the Thomaston Avenue main is completed, Waterbury will again have three transmission lines capable of supplying the bulk of the city’s water. If one of those lines were to suffer another break, Malay said, the valves would allow the water to be routed along the other lines to avoid a large-scale disruption in service.

Mayor Pernerewski plans to meet with Malay and the city’s finance team on Monday to outline the next steps and any available funding sources for the most critical valve replacement projects, according to spokeswoman Jennifer Rose. That work is expected to start in early 2026.
“The city is not aware of any prior outage of this scale or duration, certainly not in our lifetimes, and we hope it is never repeated, particularly once these critical valves are replaced or installed,” Rose said in email. “These valve replacements will allow water crews to isolate sections of pipe if a water main break occurs, significantly reducing the impact on residents and businesses.”
In the longer term, Malay said he will also move forward with a capital plan to address some of the city’s older, cast-iron pipes that are in danger of cracking and bursting. Modern pipes are typically made with ductile iron, which is less brittle and more resistant to changing temperatures.
Even some of the city’s older maps supposedly showing where the miles of pipes and other components are buried, Malay said, are outdated and in need of digitizing.
“The system is designed beautifully,” Malay said. “It’s the maintenance and the upkeep and everything else that kind of fell by the wayside through the decades, and now we’re paying the price for that, and those things have to be fixed.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/2025_1218_SR_WaterburyUpdate_004-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-19 16:57:52.718445

(Photo by Anne-Marie Caruso/New Jersey Monitor)A 41-year-old man who had been detained at a migrant jail in Newark died one day after he was arrested by federal authorities, according to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. 
Jean Wilson Brutus entered ICE custody on Dec. 11, and while at Delaney Hall in Newark, he experienced a “medical emergency,” ICE said in a statement. Emergency services were called, and Brutus was transported to University Hospital in Newark, where he was pronounced dead Dec. 12, according to the agency.
ICE attributed the death to “natural causes.” Brutus showed no signs of distress during intake nor had a medical history of cardiovascular issues, the agency said. 
Lawmakers take first step in banning ICE agents from wearing masks

This marks the first death of a Delaney Hall detainee since it opened earlier this year. Immigrant advocates are demanding more information from authorities on exactly what happened and why it took a week for ICE to announce Brutus’ death.
Kathy O’Leary, an activist who holds vigils at the detention center, said she was there last week when an ambulance pulled onto the jail’s property, and she heard discussions of someone having a medical emergency over guards’ walkie-talkies. That ambulance was held up leaving the jail by a van dropping off new detainees, she added. 
It wasn’t until ICE put out the statement Thursday evening that she learned about Brutus’ death. 
“There’s a lot of questions that we need answers to. Was he on medication that he wasn’t getting? Was he not given the correct medication? That’s something we frequently hear,” O’Leary said. “It’s pretty unusual to have a natural death at 41, so there’s a lot of questions about what happened and how he got there.”
According to ICE, the Elizabeth Police Department arrested and released Brutus four times between July 2024 and November 2025 for criminal trespassing. Immigration officials lodged a detainer and notified local police they intended to take Brutus into federal custody. Brutus was released from Union County jail without ICE being notified, the agency said. 
He was arrested again on Nov. 28 for two counts of criminal mischief and released again, despite the detainer, ICE said. He was arrested by immigration authorities on Dec. 11 and transferred to Delaney Hall. 
ICE said Brutus, originally from Haiti, entered the United States in Texas in 2023. It’s unclear if he was convicted of any of these charges. 
Amy Torres, executive director of New Jersey Alliance for Immigrant Justice, criticized ICE for using its press release announcing Brutus’ death to describe him almost entirely by the crimes he’s alleged to have committed. 
“Nothing that’s listed in that press release amounts to something that should become a death sentence. And yet, that’s what happened to him as soon as he was in ICE custody,” Torres said. 
Delaney Hall, one of the largest migrant detention centers in the country, has made headlines multiple times this year. 
It was the first new immigrant jail announced during the second Trump administration as President Donald Trump pursued his policy of detaining and deporting millions of undocumented immigrants. Newark Mayor Ras Baraka (D) was arrested there in May for trespassing, a charge that was quickly dropped after videos showed federal agents inviting him onto the property. Rep. LaMonica McIver (D) is likely heading to trial over charges of assaulting two agents as they moved to arrest Baraka. And in June, four detainees escaped during an uprising at the detention center.
Immigrant advocates say detainees regularly report inhumane treatment, like a lack of toilet paper, inedible food, and overcrowding in the units. 
Activists said lawmakers should be paying more attention to what’s going on at Delaney Hall on a regular basis. 
Sen. Cory Booker (D) said in a statement he is “deeply concerned” about Brutus’ death. Booker noted he opposes private detention centers and has condemned the inhumane conditions at Delaney Hall. 
“There must be a clear accounting of what happened in this tragedy, and Delaney Hall must be closed so that this stain can be removed from our community of Newark,” he said.
McIver called the death an “outrage” and echoed calls for more details on Brutus’ confinement and treatment. She also said the jail should be closed.
“This tragedy is not an isolated incident, and we have seen neglect, abuse and cruelty from this administration as they strip people of the rights this country affords everyone, including those in detention,” she said. “This incident demands immediate answers.”

Joseph Schwartz, 65, of New York, was three months into a three-year federal sentence for tax fraud when President Donald Trump pardoned him in November.
Attorney General Tim Griffin filed a petition on Dec. 2 asking a Pulaski County Circuit Court judge to require Schwartz to serve the rest of his Arkansas sentence on Medicaid fraud and state tax evasion charges. The 12-month state sentence was to run concurrently with his federal sentence, according to his plea deal with Arkansas.
Pulaski County Circuit Judge Karen Whatley on Thursday rejected defense lawyers’ argument that the three months Schwartz served in federal prison made him immediately eligible for parole. She said parole eligibility is determined by the Department of Corrections, not the court, the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette reported. She ordered Schwartz to report to the Ouachita River Correctional Unit by 2 p.m. Dec. 29.
Griffin, in a statement, said he was pleased with the court’s decision.
“Schwartz still owes the State of Arkansas nine months of incarceration per his plea deal,” Griffin said. “The status of Schwartz’s federal case has no bearing on his obligations to the State, and it is completely appropriate that he be mandated to serve out the remainder of his sentence.”
Schwartz’s attorney did not immediately return a call seeking comment Friday morning.
Schwartz, an insurance broker, owned Skyline Healthcare LLC, which operated from an office above a pizzeria in New Jersey. The company originally owned six nursing homes in 2005 but expanded rapidly after 2015, operating more than 100 nursing homes across 11 states at its peak before declaring bankruptcy in 2018. It operated 22 nursing homes in Arkansas, about 10% of the state’s long-term care facilities, the Democrat-Gazette reported in 2019.
In April, Schwartz was sentenced in federal court in New Jersey to 36 months in prison for failing to pay $38 million in withholding taxes for employees of his nursing home empire and failure to file required IRS forms about employee benefit plans. He was also ordered to pay $5 million in restitution, which Trump’s pardon negated.
Schwartz pleaded guilty in the Arkansas case in May to the felony charges related to Medicaid. He was ordered to pay $1.8 million in fines and reimbursements. Court records show he made the first quarterly payment of $133,203 to the state’s Medicaid Trust Fund and the attorney general’s Medicaid Fraud Unit in August.
In his statement, Griffin said Schwartz “submitted false and misleading information” that affected the daily rates paid to Skyline’s nursing homes in the state.
“He also failed to pay insurance premiums for employees, neglected grocery bills — forcing staff to buy food for residents — and paid himself as an employee in multiple facilities. Two of his Arkansas nursing homes were later placed into receivership by the Arkansas Department of Human Services,” Griffin said.
“Schwartz didn’t just take advantage of our vulnerable population, he also preyed on Arkansans who worked in his facilities,” Griffin said.
The Washington Post reported in November that Schwartz paid right-wing lobbyists $960,000 to secure the federal pardon. The Trump administration denied the lobbying influenced the decision, calling such spending a foolish waste of money.
In defending the pardon, the White House said the three-year federal sentence was “exceptionally harmful to a 65-year-old man already in deteriorating health.”

“We’re this mix of vulnerable and unprepared and all of a sudden facing this threat,” one UVM researcher said.

When deciding where to live when beginning her PhD, Anna Maassel was drawn to UVM for Vermont’s relative respite from climate catastrophes. Then, the summer before she moved here, the state was slammed with historic flooding and coated in a hazy smoke from Canadian wildfires. 
Just over two years after the fires of 2023, Maassel, a doctoral candidate at UVM’s Rubenstein School of Environment and Natural Resources, is the lead author on a paper just published in the journal Environmental Health. She and her co-authors found that the smoke from those 2023 wildfires was linked with worsened asthma outcomes for children in the Northeast. 
The study is among the first of its kind to look at the health implications of wildfire smoke in the Northeast. Although the correlation of smoke and pediatric asthma has been well studied on the West Coast, scientists are only just starting to look at the specifics of smoke in New England, a region less prone to widespread fires. The smoke from the 2023 Canadian fires served as something of a local wakeup call, Maassel said.
“We’re this mix of vulnerable and unprepared and all of a sudden facing this threat,” she told VTDigger in an interview. 
Vermont has one of the highest rates of pediatric asthma in the country — one analysis found that in Vermont, 8.3% of people under the age of 17 have asthma, according to 2023-24 data from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. That’s higher than the nationwide average of 6.8%. 
Maassel’s study, which she co-authored with Keith Robinson, a pediatric pulmonologist at UVM Health’s Golisano Children’s Hospital, found that patients struggled to manage their asthma more in the post-fire summers of 2023 and 2024 than in 2022. 
Robinson said his team received a high volume of calls from parents concerned about their child’s asthma symptoms during the summer of 2023. 
The paper supports his memory. He and Maassel scoured medical records from UVM Health to assess 900 young patients with asthma seen by one of the hospital network’s clinicians between 2022 and 2024. They looked at three different assessments that clinicians use in medical records to track asthma plans and management. The researchers found worse management in the years following the wildfire smoke.
Maassel said she hopes the research can help guide clinicians and parents as they help children manage their asthma. 
Summer, for instance, has historically seen better asthma outcomes, in part because people are not battling winter colds and flu. It’s often when providers consider phasing patients off of their daily controller medications. Awareness of air quality can help clinicians time that better in the future, Maassel said. 
Parents, too, can watch out for dangerous air quality levels to know when to close their windows, run an air purifier or encourage their child to avoid intense activity. They can also come up with an emergency management plan, like resuming use of a controller medication and having a rescue medication on hand. 
“Even during these short periods of bad wildfire smoke or minor wildfire smoke, where the air quality index spikes to a medium risk level, it is still really important to take those protective actions,” Maasel said.
It’s a reminder for the region that people will need to become much more familiar with wildfire smoke in the future. 
“It’s not going to be an isolated incident,” Maassel said of the 2023 fires. “It’s here, and it’s here sooner than people expected.”

(Photo by Ashley Murray/States Newsroom)Earlier this week, Montana’s junior Senator, Tim Sheehy, said that after a closed-door briefing with other Senators and Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, he’s standing by the controversial boat strikes in the Caribbean.
Those strikes have been the subject of controversy, as President Donald Trump has used military intervention to hit boats his administration says are transporting illegal drugs to the United States. Trump has said that the drugs are “weapons of mass destruction” and therefore the use of the military is justified.
But increasing concerns were raised when it was reported Hegseth gave the orders for a second strike on a boat which appears to have been disabled, leaving only a couple of survivors. Hegseth has denied he gave the order to kill the remaining people on one of those boats, raising questions about whether an order to kill the survivors was legal, or contrary to international law.
To date, the Pentagon and the Trump administration has not released video footage of the incident, despite pressure from some members of Congress.
Tim Sheehy speaks to reporters about the U.S. military striking boats in the Caribbean in Washington, D.C. (Screenshot Tim Sheehy Senate X account).
After the briefing, Sheehy said he had been a part of dangerous boat strikes as a member of the U.S. Navy’s SEALS, and said he trusted Hegseth. In a message posted to Sheehy’s X account, he said:


        “To go after brave men and women in uniform, who are conducting these attacks is to indict the system that was used in bipartisanly for the past 24 years. I personally was involved in many of these operations, from kinetic strikes to direct action operations. And the process we have is legally sound; it has been supported for a quarter century now about how we find them, fix them and finish them. And keep in mind, if we don’t finish them, and we decide to interdict, as is being said by many folks, we have an obligation to send a team to interdict, but when we make that decision, you’re putting our lives at risk — putting American lives at risk. Just about a year-and-a-half ago, remember two SEALS were killed interdicting a drug vessel at night on the Red Sea. Interdicting a vessel underway is perhaps the most dangerous mission we have in our entire inventory. When we task our commanders to go out and attack a vessel under way, that’s an incredibly high-risk mission, so that when folks say that we should be interdicting, that’s easy for you to say here in this building, in between two cups of cappuccino. It’s a lot hard to send that 24-year-old operator out there who has a wife and kids and tell him in the middle of the night that he has dive off the side of a helicopter, scuba dive under a ship, climb up the side of that, and fight your way onto a vessel, because we’re more worried about the lives of drug dealers than we are with our own people?”

(Photo by Nadia Engenheiro, Half Street Group) A U.S. Department of Justice attorney informed a federal Rhode Island judge Friday morning that the Trump administration intends to issue a new funding notice for homeless support services before the end of the business day.
That news posed a potential obstacle for Judge Mary S. McElroy, who was considering a request to block the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) from revamping funding priorities for its Continuum of Care grant program.
A group of democratic-led states, along with another coalition of communities and homeless care providers, sought a preliminary injunction after HUD issued a Nov. 13 Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO) that would have capped how much of the $3.9 billion grant program could be used for permanent supportive housing at 30%. 
HUD has previously directed approximately 90% of Continuum of Care funding to support permanent supportive units as part of its “Housing First” philosophy, according to the lawsuit from the coalition of states. 
 “Why today by the close of business?” McElroy asked John Bailey, a U.S. Department of Justice attorney representing HUD, during the roughly 90-minute virtual hearing that began at 10 a.m. “The timing seems to be strategic.” 
But after a five-minute recess, the first-term Trump appointee ruled to temporarily block the now withdrawn notice of funding opportunity for federal fiscal 2025 grants, noting the harm a lack of action could inflict. HUD withdrew the contested notice on Dec. 8, an hour before McElroy’s first hearing on the lawsuits.
“The withdrawal of the operative NOFO and the delayed and conditional replacement guarantee funding gaps,” she said. “And we don’t know what the agency intends to do.” 
Previously, HUD embraced the “Housing First” philosophy, which prioritizes getting people quickly into safe, stable housing ahead of other treatment and enforcement with no preconditions. Instead, the Trump administration wants the majority of grant funding to go toward transitional housing with work requirements. 
A coalition of states co-led by Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha filed suit over HUD’s latest funding notice on Nov. 25. On Dec. 1, a group of cities and nonprofits led by the National Alliance to End Homelessness and the National Low Income Housing Coalition filed a separate 85-page lawsuit. The coalition includes Crossroads Rhode Island and Youth Pride as well as the County of Santa Clara, California, Washington’s King County, and the cities of San Francisco, Boston and Cambridge, Massachusetts, Nashville, and Tucson, Arizona. 
Plaintiffs argue the Trump administration violated the Administrative Procedure Act by rescinding the initial two-year grant notice and crafting a new set of rules many care providers argue will leave 170,000 Americans homeless, including about 1,000 in Rhode Islanders.
Bailey argued Friday that the agency has the broad authority to make changes in order to comply with the president’s executive orders.
“The government is acting reasonably,” Bailey said.
McElroy contested that the directive is a policy change, which would require an act of Congress or more formal rulemaking as set in the Administrative Procedure Act.
“HUD can’t decide tomorrow that it doesn’t want to house homeless people,” she said. “There are parameters set forth by Congress — that’s sort of how our system works. And you have to follow them just like I do.”
Attorneys for the Trump administration argued the joint cases were moot now that HUD has withdrawn the funding notice.
Kristin Bateman, an attorney representing local communities and nonprofits and a senior counsel with Democracy Forward, argued that withdrawal still left a critical funding gap for homeless services starting early next year. Most federal fiscal 2024 grants start to expire in January.
“This is causing serious, serious harm to plaintiffs and their ability to carry out their missions” she said. “Individuals, families with children, veterans, victims of domestic violence are going to lose their housing in the middle of winter.”
Rhode Island’s network of care providers is spared from that early funding lapse. 
Sarah Saint Laurent, coordinator for the state’s Continuum of Care, told Rhode Island Current that the earliest contract tied to the federal fiscal 2024 grants ends in March.










HUD can't decide tomorrow that it doesn’t want to house homeless people. There are parameters set forth by Congress — that’s sort of how our system works. And you have to follow them just like I do.


– Judge Mary S. McElroy


McElroy said the preliminary injunction will remain in effect until a “lawful” funding notice goes out. While the wait for a new funding notice continues, the coalition of cities and nonprofits issued a statement doubting there will be any change.
“The Trump-Vance administration has suggested it would double-down on its unlawful and unreasonable effort to kick people out of housing and back into homelessness with a new policy shift,” the coalition stated. “We will continue to pursue this case and remain dedicated to protecting proven solutions to homelessness and the hundreds of thousands of people who rely on this housing support.”
HUD says reforms overdue
The Housing First philosophy is not without its critics. Pallet, the Washington state-based company that built ECHO Village, Rhode Island’s first community of tiny temporary shelters in Providence, published a recent blog post suggesting that HUD’s overhaul could bring more accountability in ensuring the formerly unhoused get help beyond just a place to live.
Amy King, Pallet’s CEO, told Rhode Island Current Friday she understands providers’ frustrations over the administration’s overhaul, but noted not all organizations properly use grant funds.
“We have to figure out a good way to supplement and support good service providers and put the bad ones out of business,” she said. “And there’s a lot of them — the homeless industrial complex is real.”
A 2021 Harvard University study found that while most people in permanent supportive housing remained housed in the first year, retention dropped sharply over time — with only about 12% still housed after 10 years.
HUD has promised to craft a new notice with potential “technical corrections” a department spokesperson told Rhode Island Current in an emailed statement, adding that the agency stands by its initial changes.
“The department remains fully committed to making long overdue reforms to its homelessness assistance programs,” the spokesperson said.

Nicole Chavez (R-Albuquerque) and Sen. Crystal Brantley (R-Elephant Butte) listen during a juvenile justice town hall Dec. 15, 2025 in Las Cruces. Republicans are urging Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham to put juvenile crime on the agenda for the legislative session beginning Jan. 20, 2026. (Leah Romero for Source New Mexico)New Mexico Republican lawmakers on Thursday sent a letter to Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham urging her to add juvenile crime to the agenda for next year’s legislative session.
The 30-day session starting Jan. 20 will be confined by state law to budgetary matters, along with any topics the governor specifies in her “call” for the session.
Republicans held a town hall earlier this week in Las Cruces, during which they collected testimony from law enforcement, schools, state agencies and others frustrated with the state’s perceived inaction on juvenile crime, particularly juvenile gun crime, across New Mexico.
Following the town hall, Republicans released a 32-page report with findings and recommendations for tackling juvenile crime. It found that the number of juveniles charged with first-degree murder has increased sharply since the pandemic, growing from two in 2019 to 27 in 2024. 
Despite the increase, according to the report, policy debates have focused primarily on adult crime, “leaving juvenile justice largely untouched.”
Republican legislative task force discusses juvenile crime ahead of 30-day session

That lapse has occurred even while “law enforcement officers, prosecutors, educators and victims increasingly report that juveniles who commit serious violent offenses often face inconsistent consequences and limited supervision,” the report concludes. 
One key issue Republican lawmakers say they hope the Legislature will address relates to competency determinations for young people charged with serious crimes. Multiple witnesses testified to the committee about cases in which state courts deemed young people accused of crimes to be mentally incompetent to stand trial, only for federal or independent evaluations to deem otherwise. 
“These disparities raise serious concerns about evaluation standards, accountability, and public confidence in critical legal determinations,” the Republican lawmakers wrote. 
In addition to the competency issue, Republicans recommend the Legislature “strengthen accountability measures” for violent juveniles, expand access to services, implement early warning and intervention services. 
Republicans have repeatedly championed legislation that would lower the age at which a juvenile charged with serious crimes could be tried as an adult from 15 to 14. They did so again in October during a special legislative session convened to offset upcoming federal spending cuts. Because crime bills were not on the call for that session, the bill never went anywhere.

A spokesperson for the governor’s office did not respond to Source New Mexico’s request for comment Friday morning on whether the governor will include juvenile justice on the agenda for next year’s session.
However, at the end of this year’s regular session, Lujan Grisham castigated lawmakers for not taking more action on the issue of juvenile crime amidst breaking news of a shooting in a public park involving teenagers. 
The governor’s office has previously said that “public safety” will be on the agenda.

DeWine signed Ohio Senate Bill 56, which will take effect in 90 days. He has been urging Ohio lawmakers to do something about intoxicating hemp products for the past nearly two years.

Ohio’s bill complies with recent federal changes by banning intoxicating hemp products from being sold outside of a licensed marijuana dispensary. 
In November, Congress voted to ban products that contain 0.4 milligrams of total THC per container earlier this month when they voted to reopen the government.
Those who work in the intoxicating hemp industry are worried this will put thousands of people out of business.  
DeWine line-itemed vetoed the THC-infused beverage provision in the bill that would have allowed five milligram THC beverages to be manufactured, distributed, and sold in Ohio until Dec. 31, 2026.
“My veto means that they cannot be sold,” DeWine said during a Friday press conference. 
“…The simplest thing, frankly, to do is to stop it right now instead of going until the date in November set by federal law.” 
DeWine said he does not think THC beverages are a good idea. 
“I think they create extra problems,” DeWine said. 
Ohio S.B. 56 had a provision that said if the federal government legalizes THC beverages, Ohio will consider “a more robust regulatory framework of these products,” according to the bill’s language. 
“We got to this point because of poorly drafted federal legislation and people taking advantage of it,” Ohio House Speaker Matt Huffman, R-Lima, said. 
“So speculating about what the federal government may do in the future and what we may do as a result, I think, adds to the same problem that has already been created.”
‘This bill is going to put …. me out of business.’ Ohioans in hemp industry fear potential new law

On the marijuana side, the bill would reduce the THC levels in adult-use marijuana extracts from a maximum of 90% down to a maximum of 70%, cap THC levels in adult-use flower to 35%, and prohibit smoking in most public places. 
The bill gets rid of protections against discrimination for housing, employment, and organ donation. It also allows police to have probable cause during traffic stops is someone is a known user of marijuana. 
The bill prohibits possessing marijuana in anything outside of its original packaging and criminalizes bringing legal marijuana from another state back to Ohio. It also requires drivers to store marijuana in the trunk of their car while driving. 
Ohio S.B. 56 would give 36% of adult-use marijuana sale revenue to municipalities and townships that have recreational marijuana dispensaries.
The bill also maintains the 10% tax rate on recreational marijuana and keeps home grow the same at six plants per adult and 12 per residence. It also places a cap on 400 marijuana dispensaries in the state. 
Ohioans passed a citizen-initiated law to legalize recreational marijuana in 2023 with 57% of the vote. Sales started in August 2024 and exceeded $702.5 million in the first year. 
Ohio lawmakers can change the law since it passed as a citizen initiative not a constitutional amendment, something they have been trying to do since late 2023. 
Ohioans for Cannabis Choice said they will be launching a referendum campaign
“S.B. 56 forcefully defies the will of the voters of Ohio,” said Dennis Willard, spokesperson for Ohioans for Cannabis Choice. “We believe voters will say no to government overreach, no to closing 6,000 small businesses and pink-slipping thousands of workers across the state, and no to once again re-criminalizing hemp and marijuana.”

After leaving state government, he’s now a vice president for the company, which has benefited from state grant and loan approvals totaling $69 million.
All the while, the chairman of the state board that approved some of the aid, Jeff Erickson, has also been a member of the CJ Schwan’s board of directors.
The state funding is helping CJ Schwan’s with the construction of a $550 million food production plant in Sioux Falls that will have an estimated 600 employees — a project that the Governor’s Office of Economic Development has described as the largest single private investment in South Dakota history. The company, which is part of a South Korean global conglomerate known as CJ Group, has also opened an office in downtown Sioux Falls.
State Board of Economic Development minutes say Erickson abstained from discussion and votes on financial assistance for the company. Westra’s LinkedIn page indicates he waited a year after leaving state government to begin working for CJ Schwan’s, which is the state’s legally required waiting period for former state employees to benefit from a contract they were involved with, or to enter into a new contract with the state.

Yet lawmakers and others from both sides of the political aisle are questioning the ethics of the situation.
Former state Sen. Reynold Nesiba, D-Sioux Falls, served on the state Board of Economic Development until last year. He said Erickson’s dual roles on the CJ Schwan’s corporate board and a state board that’s approved tens of millions of dollars in aid for the company are “deeply problematic.” To avoid the appearance of impropriety, Nesiba said, Erickson should give up one position or the other.
“Serving both simultaneously tarnishes the reputation of both institutions,” Nesiba said.
Sen. Tim Reed, R-Brookings, is the former CEO of the Brookings Economic Development Corp. He said the jobs and tax revenue generated by the CJ Schwan’s project will be a win for South Dakota and Sioux Falls, but “the optics” of Westra’s transition “are absolutely terrible.”
“I think there are some concerns with this,” Reed said. “The safeguards are supposed to be there with the one-year statute, but is that enough? I think we may need to revisit that.”
Rep. Erik Muckey, D-Sioux Falls, said lawmakers should investigate Westra’s conduct.
“This is a serious issue and a potential conflict of interest that deserves the full weight of the Legislature looking into it,” Muckey said.
Nesiba, Reed and Muckey had not been aware that CJ Schwan’s hired Westra until South Dakota Searchlight informed them.
Responses to concerns
Westra did not respond to multiple South Dakota Searchlight messages. CJ Schwan’s said in an email that Westra “is currently employed by CJ Schwan’s to advise on business development and government relations matters. He was hired after he left state government. At no time did anyone from the company discuss potential employment with Mr. Westra while he was involved with state government.”
Reed and Muckey are two of the four non-voting legislative members of the state Board of Economic Development, serving alongside 13 citizen appointees, including Erickson. Reed said Erickson “recuses himself and does not participate in the discussion” when matters involving CJ Schwan’s arise.

Erickson was required to file a financial interest statement with the state to serve on the Board of Economic Development. He disclosed in his 2017 statement — the most recent one available from the South Dakota Secretary of State’s Office — that Schwan’s was one of numerous businesses supplying him, his spouse or his children with more than 10% control or more than $2,000 of annual family income.
When Searchlight asked Erickson for further information about those disclosures, he mentioned his abstention from matters pertaining to CJ Schwan’s and said he disclosed his conflict to the rest of the state Board of Economic Development. Although he serves on the CJ Schwan’s board of directors, Erickson told Searchlight in a written statement, “I have no ownership interest in this company and have not financially benefited in any way from this project.” In response to Nesiba’s assertion that Erickson should give up his state board or corporate board position, Erickson said he disagrees and stands by his statement.
CJ Schwan’s said Erickson “was asked by one of our shareholders to represent their interests on our board, and his service began years before any discussions or plans related to our South Dakota project even began.” Erickson began serving on the company’s board in 2016. He had already been a longtime member of the state Board of Economic Development by then, with minutes showing him in the chairman’s role as early as 2012.

State aid approvals benefiting CJ Schwan’s

$6.7 million grant from the Future Fund — a pool of economic development money controlled by the governor — to the Sioux Falls Development Foundation for land in an industrial park that the foundation developed and transferred to CJ Schwan’s for its construction of a food production plant.
Up to $15 million in rebates of state sales taxes paid on project construction and equipment, via the Reinvestment Payment Program.
$15 million low-interest loan from the Revolving Economic Development and Initiative Fund to support construction of the plant.
$30 million more from the Future Fund, paid in two $15 million installments to the Sioux Falls Development Foundation, to reimburse CJ Schwan’s for construction costs including an on-site wastewater treatment facility.
$448,000 grant from the Local Infrastructure Improvement Program to the Sioux Falls Development Foundation for gas-line infrastructure at the project site.
Another $1.55 million grant from the Future Fund to the Sioux Falls Development Foundation for gas-line infrastructure at the project site.

Total: $69 million.



The state first pledged assistance for a CJ Schwan’s project in 2021. Then-Gov. Kristi Noem’s administration committed to providing $6.7 million in grants through the Governor’s Office of Economic Development, which Westra led at the time. He left his state government job in May 2023.
Since May 2024 — the month Westra began working for CJ Foods, according to his LinkedIn profile — the company’s project has been approved for another $32 million in state grants, a $15 million low-interest state loan, and up to $15 million in state sales tax rebates.
From ice cream trucks to food production
Schwan’s was founded as a family company during the 1950s in Minnesota. It was known for its yellow trucks and delivery drivers who went door-to-door selling ice cream and frozen food.
Over time, the company grew to include the production of frozen foods for grocery stores and the food-service industry. The transformation culminated in that part of the business being acquired in 2019 by CJ CheilJedang, a subsidiary of South Korea-based CJ Group, for a price reported at the time as $1.84 billion. CJ Group, which is publicly traded in Korea, disclosed revenues of about $30 billion last year. The Schwan’s home delivery service, which was not part of the acquisition, has since been shut down.

The company first contacted the state in the fall of 2019 — the year Noem became governor and hired Westra to lead the economic development office. The company said it was planning a major project in one of several states. South Dakota officials met with the company over the course of a year to discuss the project and potential state incentives.
“GOED has actively recruited Minnesota businesses, particularly those with strong ties to South Dakota, for years — CJ Schwan’s is one such business,” said a statement from the state economic development office to South Dakota Searchlight. “Their Sioux Falls project emerged in 2020 through GOED’s ‘South Dakota Means Business’ campaign and the subsequent hard work of many in Sioux Falls and at GOED.”
Westra explained the campaign’s philosophy in 2020.
“We hear over and over from business owners in Minnesota and other states that increased government regulations are making it difficult to earn a profit and plan for growth,” Westra said at the time. “We want to get the word out that it doesn’t have to be this way.”
Near the end of 2020, the company had narrowed potential sites to two states. In January 2021, CJ Schwan’s announced its selection of a site in northern Sioux Falls.
“The combination of the state’s highway infrastructure, geographic proximity to serve our customers, and South Dakota’s pro-business environment were all factors in our decision,” the company said in a statement to South Dakota Searchlight, explaining its choice of the site.
The company hopes to open its Sioux Falls plant next year with 600 full-time jobs paying an average of $19 per hour. The facility will include production lines for the bibigo brand of steamed dumplings and egg rolls marketed to the food-service industry, the company said last year, plus a warehouse, distribution center and office space.
“Projects of this scale and complexity are only possible through strong business/government partnership,” the company said, “and the state of South Dakota has provided outstanding support to us.”
Incentives begin
Westra signed the agreement promising the state’s first assistance to CJ Schwan’s, which is dated Sept. 30, 2021. It was a commitment to provide $6.7 million in grants from the state’s Future Fund to the Sioux Falls Development Foundation. The state paid the money to the development foundation in 2024, when the foundation transferred land in its Foundation Park to CJ Schwan’s for the project.
“It covered what it cost us to develop the land,” said Bob Mundt, president and CEO of the foundation, adding that the land transfer to CJ Schwan’s was “part of our contribution to help bring them here.”
Mundt declined to comment on the ethical concerns expressed by lawmakers but offered comments on the worthiness of the CJ Schwan’s project.
Noem’s uses of credit cards and an economic fund cause lawmakers to propose restrictions

“This is a great project for the city and state of South Dakota,” Mundt said. “We feel that it has tremendous potential for growth and expansion in the future.”
Mundt said another state competing for the project had a site ready to go, making the land important in the competition to recruit the company to Sioux Falls.
The source of the initial state aid for the project, the Future Fund, is a pool of money that was created in 1987 at the request of then-Gov. George Mickelson. It was placed under the exclusive control of the governor, with the intent of enabling the state’s chief executive to respond quickly when economic opportunities arise.
State law mandates only that the fund be used “for purposes related to research and economic development for the state.” The money comes from South Dakota employers, who pay a fee to the Future Fund when they submit payroll taxes to the unemployment benefits program.
Noem sparked controversy and bipartisan lawmaker criticism with several uses of the Future Fund, including a fireworks show at Mount Rushmore, a Rapid City-area shooting range that legislators refused to pay for, a Governor’s Cup rodeo in Sioux Falls, and a workforce recruitment campaign that Noem starred in.
Lawmakers on a government oversight committee recently endorsed a draft bill that would take some control of the fund away from the governor. The bill would require each Future Fund grant to be approved by a majority of the Board of Economic Development, which already has oversight of other economic development programs.
Sen. Taffy Howard, R-Rapid City, plans to introduce the bill during the legislative session that begins in January. She said the Future Fund is one of a range of government financial incentives for businesses that “need more transparency, objectivity and unbiased oversight than we have now.”
State aid continues
Noem’s office announced in April 2023 that Westra would step down as economic development commissioner on May 22 of that year. Further aid would not begin flowing toward the CJ Schwan’s project until 2024, by which time Westra was a company employee. On his LinkedIn profile, Westra lists his title as senior vice president of business development and his start date as May 2024.
In August 2024, the state Board of Economic Development — chaired by Erickson, but with him abstaining as he did on each discussion and vote related to CJ Schwan’s — approved up to $31.5 million for the company from the state’s Reinvestment Payment Program. It provides rebates of state sales taxes paid on qualifying construction and equipment expenses. That approval and some of the other aid benefiting CJ Schwan’s went to SFC Global Supply Chain, which has been described as a subsidiary of CJ Schwan’s in company documents.
The sales tax rebate has since been reduced to a maximum of $15 million. The company previously planned a $750 million project with 650 employees. Those figures have since changed to $550 million and 600 jobs.

The state board additionally approved two loans to the company in September 2024 through the state’s Revolving Economic Development and Initiative Fund. It provides low-interest loans to help finance land, buildings and equipment for business expansions and relocations. The CJ Schwan’s project was initially awarded two REDI loans totaling $25 million, but those commitments expired before the loans were taken out, and the loans were not made. Instead, the state board approved a $15 million REDI loan in October of this year.
CJ Schwan’s conducted a ceremonial groundbreaking for its Sioux Falls project in November 2024.
The next month, the Noem administration pledged another $30 million from the Future Fund. The grant was split into two $15 million awards to the Sioux Falls Development Foundation so it could reimburse some of CJ Schwan’s construction costs, including building an on-site wastewater treatment facility. The first $15 million was paid out that month, and the second $15 million was provided in June this year.
The Governor’s Office of Economic Development said both of the $15 million grants were approved by the Noem administration before Noem resigned in January to accept the top job at the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. Her departure elevated her lieutenant governor, Larry Rhoden, to governor.
“The current administration’s role has been to review progress and release funds only after the required milestones were met,” the state economic development office said in a statement to Searchlight.
The office also said that when CJ Schwan’s selected South Dakota, Sioux Falls required the company to build a wastewater treatment facility that the company would not have been required to build in other states.
“To present a competitive bid for the project to move forward, the state agreed to a Future Fund grant to offset those additional costs,” the office said. “But for this grant, CJ Schwan’s would have chosen a state without this requirement.”

In March of this year, the state Board of Economic Development approved a $448,000 grant to the Sioux Falls Development Foundation from the state’s Local Infrastructure Improvement Program for natural gas infrastructure supporting the CJ Schwan’s project site.
Construction work at the site began in May this year, and in June, Rhoden awarded another $1.55 million grant from the Future Fund to the Sioux Falls Development Foundation to further assist with the natural gas infrastructure at the site. The work funded by the infrastructure grant and the latest Future Fund grant will also benefit the broader industrial park around CJ Schwan’s as it continues to develop.
The latest Future Fund award brought the total amount of Future Fund assistance for the project to about $38 million.
The total of all state grants and loans initially approved to benefit the CJ Schwan’s project added up to $95 million, but after the reductions to the REDI loans and sales tax rebates, the amount is now $69 million.
Meanwhile, CJ Schwan’s said it has pledged $250,000 to Forward Sioux Falls, a joint economic development venture of the Greater Sioux Falls Chamber of Commerce and Sioux Falls Development Foundation. The company said it has also sponsored the Sanford International golf tournament in Sioux Falls for the past three years. More than half of the construction contracts associated with the Sioux Falls project so far have been awarded to local contractors, the company said, totaling more than $75 million.
“We look forward to continuing to support the community and the vitality of the region as a corporate citizen,” the company said.
Rhoden said he is proud that South Dakota “is a destination for world-class companies like CJ Schwan’s.”
“This project will be a huge benefit to our economic growth — it’s a major feather in the cap of former Governor Noem, and the state’s investments brought South Dakota a $550 million plant that will support 600 good-paying jobs in Sioux Falls,” Rhoden said.
Political fallout
The state’s approach to economic development is one of the central issues in the campaign for next year’s Republican gubernatorial nomination, which has four candidates so far: Rhoden, who is serving the remainder of Noem’s second term, U.S. Rep. Dusty Johnson, Aberdeen businessman Toby Doeden, and state Speaker of the House Jon Hansen.
Hansen, of Dell Rapids, has made criticism of the Governor’s Office of Economic Development one of his main campaign themes, calling aid from the office “corporate welfare.” He said Westra’s transition from state economic development commissioner to an executive for a company receiving millions from that office “may be the most blatant example of crony capitalism I’ve seen yet.”
Governor race exposes divergent paths on economic development among South Dakota Republicans

“I’m committed to ending this abuse — whether through legislation this session or as the next governor — and stopping the unaccountable slush-fund spending in our government,” Hansen said.
South Dakota Democratic Party Executive Director Dan Ahlers, a former legislator, said he’s bothered by Westra’s transition — which Ahlers called a “golden parachute” — and by CJ Schwan’s being part of a global conglomerate “that doesn’t need this kind of assistance.” He said some of the state aid given to the company would have been better used “to cultivate entrepreneurship at the local level in this state for small business owners to help get their ideas off the ground.”
Sen. Michael Rohl, R-Aberdeen, said Westra’s actions in helping to arrange state aid for a company that he ended up working for “certainly appear unethical and premeditated.” Rohl voted against the state Senate’s confirmation of Westra’s reappointment to a new term as economic development commissioner in 2023 because, according to Rohl, Westra “lacked the integrity my neighbors expect.” Rohl was one of six people in the 35-member Senate to vote against Westra’s confirmation.
The CJ Schwan’s situation is not the first time Westra has faced ethical questions.
While he was serving as state economic development commissioner during the COVID-19 pandemic, companies connected to Westra and his business associates received state coronavirus relief grants, according to a 2021 South Dakota Public Broadcasting review of state records.
Hegg Companies, where Westra had long held leadership roles, was awarded $574,425 from a state small-business grant program funded with federal pandemic relief dollars. Additional corporations registered to Hegg Companies President and CEO Paul Hegg and his father, Board Chairman Peter Hegg, received roughly $3 million combined.
Westra listed income from Hegg Companies on a required financial disclosure when he joined Noem’s cabinet in 2019. Noem’s spokesman, Ian Fury, said at the time that Westra was on a leave of absence from Hegg Companies. But when Hegg Companies filed its 2020 annual report with the South Dakota secretary of state, the corporation still listed Westra as vice president and secretary.",https://southdakotasearchlight.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/547216837_1171591868126329_3211402717568117755_n-1-1024x491.jpg,,,2025-12-19 15:59:03.498354

Data centers are hubs for information technology equipment including servers, storage systems, networking equipment and other hardware for storing and distributing data. These facilities act as the infrastructure for web-based services and are used in developing artificial intelligence. 
However, these facilities demand large amounts of energy to operate and large amounts of water to cool the machinery inside, with environmental and consumer advocacy watchdogs warning these facilities can herald skyrocketing energy rates while harming drinking water access in nearby communities.

In response, state Sens. Rosemary Bayer (D-West Bloomfield), Sue Shink (D-Northfield Township) and Erika Geiss (D-Taylor) have introduced three bills to begin regulating the influx of data center facilities aiming to set up shop in Michigan.
Bayer’s Senate Bill 761 would bar entities withdrawing above an average of 2,000,000 gallons of water per day for consumptive use – where the water is lost and is not returned to the system – from obtaining a water withdrawal permit.

Shink’s Senate Bill 762 would create transparency standards on how much water and energy these facilities use, by requiring the Michigan Public Service Commission to publish annual reports regarding the total energy expenditures and water usage of data centers.
Geiss’s Senate Bill 763 would bar water utilities from passing off the infrastructure costs to accommodate a data center onto residential customers.
“We have seen hyperscale data center projects proposed in Saline, Battle Creek, Mason, and many other places throughout Michigan,” Bayer said in a statement. Residents of these communities are rightfully concerned, and by implementing additional guardrails, we can protect our constituents and our natural resources.” 
Alongside support from other Senate Democrats, Sen. Jon Bumstead (R-Norton Shores) has also joined the bills as a cosponsor.

(Photo by Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Kansas Supreme Court Chief Justice Marla Luckert will step down from her position at the start of the new year and retire within weeks, she announced Friday.
Luckert, the second woman appointed to the state Supreme Court, suffered a stroke in October and temporarily withdrew from her public-facing duties. She said in a video address the decision to resign and retire was one of the hardest of her life.
“I am on a path to recovery,” she said in the video, “but I have had to face a difficult truth.”
She is unable to fully fulfill the demands of chief justice, she said. Luckert said she will resign from the office of chief justice Jan. 2 and retire weeks later, in late January or early February. As the most senior member on the court, Justice Eric Rosen, who has been serving as interim chief justice while Luckert was on medical leave, will step into the role Jan. 2.
Luckert’s retirement will give Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly a fifth installation on the court before her term is up at the end of 2026. Justices Dan Biles and Rosen will be required to retire after completing the term during which they turn 75 years old, per state law. Justice Evelyn Wilson retired in July, citing a Lou Gehrig’s disease diagnosis, and her replacement, Justice Larkin Walsh, took the bench in November. Voters in August 2026 will decide if they want to change the way state Supreme Court justices are selected. They will have the choice of switching to a popular vote system or retaining the current nomination and gubernatorial appointment process.
Luckert, 70, also announced her resignation from three national committees.
Before the Supreme Court, she was a district judge in Shawnee County, becoming the first woman in Kansas to be a chief district judge.
“I wanted small town Kansas children, including girls, to see themselves reflected in positions of leadership and to know their voices, their intelligence and their perseverance matter,” she said.
Luckert was born in Goodland, and she obtained undergraduate and law degrees at Washburn University in Topeka. She worked in private practice before Gov. Joan Finney appointed her to the district court.
Gov. Bill Graves appointed Luckert to the Supreme Court in 2003, where she has sat for 22 years. She became chief justice in 2019 following the retirement of former Chief Justice Lawton Nuss.
“Serving as chief justice has given me a front row seat to the courage and compassion that define our judicial system,” Luckert said. “I have watched judges make difficult decisions with integrity. Courts staff treat people with dignity during their most vulnerable moments, and employees adapt to change with grace and resolve.”
Rosen said in a news release Luckert’s time on the bench has been “fraught with challenge.” He lauded her efforts to build relationships in state government and overcome major obstacles. She made the court system “stronger, more resilient and better prepared for the future,” he said.
Luckert said Kansas’ three branches of government have come together during her tenure to create a “more accessible, more efficient and better equipped” judiciary that can “respond to complex issues such as mental illness and the needs of children in care.”
“That spirit of cooperation gives me great hope for the future,” Luckert said, “and confidence that the three branches can continue to build upon that foundation, and to continue to strengthen a dedicated court system designed to bring accessible justice to all.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/P1111150-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-12-19 15:59:03.498354

(Photo by Joshua Haiar/South Dakota Searchlight))COLUMBIA — More than 220 people in South Carolina are in quarantine for measles heading into Christmas week, after the number of cases in a monthslong outbreak hit 144, the state health department said Friday.
All the exposures so far have come from Spartanburg County, primarily through schools and a church in Inman, according to the Department of Public Health. Over the past week, the department has reported 18 new cases.
More than three-quarters of those in quarantine are school children, according to the health department. All four schools involved are in Spartanburg County districts, where winter break begins Monday. Under state policies, if a student at a school tests positive for measles, all unvaccinated children must remain home for 21 days, which is the maximum amount of time it can take a person to become sick after exposure.
SC sees ‘alarming’ increase in measles cases, with 280 in quarantine

Around 10% of Spartanburg County students did not complete their vaccination forms this year, leading to one of the lowest vaccination rates among students in the state, according to health department data.
Public health officials expect the number of cases to rise in the coming weeks as people gather for the holidays, state epidemiologist Linda Bell told reporters. More cases are expected out of quarantine, as people in close contact with those who are contagious become ill, she said.
Of those infected, 94% were unvaccinated, Bell said. Vaccination is the only way to prevent measles cases, she added.
Vaccinated people traveling to the Upstate don’t need to worry about bringing the disease home, since this isn’t a carrier virus, Bell said.
Receiving one dose of the vaccine, typically administered in two doses during childhood, within three days of exposure to measles can prevent an infection. Vaccines are also available at doctors’ offices, public health clinics, and by request through state-run mobile vaccine units.
Symptoms of measles typically begin between one and three weeks after exposure, starting with a cough, runny nose, red and watery eyes, and a fever. Following that, people who are infected develop a red, blotchy rash that typically begins on the face before spreading to the rest of the body.
Measles can cause severe illness, potentially leading to pneumonia or even death, especially in young children. The state health department has not received any reports of serious complications, Bell has said.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/measles-vaccine-1024x719.jpg,,,2025-12-19 15:59:03.498354

(Photo by Jay Waagmeester/Florida Phoenix)A dozen gun-violence prevention groups are calling upon Florida Senate President Ben Albritton to once again reject a proposal from the Florida House to lower the age to purchase a long gun from 21 to 18 years old.
A measure (HB 133) that would repeal the 2018 law that raised the legal age for such purchases to 21 has already passed two committees in the Florida House and is now up for a vote in the full House of Representatives when the Legislature kicks off the 2026 session next month.
That regulation is part of a package of gun safety reforms enacted by the GOP-controlled Legislature and signed into law by then-Gov. Rick Scott in 2018. The bipartisan vote approving those measures came just weeks after a 19-year-old legally purchased an AR-15 and murdered 17 students and teachers at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland.
The Florida House has passed similars measures over the past three legislative sessions, but each time they have died in the Florida Senate. And with four weeks left before the 2026 legislative session commences, no Senate companion measure has yet been filed.
“President Albritton, we urge you to use your authority as Senate President to prevent HB 133 from becoming law,” reads a portion of the letter. “Remember the priorities made after our state’s darkest day. Remember those who buried their loved ones because a teenager could access a gun. Honor the bipartisan commitment lawmakers made in 2018: never again. Refuse to file a companion bill to HB 133, as you have done in previous years.”
Among the groups signing the letter are March For Our Lives, Brady Florida, the League of Women Voters Florida, and the Campaign to Keep Guns Off Campus.
“Young people in Florida deserve to grow up without wondering whether the teenager sitting next to them can legally buy a weapon of war,” said March for Our Lives executive director and Parkland survivor Jackie Corin in a statement. “We call on state leaders to block HB 133 and to honor the promises they made to our communities and to the lives already lost.”
Although the Senate has shown no inclination in the past to approve the measure, gun-safety advocates are concerned right now that the Senate might swallow the idea in a tradeoff with the House that to curb the open carrying of firearms.
A three-judge panel of the Florida First District Court of Appeal ruled in September that the state’s 1987 law banning open carry in Florida was unconstitutional. Attorney General James Uthmeier immediately declared that open carry was now the law in the state, but that change hasn’t been put into statute yet.

Now, some of the inmates who were served the food have contracted hepatitis C, the same disease the inmate had tested positive for.
A group of 26 inmates who were in the Great Falls facility are suing in Great Falls federal court, alleging a host of violations ranging from negligence to violating their constitutional rights.
Shortly after the incident occurred, the Cascade County Sheriff’s Office put out a press release saying that the administration which operates the jail did not find out about the bleeding incident until two days later, suspended Summit Food Service, the company which contracts for meal preparation, and began testing the affected inmates.
Summit Food Service, LLC, which is incorporated in New Mexico but based in Sioux Falls, S.D., released a statement about the incident when contacted by the Daily Montanan on Friday:


        “We understand the concerns raised by the filing of a lawsuit related to this incident. While we cannot comment on ongoing litigation, we want to inform our clients, partners, and community about our response to the incident.
“This was an isolated event caused by a supervisor failing to follow Summit’s established food safety protocols. We were shocked to learn of this incident, as all Summit Food Service employees, including this supervisor, are properly trained and certified in food safety protocol. Once Summit leadership became aware, we acted immediately by investigating the matter, terminating the employee, and implementing additional safeguards.
“Summit has developed additional specialized training and passed a subsequent health department inspection. We have also expanded our crisis and compliance hotline to directly give our clients access to our dedicated food safety and crisis response teams.
“We continue to work cooperatively with the Cascade County Sheriff’s Office and Health Department. Summit remains committed to implementing improvements and ensuring that our staff provide service within the standards, values, and food safety culture of Summit.”    
According to court documents, before lunch on Sept. 28, an inmate who was assisting food preparation experienced a bloody nose. Blood fell into the food. However, when inmates tried to discard the food allegedly tainted with blood, a Summit Food Service employee demanded that pasta be served, and told staff to “scoop around (it).”
“(Summit employees) directed the inmates to place the contaminated food back into the serving line,” the court documents said.
The inmate was known to be positive for hepatitis C.
Still, inmates consumed the food, and several have since tested positive for the disease when they had previously not had it. The 26 named plaintiffs in the lawsuit said they either saw blood in the tray of food, or were later made aware that they had been served the contaminated food, court documents said.
“Plaintiffs experienced, among other things, revulsion, disgust, anger, horror, humiliation, embarrassment, despair, anxiety, worry, concern and nausea at being served food contaminated with human blood,” the lawsuit said. “Some of the plaintiffs have since tested positive for the first time in their lives with Hepatits C.”
The lawsuit says that they are likely to need medical care and treatment for the disease for the rest of their lives.
One of the counts the lawsuit raises is that being served blood-tainted food could be a violation of the inmates’ rights under the U.S. Constitution, including being free from cruel and unusual punishment.
The lawsuit also seeks punitive damages because of the situation, which attorneys Tim Bechtold, Elijah Inabnit and John Heenan, characterize as “reckless or callous disregard,” and that it happened because of an “evil motive or intent.” The attorneys said that the court should consider punitive damages, in addition to other damages, to send a strong message to other contract service providers.
On Oct. 7, Cascade County Sheriff Jesse Slaughter issued a statement.
“Upon learning of the incident, the Cascade County Sheriff’s Office acted immediately, revoking the security clearance of the SKS Kitchen Supervisor and initiating a full investigation into how contaminated food was knowingly served to inmates,” Slaughter said. “This incident is both disturbing and inexcusable. Summit Correction Services’ actions were reckless, violated every standard of sanitation and human decency, and placed individuals in unnecessary danger. The Cascade County Sheriff’s Office took swift action the moment we were informed and will ensure accountability from those responsible.”
Hepatitis C is a virus that is often spread through blood contact, according to the Mayo Clinic. In many people, the disease is asymptomatic, but it can also include jaundice, fatigue, nausea, and dark urine.
The highest risk groups include drug users, prisoners or those who have had many sexual partners. As the disease progresses, it can lead to cirrhosis, liver cancer or liver failure.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/gavel.jpg,,,2025-12-19 15:59:03.498354

(Photo: Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)A controversial proposed natural gas pipeline in North Carolina has passed the latest hurdle to move forward, receiving approval from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.
FERC announced Thursday it has approved an amendment to change the route, pipe diameter and gas-carrying capacity for the Mountain Valley Pipeline Southgate project. This means Southgate would extend the pipeline from Pittsylvania County, Virginia into Rockingham County, North Carolina. 
Opponents to Southgate say the project needed a new application, not an amendment, because the pipeline’s proposed route, size and impact have changed drastically since FERC issued the original Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity in 2020. 
Jessica Sims, Virginia field coordinator at Appalachian Voices, said Southgate will harm Virginia and North Carolina waterways and communities. 
“The project necessitated, at the very least, an environmental impact statement. Ideally, this totally revamped project should require a new application to fully consider its impacts,” Sims said. “FERC required neither and has failed impacted communities in its Southgate decision.”
Southgate has been a subject of debate since it was proposed in 2018. North Carolina’s DEQ denied a water quality permit for the project in 2020, NC Newsline previously reported. 
The controversy has continued in recent months. 
Earlier this year, environmental advocates mounted a challenge to the methane gas pipeline. In October, a FERC analysis found the project potentially redundant. 
“Right now, people want to see lower electric bills and know their drinking water is safe,” said Steph Gans, assistant director at Clean Water for North Carolina. “This decision does the opposite; it will raise bills and pollute water.”
These concerns come about as a rival pipeline undergoes a permitting process at the same time. The Williams Companies expansion of their Transco pipelines, called the Southeast Supply Enhancement Project, expects to receive a decision from FERC on a Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity in early February. 
FERC’s October analysis said the Southeast Supply Enhancement Project could eliminate needs for Southgate, NC Newsline previously reported. 
“We conclude the Transco System Alternative would be technically and economically feasible and practical,” FERC staff wrote in the document. 
In the meantime, the North Carolina DEQ’s Division of Air Quality issued permit modifications for two compressor stations associated with the Southeast Supply Enhancement Project on Thursday. 
Transco plans to upgrade two existing compressor stations along the pipeline — one in Mooresville and one in Lexington. 
“The leading preference is that neither [pipeline is] built because of the level of emissions that they would bring, and that’s locking us into decades more of fossil fuel infrastructure,” Sims told NC Newsline. “Neither project serves the communities through which it passes.”
Shawn Day, a spokesperson for MVP Southgate, said the amended project is necessary to meet public demand for natural gas and its construction and operation will not have a significant environmental impact.
He pointed out that in the October environmental assessment, FERC’s “staff analysis here does not consider non-environmental aspects of the project objectives, such as supply diversity and other market issues, which could affect the ultimate viability of the system alternative.”
Representatives for FERC did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
“We look forward to securing all necessary authorizations to build this important project, to provide homes and businesses across North Carolina with the affordable, reliable and lower-carbon energy needed to power modern life,” Day wrote in an email. 
The Virginia Department of Environmental Quality will issue its decision on a clean water permit within the next two months, followed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, according to the amendment.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Mountain-Valley-Pipeline-Photo-Ned-Oliver_Virginia-Mercury.jpg,,,2025-12-19 15:59:03.498354

(Kansas Reflector screen capture of Kansas Legislature's YouTube channel)TOPEKA — The total price of constructing research and clinical facilities for the new University of Kansas Cancer Center increased nearly $80 million to accommodate plans for additional laboratory space and in response to general inflation, tariff and labor cost spikes.
Roy Jensen, director of the KU Cancer Center, said financial requirements of transforming the campus in Kansas City, Kansas, to fulfill the promise of a coveted federal designation as a comprehensive cancer center was estimated in November 2023 to total $250 million. He said the current assessment pegged the project cost at $329 million, which would amount to a 30% escalation in the budget.
Presentations to the Kansas Legislature and Kansas Board of Regents indicated decisions to add 70,000 square feet to the project for research purposes, enough to allow 44 principal laboratories rather than the original 32, would elevate the cost by $67.5 million. Escalation in materials and labor expenses added $6 million to the bottom line. In addition, planners committed $6 million more to the contingency fund.
In May, ground was broken for the cancer center complex. The plan calls for occupancy of the new research building in February 2028. Renovation of the nearby Hemenway Life Sciences and Innovation Center would connect it to the research hub of the cancer center. The entire complex would be operational by February 2029.
“It’s going to be an incredible catalyst for, I think, further growth of the cancer center,” Jensen said. “We’re super excited to have this in progress right now.”
The cancer center complex at 39th and Rainbow campus was designed to provide patients with access to groundbreaking clinical trials and therapies, KU officials said. Physicians and researchers engaged in cancer research and treatment would be brought together to make personalized care more readily available.
Jensen said KU Medical Center attracted 8,500 new cancer patients annually, an increase from 1,700 new patients in 2004. The volume of research at the medical center has grown over the past 20 years from $14 million annually to $94 million annually, he said.
“With that significant growth, we’re in need of an expansion,” Jensen said. “We’re currently in 10 different buildings just on the medical center campus. A big reason for this project was to begin to consolidate.”
Under the revised $329 million budget endorsed by the Board of Regents, the cancer center project would rely on $75 million in state aid, $60.7 million in federal appropriations, $57.2 million in private donations, $98 million in bond debt and $38 million from cash reserves and contributions from KU Health System.
“The Legislature’s allocation of $75 million played a key role in allowing us to move forward with this project,” Jensen said. “The office of Sen. (Jerry) Moran has also been quite helpful with a number of congressionally directed spending allocations.”
Rep. Troy Waymaster, the Bunker Hill Republican chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, said unresolved pieces of the puzzle included the potential of supplemental federal funding. U.S. Senate legislation pending in Washington, D.C., would earmark $36 million more to the KU Cancer Center, which Waymaster suggested could be dedicated to reducing KU’s bond debt obligations.
Jensen said extra federal aid might moderate costs of borrowing, but the infusion also could allow shifting of resources to better incentivize hiring of cancer center researchers.
“Some of the cash on hand that’s being set aside for this building could then be used to help us to build recruiting packages to help bring new investigators to the cancer center,” he said.
In 2012, KU was federally designated by the U.S. National Cancer Institute as a clinical cancer center. KU Cancer Center was declared a comprehensive center in 2022, which was the highest level of recognition awarded by NCI.
Fifty-four comprehensive cancer centers have been established in the United States — a figure representing 1% of all cancer treatment facilities in the country, Jensen said.
“It’s impressive,” said Rep. Barbara Ballard, D-Lawrence. “I think people should know that because it didn’t happen by accident.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-Roy-Jensen-ku-cancer-center-1024x572.png,,,2025-12-19 14:58:49.858354

Tim Walz and officials with the Minnesota Department of Human Services on Friday cast doubt on a federal prosecutor’s estimate that fraud in state-run Medicaid programs since 2018 could total over $9 billion.
Assistant U.S. Attorney Joe Thompson on Thursday said providers in 14 “high-risk” programs being audited by the state have billed $18 billion since 2018, and “half or more” is possibly fraudulent.
“The fraud is not small. It isn’t isolated. The magnitude cannot be overstated,” said Thompson, who also announced new indictments.
But Walz, who is running for a third term, said the estimate is motivated by politics, and it’s a number created by the Trump administration, which has attacked the governor on multiple fronts in recent weeks.
“You’re seeing a weaponization. We’ll continue to fix (the fraud). They’re going to continue to come up with numbers that don’t have it there, and it’s sensationalized. I don’t expect anything different from this administration,” Walz said.
The governor said the goal of the “sensationalism” was to eliminate these governmental safety net programs for those who need it.
State Medicaid Director John Connolly told reporters that the Department of Human Services has evidence that substantiates fraud totaling tens of millions in these programs to date, not $9 billion. He said the U.S. attorney should turn over that evidence of fraud so DHS can stop it.
“We don’t have evidence in hand to suggest that we have $9 billion in fraud in these benefits over the last seven years,” Connolly said. “If there is evidence, we need it so that we can stop payment. That’s a very alarming number, and so if there is evidence — credible allegations of fraud — we need that information to take action now.”
Thompson — who has been a federal prosecutor since 2009 — for years led the prosecution of the Feeding Our Future fraud. That investigation mushroomed into other programs when investigators discovered that Feeding Our Future defendants had other state contracts. Thompson’s leading investigations into a state autism program and the Housing Stabilization Services program, which DHS shut down in August, citing “credible allegations of fraud.”
In July, Walz agreed with Thompson that fraud in Minnesota could exceed $1 billion.
Walz has been facing increasing scrutiny for the fraud that’s occurred under his administration. On Friday, Walz said he’s working to stop fraud on the front end and that he takes accountability for the fraud that’s occurred so far.
“This is on my watch. I am accountable for this. And more importantly, I am the one that will fix it,” Walz said.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/P1141464-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-19 14:58:49.858354

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch)Iowans eligible for a federal utility assistance program are applying for assistance at higher rates this winter than last year, according to some distributors. 
The low-income home energy assistance program is a federal program that helps qualifying households pay for part of their residential heating bill during the winter season. 
The program, which is abbreviated to LIHEAP, is administered by community action associations and the Iowa Department of Health and Human Services. 
A spokesperson for HHS said the state is seeing “a consistent slightly increased level of need” so far into the winter heating season. The spokesperson noted in an email, however, that applications are still being processed by the state and that HHS expects to have a “clearer picture” of need in the next couple of weeks. 
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Christopher Ackman, the communications and volunteers manager at Hawkeye Area Community Action Program, or HACAP, which helps to administer LIHEAP to households, said the organization has already had more than 5,700 applications for the winter season. 
Ackman said in most years, HACAP has around 11,000 applications. 
“We’re well over halfway to what we normally have in a given year, and we’ve still got until April to go,” Ackman said. “This time of year is definitely a big need, and we see a big surplus in applications.” 
Ackman said the sub-zero temperatures that most of the state endured in early December were likely a contributing factor to the increase in applications, but he said other factors like the cost of food and energy can also contribute to an increase in applications to the program.
While overall inflation rates decreased in November, according to consumer price indexes from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, prices for food at home and energy increased slightly.
HACAP, which is also a food bank and provides other services to low-income households, is experiencing “higher than normal” need at the food pantries it serves, according to Ackman. 
He said folks seeking energy assistance are typically enrolled in or utilize other programs that HACAP facilitates. Ackman said the holidays are always a time of additional need at food pantries and in the charitable sector.
“It’s definitely good to always donate to your local food pantries, your local food banks during this time of year, any local nonprofit,” Ackman said. “We work with so many other different nonprofits in the community, we’re not competing with them, so anytime you can donate to a homeless shelter or Salvation Army or whatever it may be … it just goes to the greater good of helping.” 
Utility companies also accept and offer a match on utility assistance donations. Programs, like I CARE from MidAmerican Energy, or Hometown Care Energy Fund from Alliant Energy, collect funds and donate to the local community action agencies. 
Most rural cooperatives and other utility companies offer similar services or allow customers to round up their energy bills to donate into the community network. 
Customers who qualify for LIHEAP, which requires an income at or below 200% of the federal poverty level, are also eligible for a disconnection moratorium during the cold season, from Nov. 1 through April 1. 
Rate-regulated utilities are required to report data of accounts that are past due and have been issued disconnection notices. According to the latest data compiled by the Iowa Utilities Commission, in November there were 49,299 accounts eligible for energy assistance in Iowa, 912 of which were issued disconnection notices. 
The total number of accounts eligible for energy assistance is up nearly 21% from November of 2024 and the number of accounts with disconnection notices is about 9.5% higher this year than last.
HHS said LIHEAP applications for both owner-occupied and renter-occupied households will be accepted through April 30, 2026. Applications can be found online and submitted in person, by mail, over the phone or via email. 
Expanding LIHEAP along with energy changes
LIHEAP funding was delayed during the government shutdown in October and part of November, but programs were awarded their 2026 fiscal year funds in late November. According to the Administration for Children and Families, Iowa was awarded $52.9 million for the program.
The National Energy Assistance Directors Association, which is a policy organization for state LIHEAP directors, projected that home heating costs will rise 9.2% this winter across the U.S. due to “surging” gas and electrical prices and a “colder-than-average” winter.
The organization called on Congress, according to a news release from early December, to increase funding for LIHEAP to account for “relentless increases” in the cost of electricity, food and housing. The group attributed rising energy costs to increased demand, aging grid infrastructure, higher interest rates and regional capacity shortfalls.
The association said the path forward includes “expanding renewable generation, modernizing the grid, and investing in weatherization, rooftop solar, and community solar” projects.
“The sharp rise in electric prices demands immediate attention,” Mark Wolfe, the association’s executive director said in the release. “We are urging Congress to increase final funding, so families aren’t left behind as energy costs continue to climb.”

Redadas obligan a algunos inmigrantes a evitar la atención médica,"Halle Parker, Verite News",,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/12/19/911-inmigrantes-atencion-medica/,Cada vez más inmigrantes en Nueva Orleans y Mississippi están faltando a citas médicas importantes y experimentando un mayor estrés en medio de las redadas de inmigración federales.,"Mientras inmigrantes en el sureste de Louisiana y Mississippi se preparaban para una operación del Departamento de Seguridad Nacional en diciembre, Cristiane Rosales-Fajardo recibió una llamada desesperada de una amiga.
La inquilina guatemalteca de su amiga, quien no sabía que estaba embarazada, acababa de dar a luz a un bebé prematuro en una casa en Nueva Orleans. Los padres no tenían residencia legal, y la madre se negó a ir al hospital por miedo a ser detenida por agentes de inmigración federales.
“Hay sangre por todos lados, y el bebé está muerto”, recuerda Rosales-Fajardo que le dijo su amiga.
Rosales-Fajardo se puso las sandalias, agarró guantes quirúrgicos y corrió hacia la casa.
Inmigrante de Brasil, Rosales-Fajardo es organizadora comunitaria en Nueva Orleans Este, que concentra una gran comunidad inmigrante. No tiene formación médica formal, pero tiene experiencia asistiendo partos.
Al llegar, observó la habitación. Un niño de 3 años estaba de pie a un lado mientras la madre se sentaba al borde de la cama. El padre sostenía a su hijo recién nacido envuelto en toallas empapadas de sangre; el bebé no respiraba.
“El bebé estaba completamente gris”, dijo después Rosales-Fajardo.
Le limpió la boca y le frotó la espalda antes de hacerle pequeñas compresiones en el pecho y darle respiración boca a boca.
Le dijo a los padres que debía llamar al 911 para que la madre y el bebé recibieran atención en un hospital. El bebé ya había nacido, pero el parto aún no había terminado.
“Le aseguré que iba a estar a salvo, se lo prometí”, dijo Rosales-Fajardo.
El miedo se sentía en la habitación. Aun así, hizo la llamada y continuó con la reanimación. Finalmente, el bebé reaccionó y se movió en brazos de Rosales-Fajardo. Cuando llegó la ambulancia, la madre intentó evitar que su esposo la acompañara, aterrada de que arrestaran a ambos. Él fue de todos modos.
Poniendo la seguridad sobre la salud
“Estas son personas trabajadoras”, dijo Rosales-Fajardo. “Todo lo que hacen es trabajar para mantener a su familia. Pero estuvieron a punto de perder a su hijo por no llamar al 911”.
A casi dos semanas de iniciada la operación del Departamento de Seguridad Nacional (DHS, por sus siglas en inglés) llamada Catahoula Crunch, que comenzó el 3 de diciembre, profesionales de salud y defensores comunitarios en Louisiana y Mississippi reportan un aumento inusual de pacientes inmigrantes que se han salteado citas médicas y muestran altos niveles de estrés.
Según un comunicado de prensa, el DHS había arrestado a más de 250 personas hasta el 11 de diciembre. Aunque las autoridades federales aseguran que están enfocadas en detener a personas con antecedentes penales, la agencia Associated Press (AP) informó que la mayoría de las 38 personas detenidas en los primeros dos días del operativo en Nueva Orleans no tenían historial criminal.
Desde que el presidente Donald Trump asumió el cargo en enero, las familias inmigrantes en todo el país son más proclives a evitar o posponer la atención médica, en parte por preocupaciones relacionadas con su estatus migratorio, según una encuesta reciente de KFF y The New York Times.

La encuesta reveló que casi 8 de cada 10 inmigrantes que probablemente estén viviendo en Estados Unidos sin autorización legal dijeron haber experimentado efectos negativos en su salud este año, desde ansiedad y problemas de sueño hasta el empeoramiento de afecciones como presión arterial alta o diabetes.
Las redadas migratorias federales en California, Illinois, Carolina del Norte y ahora en Louisiana y Mississippi agravan las dificultades que estas familias ya enfrentan, como el acceso limitado a servicios, barreras lingüísticas, falta de seguro médico y altos costos.
Esa renuencia a recibir atención, incluso en casos de emergencia, parece justificada en medio de las redadas.
Según la Unión Estadounidense de Libertades Civiles (ACLU, por sus siglas en inglés), los hospitales y centros de salud generalmente deben permitir el acceso de agentes federales a las áreas abiertas al público. En California, este año, agentes federales se han apostado  en salas de espera de hospitales, se han presentado en clínicas comunitarias y han custodiado a personas detenidas en habitaciones de hospital.
Incluso ir o volver de una cita médica implica un riesgo, ya que las detenciones durante controles de tránsito son una práctica común de los agentes de migración.
La enfermera Terry Mogilles, del University Medical Center (UMC), dijo que los inmigrantes suelen representar al menos la mitad de los pacientes en su clínica de traumatología ortopédica en Nueva Orleans, muchos con lesiones graves relacionadas con el trabajo en la construcción que requieren cirugía. Pero ahora, Mogilles dijo que muchos de esos pacientes no van a sus citas de seguimiento, a pesar del riesgo de infecciones.
“Llamamos y no logramos comunicarnos”, dijo Mogilles. “Es muy angustiante porque no sabemos qué les está pasando después de la operación”.
El miedo se extiende en el sur
Las autoridades federales informaron que la operación Catahoula Crunch también se lleva a cabo en el sur de Mississippi, aunque la mayoría de los arrestos iniciales ocurrieron en el área metropolitana de Nueva Orleans. Las familias inmigrantes en todo Mississippi se están preparando para lo que se avecina.
Michael Oropeza, director ejecutivo de la organización El Pueblo, que presta servicios a comunidades inmigrantes de bajos ingresos en Biloxi y Forest, dijo que han visto a familias postergar atención médica, cancelar chequeos infantiles y dejar de surtir recetas.
“No es que no valoren su salud; es que no se sienten seguros”, afirmó Oropeza. “Cuando los hospitales y clínicas dejan de ser un lugar seguro, se pierde la confianza que tomó años construir. Puede desaparecer de la noche a la mañana”.
María, una residente de Biloxi originaria de Honduras, contó en español que ella y sus dos hijos han perdido citas médicas rutinarias porque están “aterrados” de salir de casa ante el aumento de la presencia de agentes federales de migración. Su esposo, quien tiene autorización para trabajar en Estados Unidos, fue detenido durante dos meses este año.
Sus hijos son ciudadanos estadounidenses. Antes tenían cobertura de Medicaid, pero María decidió darlos de baja hace tres años por miedo a que el uso de beneficios públicos afectara las solicitudes de residencia de su familia. Ahora pagan la atención médica de sus hijos de su propio bolsillo.
Cuando se sientan seguros de volver a salir, María dijo que su prioridad será buscar atención en salud mental para abordar el estrés que ha vivido su familia.
“Yo necesito visitar un médico definitivamente para que me chequee porque no me siento bien”, dijo, al describir su ansiedad, depresión e insomnio.
En Louisiana, Marcela Hernández, de Familias Unidas en Acción, una organización sin fines de lucro que brinda ayuda directa a inmigrantes, dijo que muchas de las familias con las que trabaja viven al día. Refugiarse en casa y perder días de trabajo solo aumenta el estrés. Hernández contó que recibió 800 llamadas pidiendo comida en solo dos días, de familias que tenían miedo de salir a la calle.
Según la agencia AP, la operación federal en Louisiana y Mississippi podría extenderse por más de dos meses. Cuanto más se prolongue, más teme Hernández que comience a haber desalojos, ya que las personas no podrán pagar el alquiler, lo que traumatizaría aún más a una comunidad que a menudo ha tenido que emprender viajes peligrosos para llegar a Estados Unidos, huyendo de situaciones difíciles en sus países de origen.
“No abandonas tu país sabiendo que vas a ser violada en el camino solo porque quieres venir a conocer a Mickey Mouse”, dijo.

Rosales-Fajardo, quien dirige una organización sin fines de lucro llamada El Pueblo NOLA, comentó que muchas familias le cuentan que sus hijos han comenzado a hacerse pis encima por el miedo y el estrés.
A nivel nacional, inmigrantes en situación migratoria irregular han reportado que algunos de sus hijos tienen problemas para dormir o cambios en el rendimiento escolar o en su conducta, según la encuesta de KFF y The New York Times.
Grupos comunitarios esperan que personas de la comunidad se movilicen para llevar alimentos y productos de higiene a los hogares de inmigrantes, y que profesionales de salud ofrezcan más visitas domiciliarias o por telemedicina.
Como en otros hospitales, las salas de espera del UMC son consideradas espacios públicos, explicó Mogilles. Pero el sindicato de enfermeras pide que el hospital establezca áreas seguras a las que los agentes federales no tengan acceso y políticas claras para proteger al personal de salud que a su vez cuida a los pacientes.
Las citas postoperatorias no pueden realizarse de forma virtual, por lo que los pacientes necesitan sentirse lo suficientemente seguros para venir, explicó Mogilles.
El cuidado prenatal y postnatal también es difícil de ofrecer de forma virtual, lo que pone en riesgo la salud de embarazadas o mujeres que han parido recientemente, explicó Latona Giwa, directora ejecutiva de Repro TLC, una organización nacional de capacitación en salud sexual y reproductiva.
Desde que comenzaron las redadas en Chicago en septiembre, Giwa dijo que las clínicas y proveedores con los que trabaja reportaron que el 30% de sus pacientes no habían ido a sus citas médicas. Las farmacias reportaron una caída del 40% en la recolección de medicamentos.
“Sabemos que en el manejo de afecciones crónicas, especialmente durante el embarazo, pero también en general, incluso faltar a una sola cita puede afectar el desarrollo de la afección y empeorar los resultados del paciente”, dijo Giwa.

En Louisiana, donde los resultados de salud materna ya son deficientes, el temor al arresto podría agravar una crisis que ya se intensificó con la anulación de Roe v. Wade y poner vidas en riesgo. Giwa está especialmente preocupada por las familias con bebés prematuros en la unidad de cuidados intensivos neonatales (NICU, por sus siglas en inglés).
“Imagínate que tu bebé está en el hospital, tan vulnerable, y tú tienes miedo de ir a verlo y cuidarlo porque temes ser deportada”, dijo, señalando que la salud de un recién nacido depende en parte de la presencia de sus padres.
Esa es la situación que enfrenta la familia guatemalteca en Nueva Orleans.
En un día reciente de diciembre, Rosales-Fajardo actuó como traductora y defensora de la familia durante su primera visita para ver a su hijo en la NICU, en un hospital en la zona norte del lago Pontchartrain. El personal les dijo a los padres que necesitarían hacer ese viaje largo y riesgoso varias veces durante al menos un mes, para brindar contacto piel con piel y leche materna.
Rosales-Fajardo condujo a los padres, quienes tenían miedo de cruzar el puente por su cuenta por temor a ser detenidos. Dijo que seguirá llevándolos las veces que sea necesario.
“Cuando ven a alguien hispano manejando o algo así, ya les parece sospechoso”, dijo sobre los agentes federales.
Pero el bebé está a salvo y saludable. Y los padres nombraron a Rosales-Fajardo como su madrina.

(Leah Romero for Source NM)The New Mexico Environment Department this week ruled that a developer’s request for air quality permits at Project Jupiter, the massive proposed data center complex in Doña Ana County, is “incomplete” for now. The department gave developers until Jan. 19 to provide more information that will help them make a final decision.
Environmental advocates earlier this month alleged that developer Acoma, LLC’s plans, if approved, would allow Project Jupiter to emit as many greenhouse gases annually as New Mexico’s two largest cities combined. The November applications called for the construction of two natural gas generating stations to power the data center project and approximated they would generate about as much electricity as the entire PNM system.
Developers estimated the two gas plants would together put nearly 500 tons per year of nitrogen oxides, an important ingredient in contributing to ozone, in the air. One of the generating stations — referred to as a “microgrid,” which describes developments that generate their own electricity without drawing from a larger power company’s grid — was listed at 249.97 tons per year and the other at 248.9. Developers sought an individual permit for the microgrids, even though they will support the same development.
Critics said the developers behind Project Jupiter appeared to be evading state regulations, which classify projects with at least 250 tons per year of nitrogen oxides as “major sources” of hazardous air pollutants and subject them to arduous monitoring.
A development “that is 1.1 tons away from the 250” threshold is “not practically enforceable,” NMED officials on Wednesday wrote to Project Jupiter’s developers of one of the proposed microgrids. Air in the surrounding area will also be impacted by the nearby microgrid that is planned to produce essentially the same amount of nitrogen oxides, they wrote.
Maslyn Locke, a New Mexico Environmental Law Center senior attorney who is representing nearby residents in a lawsuit against the Doña Ana County Board of Commissioners, said she was encouraged by the NMED decision.
“This reminder that the rules still apply is a good thing,” Locke said. “Of course, it’s not going to stop everything. It’s just giving us a little more time to wrap our heads around it.”
This week, Locke’s organization sent NMED a list of demands, including that the department widely distribute materials related to the project in both English and Spanish.
BorderPlex Digital Assets, the company behind Project Jupiter, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
In another Wednesday letter, environment department officials set a Jan. 19 deadline for developers to submit more information to determine whether their application is complete. The required information includes:

Detailed information about plans for on-site diesel generators
Confirmation that emissions from “standby” generators were included in air quality modeling
A recalculation of turbine emissions “without reducing emissions by 10% based on the ‘fleet average dispatch rate of the on-line turbines’”
Documentation of how much sulfur is used to calculate certain emissions
Documentation that details “the formaldehyde emission factor”

(Photo by Alex Wong/Getty Images)Gov. Patrick Morrisey has formally requested that two members of the West Virginia National Guard who were shot last month be awarded the Purple Heart.
The award is given to service members who are wounded or killed by enemy action.
U.S. Army Spc. Sarah Beckstrom, 20, of Webster Springs, died of her wounds a day after she and U.S. Air Force Staff Sgt. Andrew Wolfe, 24, of Martinsburg, were shot in what law enforcement has called a targeted “attack” Nov. 26 blocks away from the White House in Washington, D.C. They were on duty with hundreds of other National Guard members as a part of President Donald Trump’s Operation D.C. Safe and Beautiful.
Rahmanullah Lakanwal, a 29-year-old Afghan national, was charged with one count of murder after the attack on the Guard members, as well as two counts of assault with the intent to kill, and a count of possession of a firearm during a crime of violence. Lakanwal pleaded not guilty.
“Spec. Beckstrom was killed in action while serving her country,” Morrisey told reporters Friday. “She made the ultimate sacrifice defending the freedoms we all hold dear. Her courage, her selflessness and her devotion represent the very best of West Virginia and our country.”
Doctors caring for Wolfe said last week the serviceman’s condition is improving and that he’d been moved to rehabilitation. 
“Sarah and Andrew’s actions on that day, they meet the highest standards for the Purple Heart, a decoration that recognizes those wounded or killed in action against an enemy, or during a hostile or terrorist act,” Morrisey said. “So this should qualify as a terrorist act.”
Besides the governor, retired U.S. Army Capt. James L. McCormick, a three-time Purple Heart recipient from New Haven, West Virginia, is also pushing for the two Guard members to receive the award. 
“This was an act of terrorism. This was premeditated,” McCormick told West Virginia Watch. “I pray to God Almighty that they get the Purple Heart, and that those that heroically stood up and fought off this guy that they’re properly recognized.”
Morrisey said he wants Wolfe and Beckstrom’s families to know that West Virginia stands with them. 
“I couldn’t think of two more deserving service members for this award,” Morrisey said.

(Photo by Isiah Holmes/Wisconsin Examiner)Republican leaders in the Wisconsin Legislature called Friday for Milwaukee County Judge Hannah Dugan to either resign or face impeachment after her conviction Thursday on a federal felony obstruction charge during an immigration enforcement action in the Milwaukee County courthouse in April.
“If Judge Dugan does not resign from her office immediately, the Assembly will begin impeachment proceedings,” Assembly Speaker Robin Vos (R-Rochester) and Assembly Majority Leader Tyler August (R-Walworth) said in a joint statement issued Friday.  “Wisconsinites deserve to know that their judiciary is impartial and that justice is blind. Judge Hannah Dugan is neither, and her privilege of serving the people of Wisconsin has come to an end.” 
They noted that the last time that a Wisconsin judge was impeached was in 1853. Republican lawmakers have also introduced a bill that would withhold pay for suspended judges. 
After a four-day trial, a federal court jury convicted Dugan of felony obstruction for allowing a man who was in the country without legal authorization to exit her courtroom using a non-public hallway in April. Prosecutors argued that Dugan was trying to help the man avoid plainclothes  federal immigration agents who were waiting in the public hallway outside her court. 
Judge Dugan found guilty of felony obstruction in federal trial 

The jury found Dugan not guilty on a second charge of concealing the man, Eduardo Flores-Ruiz, from federal agents. Dugan was suspended with pay by the Wisconsin Supreme Court after her arrest by FBI agents in April. 
In closing arguments, prosecutors cast Dugan as being angry due to the influx of ICE agents in the courthouse and said no one should second-guess law enforcement, including immigration officers. Defense attorneys told jurors that courthouse immigration arrests had created an environment of unease and that the federal government was trying to make an example of Dugan.
No sentencing date has been set for Dugan. Attorney Steven Biskupic, who helped represent Dugan, has said that his team plans to appeal the conviction.

Connecticut does not have the highest flu rate in the Northeast based on the latest available data, with Centers for Disease Control and Prevention regional maps showing that only a limited number of jurisdictions nationwide fall into the high or very high categories.
As of the week ending Dec. 13, 2025, CDC influenza surveillance reports showed flu activity in Connecticut and Massachusetts classified as high. Meanwhile, Massachusetts, New York City, New York State and New Jersey had very high flu activity. Maine, New Hampshire and Vermont had lower levels of flu activity.
Further complicating the flu season is the fact that a new influenza virus strain renamed “H3N2 subclade K,” which is circulating widely today, was identified by health organizations months after the seasonal influenza vaccine was developed.
State and federal health officials note that flu season is still developing, meaning activity levels may change in the coming weeks.

Gov. Tim Walz had the best 15 months of any politician in America between May of 2023, when the Democratic-trifecta delivered on a long wish list of progressive legislation, to his selection as Democratic vice presidential nominee in the summer of 2024.
The next 15 months were a disaster. As Shakespeare’s Juliet says, “O Fortune, Fortune, all men call thee fickle.” Some of what’s happened was beyond his control, at times tragically so, like the assassination of Melissa Hortman, who was the successor he desperately needed.
As is so often the case, the dark clouds were visible during Walz’s 15-month honeymoon if you knew where to look; e.g., our reporting in the summer of 2023 that roughly half of the people charged in the Feeding Our Future case had other state contracts. In 2024, this time as Walz was being feted by national Democrats, we detailed the likelihood of widespread fraud in the autism program.
Asked about it roughly six months later, Walz was oblivious.
And so Walz is reaping what he sowed, especially his apparent lack of focus on the details of governing, and particularly what was happening in the Department of Human Services.
Apparently the Housing Stabilization Services program was so easy to game that word got back to a couple guys in Philly, who set up a business and started billing phony hours, according to federal charges unveiled Thursday. The lead prosecutor on all the fraud cases, Joseph Thompson, referred to this as “fraud tourism.”
For whatever his politics — my sense is that he’s a career prosecutor genuinely outraged by what he’s found — Thompson’s Thursday press conference was an anvil falling on Walz’s reelection campaign for a third term. In asserting that as much as half of the $18 billion spent in Medicaid waiver programs was stolen since 2018, Thompson introduced another phrase for GOP ad writers: “Industrial scale fraud.”
Walz now faces a few intractable problems beyond his control:

The story is endless. DHS has 1,300 open cases in its Medicaid program integrity unit.  Each crime produces a stream of stories — search warrants, indictments, trials, convictions, sentencings — each with its own embarrassing revelations.
There’s no easy message fix. Even while his approval numbers hold relatively steady, the issue is clearly hurting him. Lately they’ve been making a big show of tackling it, shutting down Housing Stabilization Services, appointing a program integrity officer, etc. But that only draws attention to his worst issue, and makes him seem reactive. But he also can’t pretend it’s not there, lest he appear indifferent to such a huge crisis.

Maybe, just maybe, he can use his remaining credibility to make a sweeping proposal to reform our social safety net, while taking responsibility for the missteps that got us here.
For instance, why are we outsourcing social services to private businesses which are turning around and stealing the money? Bring the whole thing in-house, where fraud is minimal, and where we can better track performance. His allied public unions would love it.
More likely, he’s going to hope the Republican clown car gifts him an easy opponent — a strong possibiility! — while he focuses on attacking President Donald Trump. He did his best Friday to tie his latest problems to Trump, during an appearance hitting Washington Republicans for failing to give relief to Minnesotans who are about to endure a spike in their health insurance premiums.
In response to a question about the feds’ press conference and the eye-popping $9 billion figure, Walz responded, “It’s been very clear that this is being driven from D.C.” The $9 billion figure, he added, is “sensationalism.” DHS officials in attendance then sounded skeptical notes about the $9 billion claim.
For those of us who want a robust discussion of the state’s future during next year’s election, a Walz campaign that’s focused on Trump is an altogether depressing state of affairs.
If Walz has few good options, the Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party doesn’t have many either.
Who would run in his place?
And who are the adults in the room who can tell him he’s better off not running?

Mike Kehoe’s administration sent an internal memo to Missouri state employees requiring their return to office by late March. Across the state and throughout the country, other employers, including AT&T, JPMorgan and Ford, have taken similar steps this year.
With 2025 marking half a decade since the beginning of COVID-19, the pendulum is swinging away from pandemic-era flexibility for many companies.
Prior to the pandemic, only about 15% of employers in Missouri reported that they had some number of employees working remotely. That number rose to about 25% of Missouri employers in 2023.
Officials driving a push back to the office cite enhanced customer service and improved collaboration as justification for the changes. However, the research doesn’t clearly show that in-person work always improves productivity.
Kansas City-based tax services company H&R Block even reversed its 2021 in-office mandate after receiving pushback from employees indicating enjoyment of hybrid workspaces on annual company surveys.
For many fields, the pandemic brought into the mainstream the novel concept of consistent options – and even requirements – to work from home. This shift away from a traditional workweek was something many employees were experiencing for the first time.
Daniel Goering, assistant professor of management at Missouri State University, said the tension between employers and employees vying for more control over their work has fueled some of these return-to-office mandates.
“During the pandemic, employees got a taste of a kind of extreme flexibility and autonomy and freedom and how they work,” Goering said. “And employers lost a lot of control. They lost control over oversight.”
Research like Goering’s shows that top-performing employees often most highly value a schedule with more flexibility.
These employees, according to Goering, prioritize positions in which they feel like their independence is taken seriously. A company takes a risk of losing top performers when it instates stricter rules.
“The employees who want control the most, who are also the ones who perform really well, are your top employees,” he said. “They’re the ones who are going to have options, and they’re going to exercise those options and find jobs elsewhere.”
Michael Montanye, an assistant management professor at North Central College in Illinois, said the culture at some successful companies is based on the so-called “ideal worker norm,” or the potentially toxic expectation that employees will always be committed to their work over any other non-work responsibilities.
“Any organization that considers themselves a high-pressure, high-performance company, a lot of times their organizational culture is built on this ideal work environment,” Montanye said.
When company culture is tied to the ideal worker norm, the expectation to be fully present in office may be seen as integral to keeping up this culture.
This ideal worker is far from representative of all types of workforce participants. Mothers, in particular, greatly benefit from more flexible working hours, something often seen as conflicting with idealized expectations.
According to a study from the McKinsey Global Institute, 58% of women prefer remote work arrangements, compared to 51% of men.
The burden of child care is often enough to disrupt a woman’s ability to sustain her career, said Wendy Doyle, CEO and founder of United WE, a Kansas City-based nonprofit focused on advancing women’s economic leadership.
“Women in Missouri are three times more likely to drop out of the workforce, especially during the pandemic, due to child care challenges,” Doyle said. “So it often puts families in a position to have to choose between work and family.”
Despite growing pushes for in-office work, places that often alleviate some burden of child care for parents – like schools and daycares – have shifted their new normal too. Shortened hours, additional days off or more virtual workdays all require a parent to modify their schedule to accommodate for the changes.
Maura Mills, management professor at the University of Alabama, said this increases the strain on working mothers trying to meet both office and familial expectations.
“It’s hard when workplaces are demanding, like, ‘Hey, let’s go back to our pre-pandemic schedule,’” she said. “But all these other support network organizations haven’t returned to pre-pandemic and have actually just adopted these changes as their new norm.”
A workplace utopia does not exist, and return-to-office mandates cannot change that. Instead, Mills said, businesses must work with their employees to understand what is most beneficial to them, not what looks best on paper.
“It’s hard to say what the ‘ideal workplace’ would look like, because it looks so different for everyone, because different people have different needs,” she said. “So, in that spirit, I think I have to say that a workplace – the ‘ideal’ – would be one that’s flexible, adaptive and responsive for everybody across the board.”

That request was denied.,"A federal judge denied a request from Konstantinos Diamantis, the former director of Connecticut’s school construction program, to question the 12 jurors who convicted him of bribery, extortion, conspiracy and lying to federal investigators earlier this year. 
Diamantis and his attorney, Norm Pattis, filed a motion in October asking U.S. District Judge Stefan Underhill to call the jurors back into court so they could answer questions about whether any of them were untruthful during the jury selection process.
But Underhill, who oversaw Diamantis’ nine-day trial, saw no reason to summon the jurors back into federal court in Bridgeport. 
Diamantis’ motion to question the jurors cited remarks the jury forewoman made to news reporters outside the courthouse following the verdict.
The forewoman reportedly told Hearst Connecticut Media she was not aware of Diamantis before the high-profile criminal trial, but she suggested that other members of the jury panel had heard of Diamantis before the trial began.
Pattis argued that statement suggested some jurors had not answered truthfully when Underhill asked them whether they had read or viewed any media about Diamantis.
“Simple logic suggests that one or more jurors in this case were either exposed to potentially prejudicial pre-trial publicity in this case and failed to disclose it, or that one or more jurors were exposed to potentially prejudicial publicity during trial,” 
But Underhill sided with the federal prosecutors, and ruled that the statements by the forewoman did not justify bringing the jurors back into court. 
“The only evidence that Diamantis can point to in support of his motion is a singlesentence from a single article published after the verdict was delivered,” Underhill wrote in his order. 
Underhill also said Diamantis was taking the jury forewoman’s statements out of context. 
“Diamantis’ cherry-picking of one sentence from a much longer article — when that sentence does not even quote the foreperson directly or point to any concrete instance of jury misconduct — does not provide incontrovertible evidence that members of the jury acted improperly,” Underhill wrote.
Pattis said he did not agree with Underhill’s order. 
“Burying your head in the sand guarantees you will see nothing. We asked for a hearing to make the context clear,” Pattis said in a statement. 
“The court’s decision to avoid looking so that it could conclude it sees no evil is unworthy of the court. This decision gives ostriches a bad name,” Pattis said.
Diamantis’ sentencing hearing is set to take place next year, but before that occurs, he is scheduled to face another federal criminal trial in February for allegedly pressuring state officials to cancel a state Medicaid audit in return for bribery payments.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2025_1016_SR_KostaTrial_056-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-19 14:58:49.858354

“Our goal remains ensuring every registered voter in our Commonwealth can cast their vote and have it counted in every election,” Schmidt said in a release. “As with the changes to mail ballot materials two years ago, these improvements resulted in more registered voters being able to make their voices heard in November’s election.” 
Two years ago, the state conducted a voter education initiative and required counties to preprint the full year of mail ballot return envelopes. Mail ballot instructions and online application materials were also redesigned. 
Five counties — Philadelphia, Berks, Butler, Mercer and Greene — worked with the state to craft the new envelopes to be more user friendly for both voters and poll workers.
“The purpose in leading the redesign effort was to reduce errors and have more votes counted, which is exactly what we achieved,” said Omar Sabir, the chair of the Philadelphia City Commissioners. “An 11% decrease in ballot rejections shows the real impact that thoughtful design can have on protecting voting rights across Pennsylvania.”

In Alaska and Michigan, legislators are nonetheless advancing bills to keep medical debt off consumer credit reports.
The attorneys general of California and Colorado said they would stand behind credit reporting laws enacted in those states in recent years, even as Colorado faces a lawsuit from debt collectors contesting such laws.
Indiana and Ohio lawmakers have dropped proposals to remove medical debt from credit reports but are pushing legislation that would extend other protections to patients who cannot pay their medical bills.
“Seventy-four percent of Alaska voters don’t think credit reports should include medical debt,” said state Rep. Genevieve Mina, a Democrat sponsoring a medical debt measure there. “I’m not going to wait on the courts on the medical debt issue.”
An estimated 100 million Americans are saddled with health care debt. And a growing number of red and blue states have enacted laws to protect patients.
But federal policy on such debt boomeranged this year when President Donald Trump’s administration chose not to defend federal regulations that would have removed medical debt from all Americans’ credit scores. And in October, Trump’s Consumer Financial Protection Bureau said that states do not have the authority to regulate consumer credit reports.
“It’s sort of a head-spinning, 180-degree reversal,” said Chi Chi Wu, an attorney with the National Consumer Law Center, which advocates for people with low incomes. She called the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, now led by Project 2025 architect Russell Vought, the “evil twin” of its predecessor under President Joe Biden.
The bureau did not respond to requests for comment.
Eight days after the new federal guidance, debt collectors filed a lawsuit contesting Colorado’s 2023 medical debt credit reporting law, the first to require removal of some or all medical debt from credit reports.
Scott Purcell, CEO of ACA International, which is a debt collection trade group and a plaintiff in the Colorado suit, said removing the debt makes it harder to gauge creditworthiness, which he said would lead creditors to assume everyone is a riskier bet.
His organization’s case also argues the Colorado law violates the First Amendment by suppressing “truthful commercial speech.”
Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser, a Democrat, called the lawsuit outrageous in a statement to KFF Health News. His office, he said, “will strongly oppose all efforts to strip away critical medical debt protections.”
In California, Attorney General Rob Bonta, too, is standing firm on his state’s law regardless of how federal officials now interpret state rights. The Democrat told constituents in a Nov. 13 alert: “Let me be clear: This remains the law in California.”
In other states still contemplating credit reporting laws, legislators are adjusting their strategy to account for the lawsuit and the Trump administration’s moves, by either ditching the plan to remove medical debt from credit reports or modifying such legislation.
Wu said her organization saw the federal change coming and had already urged state lawmakers to make pending legislation on credit reporting more lawsuit-proof by looking upstream and downstream of the credit reporting agencies. For example, Wu said, states can tell landlords, employers, or other credit report perusers that they cannot use a person’s medical debt history in their decision-making. And states can require health providers to include, in their contracts with debt collectors, limits on what they can tell credit reporting agencies about the bills they’re collecting.
“You’ll often hear providers say, ‘Oh, well, we don’t want to hurt our patients’ credit,’” she said. “Tell the debt collectors, ‘Don’t report this.’”
Alaska’s legislation has both elements: It bars landlords from making decisions about potential renters based on their medical debt history, and it bars providers and collectors from telling credit reporting agencies about patient debt.
Elsewhere, state lawmakers have opted out of trying to pass credit reporting provisions in proposed legislation. Indiana state Sen. Fady Qaddoura, a Democrat, filed a medical debt measure that tries to, among other things, cap interest rates, limit wage garnishment, and keep people from losing their homes over unpaid bills from medically necessary procedures. But he and his colleagues made a tactical decision to leave out credit reporting, after unsuccessfully including it in a similar bill last year.
“It’s out of legislative pragmatism,” Qaddoura said. “We want to be sure that you don’t get a piece of legislation killed with many benefits to tens of thousands of families just because one provision can’t go in.”
In Ohio, Democratic state Rep. Michele Grim made a similar calculation. She has been working on a measure to ban wage garnishment over medical debt, cap interest rates for such debt at 3%, and scratch it from credit reports. She said she and other lawmakers recently removed the credit reporting portion.
“It’s better to pass something than nothing at all,” Grim said. “It still bans wage garnishment, which is a very aggressive, more-common-than-you-think practice. And it caps the interest rate.”
A recent investigation by KFF Health News found that, in Colorado alone, thousands of people each year have their wages garnished to pay back medical bills, and some people taken to court for medical debts never actually owed the money.
Legislative efforts to protect people from the effects of medical debt are often bipartisan, but that doesn’t mean they pass easily. Even before the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau reversed its stance on credit reports, several measures hit obstacles in conservative states this year, and legislation failed in Wyoming and South Dakota that aimed to take medical debt off credit reports.
Americans are largely protected from having their credit scores dinged by small medical debts. In 2023, the three big credit bureaus — TransUnion, Equifax, and Experian — voluntarily opted to remove medical debts under $500 from their credit reports, and the Consumer Data Industry Association, a trade group for the companies, confirmed they are still doing so.
Even so, lawmakers in several states said they are deciding whether and how to get ahead of the federal guidance with legislation that tackles additional, larger medical debt on credit reports.
“We know that this will need to get beefed up,” said Sarah Anthony, a Democratic state senator in Michigan, of legislation she’s co-sponsoring. She isn’t sure what that will look like, though consumer advocates including Libby Benton hope to see the measure follow Wu’s strategy.
“These aren’t debts that people choose to take on. People might choose to buy a huge pickup truck and that’s a bad financial decision,” said Benton, director of the Michigan Poverty Law Program. “People don’t choose to have emergency heart bypass surgery.”
Yet both can end up on a credit report.

(Elise Plunk/Louisiana Illuminator)Prices have steadily risen for natural gas throughout 2025, for residents and industry alike, and Louisiana finds itself at the center of the boom. A nation-leading three liquified natural gas export facilities operate along its coast, and five more are in the construction or planning phases. 
But more LNG exports will mean higher domestic utility prices, according to a new report from the consumer advocacy group, Public Citizen.  
Public Citizen analyzed documents from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and determined natural gas prices are increasing for American households as gas companies in the U.S. export more of the commodity to meet global demand.
From January through September, Americans paid $12 billion more for natural gas than the same period last year. That comes to about $124 per family in higher utility bills, a 22% increase directly related to higher natural gas prices, the report notes. 
Natural gas prices for consumers are expected to increase another 16% in 2026, according to Public Citizen, which cited U.S. Energy Information Administration predictions.
Analysts attribute growing global demand for natural gas to political, industrial and environmental factors. 
Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has led other countries, mostly European, to seek other sources of the fuel, which is widely preferred as a cleaner alternative to coal. 
The rise of artificial intelligence has caused a surge in the construction of data centers that require vast amounts of electricity that is most likely to come from power plants that run on natural gas. 
An LSU Center for Energy Studies outlook for 2026 credits much of the state’s growth in natural gas exports to executive orders from the Trump administration that lifted a Biden-era moratorium on expansion of LNG export facilities.   
The United States exported 11.9 billion cubic feet per day of LNG around the globe in 2024, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Louisiana handled around 61% of those shipments. 
LNG exports are expected to “more than double by 2037, with nearly all new export capacity located on the Gulf Coast,” according to the LSU report’s analysis of Energy Information Administration predictions.  
“As we continue to see more production, more capacity for exports, particularly in the LNG space, that’s going to mean more jobs,” said Tommy Faucheux, president of the Louisiana Mid-Continent Oil and Gas Association. “Somebody is going to supply that gas. Louisiana gets to benefit from the investments in the export capacity.”
But with increased exports comes the tradeoff of higher domestic prices for residents, according to the Public Citizen report. 
The majority of Louisiana’s electricity, around 70%, is generated from natural gas, according to the most recent numbers from the Energy Information Administration. It costs about 12 cents per kilowatt hour of electricity for residential, natural gas-fueled power in Louisiana, compared with the 18-cent national average.  
Utilities pass along the increased cost of electricity generation to their customers, often through what’s called a fuel adjustment charge on their utility bills. They also include charges to recoup the costs of any losses or investments such as new power lines or infrastructure upgrades. Although Louisiana has low rates for its electricity, it hasn’t translated to low power bills because of these pass-along costs to customers.
“Whatever amount of gas they’re using to generate the electricity that’s being used in your home, the cost of that gas is being charged directly to you,” said Jesse George, policy lead for the Alliance for Affordable Energy. 
In some areas such as New Orleans, an area with older, less energy-efficient homes, residents will feel the higher prices in 2026, George said.  
Colder temperatures create more power demand, and natural gas prices tend to increase when utilities need more fuel to increase their generation. The Energy Information Administration predicts a 22% increase in natural gas prices for the winter heating season that runs through March.
Though heightened winter electricity demand in Louisiana typically ends by March, customers could see additional fuel surcharges on their utility bills for months if there is a severe cold snap. The same situation arises during intense summer heat,
“About 20% of households cannot pay their utility bills already,” George said, citing the most recent numbers available from Entergy New Orleans’ disconnection rates. “Couple that with these increased fuel prices, and that certainly will only exacerbate the problems and the challenges that people are facing already.”",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_9287-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-19 14:58:49.858354

(Faith Miller/Colorado Newsline)Colorado State Treasurer Dave Young on Friday dropped his bid for Colorado’s highly competitive 8th Congressional District seat.
The Greeley Democrat said while he has been capable of managing his role as treasurer as he campaigns, a family member’s “serious health situation” led him to withdraw from the race. 
“My family must come first, and stepping back from this race to care for my family, as well as continuing to fulfill my duties as State Treasurer, is the responsible choice,” Young said in a statement.

Young, a former state representative from Greeley, has served as Colorado treasurer since 2019. One of four statewide executive offices elected by voters, the treasurer oversees the management, investment and disbursement of state funds, along with a handful of savings and loan programs and the state’s Division of Unclaimed Property.
He is one of several Democrats who sought to unseat U.S. Rep. Gabe Evans, a Fort Lupton Republican in his first term representing the state’s newest and most competitive district. The 8th District includes the northern Denver suburbs and extends into Greeley and was drawn by an independent redistricting commission. 
“Although this campaign is ending, my dedication to the people of our state is unwavering and our work continues,” Young said. “I will keep working every day as your Treasurer to deliver results, safeguard our financial future, and uphold the values that define Colorado.”
Evans unseated former Democratic U.S. Rep. Yadira Caraveo, who was the first person to represent the district. Caraveo dropped her bid to reclaim the congressional seat, as did former teachers union president Amie Baca-Oehlert. Democrats still in the race include Colorado state Rep. Manny Rutinel of Commerce City, state Rep. Shannon Bird of Westminster and Marine veteran Evan Munsing. The Democratic primary election in June will determine which candidate will face Evans in November.
In a statement, Bird said Young “has dedicated his life to service” and she knows he “will finish out his last year as Treasurer with the same determination to make life better for the next generation of Coloradans that has driven his life’s work.”

She loves working at the Booneville campus, enough so that she drives around 60 miles round trip every day from her home in Tupelo. It was an exciting change after roughly two decades of work in a K-12 setting. 
Amid the rising costs of colleges across the country, Shelton said the school has done a good job of keeping tuition relatively affordable for people who live nearby. 
“It’s calm, it’s relaxing and you can always find family,” she said. 
But the school isn’t immune to some of the resource scarcity that’s common for public services in northeast Mississippi. Shelton sometimes struggles to meet the health needs of all students — especially as rates of anxiety and depression have climbed among college students across North America since the worst of the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Years later, Shelton and her coworkers do what they can to help all who struggle with their mental health. But Northeast has over 3,000 students, and some still fall through the gaps.

“It’s kind of been all over the place,” she said, adding that more staff could help address these needs. 
Northeast Mississippians said this type of mismatch between resources and services that would help locals and what’s available close to them is common in their corner of the state. In one of the most remote regions of Mississippi, people across Prentiss and Alcorn County told Mississippi Today that they, their families and their friends would benefit from more resource support from their local governments and the state.
From Jackson, it takes at least 3.5 hours of law-abiding driving on the 50 miles-per-hour speed limit Natchez Trace Parkway to get to Booneville. Shelton said she thinks transportation and distance factor into the gap between people’s needs and the opportunities available to them.
“It’s kind of off the beaten path,” she said. “And because of that, sometimes we get left out because we are so far up north.”

It’s not just the college that could use more resource support. Jennifer Kendrick, a Booneville mother of two, sends her children to the local public schools. She attended the same schools when she was a kid, playing the bassoon at football games and competitions for the Booneville High School marching band. 
Her freshman son plays the trombone for the same team, and her daughter plays the trombone for the feeder middle school.
“Booneville has for decades had an amazing band,” Kendrick said.

But there are other extracurriculars the schools don’t have that she sees offered elsewhere in Mississippi, Alabama and Tennessee. Prentiss County is split into three separate school districts — allowed by Mississippi’s laws around county and municipal school districts — and Kendrick worries that splitting up her rural county this way means no high school can offer all the opportunities others do.  
Booneville High School doesn’t have a debate team, a theater club or a choir — all extracurriculars Kendrick would like her kids to have the option of exploring. When she was in school in the 1990s, she was part of a program no longer offered called Future Problem Solving, a club that invited kids to think of solutions to large problems like drunken driving. It then asked the students to work through the problems of those proposed solutions. 
“I would love for my kids to be involved in it,” she said. 
In addition to building relationships and community with other high schoolers, Kendrick said these clubs offered potential pathways to paying for college. The 2023 per capita income of Prentiss County was under $40,000 — about $10,000 less than that of Mississippi as a whole.

Without scholarships, like those awarded for a skill that could be developed through an extracurricular activity, she said she won’t be able to pay for her kids’ college tuition. It’s just too expensive, especially as she expects her health insurance premium to go up next month. 
“We’ve already discussed, ‘You need to be looking for ways you can get scholarships,’” she said.

The resource gaps of local schools could have repercussions into adulthood. While exploring the W.M. Browning Cretaceous Fossil Park in Baldwyn, Emmy Nelson and Joanna Bishop interact with people from across north Mississippi through their work as traveling New Testament ministers. While they don’t work directly with the schools in the area, Nelson said she meets with many adults who likely should have received special education for dyslexia. 
Through their travels, Bishop also notices that there’s a gap between the level of unaddressed trauma among people she meets with and available mental health services for those needs, often using substances to cope with issues.
“When you never deal with the problem and it’s still reoccurring, then it doesn’t solve anything,” she said.

Twenty miles north in Corinth, Heather Hurt sees that service gap in her own life. She filed a domestic violence protection order recently, and she said she hasn’t been able to find a support group in the area for victims of the crime. 
S.A.F.E. Inc., a domestic violence shelter 50 miles south in Tupelo, serves Alcorn County and offers support groups once a week. But although there are virtual video call options for the meetings, they’re held in -person two counties south of Hurt’s home. 
“Sometimes, it would be nice to just have other women that you could go and listen to and talk to,” she said.

Not knowing where to find or being able to get social services is a problem Hurt says affects the most financially and medically vulnerable Alcorn County residents. And the problems aren’t limited to long-term programs. Hurt works as a paramedic in Tennessee, and she said she’s experienced difficulty getting first responders on her side of the state line to show up in a timely manner. 
While Hurt thinks Corinth is a great place to live, she would like to see her state representatives work to address these resource gaps. So far, she said she hasn’t seen them in the community nor had a chance to tell them that.
“I don’t ever hear of them coming up here,” she said.
Even with the public service access challenges, Kendrick said small businesses in the area work to fill some of the communities’ needs. She has her own private therapy practice in Booneville, and she’s worked with other groups in the area to address community needs herself. 
In September, Kendrick and a local gym partnered to host a free class on domestic violence, where she said she shared information about recognizing the signs of abuse and exiting an unsafe situation. Although only a few people attended, she said those who did were very engaged in the discussion.
“We ended up partnering and supporting and promoting each other,” Kendrick said. Hurt hadn’t heard of the class, but she said it would have interested her.
The small business relationships in Booneville is one of the things Kendrick loves about her hometown, which she returned to after attending college in Memphis. She sees many residents making decisions with her and her neighbors in mind, not out-of-state stakeholders.

He was a state senator at the time.
“I’m giving him my card, and he just pauses and looks at me and is like, ‘Rental registration? What is it that you do besides getting the rentals to register?’” Love said.
Love, in fact, does a lot more than registration. The former property manager sends inspectors out to properties, she collects and crunches data on Jackson’s landlords, and she works with rental owners to help them maintain safe, habitable units. 
Now, three years after a lawsuit from metro-area landlords and an industry organization called the Mississippi Apartment Association impeded the city’s implementation of its rental registration program, Love will finally be able to collect fees to fund routine inspections. 
The new age for rental regulation in Jackson comes after the city council passed an amended version of its rental registration ordinance earlier this month to incorporate court-mandated changes. These include lowering fees and eliminating a provision aimed at absent and out-of-state owners that required anyone operating rentals in Jackson to have a local agent residing in city limits. 
City officials hope the new registry will help inspectors identify and sanction bad-acting landlords, bringing some regulation to a rental market that has operated virtually unchecked for years. Under the ordinance, property owners who fail to register on time or whose units cannot pass inspection will face stiff fines. 
“So it’s not just the wild, wild west,” Ward 7 councilman Kevin Parkinson said.

But whether the program will foster better living conditions for Jackson’s renters hinges on the city’s dedication to code enforcement, said Lynda Troyer, a local landlord who has rented property near the Jackson Zoo for more than a decade. 
When she first started working in Jackson, Troyer said the city had the authority under a 2006 ordinance to inspect properties during what’s called the “turnover” period when one tenant leaves and another has yet to move in. 
Lacking an adequate number of inspectors, the city struggled to show up to her units in a timely fashion, Troyer said, delaying tenants from getting in the door. 
“Nobody complied with it,” she said. “There were no real penalties for not complying and …. when the city couldn’t do timely inspections, landlords just quit asking for them.” 
The solution to a problem as complex as poor housing conditions in Jackson is repeated follow-up, Love said. The program has five inspectors and Love said she doesn’t expect to be able to hire more amid the city’s financial woes. But her ability to collect fees from landlords will go a long way to ensuring the program is self-sufficient. 
“You can expect true dedication to looking at the issue, going out and inspecting it,” she said. 
The new rental registry does away with inspections during the turnover period, instead requiring the city to conduct property reviews upon an owner renewing their annual registration. 
For smaller landlords, Love said the city will strive to inspect 20% of a landlord’s portfolio. Landlords with multi-family apartment complexes will have no more than 20% of their units inspected. If an inspector does not identify issues in the first 10% of units, the ordinance states they will have the option to declare the landlord compliant without inspecting the rest. 
To cover the cost of inspection, the city will charge landlords $50 for each single-family home examined and $25 for each unit in an apartment complex. 
In the newest version of the program, the city calculated these fees so that inspections were not generating revenue, which would constitute an “impermissible tax.” This is one of the arguments Troyer and other landlords made in their legal challenge against the original ordinance.
The Mississippi Apartment Association was not able to participate in an interview by press time but shared a letter of support for the new ordinance that it sent to the council. 
“The final ordinance reflects an approach that enables the City to meet its important rental housing goals while being mindful of the existing demands on property owners,” wrote Meghan Elder, the association’s executive.

Earlier this year, a Hinds County Circuit Court judge ruled the city could not enforce the fees until it had determined how much it will actually take to run the rental registry program, the Northside Sun reported. 
Parkinson said he believes the fees might have to go up after a year of the city actually running the program. 
“Now, I suspect it’s going to be nowhere near the cost” of the program, Parkinson said. “But because we’ve never operated before, we don’t have any proof that’s the case.” 
Love has ambitious goals for the program: She’s working to set up a complaint form that tenants can use to contact the city after their landlord has failed to address their concerns, and she envisions educational classes for owners who don’t know city code. 
“You have 80-year-old women who it’s been their lifelong dream to rent a property,” she said. “They have these two rental properties and they really don’t know … you have to have a smoke detector in every bedroom.” 
Love also hopes the rental registry will help beget data on which landlords own the most challenged apartment complexes. She said her office regularly scrapes Zillow and monitors Facebook Marketplace to try to catch landlords who have failed to register. And she wants to tackle some of the city’s long-troubled apartment complexes, such as Pine Ridge Gardens, a Section 8 complex in southeast Jackson.

While the city program’s inspectors will prioritize rentals that are not already examined through state and federal affordable housing programs, the city can inspect apartments if the rental division has “reasonable information and belief” of poor living conditions, according to the ordinance. 
Love said the city can kick off this process once it gets word that a complex has failed its federal or state inspection. In a situation where a complex has been a 30-year problem, Love said she thinks it’s unrealistic to expect a landlord to improve a property within their first year of ownership – especially when some out-of-state landlords are buying complexes sight unseen. 
“This just isn’t really the market for that,” she said. “You have to have someone here.” 
But as soon as a landlord fails their first inspection, or if enough Jacksonians complain, Love said it’s fair game for the city to take its own look. That doesn’t mean her approach will always be punitive, though, and Love has connected with local lending resources to help landlords find ways to afford costly repairs. 
“There has to be a little bit of grace,” she said. “They don’t get to get off the hook, but now they are on the path to being fully functional.” 
Jackson has more than 30,000 renter-occupied units, according to Census data. The version of the rental registration ordinance the council passed appears to be more lenient and less specific than similar laws in neighboring communities. 
In Ridgeland, for instance, Troyer said a tenant cannot put the utilities in their name until a unit passes the city’s inspection. But the city pledges to inspect units within a few days of a landlord’s request. The stricter rule also comes with less inspections, Troyer said, because her Ridgeland tenants stay in their rentals longer. 
“Because you’re not having as much turnover, you’re not having the inspection,” she said.

Troyer predicts the ordinance will add to her costs of doing business in Jackson — which had already gone up in recent years due to a combination of inflation, insurance and a bogged-down court system that slowed the eviction process for nonpaying tenants. 
“People have a misconception that landlords are rich, but they are not,” she said. “I don’t know why. I guess because you own property, and everybody thinks property is worth something.”
Jackson needed the rental registration program, Troyer said, but she will have to pass the cost on to tenants — a challenge when she is renting in a low-income neighborhood. Along with her husband, who does the maintenance while she handles paperwork, Troyer said she owns less than 20 properties. 
“It all goes back to that affordability issue,” Troyer said. “You’ve got tensions of people trying to live on fixed incomes who can’t afford anything but $300 in rent – which there is nothing you can find for $300 that’s going to be good, halfway decent. But with their income, that’s it for them. So there’s all these tensions out there.”
When Blossom Apartments in south Jackson dramatically closed earlier this year, Troyer said she got a slew of calls from people who were looking for a one-bedroom to rent. She didn’t have any one-bedrooms — and no units available at the prices they could afford.
“There’s not enough federal government money, there’s not enough state money,” she said. “Wherever this money comes from, there’s not enough to help these folks on fixed incomes.”
Even when a crisis like Blossom isn’t happening, Troyer said she gets calls from people who can’t afford the rents she’s offering, even with housing vouchers.

(Katie McKellar/Utah News Dispatch)Heidi Barr. Hoi ‘Holly’ Xuan. Anjala Evans. Jose Hernandez. 
As he read their names aloud Thursday night in front of a somber crowd illuminated by candlelight, Herbert Elliot — co-chair of the consumer advisory board for the Fourth Street Clinic, which provides health care for the homeless in Salt Lake City — dropped a small stone into a glass jar for each name. 
Clink. Clink. Clink. 
Utah’s homeless dying 10 times the rate of state’s general population

By the end of the list, about 80 stones filled the jar. 
That’s how many known people died in 2025 while experiencing homelessness or having been homeless. There is likely more. Thursday’s vigil in Pioneer Park is part of an annual tradition to honor the lives lost in Utah’s homeless community — and to honor those who might otherwise be forgotten.
When the name James Owen Dennis was read aloud, a hooded man in the crowd named Darien Willardson murmured, “Love you, James.” 
His face glowed from the single candle he held in his hands. By the time the rest of the names were read aloud and the last stone clinked into the jar, the candle Willardson held had melted down to the bottom of its wick. 
After the vigil, Willardson told Utah News Dispatch he knew two men on the list. One was Dennis. The other was Rodney, whose last name was listed as unknown on the vigil’s program. 
Willardson — who leads outreach teams for the Rescue Mission, a faith-based nonprofit helping the homeless in Salt Lake City — said Dennis went through the Rescue Mission’s recovery program. After Dennis moved away to take care of his dad, Willardson said he was diagnosed with cancer. He died just two weeks ago.

“He loved coming to Bible study and just reading the word. He didn’t preach or judge … he would just read the word and sit with it,” Willardson said of Dennis. 
Willardson also knew Rodney because he said he used to meet him under a bridge near the Jordan River Trail. 
Though Willardson said he would try to encourage Rodney to come to the Rescue Mission, “he never wanted to come,” he said. “He wanted to live out his days comfortably under the bridge, and that was his home.” 
So Willardson said he struck a deal with Rodney — that he would continue to keep checking on him “and bring what I could to make his stay a little more comfortable.”
But one day, when Willardson came to find him, Rodney was gone.

“He passed away living under that bridge,” Willardson said. 
He said it could have been because of exposure, sickness, or a drug overdose. He didn’t know. All Willardson said he did know was that when he went to check on Rodney in October, some nearby campers said his body had been taken away the week prior. 
Willardson said sometimes he wished he could “grab him by his collar and pull him out. But I think I am at peace with it, knowing I did everything I could.” 
“I can only do so much,” Willardson said. “I can’t change hearts. But I can do everything in my power to show them love.”
A lack of resources
Through song and prayer, vigil speakers and attendees honored the lost lives with tears — but also calls to action. They also urged Utahns to come together to do more for the state’s homeless. 
Among them was former Senate President Wayne Niederhauser, who earlier this month retired from his role as state homeless coordinator. Tearfully, Niederhauser said a “lack of resources” is a constant struggle when it comes to dealing with homelessness. 
“It’s a scarcity of treatment and housing and a lot of other things,” he said. “And it seems that when there’s a scarcity of something, it’s our most vulnerable populations that end up without.”
But Niederhauser also gave a nod to the “progress that we’ve made over the last several years” to commit more funding to homeless services, housing and shelter throughout the state’s system. 
He thanked homeless service providers who are by no means “getting rich working in homeless services, but they are getting rich in a way where they’re helping humans.” 
“The reward of helping others is riches beyond anything on this earth,” he said.

‘We need to do more’
Jarod Beardon once lived on the streets of Salt Lake City but now works for the INN Between, which provides end-of-life care for people experiencing homelessness. He also spoke during the vigil — which he said he was at first reluctant to do because his experience with homelessness “has scarred me.” 
“I remember having to walk the streets at night, having to look for a safe and secure place to sleep,” he said. “I remember feeling so tired that I felt like at any moment I could pass out on the streets or in some random ditch.” 
Beardon said he also remembered having “a working cellphone,” and yet  “not one person that I could call that would let me come stay the night.” 
“I remember the drugs and everything that comes along with that,” he said, but he added what he remembered most “was the looks that I would get from people going to work, and how low I felt. For the first time in my life, I felt less than and, quite frankly, not human.” 
Beardon said the “wonderful, courageous people” being honored during the vigil aren’t “just a name to me. In many ways, they are me. And I am them.” 
“I’ve met people that have at one point earned six-figure incomes that now by some unexpected circumstance are now spending their nights (in homeless shelters),” he said.

Through his work at the INN Between, Beardon said he’s learned “that what connects us all is that we all have trauma,” and that’s helped him heal from his own trauma every day.
“Now, many of the names we are reading tonight belong to people who did not pass away in a safe space, surrounded by care, and were never formally memorialized,” he said. “Some, however, spent their final days at the INN Between, resting in a bed and not on the streets. Surrounded by people who cared deeply for them.” 
After their deaths at the INN Between, he said their lives were honored by a candlelight ceremony “because everyone deserves that basic dignity. Everyone.”
Beardon thanked the more than 100 people who showed up for the vigil — but he also issued a call for everyone to do more for Utah’s homeless. 
“Even though we are making progress, it is just a small, small dent,” he said. “We need to do more. We need more of everything. More of your support. More of your money. More of things like socks, clothing, food, anything you can possibly give.” 
The most important thing, he said, “is we need people not to judge.” 
“We need people not to look at homeless people like they’re not people,” he said. “Because they are. We need your compassion.”

The lights stayed on overnight after a second night of unrest. (Photo by John Hult/South Dakota Searchlight)The November overdose death of a state prison inmate in Sioux Falls has drawn charges for a former Department of Corrections medical staffer and a man who’s already serving a 65-year sentence in the South Dakota State Penitentiary.
In indictments filed this week in Minnehaha County, 25-year-old medical aid Natalie Krause is accused of conspiring with 26-year-old inmate Cole Waters to distribute the synthetic drug that killed Travis Long Fox.
Long Fox overdosed on Nov. 4, Attorney General Marty Jackley said at a Friday news conference in Sioux Falls, and died Nov. 7. His is one of eight inmate overdose deaths that have occurred in 2025 — a figure higher than any year in recent memory for the Department of Corrections.
Thanksgiving death brings the number of suspected prison drug overdose fatalities in 2025 to eight

The synthetic drug involved is commonly referred to as K2, which can be soaked into pieces of paper that are then dried out for smoking. 
That’s the form it took in the Long Fox overdose case, Jackley said. 
“K2 wouldn’t necessarily be the drug of choice” on the streets in South Dakota, he said, but the ability to conceal it on sheets of paper has made it a popular option inside prisons and “it’s creating a public health and safety issue” in those institutions.
Seven of the eight prison overdose deaths are suspected or confirmed to be tied to K2. 
“It can be difficult for corrections officials to prevent inmates from having a piece of paper,” Jackley said. 
Krause and Waters face a host of felony charges relating to the alleged possession and delivery of unauthorized articles in a correctional setting and allegedly distributing a substance resulting in death. If convicted on all charges, Krause could get up to 95 years in prison. Waters, because of his previous felony conviction, could be sentenced to an additional 170 years. 
Waters pleaded guilty to manslaughter for shooting and killing a 17-year-old boy in 2019 during a botched attempt to steal the victim’s marijuana. 
Krause, the former medical aid, allegedly delivered the K2-laced paper to Waters, with whom she had “a personal relationship,” Jackley said.
Krause is currently in custody at the Minnehaha County Jail on a $100,000 cash-only bond. She’s scheduled to appear in court on Monday. Waters was given a personal recognizance bond and released back to the custody of the Department of Corrections. His next court date is set for Jan. 6. 
Jackley said his office has 112 pending criminal cases tied to the Department of Corrections at the moment, ranging from drug possession and distribution to inmate assaults on other inmates or staff members. The new case is the third tied to the death of a specific inmate. Charges were filed in July and September, respectively, in earlier overdose deaths. Krause is the second former prison staff member charged. 
Jackley said he has “authorized” charging decisions in one other overdose case, and said he expects to announce indictments in that case within about a month.

(Micah Drew/Daily Montanan)The Gallatin County Commission at its Tuesday meeting voted unanimously for 25-year-old Katie Fire Thunder to take over the remainder of former Democratic Rep. Ed Stafman’s term in the Legislature.
Stafman, a 71-year-old former trial attorney and Rabbi Emeritus, served his third Legislative session in Helena this year, representing House District 59, but resigned his post in early November.
The county commissioners considered three candidates for the House seat, forwarded from the Gallatin County Democrats Central Committee.
Along with Fire Thunder, the committee recommended JP Pomnichowski, who previously served in as a legislator in both chambers from 2007-2009 and 2013-2021, and Tanya Reinhardt, a trustee for the Bozeman School District for nine years.
Fire Thunder is a co-founder of Bozeman Tenants United, works as a legal assistant the Gallatin County Attorney’s Office and has been involved in politics as a student political action director at Montana State University and as a legislative aide to the Montana Budget and Policy Center in 2025.
In brief remarks to the commission, Fire Thunder said she was raised in Bozeman by a single mother in a low-income household — real-life experiences she said will ground her in the Legislature.
“My mom is a success story. She graduated with a master’s guide to her own private practice and bought a house. However, the reality is we still live paycheck to paycheck, and I constantly question if I’m going to be able to afford to live in this community long term and continue to live in this state,” Fire Thunder said. “As an indigenous woman, a part of the Ogalala Lakota Sioux Tribe, my people, have been forgotten from this land that we want stewarded and called home.
Montana currently has 12 Native lawmakers as part of the Montana American Indian Caucus, with Fire Thunder bringing the number to 13, and comprising more than 8% of elected legislators.
House District 59 comprises the south-eastern portion of Bozeman.
Fire Thunder will have to run for election in 2026 for a full term beginning the 2027 Legislature. She said that until then, she will spend her time “strengthening relationships across the aisle, building coalition and ensuring that the voices of House District 59 are always at the table.”
Stafman told the Daily Montanan his decision to step down during the interim came after he decided he wouldn’t run for a fourth term and wanted to spend more time with his family, including a new grandchild.

(Photo by Tess Vrbin/Arkansas Advocate)Arkansas lawmakers approved changes to a contract between the state’s child welfare agency and a California-based company Friday after a House member questioned the quality of the company’s work and whether the state has become too reliant on it.
Evident Change, a nonprofit that aims to improve child welfare programs and other social services, provides “professional consultant services” to the Division of Children and Family Services within the Arkansas Department of Human Services, according to documents provided to the Arkansas Legislative Council.
The council approved a $375,000 amendment to an existing contract with Evident Change that raises the total authorized amount to roughly $4.2 million. The additional funding will expand Evident Change’s ability to provide quality control for the state’s Child Abuse Hotline and investigations of alleged child maltreatment.
Specifically, Evident Change will screen calls to the state Child Abuse Hotline, coach child abuse investigators and help implement the company’s structured decision-making tool that DCFS has adopted, division director Tiffany Wright said last month.
The state’s business relationship with Evident Change began in 2018 when it was called the National Council on Crime and Delinquency. The Legislative Council’s Review subcommittee postponed a decision Tuesday on whether to re-approve the amendment to the contract because members had conflicting information about how much the state has paid Evident Change since 2018.
Arkansas panel delays contract amendment over company’s stance on transgender youth

That amount is roughly $11.6 million, Rep. Frances Cavenaugh, R-Walnut Ridge, said Friday. DHS spokesperson Gavin Lesnick confirmed the amount in an email.
The panel previously approved the contract amendment in November, but the full Legislative Council sent it back to the subcommittee after Rep. Ryan Rose, R-Van Buren, raised concerns about Evident Change’s stance on health care for transgender youth.
The company “publicly posted articles and argued that… gender transition surgeries, hormone therapies, et cetera for minors should not be treated or investigated as child abuse,” Rose said last month. He added that the company had removed the articles from its website.
“There is a very definite contradiction between their public opinions and the law that we have established here,” Rose said on Nov. 21, referring to a 2021 law that banned puberty blockers, hormones and gender-affirming surgeries for Arkansas children with gender dysphoria.
A federal judge struck down the law in 2023, but it was allowed to take effect this year after the U.S. Supreme Court said states could ban gender-affirming care for minors. Some conservatives have portrayed the care as child abuse, even though it’s been supported by groups such as the American Medical Association.
Rose did not mention Evident Change’s stance on gender-affirming care during this week’s meetings. He told the Advocate Tuesday that he still had “genuine concerns about the ideological bend” of Evident Change but believed it was more important to address more “substantive” issues.
Rose cited the case of a Mountain Home teenager who was reportedly abused for years after the state determined 29 allegations of abuse against the child were unsubstantiated.
After the case came to light in October, DHS began to review 341 child maltreatment reports made from July 1, 2024, to June 30, 2025, according to the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette. Eight of those 341 reports are under further review, Lesnick told the Democrat-Gazette this week.
This proves “there are cracks in the work” Evident Change does, Rose said Tuesday. He repeated his concerns Friday, saying DCFS should “look internally” at problems with investigations of child maltreatment instead of “throwing more money” at Evident Change.
Rep. Frances Cavenaugh, R-Walnut Ridge (Arkansas Secretary of State)
Chief Program Officer Angie Wolf said Tuesday that Evident Change does not “want anyone to be dependent” on its work. Rose said both the contracts and Evident Change’s testimony did not convince him there is an “off ramp” to avoid that dependency.
Rose asked the Legislative Council on Friday not to approve the amended contract. Cavenaugh, the Review subcommittee’s House chair, urged members to pass it instead and said “extra eyes” besides DCFS are necessary to solve problems with the Child Abuse Hotline.
“If we can save one child, I’m glad to have spent [more than] $300,000” on the amendment, Cavenaugh said.
The council approved the amended contract on a split voice vote.
In its efforts to reduce the number of children in foster care, DCFS has worked with Evident Change to train staff to better assess risk and safety and manage safety concerns.
Evident Change has worked with the Annie E. Casey Foundation, whose annual reports on child wellbeing indicators continually rank Arkansas as one of the worst states for children.

(Photo via Getty Images)Iowa’s Office of Ombudsman, which investigates complaints related to local and state government, saw an almost 10% increase in cases opened during the last fiscal year.
The agency’s annual report, published this week, indicates that during fiscal year 2025, the office opened 6,266 cases — a 9.6% increase from the previous year.
The number of opened cases represents the second-highest total in the history of the office, and is 57% higher than what was recorded in 2014. The highest number of opened cases was in 2022, when the COVID-19 pandemic was still creating issues for government agencies and the people they serve.
The ombudsman’s office consists of 16 employees, a total that includes two administrative staffers.

In the new report, Ombudsman Bernardo Granwehr said that “with such a big workload, we must be selective about the cases we choose to investigate.” He said the office is focused on prioritizing complaints and “as a result, we can better handle situations when we are called to do more with our finite resources.”
Granwehr credited the staff with building relationships with key employees of governmental entities across the state, which he said has made the office more efficient in its investigations and “increased the probability that state and local government officials will be receptive to our recommendations.”
With regard to the complaints dealing with state entities, the annual report shows that 56% of those cases involved the Iowa Department of Corrections, and 24% involved the Iowa Department of Health and Human Services.
In December 2024, the office published a public report, “Sitting in Place: A Re-Examination of Restraint Device Use and Regulations for Iowa’s County Jails.” While restraint chairs can serve a legitimate function in protecting inmates and staff, prolonged use and a lack of medical oversight can lead to injury. The report noted that some Iowa jails lacked written policies that aligned with state standards, while other jails failed to document the duration and justification for their use of the devices.
The Office of Ombudsman says it will continue to monitor restraint-chair use in county jails, but notes that the Department of Corrections has yet to complete “needed revisions to jail administrative rules.”
Among the cases highlighted in the annual report:
— Medicaid MCO: In 2025, an Iowa resident complained that he had been receiving repeated phone calls from a managed care organization affiliated with the state’s Medicaid program. The calls were not only unwanted, they included confidential health information — such as test results – for other individuals the complainant didn’t even know. Despite the complainant asking the MCO to stop calling, the calls continued.
The man then complained to the ombudsman, noting his concern with not just the inconvenience he was experiencing but also the privacy violations and the fact that the intended recipients of the calls weren’t receiving critical information related to their own health. With the ombudsman’s intervention, the calls finally stopped.
— Bureaucratic red tape: A South Carolina man informed the ombudsman’s office that for 15 years, he had been receiving erroneous tax bills from the State of Iowa. Each year, the man had complained to the state’s taxing agency where officials confirmed he owed nothing and assured him the matter was resolved – although the tax bills kept coming.
After the ombudsman’s office intervened, the erroneous billing was stopped. In its annual report, the ombudsman’s office noted the case “highlights the value of our office’s role in cutting through red tape and ensuring that agencies follow through on their commitments.”
— Constitutional rights: A state prison inmate complained that his communication privileges were restricted for 90 days for unauthorized possession of contraband. The ombudsman found that under DOC policies, communication privileges could be restricted only “when evidence shows that communication was used for the introduction of any contraband into the institution” – and there was no indication of that occurring in the case at hand.
Although the ombudsman expressed its concern with the prison’s adherence to its own policies, the warden and deputy warden maintained the restriction was justified and so the restrictions remained in place for 90 days. “Our office maintains that while other forms of communication may be restricted, mail is not merely a privilege, it is a constitutional right,” the ombudsman observed in the annual report.
— Delayed surgery: In 2025, a prison inmate complained about a long overdue surgical procedure to remove a bullet fragment from his arm. The ombudsman’s office investigated and found that while a surgery referral had been submitted to a hospital, no appointment had been scheduled and the referral was never processed.
“The oversight meant the inmate was left waiting for a medically necessary procedure with no timeline for resolution,” the office concluded. “Upon our inquiry, the hospital scheduled the surgery —months later than originally intended.”
— Medical care in jails: The report includes two complaints that it said “underscore the importance of proper training and adherence to medical standards in correctional settings.” In one of the two cases, a county jail inmate complained that after he refused one of his prescribed medications, the jail staff informed him that refusing any single medication would result in a denial of all medications at that specific point in time. After the ombudsman’s office intervened, the jail administrator agreed to speak with the staff and review the jail’s medication policies.
In the second case, a county jail inmate noticed employees weren’t changing gloves after being exposed to bodily fluids from one inmate before they tended to other inmates. Noting that “this practice poses a significant risk of cross-contamination and violates widely accepted medical protocols,” the ombudsman raised the issue with the jail administrator, who confirmed the practice violated policy.

Lucas Oil founder Forrest Lucas was posthumously honored as the 2025 Sachem Award honoree by Gov. Mike Braun.
The award is given out once a year to recognize Hoosiers honored for their work and virtue in shaping the state.
Braun presented the award Thursday in the governor’s office to Lucas’ wife Charlotte, son and current Lucas Oil CEO Morgan Lucas, and his wife Katie Lucas, who is president of Lucas Oil.
Lucas, who died in August at age 83, is the 20th Sachem Award honoree and the first chosen by Braun.
“Forrest Lucas exemplified what it means to be a Hoosier,” Braun said in a statement released by his office. “As a self-made entrepreneur, Lucas applied the work ethic he learned on the family farm to build an iconic American company, and left an indelible mark on the state of Indiana through his passion for sports and racing, philanthropy, and moral character.”
Lucas grew up on a small family farm in rural Brown County and started his career as a truck driver before he and his wife founded Lucas Oil in 1989.
The company grew into a multimillion-dollar operation and acquired the naming rights for Lucas Oil Stadium when the Indianapolis Colts opened it in 2008.
The governor’s office credited Lucas as a major supporter of local charities including Project Harvest, Wheeler Mission Drumstick Dash, the Central Indiana Police Foundation, the Colts’ Horseshoe Helpings events, Grit & Grace to encourage young female leaders, as well as hosting the Eric Medlen Memorial Golf Tournament, raising over $1.4 million for Peyton Manning Children’s Hospital.

Indiana Gov. Edgar Whitcomb introduced Sachems to state government, using an Algonquin term for village leaders, in 1970 as a group of business and industry leaders tasked with serving as state hosts.

(Photo by Bill Pugliano/Getty Images)United Autoworkers union members will see several shifts in leadership, including the resignation of President Shawn Fain’s Chief of Staff Chris Brooks, following a supplemental report from the a court-appointed monitor which found further evidence that Fain’s office had retaliated against the union’s secretary-treasurer.
On Thursday, New York Attorney Neil Barofsky released a supplementary report examining additional documents related to his report in June, where he concluded Fain had led an “unfounded” attack against Secretary-Treasurer Margaret Mock after she refused to authorize certain expenditures for Fain’s office, stripping her of several responsibilities.
“The newly produced documents showed that the Compliance Director, Brooks, and Fain each made false or misleading statements to the Monitor during their interviews denying that they had discussed with one another the plan to remove Mock’s departments prior to the February 2024 [international executive board] meeting,” Barofsky wrote.

Upon reviewing a draft of Barofsky’s supplementary report, the union agreed to restore Mock’s responsibilities and take other steps to remedy retaliatory actions from Fain’s office.
Brooks’ tenure with the union will conclude on Dec. 31 and the communications director will be suspended for two weeks without pay and demoted for participating in the plan to retaliate against Mock. 
The union has also promised to restore UAW Vice President Rich Boyer’s oversight of the Stellantis Department, which Boyer alleges was removed due to retaliation. The monitor is still investigating Boyer’s claim.
The UAW also agreed to adopt several other recommendations Barofsky made in a previous report, including removing the union’s compliance department from the president’s office, to report directly to the union’s international executive board. 
In a previous report, Barofsky determined that Fain and his staff had relied on a report from the compliance director accusing Mock of  weaponizing financial policies, obstructing Union operations, and seeking to improperly influence board votes as a pretext for diminishing her authority.
“These significant actions represent a strong step forward for the Union as it grapples with the culture of fear and retaliation that has plagued it since before the monitorship began,” Barofsky wrote in his report. SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Barofsky’s monitorship was put in place as a condition of a 2021 consent decree issued by the U.S. District Court Eastern District of Michigan following an embezzlement and bribery scandal which culminated in prison sentences for several top union leaders and auto executives.
In a statement to the union on Thursday, Fain said he would be appointing Brandon Keatts as his new chief of staff.
“In addition to our work in bargaining and organizing, it is also crucial that we build an internal culture of accountability, fairness, transparency, and collaboration,” Fain said. “Our union is committed to building a culture of compliance, where staff can speak freely without any fear of retaliation.”
In his report, Barofsky said he would not pursue additional remedial action from the union at this time.
“To be clear, these actions will not be sufficient on their own, as it will be critical for the Union to maintain the progress toward cultural reform demonstrated by its actions in response to the facts in this Supplement,” Barofsky wrote.  “But, to be sure, the Union’s commitments are a commendable and meaningful step forward, reflecting courageous action.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/GettyImages-1697753501-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-19 13:57:51.412253

The program, part of the state’s Renew NC effort to rebuild homes in western North Carolina, was set to stop accepting applicants on Dec. 31. Now households will have until Jan. 31 to apply, Gov. Josh Stein’s office said.
“We’re extending the application deadline until the end of January to alleviate stress this holiday season and offer more time for homeowners to get their applications in,” Stein said in a news release.
As of Friday, the program has received just shy of 7,000 total applications; just over 5,000 of those are active and eligible.
Secretary of Commerce Lee Lilley, whose department is overseeing the program, said Friday the extension had been frequently requested.
“We got a lot of feedback that people wanted that,” Lilley said. “We’re going to be ambitious to get more people into the program.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_3421-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-19 13:57:51.412253

Many other faces in photos are redacted. The photos were released without dates or context.

A reproduction of Epstein’s contact list included entries for Trump, his late former wife, Ivana Trump, and his daughter, Ivanka Trump.Trump, who is prolific on social media, had not yet commented in the hours after the files were released. During an earlier press conference on prescription drugs Friday, the president declined to take any questions.Files in the first dataset include images of lavishly furnished rooms, including one that appears to have a taxidermied tiger, as well as bathrooms with framed photographs of women whose faces have been redacted.Photos in the second data set reveal Epstein seated at a table with Jagger, and another of Clinton lying in a hot tub or spa with the top of his chest visible. Another photo was of Clinton with the late pop star Michael Jackson.Clinton was also photographed with a woman, whose face is redacted, seated on his lap and with his arm around her. In another, Clinton and Epstein stand side by side, smiling at something off camera and dressed in shiny party shirts.

In a Dec. 10 letter from Clinton’s lawyer obtained by the New York Times, the former president denies being connected to any alleged crimes Epstein committed. Photos in the third dataset document Epstein’s travels to Europe, desert locations and island locales. Most photos of people other than Epstein, his accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell and Clinton are redacted.

The last dataset also included a completely redacted 119-page grand jury file from New York federal court. Both Epstein and Maxwell were prosecuted in New York, and the Justice Department requested the sealed records be made public.Maxwell was convicted and sentenced for her role in the scheme to traffic teenage girls for sex.The fourth trove of files appeared to relate to law enforcement and attorneys’ investigation into potential sex abusers, such as coordinating interviews and crafting timelines.

Fourth in a series on Arkansas’ crowded prisons

Signs declaring opposition to the prison’s construction line fences and mailboxes along Arkansas 215 as the two-lane road cuts a sloping path through the rugged terrain of the Ouachita Mountains, just south of the Arkansas River.
But Sanders and prison supporters say the state desperately needs more prison beds.  Almost all of the state’s facilities are at or above 100% capacity, according to the latest Department of Corrections population report. Some of the state’s highest-capacity units are more than 100 years old, while many others were built in the 1980s and ’90s.
Meanwhile, county jails, which house the overflow of state inmates, are “bursting at the seams,” even though counties have added a total 3,000 beds of their own since 2016, Sebastian County Sheriff Hobe Runion said in August.
Others, however, believe tax money would be better spent improving mental health and drug treatment services for inmates and for the formerly incarcerated.
“While some folks do things that warrant their incarceration for a period of time, it’s our responsibility as a state to do right by them while they’re incarcerated, and the fact is that over 90% of them are going to be getting out,” said state Sen. Clarke Tucker, a Little Rock Democrat.

Even one of the new prison’s strongest supporters, Republican Sen. Ben Gilmore of Crossett, said more needs to be done to help incarcerated people prepare for when they get out. But he noted that too many state prisoners are waiting in county jails for more bed space to open up in state facilities.
“We have people that are quite literally sitting there not getting the help that they need, not getting the programming that they need,” Gilmore said. That results in months of lost literacy lessons, anger management classes and more, he said.
But Gilmore was also lead sponsor of the Protect Arkansas Act, a 2023 law that will likely add to the need for more prison beds because it requires longer criminal sentencing and reduces parole eligibility.
That means Arkansas’ prison population, already on an upward trajectory, is set to climb even higher, according to Department of Corrections projections. The solution, according to Sanders, her special adviser Joe Profiri, Gilmore and other lawmakers is the Franklin County prison.

Truer sentences 
The Protect Arkansas Act is what criminal justice experts call a “truth-in-sentencing” law, otherwise known as determined sentencing.
“Here in Arkansas, we’ve moved toward, ‘OK, if you commit a certain crime, here’s what you’re going to get, and we’re not going to let you out until you serve a certain amount of time,’” said Michael Cavanaugh, an associate professor and director of the School of Criminal Justice and Criminology at the University of Arkansas in Little Rock.
He said Texas, where someone could get anywhere from probation to 99 years in prison as punishment for robbery, is an example of the opposite.
The Protect Arkansas Act removes parole eligibility for certain felony offenses, particularly violent ones, and provides for harsher sentencing for repeat felony offenders, among other changes. The offenses for which parole is off the table include: human trafficking, Class B felony fleeing and internet stalking of a child. Previously, those convicted of some of these crimes had to serve 70% of their sentence.
Crimes such as exposing someone to HIV without informing them, arson, boating while intoxicated six or more times, or performing an abortion in violation of state law now require people to serve 85% of their sentence before they become parole-eligible.


As a result, over the next decade, the Protect Arkansas Act will increase the demand for prison beds, likely adding 2,902 offenders by 2040, according to prison population projections created by Wendy Ware, a consultant who estimated the Department of Corrections’ prison population for several decades.
The prison population was already growing before the measure passed. After three years of population decreases between 2010 and 2012, the prison population has grown 32.8% since 2012 as of 2024, with much of the increases coming between 2013 to 2015, and 2022 to 2024.
She told the Board of Corrections in November that the new law’s full effects wouldn’t be seen until after 2036, as inmates who would have been handed a shorter sentence remain in prison longer as a result of the Protect Act changes.
Longtime Arkansas defense attorney Jeff Rosenzweig used a hypothetical example to explain why the effects of the law will be delayed.
Before it was passed, he said, someone could get a 15-year sentence and only serve 10. But under the Protect Act, for certain offenses, “now they end up having to do 15. The first 10 is baked in already. It’s that extra five that is going to hit and cause huge overcrowding.”
Rosenzweig said the legislation could worsen behavior inside the prisons by “taking away the carrot we have for good behavior.”
“You’re telling people, no matter how well you behave, no matter what you do, no matter what accomplishments you have, or aging out of the judgment problems that got you there in the first place, there’s nothing you can do to get out.”
Severe sentencing in Arkansas has already forced more people to accept plea deals before the Protect Act passed, even if they have had a valid defense, Rosenzweig said.
“The severity of sentences is so substantial that you have a number of people who will take a lesser prison sentence rather than run the risk of having a sentence that locks them up for the rest of their lives,” he said.
 ‘If you build it’
Cavanaugh said the Protect Act, combined with the new prison, would almost certainly reduce repeat offenders, which accounts for a large percentage of those admitted to Arkansas prisons annually — if only because of the much stricter requirements to be paroled.
“It’s one of things that, if you build it, they will come. That’s always the idea. So they’re going to fill the prison now. You almost have to build it, because of the mandatory sentences and truth-in-sentencing,” he said. “You’re going to have an increased population.”
Arkansas legislators skeptical of prison site selection, frustrated over absence of Sanders staff

Many, including some members of the Board of Corrections, don’t think a 3,000-bed prison is the answer to Arkansas’ persistent crime and prison capacity issues, even as sheriffs, counties and some state legislators push for additional prison space to alleviate the county jail backup. As of Dec. 9, 1,852 people were sitting in county jails waiting for a state prison bed, according to data provided by the Department of Corrections.
BOC Chairman Benny Magness was ambivalent about the Protect Act at times in an interview with the Advocate, though overall mostly supportive. He supported much of the bill when it was moving through the Legislature, he said, including the longer sentences, in order to tamp down on the repeat offenders he said were driving much of the population growth. But Magness also said he wished some offenses requiring 100% of a sentence be served were still eligible for parole.

“With Protect Arkansas, there’s no question there’s going to be a growth curve we’re going to have when it takes full effect,” he said. “But I actually believe the back side of Protect Arkansas will be helpful.”
A 26-year veteran of the board, Magness said he supports Sanders’ push to increase the prison system’s bed capacity. But not necessarily how large the planned prison will be. While recidivism and parole violations fuel about half of prison population growth each year, Magness said drugs play an outsized role in why people come and are later returned to prison, and that more needs to be done to address the problem.
He’s backed up by the department’s data. A 2023 report examining the three-year recidivism rate for people released from the Division of Correction in 2018 said 56% of those who returned to prison on new charges did so on a drug charge.
“My preference would be to decrease the size of what we’re going to build in Franklin County and build more treatment centers,” Magness said. He wishes more had been invested into drug treatment on the front end.
The dedicated drug treatment facilities the department has are already more successful than in regular prison units, Magness said. What hurts the prison population the most, he said, are short sentences for reoffenders, something he said was addressed in the Protect Act, and keeping them for longer will help slow the growth.










We can't build our way out of this problem.


– Sen. Clarke Tucker, D-Little Rock


But Sarah Moore, executive director of the Arkansas Justice Reform Coalition, said in an August interview that the Protect Act was “shooting from the hip” due to limited evidence that longer sentences deter crime. She said it’s part of a longer-term cycle.
“What we’ve seen historically is this swing that keeps happening,” she said, “where we recognize maybe there is a backlog, or we’re seeing overcrowding in a prison, and then it starts to swing one way. Then you get this tough-on-crime rhetoric that occurs. We get this tightening, like zero-tolerance, that happens.”

Moore said young people, who are more likely to commit crime, are already growing up in a world with “a lot of uncertainty and instability,” and that there needs to be greater investment in communities, not prisons.
“When we destabilize our communities further, ultimately we decrease public safety,” Moore said.
Kaleem Nazeem, co-director of decARcerate, agrees that more prisons don’t improve community safety. The nonprofit he leads is dedicated to organizing formerly incarcerated people around efforts to overhaul the criminal justice system. Nazeem was imprisoned for life without parole for a crime he was convicted of as a minor, but was freed after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled the mandatory sentencing of minors to life parole in prison was unconstitutional.
“We don’t need more prisons — and I must highlight this — we need more educational programs. We need more wraparound services. We need more mental health staff. We need more mental health treatment,” Nazeem said.
Tucker said in an August interview that building the prison wouldn’t do anything to address the core issue of the growing population in the first place.
“We can’t build our way out of this problem,” Tucker said. “We don’t have high crime and high incarceration rates because Arkansans are inherently violent. We have high crime and high incarceration rates because there’s some other problems that we need to solve as a society, including our own policies on who goes to prison for how long.”
This is the last in a series of stories examining the cost of Arkansas’ carceral system on people, how state policies and recidivism contribute to overcrowding, and how a 2023 law foretells more increases in the prison population.

The U.S. Senate voted 53-43 along party lines to make Stirling, who started the job on an interim basis in April, the state’s top federal prosecutor. South Carolina’s senators, Lindsey Graham and Tim Scott, both Republicans, voted in favor.
“Bryan is a motivated individual who is highly qualified for this position,” Graham said in a statement soon after the vote. “He will fiercely fight crime and make South Carolina safer.”
SC prisons director sworn in as U.S. attorney; deputy tapped as acting director

As U.S. attorney, Stirling will oversee 120 federal prosecutors. The Trump administration nominated Stirling after removing his predecessor, Adair Ford Boroughs, in February.
Among the cases on his plate are two involving former state legislators. Ex-Rep. RJ May, a West Columbia Republican, is scheduled for sentencing in January after pleading guilty to sending videos of children being sexually abused. And former Rep. Marvin Pendarvis, a North Charleston Democrat, is facing charges of defrauding legal clients, which he denies.
Before his nomination, Stirling spent more than a decade overseeing the state’s 21 prisons, which house more than 16,000 inmates.
As director of the state Department of Corrections, the 56-year-old cracked down on contraband coming into state prisons, including making South Carolina the first state to use a technology that lets cellphone providers shut down illicit phones often used to commit crimes from prison. He led a push to change federal law and allow states to make inmates’ cellphones useless, which the Federal Communications Commission agreed to advance in September.
Stirling successfully asked legislators to raise pay for corrections officers working in the state’s prisons to stem turnover and make it easier to hire qualified officers. And he oversaw a number of programs meant to keep inmates from returning to prison after release.
He also led the department through a 2018 prison riot that left seven inmates dead. And he oversaw the resumption of executions after a 13 year pause, including the addition of the firing squad that legislators required when they made it part of state law in 2021.
The Department of Corrections posted congratulations to Stirling on its social media account Thursday, writing: “South Carolina is lucky to have such a dedicated, ethical public servant, and SCDC is blessed to have had your leadership.”
Joel Anderson, Stirling’s deputy director of operations in the prison system, took over the role soon after Stirling’s April swearing-in as U.S. attorney.
Before overseeing the prisons, Stirling worked as chief of staff for then-Gov. Nikki Haley. He was also deputy attorney general during Gov. Henry McMaster’s two terms as the state’s head prosecutor.

(Photo by Kyle Martin/For the North Dakota Monitor)The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers on Friday issued a long-awaited Dakota Access Pipeline environmental impact statement, recommending that the pipeline keep operating but with some new conditions for its Missouri River crossing in North Dakota.
The pipeline has been operating since June 2017, carrying crude oil from North Dakota’s Bakken oil field to Illinois. The Standing Rock Sioux Tribe has opposed the project and challenged it in court, citing concerns about impacts to the tribe’s Missouri River water supply.
A federal judge in 2020 revoked the easement for the pipeline crossing under the Missouri River just north of the Standing Rock reservation, requiring additional environmental study.
 
More Dakota Access Pipeline coverage


The 464-page environmental impact statement evaluated five alternatives, including denying the easement or rerouting the pipeline. The Corps said its preferred alternative grants the easement, allowing the pipeline to keep operating, but with some additional conditions.
The recommendation is not official until after a 30-day waiting period required under the National Environmental Policy Act. After that period concludes on Jan. 20, 2026, the Corps may issue a record of decision.
The options evaluated were: 

Deny the easement and abandon the pipeline by removal.
Deny the easement and abandon the pipeline in place.
Grant the easement with the same conditions as the previous easement, which Dakota Access LLC preferred.
Grant the easement with additional conditions.
Construct and operate a pipeline reroute north of Bismarck.

In its analysis, the Corps wrote that the fourth option, granting the easement with conditions, protects environmental resources and responds to comments raised by Tribal Nations. 
The conditions aim to prevent an oil spill and minimize the impacts of a spill, such as implementing new leak detection technology as it becomes available and conducting groundwater monitoring and surface water sampling. 
The Army Corps held two meetings in Bismarck in November 2023 to collect public comment on the environmental impact statement. At the time, Corps officials said the final statement was expected in 2024. 
In interviews after those 2023 meetings, the chairs of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe and Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe said the Dakota Access Pipeline was operating illegally without a permit and should be shut down. Tribal leaders and environmental groups have also raised concerns about an inadequate spill response plan.
North Dakota officials, meanwhile, have supported the continuing operation of the pipeline.
“After eight years of operating safely, the Dakota Access Pipeline has become an essential part of our nation’s energy infrastructure,” Gov. Kelly Armstrong said in a statement. “Its continued operation will ensure energy security and affordability for the country while providing positive economic impact that touches every North Dakotan.”

,Mississippi Today,2025-12-19 17:41:11+00:00,Mississippi Today,JSU faces third lawsuit related to presidential choices,Debbie Skipper,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/12/19/jsu-faces-third-lawsuit-related-to-presidential-choices/,Jerome Tinker is suing former JSU president Marcus Thompon and the university in federal court alleging reltaliation in his being turned down for the position of Alumni Affairs director.,"Another lawsuit has emerged in the aftermath of presidential hires at Jackson State University.
Jerome Tinker, who serves in a leadership position in JSU’s Alumni Affairs office, is suing former president Marcus Thompon and the university in federal court for being turned down for the position of office director.
The lawsuit, filed Dec. 12, represents one side of a legal argument. It says Thompson instructed Monica Lewis, then interim vice president of institutional advancement, not to select Tinker as the interim director of Alumni Affairs or for the permanent post even though as alumni engagement officer he was second in command. The lawsuit alleges Thompson’s motivation was retaliation because Tinker had reported the “unlawful conduct toward a female employee” by Thompson’s predecessor, Thomas Hudson.  
“We are aware of the lawsuit and do not comment on pending litigation,” said John Sewell, communications director for the Mississippi Institutions of Higher Learning Board of Trustees, which oversees the state’s eight public universities.
Thompson could not be reached for comment.
The lawsuit alleges that Thompson, who was then working for IHL, was tasked with investigating the allegations against Hudson. It identifies Thompson as Hudson’s “friend and confidante.”
 “Thompson did not interview the female employee during his so-called investigation. Thompson also was aware of Tinker’s complaint to IHL that Hudson attempted to dissuade him in January of 2023 from suing Hudson and JSU retaliation,” according to the lawsuit
Tinker applied for the director position in November 2024. Lewis and Patrease Edwards, president of the JSU National Alumni Association, interviewed the applicants. According to the lawsuit, Lewis told Thompson that Tinker was one of her top choices, but Thompson ordered her not to offer him the position. When she refused to name someone else, Thompson replaced her as the interim vice president with Sloan Cargill, even though a selection committee had chosen her.
Tinker reapplied for Alumni Affairs director when Cargill re-advertised the position, and Thomspn directed Cargill not to select Tucker, according to the lawsuit. The position remains open.
Hudson resigned as president on March 15, 2023. The IHL Board of Trustees appointed Thompson as his successor on Nov. 16, 2023, and he resigned for unstated reasons in May. The IHL board is in a presidential search process now for his successor.
Tinker seeks either instatement to the position of Alumni Affairs director or front pay, equitable back pay, economic damages for his lost pay and fringe benefits, together with compensatory and punitive damages against Thompson for intentional retaliation as determined by a jury. 
In the aftermath of the Hudson and Thompson presidential selections, IHL has faced two lawsuits, one settled for an undisclosed amount and the other winding its way through federal court.
Debra Mays-Jackson, former vice president and chief of staff at Jackson State University, is suing the board of trustees, alleging that despite being qualified to lead Jackson State, she was passed over in 2023 in favor of Hudson, who had less experience. 
IHL trustees had claimed qualified immunity, a legal protection from liability for government officials, in an effort to dismiss the case. But last week, a federal appears court said the sex discrimination case can go forward.
Over the summer, the board and JSU settled a months-long federal lawsuit filed by a former faculty senate president whom Thompson placed on leave pending termination in fall 2024. The settlement gave Dawn Bishop McLin her job back as a tenured professor.  
The exact circumstances of Bishop’s termination were never released, but members of the faculty senate executive committee said she was apparently placed on leave without any written warning and accused of harassment, malfeasance and “contumacious conduct,” a term stemming from IHL policies that means insubordination. 
A faculty panel reviewed the university’s basis for McLin’s termination and recommended she be reinstated, but Thompson never responded, leaving Bishop in a state of limbo.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/13122204/Jackson-State-1.jpg,,,2025-12-19 12:57:41.834636

(File photo by Jessica Holdman/SC Daily Gazette)The U.S. Department of Justice has sent a confidential draft agreement to more than a dozen states that would require election officials to remove any alleged ineligible voters identified during a federal review of their voter rolls.
The agreement — called a memorandum of understanding, or MOU — would hand the federal government a major role in election administration, a responsibility that belongs to the states under the U.S. Constitution.
A Justice Department official identified 11 states that have expressed an interest in the agreement during a federal court hearing in December, according to a transcript reviewed by Stateline. Two additional states, Colorado and Wisconsin, have publicly rejected the memorandum of understanding and released copies of the proposal.
The 11 states “all fall into the list of, they have expressed with us a willingness to comply based on the represented MOU that we have sent them,” Eric Neff, the acting chief of the Justice Department’s Voting Section, said at the hearing. He spoke at a Dec. 4 hearing in a federal lawsuit brought by the Justice Department against California, which has refused a demand for the state’s voter data.
Neff’s courtroom disclosure, which Stateline is the first to report, comes as the Justice Department has sued 21 states and the District of Columbia for unredacted copies of their voter rolls after demanding the data from most states in recent months. The unredacted lists include sensitive personal information, such as driver’s license and partial Social Security numbers.
The states Neff identified are led by Republicans — Alabama, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, South Carolina, South Dakota, Texas, Tennessee, Utah and Virginia.
The draft memorandum of understanding represents a new effort by the Trump administration to gain access to some states’ voter data without litigation.


What’s happening in SC
South Carolina officials have said they’re working with the DOJ to reach an agreement to share voter data.
The state’s Election Commission is being sued over the issue by a voter who cited concerns about how her data would be used by the federal government. State law prohibits divulging certain personal information, her attorney wrote in a recent court filing.
In hearings in that lawsuit, state officials said they won’t hand over any confidential voter data until they reach an agreement with the federal government that does not violate privacy rights enshrined in the state’s constitution.E
Election Commission officials have not publicly clarified what, if any, pieces of voter data they may seek to keep private. The commission’s public information director did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The administration’s lawsuits mostly target Democratic states, where election officials refused initial requests for voter data and allege the demand is unlawful and risks the privacy of millions of voters. They have also voiced fears that the Trump administration could use the information to target its political enemies.
Neff said four states with Republican secretaries of state — Arkansas, Indiana, Kansas and Wyoming — have “complied voluntarily” with the Justice Department’s demand without memoranda of understanding.










What the DOJ is trying to do is something that should frighten everybody across the political spectrum.


– David Becker, executive director of the nonpartisan Center for Election Innovation & Research


The Justice Department says it needs voters’ detailed information to ensure ineligible people are kept off state voter rolls and that only citizens are voting.
Federal officials say they will follow federal privacy laws, but critics fear voter data is being shared with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, which operates a powerful citizenship verification tool known as SAVE. The Trump administration has previously confirmed the Justice Department plans to share voter data with Homeland Security.
“What the DOJ is trying to do is something that should frighten everybody across the political spectrum,” said David Becker, executive director of the nonpartisan Center for Election Innovation & Research. “They’re trying to use the power of the executive branch to bully states into turning over highly sensitive data: date of birth, Social Security number, driver’s license — the holy trinity of identity theft.”
Becker, who worked as a senior trial attorney in the Justice Department’s Voting Section during the Clinton and George W. Bush administrations, told reporters on Dec. 8 that several states received the memorandum. But Neff’s identification of 11 states wasn’t widely available until the judge in the California lawsuit on Tuesday ordered the transcript of the Dec. 4 hearing immediately posted to the lawsuit’s public docket, where Stateline accessed it.

The draft memorandum of understanding, which is labeled “confidential,” outlines the terms of the proposed agreement between each state and the Justice Department. After a state provides its voter roll, the federal department would agree to test, analyze and assess the information. The department would then notify states of “any voter list maintenance issues, insufficiencies, inadequacies, deficiencies, anomalies, or concerns” found.
Each state would agree to “clean” its voter roll within 45 days by removing any ineligible voters, according to the memorandum. States would then resubmit their voter data to the Justice Department for verification.
While the Justice Department has demanded states’ voter rolls since this summer, the memorandum of understanding offers the most detailed picture to date of how the Trump administration plans to use the data.
“It lays out in a way that we haven’t seen in any other context their plan for one of the things, I will say, that they plan to do, which is disturbing,” said Eileen O’Connor, a senior counsel and manager in the voting rights and election program at the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University, a progressive think tank.
O’Connor was a trial attorney in the Justice Department’s Voting Section during the Obama, first Trump and Biden administrations. “I think with each passing lawsuit, they are clearly trying to create a national database of every voter in the country,” she said.
The Justice Department didn’t answer questions from Stateline about how many states had been sent the memorandum and whether any had signed it.
Assistant U.S. Attorney General Harmeet Dhillon, who leads the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division, wrote in a statement to Stateline that the department has a statutory mandate to enforce federal voting rights laws. Ensuring the voting public’s confidence in election integrity is a top priority of the Trump administration, she wrote.
“Clean voter rolls and basic election safeguards are requisites for free, fair, and transparent elections,” Dhillon wrote.
Federal involvement in elections
The Justice Department memorandum, if implemented, would mark a significant departure from how election officials typically maintain voter rolls.
States, often in coordination with local election officials, check lists for changes in address, deaths and other reasons for ineligibility, such as a felony conviction. States typically perform this task with little to no federal involvement.
SC elections agency weeks away from possible DOJ agreement amid voter privacy lawsuit

Some states participate in voluntary programs that allow election officials to share voter information with other states for the purposes of looking for voters who may have moved or who are registered in multiple locations. But those don’t include the federal government, which plays a limited role in election administration under the United States’ decentralized approach to elections.
Matt Crane, executive director of the Colorado County Clerks Association, said clerks continually look at death records and other sources of data to update voter lists. He said the United States’ localized election system is a strength that guards against election interference.
“The federal government has no role in list maintenance,” Crane said.
But that has begun to change under the Trump administration, as President Donald Trump has made removing noncitizen voters a priority.
Earlier this year, Homeland Security overhauled the SAVE program into a tool that can scan millions of voter records against government databases for evidence of citizenship. The program was previously used for one-off searches to check whether noncitizens were eligible for government benefits.
Some Republican secretaries of state have agreed to upload their voter rolls into SAVE. Democratic secretaries of state object to using the program and say they are wary of what will happen to the voter information once it’s provided to the Trump administration, including its potential use by the Department of Homeland Security.
While SAVE can flag voters with potential eligibility issues, the onus now is still on state officials to investigate whether those voters are actually ineligible and decide whether to initiate a process to remove them from the rolls.
By contrast, the Justice Department memorandum would empower federal officials to take a more active role, allowing them to check the work of state election officials as they remove — or don’t remove — voters.
“We have a system that allows Americans to voice their opinions and to hold government accountable, and that is so fundamentally central to the way our system works,” Oregon Democratic Secretary of State Tobias Read, who has been sued by the Justice Department, said in an interview. “We should be focused on how to make that better, not on erecting artificial barriers and putting people’s privacy and confidence at risk for no reason.”
Republican interest
Some GOP election officials have welcomed the Trump administration’s interest and have accused the Biden administration of not doing enough to help states vet their voter rolls. In particular, they praise the overhaul of SAVE, which some GOP secretaries of state had requested before Trump took office.
Some secretaries have touted the removal of noncitizen voters after using SAVE. Wyoming Secretary of State Chuck Gray, a Republican, in November announced three voters identified as noncitizens had been removed from his state’s voter rolls. Gray has also provided the Justice Department with full access to Wyoming’s voter roll.
“The voter list maintenance that we have been conducting is extremely important for election integrity,” Gray said in a news release.
But as of early December, nearly all states hadn’t provided the Justice Department access to their unredacted voter rolls, with Neff identifying only four that had shared their lists. It also remains unclear whether any state has signed the memorandum of understanding. No state has told Stateline it signed the document.
Nebraska Secretary of State Robert Evnen, a Republican, has received a memorandum of understanding and plans to comply with the Justice Department request, pending the outcome of an ongoing lawsuit, Evnen spokesperson Rani Taborek-Potter wrote in an email to Stateline. A voting advocacy group has sued to block the release of the data.
In an interview with Kentucky Lantern, Kentucky Republican Secretary of State Michael Adams said that his office was “going back and forth a little bit” with the Justice Department over what federal law requires.
“We’ve not really figured out exactly where that line is of what-all they’re entitled to,” Adams said. “What’s not in dispute is they’re entitled to the vast majority of information — people’s names, addresses, birthdays — and we’ve given them all of that.”
Adams added that many state officials “are in the same boat of trying to figure out what exactly they need to do their job and what our obligations are legally.”
Utah Lt. Gov. Deidre Henderson, a Republican, confirmed in a statement to Stateline that her office received a proposed memorandum of understanding from the Justice Department. “We are in the process of reviewing the document with our attorneys and carefully considering our options,” Henderson wrote.
Rachael Dunn, a spokesperson for Missouri Republican Secretary of State Denny Hoskins, wrote in an email that the state hadn’t entered into an agreement with the Justice Department “at this time.”
DOJ ‘contractor’ could get voter data
The draft agreement would give the Justice Department wide authority to share the voter data of states that sign on.
The department would be authorized to share the data with “a contractor” who needs access “to perform duties related” to voter list maintenance verification, according to the draft agreement. The agreement doesn’t name any contractors or specify whether they would be inside or outside of government.
Two states have publicly rejected the draft agreement. Colorado Democratic Secretary of State Jena Griswold announced Dec. 3 she would refuse to sign the memorandum. The Justice Department later sued Colorado.
The Wisconsin Elections Commission also rejected the draft agreement that week. In a Dec. 11 letter to Neff, the Justice Department official, the commissioners wrote that state law prohibits them from releasing certain personally identifiable information, such as date of birth, Social Security numbers and driver’s license numbers.
“I don’t look at the action that we’re taking today to be commentary on the motive of the appropriateness of the Department of Justice’s request,” Commissioner Don Millis, a Republican appointee, said at a virtual commission meeting the same day. “The U.S. DOJ is simply asking the commission to do something that the commission is explicitly forbidden by Wisconsin law to do.”
The Justice Department on Thursday sued Wisconsin for its voter data.
Justin Levitt, who served as senior policy adviser for democracy and voting rights in the Biden White House and is now a law professor at Loyola Marymount University, told Stateline in an email that he expects no states to sign the agreement.
“It’s no surprise that both Colorado and Wisconsin said no — and I don’t think that’s a question of political leadership,” Levitt wrote. “It’s hard for me to imagine any Republican state with faith in its own list maintenance capacity agreeing to outsource that decision to the DOJ.”

You can read more about the section here.

When I think of a student who “has it all,” Julie springs to mind. A cheerleader and beauty pageant contestant, she excels in sports and math.
Part of my inclusion class last school year and this year as an 8th grader, she works hard throughout her schoolday—from history to math to computer courses—completing in-class and homework assignments on time.
Yet, despite her many strengths, Julie faces a serious challenge: reading fluently. When she looks at a piece of printed text, her mind sees a jumbled mess of words, like a foreign language. As her teacher, I see her struggle to sound out words, and the frustration on her face breaks my heart.
Julie, like 10% of the world’s population, has dyslexia. She gets support from tutors in all her classes and, as part of her classroom accommodations, can have information read aloud to her whenever that helps her learn better. With these supports—whether from a teacher or a computer program—she is able to bridge the gap caused by her disability and succeed academically.
Because of this, Julie’s reading scores grew from 40% last spring to a 90% this fall, showing strong comprehension skills. Her face lit up when I shared the results with her. 
About 15% of students in our state are in special education, which is similar to the national average. However, when students like Julie take the Mississippi Academic Assessment Program (MAAP) required for graduation, only the questions are read aloud—not the passages. The test is designed to measure reading comprehension, which is Julie’s strength—if she can understand the text. MAAP unfairly limits her ability to show what she knows, turning the happy “All-American” girl into a deflated version of herself who worries that not being able to read the passage independently will derail her dream of becoming an engineer.

More than half of states—29 of them—allow state assessment reading passages and stimulus materials to be read to students who have dyslexia and other disabilities. Mississippi must follow suit, switching on the reading lightbulb for our learners and improving our ability to measure what they truly know.
To achieve this, the state should start by creating a task force that includes educators to study the academic benefits and economic implications of allowing students with documented learning differences, including those with dyslexia like Julia, to have state testing passages read aloud. 
As part of its work, the task force could gather case studies from teachers like me who have seen their students grow tremendously in their ability to understand what they read when it’s read aloud to them.
For Julie, the confidence she has gained this school year means she can fully participate in history class discussions about American explorers and Teddy Roosevelt’s visit to Mississippi. Now that she can access more information in her computer course, she is solving advanced math word problems and creating code to make her own video game.
As her future as an engineer seems more likely these days, she beams when she shares she has an A in that class. I know there are many other stories just like Julie’s across Mississippi that make the case for MAAP read-aloud accommodations.  
With the help of the read-alouds in class and continued fluency skill-building, Julie now has a favorite author: Lurlene McDaniel. Like the heroines in the novels that overcome serious illness, she is able to overcome her fear of reading fluently. The reading lightbulb has been switched on for her.
Mississippi must help ensure it turns on for all students in the Magnolia State.

(Photo by Dana DiFilippo/New Jersey Monitor)A New Jersey appeals court on Friday reversed a Newark police officer’s official misconduct conviction, finding the second job he held while on paid sick leave lacked the connection to his official duties needed to sustain such a charge.
Newark police officer Anthony Gibson was convicted of theft and official misconduct for violating department policy that bars officers from working a second job while on paid sick leave, but the latter conviction could not stand, the three-judge panel ruled.
Judge Jack Sabatino wrote for the panel that the defendant’s conduct, although it was a crime of theft, did not constitute the “unauthorized exercise of his official functions.”
New Jersey’s official misconduct statute allows charges against officials if they commit an unauthorized act that leverages their position, but only if that act is related to their office and they are aware it is unauthorized.
Courts have upheld official misconduct convictions where, for example, officers used their police cars or computers for personal business or used their office to avoid scrutiny as part of a shoplifting scheme, the panel said.
But crimes that don’t touch on the office — like keeping money accidentally withdrawn from another person’s bank account at an ATM — do not invoke official misconduct because the offense is not related to an official’s duties.
Gibson’s acceptance of sick time pay fell in the latter category because his second job as a security guard did not involve police duties like arresting and interrogating suspects or securing warrants, the court ruled.
“He did not interact with the public acting, or pretending to act as, a law enforcement official. He was not functioning as a police officer, nor was he portraying himself to others as acting in an official police capacity,” Sabatino wrote.
The Newark Police Department bars its workers from working a second job while out on paid sick leave.
The court upheld Gibson’s theft conviction in an unpublished portion of the opinion that did not set precedent.
The appeals panel remanded the case to a lower court so Gibson could be resentenced. He was originally sentenced to a five-year term for the theft and official misconduct convictions.
He separately pleaded guilty to passing bad checks, conspiracy to distribute controlled dangerous substances, and official misconduct related to the drug charge.

(Photo by Mike Clark for the Daily Montanan)An executive order from President Donald Trump has put into question artificial intelligence laws passed by state legislatures across the nation, including in Montana this year.
The Montana state legislature passed numerous laws surrounding the new and rapidly evolving technology, including things like generative artificial intelligence, the process of using a written prompt to create an image. The state also passed artificial intelligence laws in regards to elections, and sideboards for its use in state government business.
Following news this week the president signed the order, Montana legislators warned against overreacting to it — and also stressed that local control is important to Montanans.
“They voted for us to go to the legislature and pass laws that are in their best interest,” said Rep. Jill Cohenour, a Helena Democrat and sponsor of one such bill.
The executive order says it will ask the U.S. Attorney’s Office to look at state laws surrounding artificial intelligence.
“It is the policy of the United States to sustain and enhance the United States’ global AI dominance through a minimally burdensome national policy framework for AI,” the executive order reads.
It goes on to say some laws that have been passed go too far.
“A carefully crafted national framework can ensure that the United States wins the AI race, as we must,” the order reads. “Until such a national standard exists, however, it is imperative that my administration takes action to check the most onerous and excessive laws emerging from the states that threaten to stymie innovation.”
Additionally, the order also targets the Broadband Equity Access and Deployment program. That program was created to increase internet access across the country as part of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, a key piece of legislation that passed during the pandemic under President Joe Biden.
That program has sent hundreds of millions of federal dollars to Montana to address the state’s connectivity issues, though it’s had problems. Some fiber optic companies have struggled to complete some projects, and it’s been for a variety of reasons, including issues with railroad companies.
The broadband program has also changed significantly under Trump and now includes major contracts — including in Montana — going to Amazon and SpaceX for satellite internet. Both companies, and specifically SpaceX’s mogul, Elon Musk, have embraced artificial intelligence in those businesses. 
It’s unclear if any specific Montana artificial intelligence laws are under review by the federal government and the state Department of Administration did not respond to a request for comment on the subject. The DOA has helped administer the BEAD funds.
State Sen. Daniel Zolnikov, a Billings Republican who has a hand in much of the state’s tech policy during the last several sessions, said some patience might be in order.
“I believe people are jumping the gun and overreacting on what state laws would be overruled by the executive order,” Zolnikov said.
Some, including the Alliance for Secure AI, a Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit, are calling potentially cutting the BEAD funds a way to “beat the states into submission” when it comes to AI laws Trump and his associates don’t like.
“I think they know that legislators and governors and attorneys general will continue to fight against this idea,” the nonprofit’s CEO, Brendan Steinhauser, told the Daily Montanan in early December. “But if they’re threatened with losing billions of dollars and funding for rural broadband, that might be a way to try and keep them out of this discussion.”
There is concern about federal laws preempting state artificial intelligence laws passed around the country. In late November, around 280 state lawmakers from around the country signed onto a letter asking not to include any artificial intelligence language that would limit state legislatures’ ability to create legislation in the National Defense Authorization Act. That moratorium was removed from the defense bill, which did pass on Wednesday. There was also an earlier attempt, which also failed, to add a 10-year moratorium on state artificial intelligence laws in the “Big, Beautiful” reconciliation bill.
“A blanket prohibition on state and local AI and automated decision-system regulation would abruptly cut off active democratic debate in statehouses and impose a sweeping pause on policymaking at the very moment when communities are seeking responsive solutions,” the letter reads. “As state lawmakers and policymakers, we hear regularly from constituents about rising online harms and the growing influence of AI on their lives.”
That letter was signed by a number of Montana state politicians — both Democrats and Republicans — and included several in leadership positions. Cohenour was one of those and is concerned by the executive order.
“Here’s the big concern for me: If the federal government hasn’t come out with anything that matches the stuff that we’re trying to deal with in the states, then they should not be preempting that,” Cohenour said Wednesday. “That is not what the people of Montana want.”
Cohenour said she feels like it could disincentivize laws around artificial intelligence moving forward. There’s a frustration, too, that Congress hasn’t done anything at all on the topic.
“In the past, when states have made moves on these big things that are of national concern, a lot of times, it has finally forced the hand of the federal government to actually do something, and they’ve taken action,” Cohenour said. “And it mirrors a lot of what the states have tried to do, because that’s what the citizens have wanted.”
Few of the laws Montana passed around artificial intelligence were specifically controversial, though they generated plenty of discussion. Those same bills were also supported by politicians from vastly different political backgrounds, and few votes around those bills were close. The state also currently has an interim study into the issue of artificial intelligence.
Additionally, the state has also released artificial intelligence guidelines for its public schools.
Zolnikov sponsored Senate Bill 212, which created the Right to Compute Act to protect the individual use of AI and allow the state to restrict it in limited circumstances. 
Cohenour saw House Bill 514 passed and signed, which gives a person the legal right to their name, image and likeness. It also established penalties for violating that law.
Rep. Braxton Mitchell, a Flathead Republican, also saw House Bill 178 passed, which limited artificial intelligence use by local and state governments in Montana. It also provided outlines on what situations would be considered prohibited, including, “for the cognitive behavioral manipulation of a person or group,” and “to classify a person or group based on behavior, socioeconomic status, or personal characteristics resulting in unlawful discrimination.”
Montana also looked to reign in artificial intelligence election deepfakes through Senate Bill 25, from Sen. Janet Ellis, a Helena Democrat. 
That’s a concern for Sen. Shane Morigeau, a Missoula Democrat.
“Just wait until the next big wave of political races comes in,” Morigeau said. “It’s going to be weird.”
He said during the session, the caucus was focused on protecting Montanans from things that could potentially harm them. And Morigeau added there’s also a strong support for local control in the state. There’s certainly resources the federal government has that Montana does not, and there’s a willingness to work with them on tech policy, he said — it just has to be something that works for the state’s citizens.
“It’s not like we want to stop advancements and technology by any means,” Morigeau told the Daily Montanan. “It’s just about making sure that it’s not the Wild West.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/230426-CapitolStockPhotos01-scaled-e1731707160413-1024x577.jpg,,,2025-12-19 11:59:30.118531

This year’s strong ticket sales reflect that loyalty, with most performances selling out well before the final week leading up to Christmas.
The Saturday matinee creates a particularly welcoming environment for families. The daytime setting makes it easier for children, parents, and grandparents to attend together, while the familiar music and inviting theater atmosphere help younger audience members stay engaged without being overwhelmed. It’s an experience that feels festive without being rushed, offering a meaningful way to slow down during a busy holiday season.
Candlelight Theatre, located on Millers Road in Wilmington, has built a reputation for producing accessible, high-quality musical performances that bring the community together. Christmas by Candlelight reflects that mission, celebrating the joy, reflection, and togetherness that define the holidays.
With Christmas just days away and most performances already sold out, the remaining special Saturday afternoon show stands out as a unique opportunity. Whether it becomes a new family tradition or a one-time holiday treat, Christmas by Candlelight offers a chance for adults and children alike to feel fully immersed in the spirit of the season.",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/587711789_18316925518218836_1796152434029560471_n.jpg,,,2025-12-19 11:59:30.118531

Noem said on social media she was “immediately directing (U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services) to pause the DV1 program to ensure no more Americans are harmed by this disastrous program.”  
Local authorities found the suspect, Portuguese national Claudio Manuel Neves Valente, dead in a New Hampshire storage unit late Thursday, five days after the shooting at Brown in Providence, Rhode Island, that wounded nine and killed two students. 
Two days after the Brown shooting, an MIT professor was found shot in his home and later died at the hospital. Authorities also linked that killing to Neves Valente.
Neves Valente, 48, attended Brown in the early 2000s.
Visa program
The diversity visa program, also known as DV1, grants up to 50,000 immigrant visas each year under a lottery system that aims to select individuals from countries with low rates of immigration to the U.S. 
Most lottery winners reside outside the United States and are processed by the State Department. Lottery winners who are within the U.S. are processed by USCIS. 
More than 14 million individuals applied for the program in 2021, the most recent year for which the State Department has data.
Noem said in her post she was acting on behalf of President Donald Trump, who tried to end the diversity visa program in his first term after an individual from Uzbekistan who came through the program carried out an attack in New York City that killed eight people.
It’s the latest effort by the Trump administration to curtail legal immigration after a tragedy. 
The administration paused asylum applications after an Afghan national who was granted asylum was charged with killing one National Guard member and wounding another in last month’s shooting in Washington, D.C.

(Photo: Getty Images) Eight months after the North Carolina House gave the green light to the state treasurer to invest a small percentage of the state’s pension fund in cryptocurrencies, a legislative committee met Wednesday to explore alternative uses for blockchain and digital assets.
Rep. David Willis acknowledged that while there’s still a big learning curve for many legislators, there is also great opportunity.
“We’re here to talk about real-world applications that can be used for government efficiency and accountability,” said Willis.
The Union County Republican said North Carolina needs to position itself to leverage the technology and be at the forefront of an industry that’s going to create new jobs and new companies.
Michael Postupak, the policy engagement manager for the nonprofit Blockchain Association, told lawmakers that to understand the benefits, it helps to visualize blocks in a blockchain as data where new transactions can be added. New blocks of data are connected through cryptography, essentially a unique digital fingerprint or ‘hash.’ And as more blocks are added, more cryptography enters the system, becoming a much stronger record.
Postupak said owners have full control of their digital assets with a public address and a private digital key.
“Blockchains are powered by a global, decentralized distributed network of computers that verify, secure and digitally store information,” Postupak explained. “With these networks being supported by hundreds, if not thousands, of computers globally, the chance that there’s ever a network failure is almost zero.”
“So, who are these decentralized computers? How do we know that’s a trustworthy source?” asked Rep. Allison Dahle (D-Wake).

Postupak said the number of computers in the network prevents the information from being tampered with. In Bitcoin’s vast network of thousands of computers, to take control of the network, you would have to have control over 50% of the computers in that network, he said.
“Could we use this blockchain technology for voting online?” Dahle asked. “Would that make it safer for casting ballots or for military people to cast ballots from overseas?”
“I know that’s something that countries and municipalities around the world are looking at,” said Postupak, who added he would need more time to research the question.
Anthony Janocko with New York-based Ava Labs, said California’s DMV is a good example of how governments can use the technology. Their blockchain infrastructure has been enormously successful in digitizing 42 million car titles.
“That’s another way you can think about digital assets — it’s basically taking something that exists in the real world, then applying it to the framework of blockchain technology, allowing for some of the digital ownership and provability of those assets online,” said Janocko.
In the case of the California DMV, residents had access to verifiable digital credentials and the ability to check on the status of their digital titles.
“Each event or digital asset or title in its lifecycle process was basically being tacked onto the blockchain,” Janocko explained.“When users or DMV workers need to look up certain titles, they’re able to see that full history.”
Janocko said the end result is an auditable log of all the previous transactions that exist on a ledger, reducing time during an audit or reconciliation. He said it’s a far better system than a traditional database, which often cannot be shared across agencies.
“What the blockchain solved with this case is, it created a tamper-proof system of record of ownership of vehicles, allowing for real-time updates and verification of history of those specific titles,” he said.
Janocko said the blockchain infrastructure is not about rebuilding government systems from scratch. Rather, it’s about adding a modern shared system of records underneath that can be referenced with a high degree of integrity.

Wyoming is exploring blockchain technology with the first state-issued stable token. In its pilot, real-time government contractor payments using the token, managed on a blockchain network, reduced the timelines for payouts from 45 days to just a few seconds.
John Bridge of the Atlanta-based firm Trust Stamp said blockchain is being used in Africa to digitize property records and improve accountability.
A permissioned blockchain allows multiple agencies to access the records, with the chain recording if any errors were made, when a correction occurred, and who made the correction.
“We’re able to see that full data. That increases transparency and trust in the system. And then it also speeds up the sales and transfers,” explained Bridge.
Baltimore County is using the technology in a pilot project to more accurately assess distressed properties, said Bridge. Payment and delinquency events can be tracked more easily, improving collections efficiency.
Improving services at the DMV and revenue collection are two areas that hold great appeal for North Carolina lawmakers heading into 2026.
While Wednesday’s committee hearing was for informational purposes, Rep. Willis said it was clear that blockchain technology is the future of data retention.
“This isn’t just a fad. Whatever we can do to help get ahead and craft what that’s going to look like and for the betterment of North Carolina and the efficiency of our government, we’re all for it,” said Willis.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/GettyImages-1320072430-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-19 11:59:30.118531

“The District has requested a third party to complete the Title IX investigation and provide a recommended determination,” Monroe Public Schools said in a statement. “The district has chosen to use a third party so that the investigation can be completed in a manner that allows for complete transparency from beginning to end.”
The Title IX complaint alleges that, at a Sept. 9 game between Monroe High School and Ann Arbor Skyline, the two teams shared a locker room. 
“My daughter was forced to share a locker room, where females undressed, with the male athlete,” the complaint says. “The presence of a male in the girls’ locker room was not disclosed prior to the match, constituting a violation of privacy and bodily integrity protections under Title IX.”
Lechner is calling for an investigation into the situation and a ban on trans athletes playing on girls’ teams.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
“Title IX was written to protect students from discrimination and so that all girls can play sports,” Erin Knott, the executive director of Equality Michigan, wrote in a statement to Michigan Advance. “The law was never intended to force schools to disclose private information about children.”
“Parents may have questions, but that doesn’t mean they can pressure schools to confirm or deny whether a student is transgender,” Knott added. “Trans students have been participating in team sports for decades in Michigan, learning the same things all students learn about teamwork, dedication, and hard work.”
The complaint also alleges that the Michigan High School Athletic Association did not appropriately grant a waiver for a transgender player to play on a girls’ sports team. 
The Michigan High School Athletic Association says it received one waiver for a transgender child to play sports for the 2025-26 fall sports season, Geoff Kimmerly, the communications for the association wrote to the Advance.
Kimmerly did not provide further information due to privacy laws, but added that “the waiver was granted in compliance with applicable state and federal law.”
Current association guidelines do not prohibit transgender girls from playing on girls’ sports teams at the high school level, but do require submission of documentation that details the gender listed on a number of documents for the student, as well as information on the status of the student’s medical transition. 
The Skyline High School student, who has not been publicly named, came under fire after a right-wing sports blog owned by Fox Corporation published a wave of articles attacking the student, as well as the state’s high school athletic association for its handling of the situation. 
The decision to put Hesson on leave came after Uncloseted Media, a LGBTQ+ news outlet, posted a brief clip of an interview that they did with Hesson on their Instagram account. 
“For this alleged student at Skyline, my heart goes to them, whether they’re trans or not, just having that much negative eyeball on you and rhetoric is incredible,” Hesson said. “The amount of pressure that you feel as a 16 or 17 or 18 year old to have to deal with that, I would not wish that on anybody.”
“Monroe Public Schools only issues official statements through the Office of the Superintendent or the Board President. Individual staff members expressing their personal opinions do not express the official position of the District,” Monroe Public Schools wrote in a statement. “The Athletic Director’s podcast appearance was not previously authorized by the District and is not an official statement on behalf of the District.”
“You’re really impacting somebody’s life in a negative way,” Hesson said in the interview. “And not just that one person, but any other trans athlete that wants to participate, but is choosing not to because they don’t have to go through this s**t.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/GettyImages-1343826350-1024x790.jpg,,,2025-12-19 11:59:30.118531

Schedule I, the most restrictive category under federal law, indicates a high likelihood of abuse and no accepted medical value (Getty Images).President Donald Trump’s executive order to reschedule marijuana won’t change much in terms of how Missouri’s marijuana industry operates, business owners and legal experts agree. 
It doesn’t change the fact that marijuana can’t be transported or sold across state lines. It doesn’t do away with the cap on the number of business licenses to cultivate and sell marijuana in Missouri. 
And it doesn’t allow customers to use credit cards at dispensaries,  since credit card networks and issuing banks are still governed by institutional risk frameworks that prohibit cannabis transactions.
But the order will give Missouri marijuana companies some tax relief and long-awaited recognition for the medicinal benefits their products can offer, said Mark Hendren, president of Flora Farms cannabis company that operates 12 dispensaries in Missouri.
“Obviously for a cannabis company like us, the big impact is allowing us to pay our taxes and run our businesses just like all other legal businesses,” Hendren said. 
Right now, marijuana companies can’t deduct many business expenses from their taxes, including rent, travel, advertising and most professional services. 
“Frankly, it’s a testament to the resilience of the industry that they’ve been able to be a profitable model, even without 280E tax deductions,” said Craig Small, a Denver-based cannabis attorney. “But with this coming change, certainly that might immediately increase profits by about 30%.”
Trump’s order moves cannabis from Schedule I to Schedule III on the Federal Drug Administration’s list of controlled substances. Schedule I, the most restrictive category under federal law, indicates a high likelihood of abuse and no accepted medical value. 
Trump said the move reflected that cannabis could have medicinal value, even if abuse was still possible.
The rescheduling process is predicted to take place during 2026, Small said, but the timeline is still unclear.
Nicholas Rinella, CEO of Hippos cannabis company, said it’s encouraging to see cannabis operators moving closer to being “treated like every other legitimate business.”
“That shift allows us to reinvest into our operations, scale responsibly and continue delivering world-class products,” Rinella said. “It’s also meaningful to see the federal government begin to align with public sentiment in recognizing the real societal benefits of cannabis.”
Andrew Mullins, executive director of the Missouri Cannabis Trade Association, said rescheduling properly recognizes cannabis as medicine and allows for greater research of marijuana.
Mullins pointed out that marijuana has been listed as a Schedule I drug since 1970, along with heroin, LSD and ecstasy because the federal government previously determined that there were no currently accepted medical uses for cannabis. 
“Federal rescheduling of cannabis removes barriers and creates opportunity for the 40 U.S. states, including Missouri, that have legalized medical and/or adult-use cannabis,” he said. “And no other state in the country is as well positioned as Missouri to take advantage of this reform.
Mullins said Missouri’s cannabis industry has been called one of the most successful in the entire country. 
Since Missouri’s first legal medical marijuana sale in 2020, he said Missouri has surpassed $4.5 billion in total cannabis sales. In 2024 alone, the Missouri cannabis industry generated $244.93 million in sales tax revenue for state and local governments. 
Hippos recently launched the state’s first THC oral spray, and the timing couldn’t be better for innovation in the space, Rinella said. 
Cannabis prohibition, he said, represents a relatively short chapter in human history, and the country is “approaching a point where history corrects itself.” 
“Forty years from now, my grandkids will probably have a harder time understanding that I grew up in an era when cannabis was federally prohibited,” Rinella said, “than they will understanding that I grew up before the internet existed.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/GettyImages-833712532-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-19 11:59:30.118531

CT has lots of real ones,Sasha Allen,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/12/19/ct-christmas-tree-farms/,"Artificial Christmas trees remain more popular than their natural counterparts — even in CT, which is home to more than 70 tree farms.","Across the country, artificial Christmas trees remain more popular than their natural counterparts — even in Connecticut, which is home to 4,039 acres of tree farms, according to 2022 USDA data.
Nationwide, 83% of households choosing to display a tree this holiday season opted for artificial, but the American Farm Bureau urged consumers to choose natural. Natural trees support domestic jobs while most artificial trees are imported from overseas, and the Bureau also argued real trees have positive environmental impacts. 
The Connecticut Christmas Tree Association lists 77 farms that sell Christmas trees in the state, but there are hundreds more than that. While some farms are closed for the season, Connecticut is home to 547 operations with areas in production, according to 2022 USDA data — so the state is not lacking in Christmas trees. 
A 2019 census from the United States Department of Agriculture found that, in Connecticut, there were 110,000 trees being grown that would be ready to harvest this holiday season. If those numbers remain accurate, Connecticut will take 14th place for tree inventory this year. But that doesn’t mean all those trees were sold, especially with the popularity of artificial trees.
A tree needs seven to 10 years of growth to reach the heights that most consumers expect, typically spending their first years in nurseries. Due to their ability to extract carbon from the atmosphere, many argue that real trees should be purchased. 
However, real trees are not always the most environmentally friendly option. Artificial tree production does use significant energy, and most of these trees are made in China, so they have to be shipped overseas. But depending on the disposal method, real trees may cause environmental harm, especially if incinerated.
The National Wildlife Federation found that, if used for five to 10 years, an artificial tree will leave less of a carbon footprint than purchasing a real tree each year. But other sources, like the Nature Conservancy, say the environmental benefits of a real tree outweigh the negatives.
Price, however, is also a factor for many in choosing their tree. Artificial tree costs spiked this year but still could pay off in the long run compared to a real tree.
Since China is the primary producer of artificial trees, costs have risen under the tariffs.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/eHOhP-where-are-connecticut-s-tree-farms-located--1024x897.png,,,2025-12-19 11:59:30.118531

McDonald,,,,,https://newjerseymonitor.com/2025/12/19/lgbtq-group-director-arrest/,The Garden State Equality director resigned this week after news surfaced of his November arrest. What did the group's board know about the allegations?,"Christian Fuscarino, left, stepped down as director of Garden State Equality this week after news surfaced of his November arrest on child abuse allegations. (Photo by Dana DiFilippo/New Jersey Monitor)What did they know and when did they know it?
That’s the question I and many others have about Garden State Equality’s board members in the aftermath of news that the LGBTQ rights group’s executive director, Christian Fuscarino, was arrested last month and charged with abusing his foster child.
Fuscarino managed to keep the charges under wraps for nearly a month, and then resigned from Garden State Equality on Tuesday within eight hours of the first news report on them. It’s still a mystery whether any board members knew of the arrest and did not force Fuscarino out or convince him to resign before it became a public scandal.
This isn’t just any private organization. Garden State Equality received at least $2.5 million in state funding in the current budget, and millions more before. And Fuscarino is a major player in Trenton. Scroll through his Facebook photos and you’ll see a collection of selfies he took with Gov.-elect Mikie Sherrill, Gov. Phil Murphy, Attorney General Matt Platkin, state senators and assembly people — if you’re a Democrat with any importance in the state, Fuscarino probably has a photo posing with you.
Hiding behind that selfie smile lurked something much darker, police allege.
They say video from inside his Neptune City home shows he pulled a small child in his care from a bed and slapped them multiple times across the face, and pushed either them or someone else against the bedroom wall, according to court documents in the case.
Fuscarino told a resource worker that “there was an episode of physical contact” between him and the child, according to the court records. He was charged with endangering the welfare of a child and assault.
Police say the crime happened on Nov. 9. Fuscarino was arrested on Nov. 21.
But it wasn’t until Dec. 16 that NJ Advance Media first reported on the charges. Garden State Equality issued a statement at about 4:30 p.m. that day saying, “When we learned about the charge against Mr. Fuscarino, we immediately placed him on leave.” About three hours later, after some of Fuscarino’s predecessors at Garden State Equality issued a statement saying he should be fired, Fuscarino said he had resigned.
Fuscarino will have his day in court to respond to the police’s charges. In the meantime, the Garden State Equality board must be more transparent about when it learned of the claims against him and why it decided a vacation instead of termination was the wisest route. I emailed a few to ask them to chat about this, but they did not respond.
At a time when President Trump is targeting trans people, New Jersey’s queer community needs a robust organization fighting for its rights, not one that’s busy trying to protect its boss.

Sticker shock: ACA customers confront premium spikes as Congress dithers

Nevada Health Link Executive Officer Janel Davis, in a statement provided to the Nevada Current by a public relations firm, said the exchange does not plan on releasing enrollment numbers until the open enrollment period ends on Jan. 15.
“This year looks different than previous years due to several significant changes, including the scheduled expiration of enhanced subsidies, the introduction of new carriers, and new plan options on the marketplace,” read the statement. “Because of these changes, we are seeing trends showing individuals are taking more time to carefully review their options before selecting a plan.”
In previous years, Nevada Health Link has announced in December the number of enrollments that took place in November, the first month of open enrollment.
For example, in December 2024, the exchange announced that more than 17,815 people had actively shopped and enrolled in plans during the first month of open enrollment for 2025 coverage. They boasted of a 10% increase in the number of new enrollees.
On Tuesday, Nevada Health Link announced only that “early activity indicates steady engagement from both new consumers and returning enrollees” and that “active enrollments remain steady from the same time last year.”
The Current has formally requested open enrollment numbers but has not yet received a response.
The cost of existing plans available through Nevada Health Link were approved by the state to rise by 26% for 2026 coverage. Similar increases are happening across the country.
Health care advocates have warned that many people will not be able to absorb the cost of skyrocketing premiums, which are happening as a result of the expiration of federal subsidies. As a result, many may opt to go without medical insurance.
That’s of particular concern for Nevada, which perennially had one of the nation’s highest uninsured rates prior to the passage of the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare.
A national poll conducted by the nonpartisan health organization KFF found that nearly 60% of enrollees surveyed could not cover the costs of a $300 annual increase in their premiums.
Health care navigators — people trained by Nevada Health Link to provide outreach and assistance to people enrolling or reenrolling — say they are seeing this play out in real time.
One health care navigator, who requested their name be withheld because they work with immigrant communities, told the Current that at least 1 in 5 of the clients they have met with during the current open enrollment period are opting to decline insurance altogether because of cost.
One of them is a 78-year-old man in the country under a green card. His plan is skyrocketing from $35 per month to more than $3,000 monthly. His family, who financially support him and worked for years to have him immigrate to the country legally, can’t absorb that big of a change.
Another client, a single mom who works numerous part-time jobs to support two young daughters, is facing an increase from $23 per month to $675 per month.
The navigator said other clients are remaining insured but switching to plans with lower premiums and high deductibles.
Nevada Health Link has previously said that 9 out of 10 enrollees receive a federal subsidy that brings down the cost of their premium. This year approximately 110,000 Nevadans got their health insurance through Health Link.
 
Open enrollment is currently underway and runs through Jan. 15, 2026.
Nevadans who enroll on or before Dec. 31 will have coverage beginning Jan. 1. For those who enroll between Jan. 1 and Jan. 15, coverage will begin Feb. 1.

The exchange has encouraged people to review their options through their website, speak to navigators, and “don’t assume that there are not affordable options just because the average plan price is increasing.”
“Enrollees who have shopped and changed plans during this Open Enrollment Period have saved an average of $287 per month on premiums,” read the press releases from the exchange Tuesday.
Pennie, Pennsylvania’s state-based ACA marketplace, has reported a 16% decrease in new enrollees so far this year compared with last year. For every one new enrollee, 1.5 existing enrollees have terminated coverage, with the majority of those terminations coming from people with incomes in the 150% to 200% of federal poverty level.
That equates to an income between $48,225 and $64,300 for a family with two adults and two children.
Covered California, another state-based exchange, is reporting a 28% decrease in new sign ups as of Dec. 13.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/NVHealthLink-1024x570.jpeg,,,2025-12-19 10:57:52.513971

Horman, an Idaho Falls Republican serving her seventh term in the Idaho Legislature, plans to make her resignation effective Jan. 5 – one week before the 2026 legislative session begins on Jan. 12. 
Horman’s resignation means Republican leaders in the Idaho House of Representatives will appoint a new budget co-chair just as the state is navigating projected budget shortfalls for 2026 and 2027 and bracing for additional new budget cuts to avoid a projected budget deficit.
Idaho budget writers prepare to enter new era of trimming state budgets

“I fully expect the new House appropriations chairman to carry on the process changes that Sen. (Scott) Grow (R-Eagle) and I have made in the last three years,” Horman said in a phone interview. “We have heard from third parties and from members of the public that they appreciate the distinction between maintenance and growth spending, especially at times like this where we have volatility.”
In an interview, Horman said she will leave the Idaho Legislature to become director of the Office of Child Care at the Administration for Children and Families. The administration is a division of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services under Assistant Secretary for Family Support Alex Adams, who is a former budget administrator and Idaho Department of Health and Welfare director. 
“I am really excited about the opportunity,” Horman said. “It is a chance to continue the important work I feel like I’ve done for children in the state of Idaho and just continue that work at the national level, and bring a focus on children and families into child care – not bureaucracy and government.”
Horman said she expects to begin her new job near the end of January.
First elected to the Legislature in November 2012, Horman has served as co-chair of the powerful Joint Finance-Appropriations Committee since just before the 2023 legislative session began. 
The Joint Finance-Appropriations Committee, or JFAC for short, is perhaps the most powerful committee in the entire Idaho Legislature and is responsible for setting all of the budgets for every state agency and department every year.
Prior to being elected to the Idaho Legislature in 2012, Horman served as a local school board member in the Idaho Falls area for the Bonneville Joint School District. 
“Serving in the Idaho Legislature has been the privilege of a lifetime,” Horman wrote in a written statement Friday. “As I transition to this new role in the Trump administration, I will carry with me the values and lessons learned from serving the people of Idaho.”
 Idaho House’s top budget writer leaving as state budget projects a deficit

Horman leaves the Legislature at a time when the state budget her committee set is projected to post a budget deficit in the current fiscal year 2026 and future years.
Budget documents project the state will end the current fiscal year 2026 with a budget deficit of $40 million, the Idaho Capital Sun previously reported.

However the deficit is projected to increase by 10 times or more in the next year, according to state budget documents and officials. 
The Idaho Legislative Services Office presented JFAC with a budget projection last month that showed the state budget is projected to end fiscal year 2027 with an estimated deficit of $555.2 million, the Sun previously reported. However, the state may actually need to come up with $600 million to $1 billion for fiscal year 2027. That’s if the Legislature chooses to conform with the tax changes from the federal One Big Beautiful Bill Act that President Donald Trump signed into law this summer and also wants to leave a positive ending cash balance, Idaho Division of Financial Management Administrator Lori Wolff told the Sun last month.
Idaho’s projected budget deficit estimated at $40 million heading into 2026 legislative session

The Idaho Constitution requires the state to pass a balanced state budget every year and prohibits the state from running a budget deficit where expenses exceed revenues. 
Horman and Gov. Brad Little’s staff have vowed that state officials will intervene and prevent the state budget from ending the fiscal year in a deficit. 
“We will set a balanced budget,” Horman told the Sun in an interview last month. “The constitution requires it. I am personally committed to it. And I anticipate we will leave as large of a cash balance as we can to carry over into next year to guard against unforeseen circumstances.”
News of a projected budget deficit is a big change for Idaho. Following an influx of COVID-era federal stimulus money, Idaho ended fiscal year 2022 with a record budget surplus estimated at $2 billion, the Sun reported. 
Idaho is experiencing revenue shortfalls and state budget holdbacks after passing major tax cuts over the past five years that reduced the amount of revenue available for the state budget. The nonprofit, nonpartisan Idaho Center for Fiscal Policy released a report in November showing that income tax cuts passed by the Idaho Legislature since 2021 have reduced state revenue by a cumulative total of $4 billion. 
On Friday, Horman said education was her top priority while serving in the Idaho Legislature.
“I first ran for office because I want every child to have the opportunity for an excellent education, no matter where they are learning,” Horman wrote in an email to the Idaho Capital Sun. “During my 11 years on the Joint Finance-Appropriations Committee, funding for public schools has more than doubled. I have successfully championed massive investments in teacher compensation, health insurance, staff salaries, literacy, and technology funding.”
Horman said she is proud of the changes she helped bring to JFAC.
“Finally, I am proud of the work Sen. Grow and I accomplished in modernizing the budget process to prioritize transparency and accountability,” Horman wrote Friday. “This work is critical to limiting the size of government and utilizing the people’s money in efficient and effective ways, with a focus on return on investment for Idaho taxpayers.”
 Horman’s resignation creates vacancy in Idaho Legislature and at head of budget committee

In addition to creating a vacancy in the Idaho Legislature, Horman’s resignation creates a vacancy atop the budget committee just a week before the 2026 legislative session begins Jan. 12.
To fill the vacancy in the Idaho Legislature, the Republican legislative committee from Horman’s Legislative District 32 in Bonneville County will provide Little with a list of three possible nominees to succeed Horman. Little will then appoint someone to serve out the remainder of Horman’s term in the Idaho Legislature, which expires at the end of 2026. 
Like all 105 seats in the Idaho Legislature, Horman’s former legislative seat will be up for election in 2026.  
House leadership – most likely House Speaker Mike Moyle, R-Star – also must fill the vacant co-chair position on JFAC that Horman’s resignation creates. Possible candidates include JFAC Vice Chairman Steven Miller, R-Fairfield, and Rep. Josh Tanner, an Eagle Republican who is an ally of Moyle’s and serves as assistant majority leader in the Idaho House. 
Moyle will likely be able to appoint whoever he wants from the Idaho House to lead JFAC. The appointment of committee chairs and committee members typically happens behind closed doors during the organizational session following an election year, so not much is publicly known or seen about the process. 
 Hormans’s new role at Health and Human Services

In Washington, D.C., at her new role, Horman will be working for Adams, the assistant secretary for family support. Horman and Adams got to know each other in Idaho when Adams served as the administrator for the Idaho Division of Financial Management and the two worked on setting the state’s budget.
Adams most recently served as the director of the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare from June 2024, until he was appointed to his new position in Washington, D.C.

Photo by Cortez Rohr/USFWSA federal judge has said the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service may reconsider its decision to allow cattle grazing at Red Rock Lakes National Wildlife Refuge in southwestern Montana after the agency said it would reexamine assumptions it made more than 30 years ago to allow commercial grazing.
Federal District Court Judge Donald Molloy denied WildEarth Guardians and Western Watersheds Project’s motion to vacate — or completely stop — the grazing permits, saying the agency has made a good-faith effort to reconsider its plans, especially since the originally analysis done in 1994 was based on the idea that USFWS staff would monitor the effects of grazing at the refuge, something the agency admitted hasn’t ever happened because of inadequate staffing.
Meanwhile, the two conservation organizations argued continuing to allow grazing could be doing environmental damage, especially since there was no oversight.
The Red Rock Lakes Refuge is the largest wetland system in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem and includes habitat for trumpeter swans, sage grouse, Arctic grayling and grizzly bears. However, cattle grazing has taken place intermittently since 1876, but was stopped for a period because of overgrazing.
In 2009, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service affirmed that commercial livestock grazing was a compatible use for the refuge, but the “key issue” was whether there was adequate monitoring of the grazing programs, something the service admits it has never had enough staff to properly carry out.
That was, in part, why the groups challenged the cattle grazing permits, and the agency’s decision to continue it. And, it was why they urged the court to set aside the decision to allow grazing.
However, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service also asked Molloy to allow it to voluntarily re-examine the decision, including a promise to consider the grazing program, understanding that the federal agency will likely not have staff to monitor the grazing. In court documents, the agency then said after it evaluates grazing under that criteria, it will determine whether grazing is still compatible.
“(The service) has never been able to fully implement (the grazing plan) as a result of staffing resources and shortages,” the court record said. “These shortages, the service said, ‘have prevented its ability to monitor the impact of grazing on vegetation, wildlife, or nutrient level to the degree anticipated by (the plan).
“Thus, on remand, the service will review the plan as actually administered since 1994 in consideration of the funding and staffing resource limitations.”
Indeed, earlier this week, the Oregon Capital Chronicle reported that since President Donald J. Trump took office in January, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has seen a 20% reduction in staff.
Service Regional Director Matthew Hogan said it will implement a new improved grazing monitoring protocol at Red Rock Lakes, and gather data points from around the refuge. He told the court that it would prepare and share the data publicly.
From there, the service also committed to performing a new environmental analysis, as required under the National Environmental Policy Act, and a new compatibility determination.
“Essentially, the service seeks remand to implement new techniques and obtain new data that will allow it to address ‘potential deficiencies with the challenged decision,’” Molloy wrote.
The conservation groups also raised concerns that the USFWS was acting in bad faith, pledging work while allowing more degradation from grazing. However, Molloy rejected that argument.
“The service has provided a multi-part process that consists of new data collection and analyses that it plans to implement upon remand, which will culminate in a new environmental assessment and compatibility determination, and which may result in the termination or modification of the permits. Such a process demonstrates that the outcome is not predetermined.”
Even though the conservation groups contend that cattle grazing continues to degrade the refuge, they cheered the decision because they said it forced the federal agency to admit that it hasn’t followed its own plans for decades.
“It’s unfortunate that it took a lawsuit from conservation organizations to get the service to acknowledge that it’s been derelict in its duty,” said Chris Krupp, public lands attorney with WildEarth Guardians. “Now, the service must honor its commitment to the court to reevaluate whether cattle belong on this wildlife refuge and remove them if they don’t.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/usfws-golden-hour-moose-extra-large-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-12-19 10:57:52.513971

Bring it on, says Senate chair",Chris Lisinski and Jennifer Smith,,,,,https://commonwealthbeacon.org/transportation/talk-of-new-transportation-dollars-bring-it-on-says-senate-chair/,"Brendan Crighton, the Senate's point person on transportation issues, wants his colleagues to have hard conversations about new transportation-related levies even if the topic might be politically fraught.","MOST POWER PLAYERS are skittish about the idea of new taxes or tolls to fund transportation investments, but not the Senate’s point person on the issue, who is not shy about his willingness to turn over every rock.
“Obviously, you get criticized for talking about revenues at any point,” said Sen. Brendan Crighton, adding that there are no imminent plans for legislative action on new transportation levies. “But if we don’t have the conversation, we’re never gonna get to a consensus on what the best approach is.”
During an interview on last week’s episode of The Horse Race podcast, Crighton spoke openly about his interest in at least exploring or weighing almost anything to produce more money for transportation systems.
That bluntness stands in contrast to many others on and around Beacon Hill.
A task force Gov. Maura Healey convened to produce a deep dive into the entire transportation funding issue concluded the best approach is a tax stream that voters approved, and legislative leaders do not seem eager to kick off the next bruising debate about how to pay for roads, bridges, and the MBTA.
Almost every system for moving people around the Bay State remains a source of headaches for commuters and lawmakers alike.
The long-term funding plan for maintaining the T is still an open question, congestion in Greater Boston is worsening, regional transit agencies are jockeying for more financial support, and the fate of federal funding for critical infrastructure for bridges and roads is causing budgeting agita.
“Crisis is a hard word to define, but I think we have serious challenges ahead of us,” Crighton said. “I don’t know if there’s such a thing as a stable crisis. I feel like we have a ton more work to do, but we’re at least keeping our head above water.”
The Lynn Democrat ascended to the top Senate position on the Transportation Committee in 2021, following in the footsteps of his longtime boss, former senator Tom McGee (who is now chair of the MBTA board of directors).
Crighton arrived at a pivotal moment. A year later, the Federal Transit Administration flagged a series of major safety issues at the T and ordered immediate, pricey fixes to protect passengers and employees.
Crighton remembers it as a period of “real, acute crisis, with tragic deaths and injuries at stations. We had train cars on fire. We had safety disasters all over the place.” As a result, he said, the Legislature’s transportation committee that usually focuses on funding and policy took on “more of an oversight role.”
The MBTA has improved significantly since that nadir, especially under the tenure of general manager — and now interim transportation secretary — Phil Eng. But bigger questions are still unanswered, such as how to tackle the next inevitable funding gap and the enormous costs of fixing outdated infrastructure, last estimated at nearly $24 billion.
Crighton said dealing with those issues will take “rolling up our sleeves” and “making up for the sins of the past in many ways.”
“When it comes to public transit, Massachusetts isn’t Massachusetts and Boston isn’t Boston without this system,” Crighton said. “We have no alternative.”
Don’t mistake that for eagerness across the Legislature to take a massive swing, though.
For now, lawmakers seem content with what they’ve done so far, including a maneuver to funnel more than half a billion dollars in surtax revenue through an account known as the Commonwealth Transportation Fund, thereby unlocking more borrowing capacity for projects.
Asked if his colleagues are in the mood for a bigger move, Crighton said he’s unsure given the “challenging and uncertain times” posed by macroeconomic trends and a federal government eager to slash funding to states.
“I don’t know if at this moment there’s the will to pass some modernization of our transportation finance system,” he said. “It inevitably needs to happen. I don’t think anyone says it doesn’t.”
Healey convened a task force of experts from across different industries and asked them to ponder large-scale transportation finance questions. Their final report published in January eschewed any new taxes and instead called for more strategic use of surtax dollars, including the aforementioned maneuver to boost bonding.
Crighton did not take any issue with that approach to get the system stabilized, but cautioned that the voter-approved surtax “was never meant to be a silver bullet for transportation.”
“I’m all for every reform we can get — and everyone says ‘reform before revenue’ — but I think we’ve shortchanged the system for so long,” he said, citing both the T and the regional transit authorities outside the Boston area.
With that, Crighton reprised a degree of skepticism toward a phrase that became politically supercharged during his tenure as an aide to McGee more than a decade and a half ago.
In 2009, in the midst of debate over a proposed gas tax increase, then-Transportation Secretary Jim Aloisi dismissed the “reform before revenue” phrase, backed by then-Senate President Therese Murray, as a “meaningless slogan.” Aloisi, who is a regular contributor to CommonWealth Beacon, left the Patrick administration later that year.
Crighton also summoned the specter of another revenue-raising strategy that has long put many motorists on edge: congestion pricing, or charging drivers higher prices on crowded roadways at peak hours.
New York City launched a congestion pricing system at the start of the year, but despite years of debate about simply studying the idea in Boston, the Bay State appears far from embracing it.
Crighton pondered why Massachusetts would take that idea “arbitrarily off the table,” given that it’s produced “results across the world,” including in New York.
“Congestion pricing, I think, too often is looked at like Beetlejuice — like you say it three times, and all of a sudden, congestion pricing is here on our roads in Massachusetts,” he said, referencing the 1988 Tim Burton film in which the repeated invocation of the titular character’s name summons him.
Crighton is also prodding for more of a conversation about tolls, which are currently imposed only on the Massachusetts Turnpike that bisects the state from east to west and several Boston-area bridges and tunnels.
In his North Shore district, “whether you’re taking the bridge or the tunnel, you’re paying every time,” he said, referencing tolls that hit drivers using the Tobin Bridge, Sumner and Callahan Tunnels, and Ted Williams Tunnel.
Senate President Karen Spilka, who represents several MetroWest communities that make heavy use of the Massachusetts Turnpike, has long pitched expanded tolls as a matter of regional equity.
But the idea has also proven to be a political third rail. Former transportation secretary Monica Tibbits-Nutt set off a firestorm — and drew a prompt rebuke from her boss, the governor — when she said she was considering tolls along the state’s borders. Crighton says he understands cross-state tolls are sensitive for border communities, but the question of retooling tolls should be up for debate like other potential revenue streams.
Crighton dismissed the idea of an increase in the state gas tax, which he warned has “run its course” as vehicles become more fuel-efficient or electric.
Apart from that, he said, “Everything should be on the table.”",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/12-03_transit_worker_bill_signing_7-scaled.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-12-19 10:57:52.513971

(Photo via LePage campaign)President Donald Trump on Thursday threw his support behind former Maine Gov. Paul LePage, who is running for the Republican nomination to replace outgoing U.S. Rep. Jared Golden.
“A proven America First Fighter, Paul has been with us from the very beginning, helping us, MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!” Trump wrote on his TruthSocial account. 
He added, “Paul LePage is a WINNER, and has my Complete and Total Endorsement — HE WILL NOT LET YOU DOWN!”
Since Golden announced he would not seek re-election, the seat has been considered a key opportunity for Republicans to gain more seats in the U.S. House of Representatives. Golden, a moderate Democrat, has held the seat since 2018, despite 2nd Congressional District voters also backing Trump in each of his three presidential bids.
LePage was elected governor of Maine in a three-way race in 2011 and served until 2019 when he termed out. He attempted a comeback during Gov. Janet Mills’ tenure, but lost to the Democratic governor in 2022. 
LePage, who will face at least one challenger in the June Republican primary, shared the endorsement on his official campaign Facebook page and said he looks forward “to working with President Trump in growing our economy, increasing jobs and wages, fighting high prices and protecting our citizens from crime with the removal of criminal legal aliens.”
LePage — who in 2016 had described himself as “Trump before Trump” — has boasted about his record of lowering taxes and cutting regulations while chief executive. In 2018, he was sued for refusing to implement voter-approved Medicaid expansion. He has also been called out for racist remarks and left a voicemail laden with obscenities for a state lawmaker who criticized him.
While there are several Democrats currently vying for the seat — including Jordan Wood, who pivoted his campaign from the U.S. Senate race after Golden dropped out — Trump wrote in his post that LePage will likely face “Radical Left Democrat” Matt Dunlap.
Dunlap, who is currently Maine’s state auditor, had a previous run-in with the president while serving as secretary of state during Trump’s first term. Appointed to the president’s voter fraud commission, Dunlap made national headlines after he sued the commission for lack of transparency and accused it of being fabricated to validate Trump’s claims of voter misconduct.",https://mainemorningstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-19-at-9.44.28 AM-1024x756.png,,,2025-12-19 09:56:38.398629

(Kansas Reflector screen capture of Legislature's YouTube channel)TOPEKA — President Donald Trump took the first step Thursday to reclassify marijuana, but the move won’t affect Kansans unless the state changes its laws, a law enforcement professional said. 
Trump signed an executive order to drop marijuana from a Schedule I drug under the Controlled Substances Act to a Schedule III drug. 
In 2023, the Department of Health and Human Services recommended the change, indicating marijuana has medical use.
“Schedule I drugs are defined as drugs with no currently accepted medical use, a high potential for abuse, and a lack of accepted safety for use of the drug under medical supervision,” the order said. “Schedule III drugs are classified as having a potential for abuse less than the drugs or other substances in Schedules I and II, a currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United States, and a potential for moderate or low physical dependence or high psychological dependence in the event of drug abuse.”
The change doesn’t take immediate effect on the federal level, but it will not affect Kansans unless laws are changed, said Ed Klumpp, a retired Topeka police chief and a lobbyist for the Kansas Peace Officers Association.
“Under state law, it’s still under Schedule I,” he said. “If this happens and it sticks, then there would need to be some kind of bill run to move it from Schedule I to Schedule III on the state schedule, and then it’s still a controlled substance.”
If marijuana moves to become a Schedule III drug, it could be prescribed through pharmacies for medicinal use, Klumpp said. 
The Kansas Bureau of Investigation urged Kansans to remember that marijuana is still illegal and that rescheduling it is “not the same as legalization.” 
“Marijuana products sold today are highly potent and pose a direct threat to public health,” the news release said. “Rescheduling will allow qualified scientists to conduct reliable research on the long-term impact on the human brain of the use of high-concentration THC products. We believe this will conclusively prove the connection between marijuana use and mental health disorders, especially in children and teens.”
U.S. Sen. Roger Marshall, R-Kansas, was one of 24 Republicans who signed a letter asking Trump not to change marijuana’s classification.  
“Rescheduling marijuana to a Schedule III drug will undermine your strong efforts to Make America Great Again and to usher in America’s next economic Golden Age,” the letter said. “The only winners from rescheduling will be bad actors such as Communist China, while Americans will be left paying the bill.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Ed-Klumpp-1024x519.png,,,2025-12-19 09:56:38.398629

Advocates and lawmakers say the number is “devastating” and “preventable,” and are calling for the reinstatement of an independent oversight body to investigate.	
 Deaths reported by DOC in 2025:
Pedro George Rubke, 78
Reginald Eugene Childers, Jr., 42
Nathaniel David Leask, 49
Marcias Zoritas Reinhold, 83
Lena Lola Lynn, 63
Alvin Lynn Archa Jr., 62
Carl K Thompson, 68

Kurt Charles Malutin, 37
Barry John McCormack, 74
Donald Scott Hotch Sr., 78
Keith Landers, 93
Aaron Scott Merritt, 45
Kane William Huff, 46 


The count now brings the total in-custody deaths reported by DOC since 2020 to 84, an increasing number in recent years with at least 15 deaths reported in 2024 and 10 deaths in 2023. 
“It’s devastating, it’s preventable, and it’s unacceptable that there haven’t been any changes made to reduce deaths in custody,” said Megan Edge, director of integrated justice with the ACLU of Alaska in an interview. 
DOC officials, through a spokesperson, declined to comment on the number of the deaths. 
The ACLU is calling for the reinstatement of an independent oversight body to investigate the circumstances of in-custody deaths and reduce risks, Edge said. 
The state created a special internal investigative unit in DOC in 2016, following a 2015 report that widespread failures and dysfunction within the system led to at least six in-custody deaths. But the unit was dissolved in 2018 during budget cuts under the Dunleavy administration. 
Betsy Holley, a spokesperson for DOC, declined an interview but said by email Wednesday that the agency has no plans to resurrect that unit. 
“The unit was eliminated, reducing duplicative functions, reducing costs and moving to a more transparent investigative process,” she said.
The Alaska State Troopers, with the Alaska Department of Public Safety, investigate death incidents, not DOC, she said. “DPS is the investigative agency assigned to review incidents and because they are not affiliated with DOC, investigations are conducted independently, ensuring neutrality and objectivity,” Holley said.
Rep. Andrew Gray, D-Anchorage, and co-chair of the House Judiciary Committee, said he will look into the process of creating such a system in the next legislative session. He said it should be external and independent from DOC. “There’s just no doubt that the way we currently have it, which is that there’s not really any organized official oversight happening, it’s just unacceptable,” he said.
Gray said he would like to see an independent unit created to investigate DOC deaths, so that details and reports can be verified, and best practices are in use. 
“We can’t verify that they are following the correct protocols, that there are ways of reporting warning signs, or assessing folks who are at risk. We have no way of knowing,” he said. “And when we have a death toll that’s high, we have a right to question if there are mistakes being made, and we are questioning whether mistakes have been made.”
The ACLU is also calling for changes in Alaska law to allow more people who are elderly and with terminal illnesses to be released on medical and geriatric parole, which Gray said his office would be pursuing in the next legislative session starting in January. 
At least 18 reported deaths by DOC in 2025, one more by the ACLU
Most recently, DOC reported the death of Kane Huff, 46, on Dec. 15 in Goose Creek Correctional Center, bringing the state’s total in-custody deaths for this year to 18 people. 
DOC releases limited information on the causes and circumstances around in-custody deaths. But the department included a note when it announced eight of this year’s deaths — nearly half of them, including Kane’s — saying in the case of an “expected death” the Alaska State Troopers and State Medical Examiner’s office are notified. That office determines the cause of death. 
Alaska’s prison population is aging, with an estimated 21% being 55 and older, according to DOC data. DOC officials testified to the Alaska State Legislature earlier this year that more in custody deaths were due to “natural causes,” including acute and chronic disease and illness — or 68% of deaths since 2016. 
Over half of this year’s in-custody deaths, or ten people, were over the age of 60. The oldest was Keith Landers, at 94 years old, who died on Nov. 24, and the youngest was Christopher Ligons, 30 years old who died on June 28. 
At least four of the deaths have been ruled suicides, according to Alaska State Troopers, news reports and investigation by the ACLU of Alaska. One was Aaron Merritt, who died on Nov. 26 and was a Kenai church member, as reported by KDLL Public Radio.
Seven people died this year while under arrest and awaiting trial – one person in custody for less than a day – and two people were convicted and awaiting sentencing. 
At least two in-custody deaths followed violent altercations. Jeffrey Foreman, 53, died on Jul. 11 after being restrained by correctional officers after a fight with a cellmate in the Anchorage Correctional Complex, according to Alaska Public Media.
Not on the DOC list this year is William Farmer, 36, who died in an Anchorage hospital on Jan. 6, after an assault by a cellmate in the Anchorage Correctional Complex. The case involved mental health issues and DOC failed to release the cellmate who was found incompetent to stand trial. Both families have questioned why the two men were placed in the same cell, according to reporting by the Anchorage Daily News. 
DOC has said the case was not reported as an in-custody death because Farmer was released on bail after he was hospitalized. The ACLU has criticized DOC for a pattern of releasing inmates who are hospitalized or dying. 
DOC attributes more deaths to natural causes
DOC medical and correctional officials testified to the Legislature earlier this year that more in-custody deaths were due to natural causes, like chronic disease and illness, whereas in previous years more deaths were attributed to drug overdoses. 
Alaska’s Chief Medical Officer, Dr. Robert Lawrence, who previously served as the chief medical officer for DOC from 2013 to 2024, said in an interview last year that the state’s inmate population has higher needs for care than the state’s population as a whole.
“Prisons are not just warehouses where we put people. These are neighborhoods within the larger community. And one of the things that we recognize about this unique neighborhood that is a correctional institution is that it tends to have a concentrating effect, meaning that any of the issues that we’re dealing with in the community get concentrated within this prison environment,” he said.
ACLU’s Edge said the increasing physical and mental health care needs of inmates is well known, and DOC should be doing more to provide adequate care. 
“It’s not new and is not unique. People in prison are some of the often sickest people in our society and in Alaska especially, because we have such limited resources for physical and mental health care and substance use treatment,” Edge said. “Often the response in our communities is to incarcerate people. If people are homeless, they are taken to jail. People with mental illness are often put in jail. People experiencing substance use disorder are put in jail.”
She pointed to the state of Alaska’s legal obligation to provide people with health care while they’re in custody, including access to mental health care resources and treatment. 
“We hear stories from people who are experiencing suicidal ideation and thrown into solitary confinement, stripped of their clothing and placed in a suicide smock till they say they feel better,” she said. “That’s not mental health care.” 
On average, 4,500 people are incarcerated in Alaska’s jails and prisons each year, either awaiting trial or sentencing, or serving criminal sentences. That average population has been steady over the last decade. Edge pointed out that the death rate is growing, while the overall population is not. 
“Our death numbers continue to rise and stay disproportionately high for the amount of people that we actually have incarcerated,” she said.
Deaths prompt legal action
The ACLU filed a federal class-action lawsuit in May challenging DOC’s health care system as inadequate and inhumane, which includes an investigation and documentation of a variety of cases where inmates’ failed to be treated, resulting in deteriorating health conditions.

The civil rights group is also part of two wrongful death lawsuits, one for Lewis Jordan Jr. who suffered an untreated ear infection while incarcerated at Goose Creek Correctional Center in 2023 that developed into fatal meningitis. 
The lawsuit claims “deliberate indifference” from DOC, and that Jordan’s death was preventable. The families of James Rider and Mark Cook Jr., who died in pretrial custody in 2022 and 2023, have also filed lawsuits seeking restitution and damages. 
Expanding opportunities for medical and geriatric parole
For the elderly and those with severe or terminal illnesses, Gray said he would like to see Alaska move toward a compassionate release program, which would also be a cost saving measure for the state. 
“I think people kind of know this intuitively. Folks in their sixties and seventies need to see the doctor more than folks in their twenties and thirties, and so if we’re incarcerating a large population of folks who are older, they’re going to require a lot more health care, and that health care is more expensive,” Gray said.
The cost to the state for incarceration is estimated to be $202 per person per day in Alaska, compared to an estimated $13 per day on parole. 
“It is extraordinarily expensive. We cannot afford to be running basically nursing homes in our prisons,” Gray said. “We have a mechanism in Alaska for those folks who are very, very, very unlikely to be able to commit any more crimes, let’s get them out of our system. Let’s get them back to their families.”
Alaska has a special medical and geriatric parole to release those who are elderly and with a terminal illness, and have been found to no longer pose a risk to the public.
But that system is not currently being used – the Alaska Parole Board has not granted anyone medical or geriatric release in the last five years, since 2020. 
Edge said due to restrictions in the current law for those convicted of unclassified felonies – like first-degree murder and sexual assault – people may not be eligible for parole. It would require the legislature to take action to change the law. 
“So it’s really inaccessible for the people that actually need it,” Edge said. “I’m thinking of one person in particular who was wheelchair bound, blind and in his eighties. And his family, his children, had a plan to take care of him, and he could not get out. He was denied discretionary parole, and was ineligible for geriatric and special medical parole because he was convicted of an unclassified felony.”

Gov. Gavin Newsom introduced CARE Court in 2022 in part as a way to bring people with serious mental illnesses off of California’s streets. But data from the state and counties, as well as interviews with service providers, CARE Court participants and their family members, highlight the ways in which the program is struggling to help homeless Californians. 
More than two years after CARE Court first launched, most people entering the program aren’t homeless, and those who are homeless aren’t always getting what they need most: housing.
Jennifer Farrell had high hopes when she filed a CARE Court petition in Alameda County on behalf of her brother, who struggles with schizophrenia and meth use. But despite the program’s efforts, he ended up back on the street, and then in the hospital. 

Farrell: “We’re coming up on a year (since he enrolled in CARE Court). And we are nowhere … we’re probably in the same place we were when I filed. And maybe even worse off.”

To assess how CARE Court helps homeless Californians, CalMatters requested information from California’s 25 largest counties, as well as all of the ones that first launched the program. Of the 2,362 CARE Court petitions filed in the 21 counties that provided data, fewer than a third were for people who were homeless. 
When asked how many people were housed through CARE Court, even the most successful counties reported just a few dozen.

Is home ownership overrated?

Buying a home has long been seen in America as a marker of adulthood and a surefire way to secure intergenerational wealth. But with California home prices being as high as they are, is home ownership the smartest financial move?
As CalMatters’ Ben Christopher explains, though it depends largely on every individual’s personal finances, the gap between the benefits of owning and renting in California isn’t as wide as it used to be.
The median price of a detached single-family home in California is over $852,000, with some regions reaching over $1 million. That translates to as much as $6,000 a month, which far exceeds the monthly rent for a typical apartment. 
Many Californians are renting not out of choice but because they can’t afford a house. But certain conditions characteristic to the state — high housing insurance costs and strong tenant protections for renters, for example — lend evidence to the argument that renting may be a sounder financial choice than it was in years past.

Daryl Fairweather, Redfin economist: “More people are starting to be interested in renting and saving at the same time, because they’ve been priced out of owning a home, but they still want to achieve their financial goals and they’re looking into those alternatives and getting more savvy about it.”

Minimum wage will rise in 2026

Starting Jan. 1, minimum-wage workers in California will see their hourly pay increase to $16.90 — an increase of 40 cents an hour. The pay bump is part of an annual minimum wage review as required by state law, writes CalMatters’ Cayla Mihalovich.
Some California workers will see a bit more than that, however. Cities and counties can set their own minimum wages, and West Hollywood will have the highest minimum wage of any California city at $20.25 starting in January. Health care workers who successfully pushed for legislation in 2023 to boost their pay are also on track to make $25 an hour by 2027.
In May labor organizers for Los Angeles hotel and airport employees secured an hourly city minimum wage increase to $30 by 2028, the year the city will host the Olympics. But the move continues to face strong opposition from large employers and businesses. L.A.’s city council president this month proposed delaying the wage increase until 2030.

Millions of people are expected to lose Medicaid coverage due to federal cuts and new policies from President Donald Trump’s sweeping budget bill. 
In the face of this potentiality, a group of health foundations has formed the Future of Medi-Cal Commission to protect health care for 14 million low-income Californians. Read more from CalMatters’ Ana B. Ibarra, who spoke with Dr. Mark Ghaly, a co-chairperson of the commission and former California Health and Human Services Agency Secretary.






California Voices
CalMatters columnist Dan Walters: There are so many Democrats running for California governor in 2026 that it’s theoretically possible, although very slim, for a Republican to win the office.
Policymakers should focus on securing state-level funding to help launch more PACE programs, which provide medical and social services that enable older Californians to safely age in their own homes, writes Dr. Janice Grandi, a primary care physician working in geriatrics.

Last year, Massachusetts’s FAIR Plan saw its first single-year increase in home insurance policies issued since 2017, CommonWealth Beacon reported, and its largest single-year jump in two decades. 
There were more than 173,000 properties insured by the FAIR Plan in 2024 — which is still shy of the 2007 peak, but well above the 158,660 enrollees just a year prior in 2023.  
Insurance officials and experts emphasized that it’s not yet a moment of flashing red lights over one year of data, but the spike is capturing the attention of the industry as a sign of the increasingly extreme weather that makes more properties more risky and inflation that can drive up rebuilding costs. 
What is the FAIR Plan? 
In the 1960s, states started to establish Fair Access to Insurance Requirements (FAIR) Plans in their jurisdictions with support from the federal government to provide a backstop in urban areas hit hard by riots and deemed too risky to be insured by private companies. These plans, known as insurers of last resort, offered consumers another option while providing private insurers with federal riot reinsurance. 
Today, nearly three dozen states and Washington, DC, have a FAIR Plan. Each state’s plan has their own regulations governing what kind and amount of coverage it can provide.  
Over time, these plans have become particularly essential in providing coverage to parts of the country prone to natural disasters, where the potential for massive damages like roofs ripped off by high winds or homes completely flooded is higher. This shift has been stark in some states like California, which experienced a doubling in its FAIR Plan both in policies and the value of properties it insures between 2023 and 2025 as private insurers fled the state following devastating wildfires. 
Massachusetts established its FAIR Plan in 1968. The plan grew from around 70,000 policyholders in 2000 to peaking at roughly 204,000 in 2007 and stabilizing between 150,000 and 200,000 over the last two decades. The plan caps coverage at $1 million per home, which can serve as an effective tool at blunting its potential exposures. 
How Massachusetts got here 
The increased FAIR Plan policies and rising home insurance prices in the private market across New England both reflect and tell the climate story, since insurers are the arbiters of risk. 
Massachusetts homeowners who have been unable to purchase coverage in the private market can obtain coverage through the FAIR Plan. The New York Times reported last December that the Bay State has the fifth highest nonrenewal rate in the country behind states like Florida, which routinely see billions of dollars in damage from hurricanes. That nonrenewal rate is driven by areas most vulnerable to severe storms: In Barnstable County, 1 in 16 policies weren’t renewed in 2023. In Dukes County, was 1 in 9.   
The trends in Massachusetts haven’t been nearly as catastrophic as in other states, but signs of change are emerging. The 2024 FAIR Plan surge is at least in part driven by high nonrenewal rates by private insurers in the state in 2023, which drove homeowners to seek out other insurance options.  
Statewide, there were 3,483 policy nonrenewals in 2022, 1,300 of which were in coastal areas, according to a report released by Insurance Commissioner Michael Caljouw in November. The very next year, that number jumped to 9,248, including a more than tripling of nonrenewals in coastal areas. By 2024, total nonrenewals grew again to more than 13,000.   
The report also found that 14 out of the top 25 insurance companies in the state implemented measures over the past five years “that were intended to reduce their exposure to climate-related risks,” including by reducing coverage in areas near the coast.  
And about 4 in 10 homes on Cape Cod and the islands are now insured through the FAIR Plan — up from 33 percent in 2023. That represents the highest rate for the region since 2017. The coastal Bristol and Plymouth counties, together with the Cape and islands, accounted for about 51 percent of all FAIR Plan policies in 2020. Now, those regions have about 55 percent of all FAIR Plan enrollees after modest upticks in each of the past five years.   
Aside from the nonrenewals, higher private home insurance prices driven by climate risk and increased rebuilding costs due to inflation and tariffs could have made the FAIR Plan look more financially attractive to homeowners.  
The financial impacts 
But the increase in FAIR Plan policies — and the plan’s increasing exposure to vulnerable seaside properties — could have serious consequences because the impact of a major coastal storm would disproportionately deliver significant losses to one insurer, especially if these trends continue.  
The FAIR Plan has the ability to levy an assessment against private insurers when massive losses stack up. An assessment, which needs approval from the state insurance division, would force private insurance companies in the state to pay the FAIR Plan money to meet its claims and continue providing coverage — an expense private insurers could pass on to their customers.  
Frank O’Brien, the plan’s general counsel, said it’s unlikely at this time that the FAIR Plan would need to issue an assessment to pay claims should damages pile up following such a severe storm.  
“However, we’re weather-dependent. That’s the business of insurance,” he said. “You hope for the best, you plan for the worst, and at the end of the day, we’re taking on a risk that people can’t take on by themselves, so you just try to be prepared.”",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_0414-scaled.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-12-19 08:59:29.039645

‘What does the future look like?’: As California braces for Medicaid cuts, former health secretary to lead new commission in creating plan to protect care


As states figure out how to adjust to federal funding cuts, policy shifts, and major Medicaid shakeups, 2026 will be pivotal for California health officials and lawmakers. 
Many Californians on Medicaid, better known here as Medi-Cal, already struggle to access timely and quality care. Now, experts warn that millions more could lose coverage under H.R.1, which makes sweeping changes to the country’s safety net programs.
Anticipating the fallout, a group of health foundations has formed the Future of Medi-Cal Commission. Its charge: creating a 10-year blueprint for a program that covers more than 14 million low-income residents and pays for key services from childbirth to nursing home care.
The commission’s co-chairs are Gov. Gavin Newsom’s former chief of staff Ann O’Leary and his former Health and Human Services Secretary Dr. Mark Ghaly, who led the state’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
The 29-member commission will begin meetings in January and will deliver recommendations in early 2027.
Ghaly spoke to CalMatters about the commission and the challenges ahead. “Nothing forces you to think about these things more than the threat to your current existence,” Ghaly said.   
This conversation has been edited for length and clarity. 
What’s the origin story for this commission? Who decided it needs to exist and why? 
The health foundations collectively that focus on programs like Medicaid and think about issues of equity … came together and said, “we’ve got to react and be prepared for the immediate shifts.” This is a forcing function moment – and a state like California for its millions of people who benefit from Medi-Cal but also the nation have got to drive some process to consider: what does this all mean for the mission of supporting low-income people to be healthy and well?
Obviously H.R. 1 makes a lot of changes. What do you see as the biggest challenge for Medi-Cal right now? 
There’s this big concern that a lot of people who have become confident and comfortable in their care may lose it, either through eligibility or if there are – God forbid – service cuts. Those are the things that I think are the “now” worries. The future worries are a little bit different. They include some of the things I just mentioned, but it’s also about sustainability and the growth and the cost of the program, and how we are sure we’re doing the right things that actually drive health outcomes to be better.
Speaking of costs, the Medi-Cal program has grown extensively over the last several years — some people say it’s grown too much, and earlier this year,  the program went over budget. At which point does the program become too big? 
Look, Medi-Cal has become a true health program, not just a health care program. [What that means is,] it’s really thinking about all the things that go into creating healthy individuals, healthy families, healthy communities, and, by extension, a healthier state. 
Has it grown too big? I think the piece of that that I appreciate and think is very important to dig into, is, are we doing all the things that matter? It’s great that we’re doing things to support health broadly, but are all the things that we’re paying for and creating the workforce for the things that make sense to do? I think that’s what is going to be a very interesting piece [for] this commission to dig into.
The state is freezing enrollment and cutting benefits already because of budget pressures. Are more service cuts and kicking people off the program in order to respond to the federal shifts inevitable?
It’s a hard question to respond to without the knowledge of what the other pressures are that the state’s going to face. You never want to say never, but I know this governor, I know the team there. They’re not going to want to make those kinds of cuts and decisions. But at the end of the day, the state has a responsibility with its budget to make sure it’s well and balanced. 
What do you expect to happen to the commission’s recommendations? 
I would like to think that what the commission writes and ends up with is something that is usable by policymakers. 
What I like about the commission’s makeup, in part, is that it is a lot of operators. It’s a lot of people who can understand how the high level idea might actually get implemented on the ground and through the different channels and levels of bureaucracy, which is a very big plus.
By the time the commission delivers its report, California will have a new governor. What should the next governor be thinking about and saying about these problems? 
I would love our candidates to be really hungry to understand what they might come in and expect to do to support improving, modernizing and ensuring that California’s flagship Medi-Cal program is maintained and supported.
If you find a somewhat sophisticated candidate, and then elected governor, in the healthcare space, they’re going to see how it’s not that all roads lead to Medi-Cal, but Medi-Cal is a major freeway in the healthcare environment, and it is the one that she or he has the choice to really influence and control.
I’ll just add one other thing. Health care is a huge piece of the California economy. And I don’t mean just Medicaid; I mean broadly. Most every person in California thinks about, “How do I secure and preserve access to health care and live in a healthy community?” I think those are important priorities.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/030420_NewsomCoronavirus_AW_CM_05.jpg?fit=1024%2C715&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-12-19 08:59:29.039645

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch) The following story was supported by the Fund for Investigative Journalism and was reported by The Utah Investigative Journalism Project in partnership with Utah News Dispatch.
When a Unified police lieutenant tried to pull body-worn camera footage for a case where the suspect had confessed to arson and attempted homicide, he discovered something curious. The video wasn’t there — and apparently the missing footage wasn’t a one-off incident. 
In fact, officer Mario Widdowson hadn’t uploaded any body camera videos during the first three months of 2023 and had failed to turn on his body camera 103 times during the same period. 
When confronted with those facts, Widdowson apologized and said he didn’t know it was that bad and that he was embarrassed by it.
This wasn’t his first time violating the department policy. During Widdowson’s five years with the department, he neglected to properly log body camera recordings, turn in reports on time, and activate his body camera, including during at least one incident involving use of force.
Between 2019 and 2023, Widdowson received several disciplinary actions, according to documents The Utah Investigative Journalism Project obtained through a records request. Those interventions included at least four formal warnings, several informal conversations, two corrective action plans and a no-pay suspension of about 180 hours. 
In the arson case, however, Widdowson’s second chances had run out and he was given a notice of termination that chronicled a “pervasive pattern of policy violations.”
“This is not the first time you have been disciplined for dereliction of duty, insubordination, report submission or failure to activate your body worn camera,” the notice reads. “I cannot, in good faith, allow the citizens of Salt Lake County to bear the burden and liability of an employee who demonstrates this type of behavior.”
That notice was among dozens of disciplinary records the UIJP received over the course of a year after filing nearly 170 records requests with 48 Utah law enforcement agencies — specifically to every sheriff’s office and police department of larger cities, ranging from Salt Lake to St. George. The requests asked for disciplinary records of officers who had violated body-worn camera policies between January 2019 and June 2025 as well as the agencies’ policies themselves. The UIJP also attempted to reach the individual officers named in this story through their current or former departments but received no response. 
The records identified 25 officers across 11 agencies with such violations. Ogden Police Department had the most at six, followed by West Valley City with five and Salt Lake City and Unified police with three each. Of those agencies, Ogden police was the only agency that did not respond to UIJP’s request for comment. 
The 25 officers represent a small fraction of the majority of the agencies’ total number of officers, with some agencies employing hundreds of officers.  
Some of the records document what appear to be one-off incidents, while others paint the picture of more egregious patterns of behavior. In several of the cases, the records documented other misconduct, ranging from disrespectful language to mishandling of evidence and failing to fill out reports.

An investigation into former Davis County sheriff’s deputy Tyler Young, for example, found he had accessed and shared information from the state’s criminal justice database without authorization, violated a driver’s constitutional rights after stopping them on private property, and tried to use his position as a deputy to argue against a Brigham City officer’s decision to screen custodial interference charges against him. Young resigned during the investigation. 
Former Salt Lake City Police Chief Chris Burbank, who pushed the department to adopt cameras during his tenure and now works as a law enforcement consultant, said body camera violations are often an indicator of underlying problems for both the employee and the agency as a whole. 
“You just become less credible — I think that’s more of the problem than the fact of you’re not wearing your body camera,” he said. “When you start to see that, it’s like, ‘Well, OK, what other things are you not addressing as the administrator of this department?’”
Salt Lake City police spokesperson Michael Ruff and Davis County chief deputy Taylor West concurred with Burbank. Ruff said because violations can be indicative of wider issues, the department’s audits go beyond just checking one or two videos and instead include follow up on whether violations are a pattern of behavior. Likewise, West said the office has an early intervention program that will flag issues like a deputy routinely shutting off their body camera. An alert is then sent to the deputy’s entire chain of command. 
West Valley City police spokesperson Roxeanne Vainuku, however, disagrees. She pointed to the fact that violations can have several causes, “many of which do not reflect misconduct or systemic problems.” Likewise, Unified police spokesperson Sgt. Aymee Race said some violations are also the result of equipment malfunction or low battery.
Only a few of the disciplinary actions reviewed by the UIJP show what appear to be genuine, one-off mistakes. One West Valley officer, for example, did not turn on his camera during a vehicle pursuit because he was on his way to work, before he could pick up the camera. 
“What violations do indicate is that our accountability systems are functioning,” Vainuku said over email. “The fact that we identify, track, and correct issues through transparent processes demonstrates a commitment to continuous improvement, not a deficiency in officer performance or agency culture.”
Facing the consequences 
Adam Schwartz, privacy litigation director for the Electronic Frontier Foundation, agreed that  law enforcement personnel should be held to the same accountability standards as any other professional. The foundation has advocated for strict safeguards for body cameras. 
“They’re the ones with a badge and a gun who are enforcing the law,” he said. “They, more than anyone else, should be following rules.”
The records obtained by the UIJP show that in the majority of cases, officers received a formal reprimand when they violated body camera policies. 
That includes one Ogden officer who neglected to turn on his body camera during an incident where he used force on a female minor who kicked him, according to an employee counseling form. And a West Valley parking compliance officer who failed to turn on her camera during an argument with an armed suspect. 
Another officer, this one from Unified police, received only a formal reprimand after failing to wear his camera, including during a domestic disturbance where officers used physical force to arrest a man. The man’s family later filed a complaint alleging excessive force, which triggered an investigation that revealed the officer was not wearing his body camera. 
Because of the officer’s failure to address his broken body camera in a timely manner, “valuable evidence in the case was not captured and could not be used as evidence for the criminal case or to dispel the allegation levied by the Family,” reads a letter documenting the officer’s reprimand. 
In other cases, officers were suspended without pay, placed on a corrective action plan or removal from specialized teams. 
Ogden Officer Karson Garcia, for instance, received two days of suspension without pay, a work improvement plan and removal from the Ogden Metro SWAT team after he failed to activate his body camera during a use of force incident.

An employee counseling form for Garcia states he had been warned three times previously about failing to use his body camera and was suspended for two days without pay over previous misconduct. An internal affairs investigation determined Garcia neglected to turn on his body camera on 47 cases.  
Widdowson was one of only two officers who was terminated over offenses that included body camera compliance. The other, officer Brandon Lyman, also worked for Unified police. He had turned on his body camera only seven times — once on accident — during a three-month period while he was on a corrective action plan for previous policy violations, according to discipline records. 
The National Police Index, which tracks police employment history data, shows both Widdowson and Lyman continued their careers in law enforcement after they were fired at Unified. Utah data was only gathered after the UIJP and the Invisible Institute fought for the records to be released. 
According to that data, Widdowson began working for Cottonwood Heights about six months after being fired; Lyman began working for the Utah Department of Corrections almost a year after his termination. 
Unified police declined to comment on Widdowson or Lyman, citing a policy not to comment on personnel matters beyond releasing discipline records. 
Cottonwood Heights police did not respond to a request for comment. Utah Department of Corrections spokesperson Karen Tapahe declined to comment on Lyman’s hiring for similar reasons. However, she said the department does perform background checks as part of its hiring process as well as additional interviews or investigations when necessary. That includes for applicants that were terminated by a previous employer. 
Burbank said that in his experience as an administrator, a first offense would result in a reprimand and discussion of the policy. After one warning, however, Burbank said termination would be on the table. While that may seem harsh, Burbank said it’s an issue of trust. 
“I’m not an advocate for firing people for the little things,” he said. “I’m an advocate for firing people for failing to display the honor and privilege it is to be a police officer in this country and the responsibility that comes with it.”
A look at policies 
The agencies’ policies on body cameras are largely the same, with many including similar or verbatim language. Many used Lexipol, a private consulting company that provides policy manuals to law enforcement. 
Almost all of the policies reviewed required officers to wear their body cameras conspicuously. Likewise, 89% directed officers to make sure their body camera equipment is functioning at the start of each shift, and 91% required officers to report if and why they failed to use their body cameras. 
All the policies also identified when officers need to activate their body cameras — a safeguard that Schwartz highlighted. Some of the policies simply referenced state code governing body cameras, while others listed out specific types of interactions that necessitate body camera use, ranging from traffic stops to use of force and execution of warrants.

“If the officer has discretion to decide when they’re going to turn that camera on and off, that absolutely ceases to be any kind of accountability tool,” Schwartz said. “The kind of rule that we like to see is an officer must activate their camera whenever they start an investigative encounter with a civilian.”
The majority of policies did not include explicit requirements for auditing officers’ use of body cameras. In fact, only eight of the 35 policies outlined specific auditing procedures. Another said audits “may be” conducted. 
“Everybody’s going to make a mistake at some point, right?” said David Ferguson, executive director of Utah Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers. “I do think that departments need to be aware of and are hopefully keeping track of officers where that’s a repeated problem.”
Of those eight policies, West Valley City Police Department’s was one of the most specific. It states that in addition to random audits by supervisors, the chief will also audit five body camera recordings at least twice a year. 
Vainuku, the department’s spokesperson, said the specificity was intentional to strengthen transparency and public trust. She said the department’s auditing process allows it to “proactively identify areas for improvement rather than relying solely on complaints.”

While Provo Police Department’s policy doesn’t mention how frequent audits will be done beyond “on a periodic basis,” it does include how body camera audits should be conducted and what they should look for. 
Policies for the South Jordan Police Department and Sevier and Summit County sheriff’s offices include the same language: “Supervisors should conduct audits at regular intervals to confirm BWC media is being properly uploaded and tagged by their subordinates.” 
Likewise, Emery, Grand and Davis County sheriff’s offices direct their respective body camera coordinators to conduct “periodic audits to ensure compliance with applicable laws, regulations, and office policy.”
Ruff, the spokesperson for Salt Lake City police, said that a lack of audit procedures in an agency’s body-camera policies doesn’t mean audits aren’t taking place. He pointed to a city ordinance that requires a mayoral designee to review body camera recordings at least monthly as well as a 2024 memo from the department’s chief. The memo outlines a weekly audit (which Ruff equates to about 10% of the department’s officers each month) as well as disciplinary procedures that include a 30-day review of an officer’s recordings and a referral to internal affairs depending on the violation.
Burbank, who is working on a project that would use AI to audit body camera footage, is a big proponent of the accountability mechanism, although he acknowledged it can be a burden for agencies to manually go through such large amounts of footage. But he believes it’s well worth doing so to get in front of issues before they grow. 
“Why would you not want to deal with it up front? But I’ve actually had police chiefs tell me, ‘Well, I don’t have a problem now and if I let them review this or I look at them proactively, then I have a problem,’” he said. “That’s irresponsible. That’s doing your job so you sit in the seat longer.”
Human failings 
Schwartz said while there may be some instances where it’s not possible for officers to activate their body cameras, those instances should be extremely rare. 
“All you have to do when an officer sees someone they’re going to detain is lift their hand up and press a button on a device which is fixed to their uniform,” he said. “So it’s hard to see when it is not feasible for the officers to turn the camera on.”
Only a few of the records obtained by UIJP include the officers’ reasoning behind not using their body cameras. 
One officer reported not feeling like he had to turn on his camera, instead opting to drive away because the encounter had become adversarial. Another said he relied on his car’s dash cam. A third said he wasn’t wearing his body camera because it wasn’t working, even though his department policy required officers to check their equipment each shift. A fourth officer, who had multiple violations, offered a number of explanations ranging from the camera’s battery being low to simply not remembering to turn it on. 
Burbank said simply forgetting to use a body camera is a “weak excuse.” 
“How many cops do you see wandering around without a gun in their holster?” he said. “They don’t forget their Taser, they don’t forget their flashlight.”
A tool for justice?
Body camera footage is often used as a way to hold law enforcement to account. But without the correct safeguards in place, body cameras become a tool for surveillance rather than accountability, said Schwartz of the Electronic Frontier Foundation.  
“Whenever a police officer walks up to a civilian and exercises their coercive power to interrupt that person’s day, stop them from going to work, detain them, etc. — this is a situation where police can be abusing their power,” Schwartz said. “If it’s an accountability tool, then every single one of those situations, the officer needs to be turning it on.” 
Ferguson, the director of Utah Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers, has a more positive outlook on body cameras, calling them “an exceptionally good” development in criminal justice.

“This stuff is just huge. It gets to the truth better and faster than just about anything else can,” he said. “Both sides really benefit from body cameras.”
Defendants, for instance, use it to show they didn’t actually commit a crime, Ferguson said. Meanwhile, law enforcement, who are under increased scrutiny in the modern world, can point to body camera evidence as proof of proper conduct. But those benefits are only present when cameras are used correctly. 
Ferguson has litigated cases in which officers have purposefully turned their body cameras away or off. In one DUI case, he said body camera footage recorded an officer telling his partner that he would turn away to avoid recording a field sobriety test. 
“So, yeah, this does happen. It’s real; it’s not a figment of our imagination. Officers actually do this sort of thing,” Ferguson said. “Police officers are like everybody else. No one wants to have their failures recorded.”
Burbank, likewise, stressed that they have limitations.
“It’s just one piece of evidence, but we tend to take that and say, no, no, it’s everything,” he said. “I just think we need to be careful of that.”
Four agencies reported that they do not use body cameras: sheriff’s offices in Salt Lake, Piute, Millard, Kane and Emery counties. Wasatch County only provided a copy of its policy on recording systems in police vehicles.
Ferguson said cases can be more complicated when agencies don’t use body cameras. 
“As a defense attorney, when you get those kinds of cases and you know that there’s no body camera, and your client is saying something that is different than what the police is saying, it just becomes so much harder to decide the appropriate course of action,” he said. “We’re not better off because of a lack of body cameras.”",https://utahnewsdispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Body-camera-crop-4.jpg,,,2025-12-19 08:59:29.039645

(Anna Barrett/Alabama Reflector)The Alabama Alcohol Beverage Control (ABC) Board Thursday approved an emergency, temporary rule regulating the sale of consumable hemp products, over the opposition of a state representative who sponsored the law leading to the regulation.
The rule creates the Responsible Consumable Hemp Product Program and establishes warnings and fees for violations of the rule. 
David Peacock, chief general counsel for the ABC Board, told board members that on first violation of the rule, retailers would receive a warning, and distributors would be fined $1,000 on first offense for selling a product that is not approved by the board.

“If the distributor were to purchase a product from a supplier that was violative a second time, they would no longer be able to use that supplier unless they provide to us a corrective action plan that we approve,” Peacock said.
Peacock did not say what products would be prohibited or allowed, but that there would be a list of products published on the ABC Board’s website.
Peacock said the rule is needed in accordance with HB 445, sponsored by Rep. Andy Whitt, R-Harvest, which passed the Legislature this spring. The law, which goes into effect on Jan. 1, requires testing and labeling for all consumable hemp products and caps THC at 10 milligrams per individually wrapped product and 40 milligrams per package. 
It also requires the ABC Board to license retailers of these products; restrict retail establishments selling hemp products and impose an excise tax on consumable hemp products. In October, the ABC Board passed a rule to implement the law.
The emergency rule passed 2-1 with board member John Knight, a former state representative, voting against it.
“I’m opposed to it only because I have a problem with the way it was done,” Knight said.

Whitt, who did not attend Thursday’s meeting, sent the board a letter Wednesday expressing his opposition to the emergency rule. 
“In addition to my concerns about the non-compliance with statutory guidelines about emergency rules, there are other areas of the proposal that bother me,” the letter said. “Nowhere in the authorizing legislation does it provide for a Responsible Consumable Hemp Product Program, such as that legislatively authorized by Alabama Code Section 28-10-4 in connection with alcoholic beverages. Therefore, it seems that this proposed regulation goes beyond statutory authority.”
Whitt said in an interview Thursday afternoon that he had a great relationship with the board but reiterated his opposition to the rule. 
“I think when it comes down to the emergency rulings, it serves a different purpose than maybe what’s transparent to begin with, maybe a self-serving group,” he said. “I want to make sure that it doesn’t and that the legislative process works.”
Curtis Stewart, the board’s administrator, explained that the rule’s intention is to protect retailers. 
“I think it’s important to remember that this rule doesn’t punish, doesn’t make anything harder for anyone. In fact, it gives the innocent, if you will, retailer, an avenue to say, ‘Look, I tried to do all I could to provide quality products,’” Stewart said.
Donna Alexander, executive director of the Alabama Wholesale Beer Association, expressed opposition to the rule at the meeting.
“This emergency rule does not follow the law the Legislature passed that Rep. Andy Whitt sponsored,” Alexander said in an interview after the meeting.
Whitt wrote in his letter that the rule had less severe consequences than the original bill.
“Penalties imposed by the proposed Emergency Rule for violations are not congruent with those found in the statute I sponsored but begin at a lesser level. Again, this is a serious concern,” Whitt wrote. 
The rule will expire on April 16. The process of approving a permanent version of the rule passed the board unanimously. The permanent version will be up for public comment and changes before final vote and implementation.
Melissa Morrissette, a board member, said the emergency rule was needed to protect retailers and consumers until the process of a permanent rule could play out.
“Starting January 1st, you have this window of time that it’s like the Wild West,” Morrissette said. 
Whitt said he does not foresee any repeal legislation during the 2026 legislative session, which begins on Jan. 13.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/DSC_0997-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-19 08:59:29.039645
,California,2025-12-19 13:01:00+00:00,CalMatters,California’s very odd election year starts with Republicans possibly leading the governor’s race,Dan Walters,,,,,https://calmatters.org/commentary/2025/12/california-governors-race-republicans-leading/,So many Democratic candidates are running — none with high poll numbers — that two Republicans could end up winning the primary.,"The 2026 campaigns for governor, a raft of other statewide offices, 52 congressional seats and 100 slots in the state Legislature officially begin today with the onset of candidate filing. It could be one of the oddest election cycles in California’s 175 years as a state, albeit one that puts the state’s convoluted politics in the national spotlight.
There are so many Democrats running for governor that it’s theoretically possible for a Republican to win the office, despite the state’s deeply blue political profile, especially with the possibility of even more Democratic hopefuls jumping into the mob — as a herd of kangaroos is dubbed in Australia.
Meanwhile, both incumbent members of Congress and aspirants will be running in districts that have been radically gerrymandered to shrink Republicans’ tiny delegation even more, as Democrats seek to regain control of Congress.
The possibility of a Republican governor, although very scant, stems from the state’s top-two primary election system. All candidates, regardless of party, will appear on the same June 2 primary election ballot, and the two with the highest percentages of the vote — no matter how small those shares may be — will face each other in the November election.

With upwards of a dozen Democrats now running and the possibility of others, it’s possible the  two Republicans in the mix so far —  Riverside County Sheriff Chad Bianco and former television commentator Steve Hilton — could theoretically finish one and two with perhaps as few as 10-15% of the votes each.
It’s not likely if the Democratic cohort shrinks in the next few months as the weakest contenders drop out, lacking enough money or poll support to continue. However, the lack of a natural Democratic frontrunner and the seeming lack of party leadership strong enough to cull the herd bolster the mathematical possibility of a GOP upset.
Had former Vice President Kamala Harris or U.S. Sen. Alex Padilla decided to run, either would have been the immediate frontrunner. But by opting out, they left a vacuum.
At the moment, former Congresswoman Katie Porter is leading the Democratic pack, albeit with scarcely double-digit support in the polls. Being the only woman running — now with Harris and former state Sen. Toni Atkins out — is one reason for her lead, as scant as it may be. She also gained recognition during her unsuccessful bid for a U.S. Senate seat last year.
Billionaire Tom Steyer is currently the most visible contender, spending some of his immense wealth on television and internet ads to depict himself as a populist who rails against “Sacramento politicians” and promises to reduce electric bills — not unlike how Donald Trump achieved success.
Beyond Porter, former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa and former Attorney General and Biden cabinet member Xavier Becerra appear to be the strongest Democratic strivers. However, everyone is still waiting to see whether Attorney General Rob Bonta or Los Angeles businessman Rick Caruso will opt in.
Having so much uncertainty this late in the game is very unusual. However, at some point, perhaps around February or March, when the Democratic field finally begins to shrink, it will be possible to sort out the truly viable candidates from the wannabes and do some realistic handicapping.
Until then, as Willie Brown, the former state Assembly speaker and San Francisco Mayor and one of the state’s most astute politicians, put it to Politico:
“The field is not considered of a quality that you as a Democrat would expect in California. We’re still pretty much carried away with stardom, with individuals who have some impact … We don’t have any candidates like that at the moment.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/051225_Governors-Event_FG_CM_41.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-12-19 08:59:29.039645
,California,2025-12-19 13:00:00+00:00,CalMatters,California’s minimum wage is increasing in 2026 as Los Angeles debates $30 an hour,Cayla Mihalovich,,,,,https://calmatters.org/economy/2025/12/what-is-california-new-minimum-wage/,California's minimum wage is adjusted every year for inflation. Some cities have a higher wage floor and unions are advocating increases for specific industries.,"In summary
California’s minimum wage is adjusted every year for inflation. Some cities have a higher wage floor and unions are advocating increases for specific industries.


Californians will see the minimum wage increase to $16.90 per hour starting Jan. 1. The adjustment — a boost of 40 cents per hour — was calculated in August by the Department of Finance as part of its minimum wage annual review required by state law.
California has been raising its minimum wage over the past decade. Former Gov. Jerry Brown in 2016 signed a watershed law to increase minimum wage from $10.50 per hour to $15 per hour, plus annual adjustments for inflation.
The current rate of $16.50 per hour suggests that a minimum wage worker needs to work 98 hours per week to afford a one-bedroom rental at fair market rent in California, according to the National Low Income Housing Coalition. 
California is one of 19 states to raise minimum wages in 2026, according to payroll company ADP. Cities and counties can also set their own minimum wages. This year, over two dozen local jurisdictions have increased local minimum wages. West Hollywood will have a $20.25 minimum wage starting in January — the highest of any California city, according to the UC Berkeley Labor Center.
Voters last November narrowly rejected a ballot measure that would have increased the minimum wage to $18 per hour. But some low-wage workers this year have successfully lobbied for bumps in pay in specific industries. 
Under laws Gov. Gavin Newsom signed in 2023, fast food workers earn a minimum wage wage of $20 an hour and health care workers are on track to make $25 an hour.
That momentum extended to Los Angeles hotel and airport employees. Labor organizers in May secured a city minimum wage increase to $30 per hour for those workers by the 2028 Olympics. Large businesses fought back, arguing that wage hikes will only increase challenges for the tourism industry, which is still struggling to find its footing after the pandemic. 
After failing to gather enough signatures for a ballot measure to repeal the new minimum wage, business groups later filed a different measure that could gut millions of dollars of revenue from the city’s general fund. 
Following the move, Los Angeles City Council President Marqueece Harris-Dawson this month introduced a motion to delay the full wage increase from taking effect until 2030, according to reporting from the Los Angeles Times. 
Labor leaders rebuked the motion, calling it “repulsive.” 
“You can’t threaten to blow a hole in our budget and then the only way to stop it is on the backs of workers,” said Kurt Petersen, co-president of the union that represents many hotel workers, UNITE HERE Local 11. “That kind of raw extortion and shakedown has no place in our city.”
According to Peterson, a coalition of community organizations and unions are beginning to collect signatures for a ballot measure that would raise the minimum wage to $30 per hour for all workers in Los Angeles.
“The power is everyone together,” said Peterson. “Working people need help and raising wages is the easiest, most straightforward thing to do. Going up 40 cents per hour in 2026 doesn’t move the needle at all.”

,Mississippi Today,2025-12-19 13:00:00+00:00,Mississippi Today,Shutoffs loomed in third year of receivership. Can Jackson afford its own water system?,Alex Rozier,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/12/19/price-of-reliable-water-means-shutoffs-for-jacksonians/,"Ted Henifin, third-party manager of Jackson's water system, defends high water bills. JXN Water needs a surge in revenue to keep afloat, he said.","Days before this past Halloween, Aidan Girod received a frightening note atop her water bill: “FINAL NOTICE.” The letter said Girod had three weeks to pay her outstanding balance before JXN Water would turn off her tap. 
At the start of the year, the north Jackson waitress received a $2,000 statement that included the several previous months she hadn’t gotten a bill for. As the utility revamps its historically plagued billing system, residents throughout the city have recently received an invoice for the first time in months, if not years. 
Girod, a mother to three young children, agreed to send $300 a month as part of a payment plan. Then in September, she received a bill again charging her $2,000, which JXN Water told her was due to a leak. But a plumber, tp whom Girod paid $180, said they couldn’t find it. 
She said a second plumber also couldn’t find a leak. After one of her dozens of phone calls with the utility, JXN Water applied a credit to her bill, although it wasn’t clear to Girod how they decided on the amount. Then in October, she received two water bills, including the one with a final notice, that showed two different balances.
Months later, she still isn’t sure how much she owes, whether she has a leak, or if the utility is getting ready to shut her water off. 
“It has been very stressful,” said Girod, who said she’s had to skip paying other expenses to afford her water bill. “I have a 3-month-old daughter, I’ve given birth during all of this. A lot of that strain has been on simply making sure I have running water for my children.”

Ted Henifin, whom residents, business leaders and public officials have credited with rescuing Jackson’s water system from its darkest moments, says his hands are tied. JXN Water, the third-party utility he runs, needs a surge in revenue to keep afloat, and it needs to come soon. 
But procuring those funds, Henifin admitted, is all the more complicated in a city with a strained relationship between its water supply and residents, many of whom haven’t trusted what comes out of their faucets or what shows up on their bills for years. 
Just last month, the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals revived a class-action lawsuit by residents against Jackson, alleging the city misrepresented the water’s safety after detecting levels of lead over the legal limit in 2015.
In the first two years after he took over in 2022, Henifin knew he needed a proof of concept for residents to buy in. In that time, JXN Water resolved widespread pressure issues, winterized a treatment plant that succumbed to recent cold snaps, and repaired hundreds of sewer line failures. Also, for the first time in a decade, Jackson’s system is in compliance with all federal drinking water requirements, the utility said recently, including the lingering lead violation. 
While residents praised the utility for its work, they soon learned it came with a high cost. This spring, JXN Water announced it had exhausted $150 million in funds from Congress set aside for daily upkeep of the system, which includes paying staff and routine maintenance.

The utility is a few years away from sustaining itself financially, Henifin projects, and reaching that point means both increasing monthly bills and more aggressively pursuing unpaid balances. With a collection rate of about 70% – far below the national average of over 90% – JXN Water is losing over a million dollars a month. 
“We figured we’d get around to the billing at some point,” Henifin said in a recent interview at his Belhaven office. “Unfortunately the timing between running through the ($150 million of) federal funds and us getting to the billing weren’t exactly aligned.
“So we’re finding the need to get the billing done and collections up faster than we would’ve liked. But I still don’t think we would’ve done it any differently. You got to get the water system and sewer working before you can start beating on people about paying their bill.”
In September, JXN Water shut off water to nearly 1,800 accounts, and Henifin said he expected that number to be higher in October. Based on those counts, the utility has turned off service to roughly 10% of Jacksonians in 2025 alone. 
One of those ratepayers, Dominique Grant, had no idea when she would catch up on her past due balance. A single mother of three, Grant recently fell behind after not receiving a bill for two years, she said. JXN Water told her to make a down payment of $1,900, half of her total balance, to initiate a payment plan, Grant said. 
After she didn’t come up with the money, instead prioritizing bills like her mortgage and car loan, the utility shut off her water in October. 
“I have to ask myself, am I going to take my whole check and pay this water bill, or spread it out to pay my car note, insurance, light bill, mortgage,” said Grant, a case manager at a local hospital. “Unless I take out a loan, I just don’t have $1,900 to give them.”
Between bathing and meals, Grant said she spent over $100 a week on bottled water for her family, or about what JXN Water charges her for a whole month. 
Henifin and other local officials referenced  a “culture of nonpayment” in Jackson that spread after the city installed a faulty metering system from Siemens in 2013. Since then, residents became accustomed to inconsistent and inaccurate billing. Amid metering issues and the COVID-19 pandemic, city officials forewent water shutoffs for much of the past decade.

With that track record in mind, JXN Water in 2023 proposed a billing system based on property values so customers would see the same amount every month. The state Legislature, though, passed a law blocking the idea soon after. 
Henifin also set up a discount on water bills for homes that receive food benefits through the federal SNAP program. But a recent court ruling blocked JXN Water from automatically applying the discount because of privacy laws. Henifin recently estimated fewer than 600 accounts receive the discount, which is about $30 a month. 
About 11,000 homes in Jackson, or nearly one in five, receive SNAP benefits, according to Census data, which means just 5% of eligible customers are receiving the water discount. 
Since the utility began its widespread shutoffs, both officials and residents have increasingly spoken out against JXN Water, citing a lack of affordability in a city where more than a quarter live below the poverty line. Heightening those tensions is a pending proposal to increase rates, which the utility says would increase the average bill by 12%.
At a recent court hearing, City Attorney Drew Martin panned the utility for not sooner considering its revenue and billing strategy, leading to steeper rate hikes that are tougher for residents to swallow. In October, the Jackson City Council voted to recommend reversing the 2022 order putting Henifin in charge of Jackson’s water system, in large part because of recent shut offs and billing disputes. 
U.S. District Court Judge Henry Wingate, who appointed Henifin as third-party manager, has not acknowledged the city’s vote. Wingate did, though, order an injunction against Henifin’s recent attempt to push through the rate increase without the judge’s approval. Wingate said he would make a ruling on the increase no sooner than Dec. 19. 
Sitting with Mississippi Today in his brightly lit office, Henifin stood firm on the high bill amounts that Jacksonians have contested over the past year, even the ones that somehow tallied into the tens of thousands. Rep. Fabian Nelson, a Democrat whose district includes Jackson, recently submitted letters to Wingate from residents with bills as high as $70,000. 
With new meters at nearly every property, the manager was confident the utility had accurate readings of customers’ usage. In most cases with abnormal balances, JXN Water tells the resident they have a leak. 
While some, such as Girod in north Jackson, hired plumbers who dispute the diagnosis, Henifin doesn’t budge. JXN Water can tell there’s a leak, he said, simply by looking at a meter and seeing the consumption run up continuously throughout the day.

Henifin suspected a number of residents have “slab leaks” under their home’s foundation, which the average plumber may not be able to find. That’s why the utility now recommends specific contractors for customers to call, he said.
On the customer service side, Henifin conceded there’s much room for improvement, saying residents too often leave phone calls with inconsistent answers. In addition to better training, he’s hoping to have more capacity for in-person appointments, a service JXN Water recently opened at the city’s Medical Mall. 
“People seem to forget we weren’t born a fully functional utility,” Henifin said. “ We were born out of no utility, essentially, and had to create everything along the way. 
“We (first) focused on getting the infrastructure to deliver water, get the sewer to stay in the ground. And now we get into the customer service experience and the billing. There’s nowhere to go but up.”
Yet in the meantime, residents and landlords who either can’t afford their bills or get answers through the call center are left with few options if they want to keep their water on. 
Jennifer Welch, a property manager in Jackson who sits on the city’s newly created Housing Task Force, criticized JXN Water over limited transparency. Welch and other landlords, who in some cases went two or three years without receiving a bill, have tried to ask the utility for clarity around their accounts but received little response, she said. 
“I have reached out to (Henifin) personally to let him know I have real concerns about the billing department,” said Welch, who said she’s met with Henifin throughout his time in Jackson. “He’s downplaying (the billing issue). I’ve just talked to too many people who are struggling.”
A group of nonprofits, including Forward Justice, the Mississippi Poor People’s Campaign, and the ACLU of MS, argued in court filings that JXN Water has shown little flexibility in its shutoff process, especially for residents who simply aren’t able to make down payments on the large debts they’ve accumulated after years of not receiving bills. 
“The threat of losing water service cannot make people quickly find money they don’t have, unless it comes at the expense of forgoing other essential needs like food and medicine,” the groups wrote in a Nov. 7 letter to Wingate. 
During a recent hearing at the Capitol, Democratic Sen. Sollie Norward said a woman in his Jackson district recently received a $20,000 water bill. While JXN Water allows customers to enter into payment plans, its policy requires customers with debt to make an initial down payment beforehand.
After forgiving some of the owed balance, the utility asked the woman to pay $4,000, the senator said. But that was still higher than she could afford, Norwood said, and eventually JXN Water shut her water off.
“I don’t know how she got there, and she doesn’t know how she got there,” he said. “Yes, shutting off water gets attention, but it also creates other problems.”
Grant, the single mother whose water was disconnected, cobbled together the $1,900 she needed for a down payment and, after four weeks, finally got her tap back running. After feeling the toll of not having service, she decided to take out a small loan and put off other bills to come up with the money. Still, Grant said JXN Water has unfair expectations of residents’ financial flexibility, especially when many had no idea what they owed for months or years. 
“They need to just have a better grasp on things,” she said. “Nobody has thousands of dollars just sitting around to spare.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/18124049/Aidan-Girod-1.jpg,,,2025-12-19 08:59:29.039645

(Will McLelland/Alabama Reflector)A group of students and professors have appealed a federal court ruling allowing an Alabama’s anti-diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) law to go into effect. 
The appeal, filed Dec. 15 in the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals, came after U.S. District Judge R. David Proctor denied a preliminary injunction in August to prevent the state from implementing SB 129, which bans public funding for DEI programs as well as the public affirmation of “divisive concepts.” 
Antonio Ingram, a Legal Defense Fund lawyer representing the plaintiffs, said in an interview Monday the lower court “made a lot of mistakes in interpreting the law and the facts.”

“This precedent really is in many ways an attack on universities as incubators of democracy,” he said. “If you can’t have professors and students engaging in free speech and free discourse, especially about topics that we’re talking about here, which is race, sex, gender, sexual orientation, you really can’t create a functioning, multiracial, inclusive democracy.”
Proctor wrote in a 146-page opinion  that while the professors proved they had standing for the lawsuit, the students did not and language in SB 129 contains “explicit guidelines which led to the denial.”
“The court concludes that plaintiffs have not established the requirements for the issuance of a preliminary injunction against the Board’s enforcement of SB 129,” the opinion said.
The 69-page filing said the court acknowledged the bill’s “viewpoint-based restrictions” on speech for the professor plaintiffs, but incorrectly concluded that the restrictions are lawful under existing precedent and the government speech doctrine. 
Attorneys for the plaintiffs also said that the courts failed in holding that the student plaintiffs had no standing.
The lawsuit was first filed  in January by students at The University of Alabama Birmingham; three professors working at The University of Alabama in Tuscaloosa and the Alabama Chapter of the NAACP. The plaintiffs alleged that SB 129 stifled academic instruction and violated the First and Fourteenth Amendments.
“This appeal is a necessary next step because SB 129 continues to undermine academic freedom and the integrity of higher education in Alabama,” Dana Patton, an Alabama professor and plaintiff, said in a statement Monday. “This law has created a climate of fear on campus that narrows what students can learn and what educators can teach. Through this appeal, we urge the court to affirm our responsibility and right, as dedicated educators, to provide students with a truthful, comprehensive education.”
The appeal alleges that Patton was investigated because of an anonymous complaint made about her “embedding divisive concepts” into a course she taught at UA about poverty. 
The filing also alleges that following the investigation she was “confronted” by Rep. Danny Garrett, R-Trussville, who serves as the chair for the Ways and Means Education Committee at a UA football game where he told her “Alabama state legislators were ‘not going to let this go.’” 
Garrett declined to comment on Patton’s allegations in a phone interview Thursday afternoon.
Sydney Testman, a student at UAB and plaintiff in the case said in the same statement the bill being implemented has a chilling effect on the campus’ culture.
“As a senior, I have watched our campus change overnight, as students are afraid to speak, opportunities for thoughtful engagement have disappeared, and students’ shared sense of belonging has eroded,” the statement said.
Testman, who formerly served as the finance coordinator for UAB’s Social Justice Advocacy Council (SJAC), alleges in the appeal that because of the university’s interpretation of SB 129 she was unable to maintain a $600 stipend she received for work she did with her student organization and her position as finance coordinator for SJAC.
Ingram said Proctor’s ruling could have consequences on higher education.
“If opinions like this lower court’s opinion continue to exist, it really would sort of fundamentally change the way in which universities have functioned for the past hundreds of years, and really take away universities as spaces for intellectual engagement,” he said.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Tuscaloosa_McLelland16734-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-19 08:59:29.039645

The second largest provider of Medicaid coverage in Louisiana will extend its plan for approximately 330,000 enrollees until March 31, but not after that date.  
UnitedHealthcare won’t stay in the state Medicaid program beyond the end of a 90-day contract extension it agreed to Thursday, according to company spokeswoman Christina Witz. 
“This extension is for the sole purpose of allowing for a more orderly and seamless transition for our members to other Managed Care Organizations to help prevent gaps in care and give health care providers a chance to enter into new contracts with these organizations,” Witz said  in a written statement. 
“While we are disappointed that we cannot continue providing access to quality care for our more than 300,000 Medicaid members throughout the state after March 31, 2026, we will continue to work in partnership with the state throughout the transition process,” she added. 

SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The extension means Louisiana’s Department of Health will not have to scramble to put hundreds of thousands of people into new Medicaid plans by Dec. 31, as previously planned. 

But Gov. Jeff Landry’s administration will still have to transfer UnitedHealthcare enrollees to one of the five remaining Medicaid providers on a compressed timeline. 

The state health department ran into challenges when it attempted a similar transfer over a period of several months in 2022, legislators said earlier this week. 

“When we have to do this in the past, when we’ve had a year to do this, there have been problems,” Sen. Jay Luneau, D-Alexandria, said at a hearing Tuesday. 
UnitedHealthcare covers a quarter of the approximately 1.4 million Louisiana residents in the Medicaid program. Aetna Better Health of Louisiana, AmeriHealth Caritas, Healthy Blue, Humana Healthy Horizons and Louisiana Healthcare Connections also offer Medicaid plans. 

Health Secretary Bruce Greenstein expressed confidence his agency can carry out the massive shift on the three-month timeline. 

“This extension gives us more time to take an even more thoughtful approach to transitioning members to new plans,” he said in a written statement. 

Louisiana lawmakers, advocates worry ending Medicaid contract could create care gaps


Earlier this week, Greenstein and Attorney General Liz Murrill also suggested the contract extension would provide more “runway” for Murrill and UnitedHealthcare to come to an agreement over a lawsuit between the state and the company.
“It will give United an opportunity to come and talk to me and provide us with what we have asked for,” Murrill said of the contract extension in an interview with reporters Tuesday. “It gives them an opportunity that they might not otherwise have had.”
But the state will not be able to hold the ultimatum of the contract over UnitedHealthcare if the company has already decided to walk away from the Medicaid program after March. 
UnitedHealthcare’s original contract for all of 2026 was supposed to be $4.2 billion. The health department did not say Thursday how much the 90-day extension will be worth. 
Attorney general pressure
Assuming UnitedHealthcare pulls out of Louisiana’s Medicaid program at the end March, it will largely be at the behest of the attorney general. 
As recently as last month, UnitedHealthcare was on track to continue providing Medicaid coverage in Louisiana through the end of 2026. Louisiana legislators signed off on the contract extension Nov. 20 at the urging of the Landry administration. Greenstein personally pushed for the agreement as part of a package with the five other private Medicaid contracts during a three-hour hearing. 

The health department then abruptly canceled UnitedHealthcare’s agreement 11 days later after receiving a letter from Murrill encouraging it to do so. She alleged UnitedHealthcare has violated its state contract by withholding documents from state officials regarding prescription drug pricing for Louisiana’s Medicaid program. 
UnitedHealthcare has repeatedly stated it is complying with its contract and the law. 
The claim of withholding of documents was a motivating factor for the state’s lawsuit against UnitedHealthcare, initially launched in 2022 by Landry when he was attorney general. Murrill took over the litigation when she took office in 2024,

In the lawsuit, Landry and Murrill allege UnitedHealthcare and its pharmacy benefits manager, Optum Rx, overcharged Louisiana’s Medicaid program for prescription drugs from 2015 to 2023. 
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Murrill said the attorney general’s office has sought documents that would shed light on the company’s drug pricing practices, but UnitedHealthcare has refused to provide them. UnitedHealthcare stands out from the other Medicaid’s managed care organizations, Murrill said, because the other companies have provided similar information when requested.  
Murrill said she warned UnitedHealthcare at an Oct. 15 mediation session that she would move to block its 2026 contract extension. 
“They have known that this was going to be the recommendation I was going to make,” she said Tuesday. “I don’t make threats. If I told them that that was what I was going to do, I meant it.”

Though UnitedHealthcare might have known its contract could be blocked, legislators were in the dark. Murrill never raised concerns with lawmakers before they voted to let the contract move forward in late November. 

Greenstein said he also wasn’t aware the contract was at risk of being terminated by the attorney general until after lawmakers voted. 

“I didn’t know we were at that point,” Greenstein said Tuesday when lawmakers asked why he had pushed a contract at a legislative hearing less than a month ago that the attorney general opposed. 
Fewer Medicaid plans
The Landry administration and several legislators have wanted to reduce the number of private companies working in the Medicaid program. Lawmakers in both parties believe the state is paying for too much overhead by working with six managed care organizations. 
Not everyone will be enthusiastic about losing UnitedHealthcare as one of those insurers. Senate President Pro Tempore Regina Barrow, D-Baton Rouge, said in an interview this week that while she wants fewer Medicaid plans, UnitedHealthcare was not among those she initially thought should be dropped. 
Katie Corkern, who advocates for mental health services and people with disabilities, said doctors and health care providers find UnitedHealthcare easier to work with than other managed care organizations. 

“They work well with providers. There are not a lot of hassles [the providers] have to go through,” Corkern said Thursday.",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/doctors.jpg,,,2025-12-19 09:56:38.398629

Vermont resident and Brown University student who was on campus during last week’s shooting calls for better protections against gun violence.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Madeleine Connery: What it feels like to realize your country won’t protect you.","Madeleine Connery is a junior at Brown University and lifelong resident of Shelburne.



At 4:05 p.m. on December 13, I received the text that every American student fears yet none predict. My 21-year-old roommate sent a message to our group chat 
“guys I just ran out of the engineering building there were sounds like gunshots.” 
Over the course of the next 17 hours, my life unraveled.
At 20 years old, I became a school shooting survivor, along with my 7,800 peers who hunkered down in libraries, behind desks and whiteboards, fearing for their lives in dark silence while helicopters swarmed and sirens wailed.
While I will wear this trauma for the rest of my life, politicians and citizens alike seem to have grown numb and weary of caring. The routine thoughts, prayers and empty promises of change churn and sputter out until the next mass shooting occurs. Until it becomes your child, your cousin, your neighbor, you.
My story is not unique, nor is it new. The event came on the eve of the 13th anniversary of the Sandy Hook shooting. Those 20 first-grade students would have grown up to be college juniors today – just like me. Instead, their dreams, goals and ambitions were squandered at the hands of a man with a semi-automatic rifle.
Since Sandy Hook, the gun death rate among children and teens has increased by 106%. More than 398,000 American students have experienced gun violence at school. In a 2022 study by the Johns Hopkins Institute for Gun Violence Solutions, guns were the leading cause of death among children and teens. Vermont is not immune. The gun death rate here has increased by 17% since 2014. How many more statistics must I drop for you to become angry? How many more must die for you to do something?
Growing up in Vermont, gunshots normally meant hunting season; they meant late foliage hikes or long autumn drives to my grandparents’ house. I remember my first lockdown drill: my kindergarten teacher explaining it as a very important game of hide-and-seek, as we huddled together behind the arts station shelves. News of school shootings flickered intermittently throughout my childhood, but they always felt faraway–something that happened somewhere else, to someone else. 
I would like to sit here and say the event was unprecedented, a mere tragedy that we’d prevent if we could. But it wasn’t. My 14 hours of fearing for my life curled up under my desk were a brutal reminder of a pattern, a conflation of anarchy and freedom, liberty and injustice. I faced the undeniable truth that I grew up in a country that would pick death machines over children’s lives.
And what upsets me the second most – after the fact that two of my peers didn’t live to see the first Providence snow and eight more left a review session with bullets in their bodies – is that nobody is talking about solutions. 
Don’t pray for me. Don’t pity me. Don’t send any condolences my way; send that message to your legislator. Find your anger. Tap in to your fear. 
Because in 21st century America, none of us are safe in school. In the richest country in the world, we are killing our children with inaction. To my fellow Vermonters, I urge you all to email, call and pressure the House Judiciary Committee to consider a ban on semi-automatic assault rifles and to implement a common-sense concealed carry permit requirement. Ask house judiciary committee members to fight for H.381, S.131, H.264, H.200. Ask for more, because Vermont has the power to act where Congress has failed. Your thoughts and prayers won’t stop bullets, but laws can.

Concrete residents held their breath through a spate of natural disasters and severe weather that unfolded over the past two weeks.
Atmospheric rivers dumped rain across western Washington, causing historic flooding in and around Whatcom and Skagit counties. 
Concrete, located along Highway 20 in Skagit County, felt the effects.
The nearby Skagit River crested at record-breaking levels last Thursday. 
While Concrete’s downtown did not flood, areas closer to the river did. As of Wednesday, some homes on the outskirts of Concrete were still surrounded by water. Since then, the water level has fluctuated and receded to minor flood stage as of Thursday.

On top of that, a series of small earthquakes rattled the town awake Monday morning, the strongest one peaking at magnitude 2.9, according to the Pacific Northwest Seismic Network. 
The rain triggered three minor mudslides at Burpee Hill, Lake Shannon Road and Eriksen Place, forcing evacuations. 
Constricted between hills rising into the North Cascades and tall evergreen trees, Concrete residents feared more slides, some recalling the massive Oso landslide of 2014, which happened after heavy rainfall and claimed 43 lives.
Work has been underway to survey the slide areas in and around the town.
Local officials in Concrete said geology technicians had not reported any concerns yet with the Burpee Hill and Eriksen Place slide sites. County officials involved in inspecting the Lake Shannon Road mudslide could not be reached for comment.
Seventeen-year-old Kimi Ward was in the kitchen with one of her dogs when they heard the mudslide above them at Eriksen Place around 11 p.m. on Wednesday, Dec. 11.

“We just heard crashing,” Ward said. “My mom is pretty nervous because she’s been living here for 30 years. If it were to hit our house, we’d lose everything.”
Over on East Main Street, directly below the small mudslide on Shannon Lake Road, households also faced evacuation advisories. Casie Jo Manke said this wasn’t the first time a landslide had come through her neighborhood, though she wasn’t concerned this time.
The previous owner of her home had reinforced all three walls facing the nearby hill with extra concrete after a previous slide. Manke said that beneath a grassy park across the street were tennis courts buried by that earlier landslide. 
Roads to the mudslide site in the Burpee Hill neighborhood were closed Wednesday, and the neighborhood was still under a Level 3 evacuation notice, indicating immediate danger.
With slide concerns and flood threats subsiding, some sense of normalcy is returning to Concrete. Schools went back in session on Wednesday. Ward was even planning to play in a basketball game on Lummi Island that night.

Immediate aid has shifted to other areas. The National Guard left Concrete on Tuesday. The Red Cross moved its operation to Everson on Wednesday. Randy Mueller, shelter supervisor, said that cots in Concrete had been empty the night before.

Kari Monsees, the state education department’s semi-retired chief of finance, told working groups tasked with revamping the formula that he hopes to find a replacement for a variable called the dollar-value modifier. This piece of the formula, as it stands, uses regional wage data to increase state funding in areas with higher salaries. But the underlying data, Monsees said, is no longer being reported by federal agencies.
The funding targets working group thought it had a solution with a dataset called the Comparable Wage Index for Teachers, which is reported by the National Center for Education Statistics. But this week, Monsees learned this data is also set to go dark.
“It may be a side effect of all the transitions happening at the federal level, with some of the determined non-essential reporting entities no longer reporting the same information,” he said. “So after quite a bit of work over the last couple of weeks, it felt like as of last Thursday afternoon we were back to square one.”
A spokesperson for the U.S. Department of Education confirmed that the wage index, which measured the salaries of college graduates by region, was deemed nonessential.
The working groups were scheduled to complete their recommendations this week so that the larger Missouri School Funding Modernization Task Force could review plans in January. Monsees said he has identified possible data sources, like the Missouri Economic Research and Information Center.
Surveys that are part of the U.S. Census are another potential source, but the data is not reported annually.
“One of the things to be mindful of is frequency of availability,” said Liberty Public Schools Superintendent Jeremy Tucker. “Especially when you throw out Census data that is going to be a little bit longer cycle as far as when that might be available.”
Currently, the dollar-value modifier is updated annually. Though, without the underlying data, the state is forced to freeze this variable until a new method is outlined in state law, Monsees said.
Each working group has focused on different sections of the funding formula. How each piece works together — and the potential funding ramifications for schools — will begin to emerge when the task force reconvenes Jan. 26.

(Photo by Tom Davies/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Indiana’s state budget surplus could grow to nearly $5 billion by the middle of 2027 under new and much rosier tax revenue projections.
An updated report presented Thursday to the State Budget Committee forecast tax collections growing by 4.2% this fiscal year and by 2.7% the following year.
That would give the state about $2.4 billion more than officials expected when the new state budget was finalized in April — and revenue growth was anticipated at 0.8% and 0.1% for the two years of the spending plan.
But Republican state fiscal leaders showed no signs of any spending boosts for the tight budget that took effect July 1.
“It was a positive forecast and it was good news for our state,” House Ways and Means Committee Chair Jeff Thompson said. “But remember, we’re less than 25% through this biennial budget, so there’s some uncertainty still.”
The revenue growth would push the state’s cash reserves from what had been an expected $2.7 billion in mid-2027 — about 12% of annual state spending — to $5 billion, or about 22% of state spending. That is well above the 10-15% level that leaders usually aim for.
Democrats said the unexpected revenue should allow the state to restore spending cuts made after the Legislature was “spooked” by the dismal April forecast.
Rep. Greg Porter, the top Democrat on the Ways and Means Committee, said the state needed to make better use of the available funds rather than more tax cuts.
“The people who really need it, the special needs individuals, our children, seniors, they’re going to be left out in the cold,” Porter said.
Gov. Mike Braun touted the revenue forecast as “evidence that our focus on jobs and wages to grow the economy is working.”
“We are boosting Hoosier wages and lowering taxes,” Braun said in a statement. “While many other states are struggling to gain momentum, Indiana is thriving and Hoosiers are keeping more money in their pockets.”
Medicaid costs growing slower
New projections also show Indiana’s Medicaid program costs will grow slower than expected as the number of people it covers has dropped about 15% in the first year of Braun’s administration.

Medicaid officials are also planning a 10% cut in the payment rate for an autism therapy program that has drawn particular concern for its fast-growing expenses.
The state’s rising Medicaid expenditures have been a major worry of state budget officials for the past several years — and a new forecast of those costs released Thursday indicated some relief.
The previous forecast released in April had Medicaid costs jumping by 9.5% during the current state fiscal year and 7.7% next fiscal year, for a total increase of $1.2 billion over those two years.
The new projections have those growth rates slowing to 3.2% and 6.4% per fiscal year, totaling about $465 million less in state spending for the two-year period.
That cost slowdown comes as Indiana’s enrollment in the low-income health care coverage has dropped from about 2 million people at the beginning of this year to 1.7 million in November — a removal of about one in every seven people who were enrolled.
Family and Social Services Administration Secretary Mitch Roob, who oversees the Medicaid program, attributed much of the enrollment drop to the income verification letters now sent every three months that started in April.
But the state’s Medicaid expenses haven’t dropped by a similar rate because those who’ve not maintained their enrollment are healthy and not often seeking health care, Roob said.
“You have fewer patients, but you’re covering the sicker patients,” Roob told the Indiana Capital Chronicle ahead of Thursday’s State Budget Committee presentation.
Roob said the state agency doesn’t know yet how frequently those dropped from the Medicaid rolls by not responding to the income-verification letters eventually are re-enrolled.
“You’d probably need at least 18 months worth of data to discern that,” Roob said. “I think that’s an important question and it’s worth knowing, but we don’t know it yet.”
Payment cuts for autism therapy
Medicaid officials presented their plan to reduce payments for applied behavior analysis, or ABA, therapy that is often used to improve communication and learning skills in children and young adults with autism or other developmental disorders.
The plan is to reduce the state’s current ABA therapy payment rate of about $68 an hour to near what Medicaid officials say is the national average of $61 an hour.
The payment cut is planned to take effect in April for a program that has seen its use surge in recent years. More than 8,000 Hoosiers rely on Medicaid to pay for ABA therapy, with most of them between three and eight years of age.
Roob said Braun had told him to get ABA therapy costs to a “reasonable” spot.
“We think smack dab in the middle is reasonable,” Roob said. “We value ABA therapy, right? But we can’t afford ABA therapy for all in perpetuity.”
Indiana’s Medicaid program began covering ABA services in 2016, spending about $21 million over the following year.

(Photo by Niki Kelly/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Just like going to class, there is a lot to glean from watching state government in action. And 2025 was full of lessons.
As we wrap up the year, here are the top five things I learned:
DATA CENTERS
Data centers aren’t going away — and neither is the sentiment of Hoosiers against them. As many as 30 massive data centers are in the works in the state. Lawmakers and state officials seem annoyed that citizens keep fighting them — a form of not-in-my-backyard over and over again. But that’s because citizens don’t see the advantages. There are fair questions about companies using energy and water resources, and the benefits aren’t clear. There is an initial burst of investment and construction jobs, but the full-time employment is often low. Property tax abatements mean local schools and government aren’t getting new revenue. Add to that a massive state sales tax exemption worth hundreds of millions, and it’s legitimately unclear what Hoosiers are getting out of new data centers.
TRUMP
Trump’s popularity has a limit. While Hoosier Republicans gave him an 82% favorable rating in a recent poll, Senate Republicans defeated a move to redraw Indiana’s congressional districts for purely partisan reasons Despite enormous pressure over more than four months, senators stood on their principles and refused to yield to political primary threats and intimidation tactics like swatting. I couldn’t have imagined the president of the United States calling out senators by name — but that’s where we were. And now, everyone will be watching to see if national influencers really plow money into state Senate seats to get retribution.
EDUCATION MATTERS
When education stakeholders focus — with resources, data and effort — it works. Indiana saw big gains in third grade reading proficiency thanks to a literacy effort backed by state and private philanthropy dollars. While some students will be repeating third grade, the additional remediation that lawmakers and state officials made available means it was far less than originally feared. The state’s chronic absenteeism rate is also improving after hitting a “crisis” level. That led to a more intensive law targeting absences. One area that needs similar focus is Indiana’s college-going rate, which continues to disappoint.
HURTING THE POOR
Poor people are the target of cuts in state government. Gov. Mike Braun’s administration is trying to reign in Medicaid enrollment — and therefore expenses — by imposing additional verification checks, work requirements and more. Similarly, those on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program will no longer be able to buy a candy bar or a Dr. Pepper. But perhaps the biggest impact is coming from cuts to childcare vouchers. With fewer vouchers and provider rates slashed, day care centers are closing. And that means fewer people in the workforce. I can’t help but note that at the same time these cuts are happening, lawmakers removed limitations for state-paid private school vouchers.
IEDC
The Indiana Economic Development Corporation doesn’t have a blank check anymore. During former Gov. Eric Holcomb’s tenure, the spending by the IEDC was legit insane. And legislators seemed hesitant to question or block any of it. An audit of the quasi-governmental agency and related entities turned up lots of conflicts and lapses in process. Lawmakers slashed the IEDC’s budget. How they spend their money is also still up for debate. And some local officials say the entity lacks a clear vision. With a new board and focus on smaller businesses outside of Indianapolis, it remains to be seen which version of the agency is better for Indiana.
RISING COSTS
I was going to stop at five, but I can’t ignore the growth in utility and health care costs. The latter have grown for decades, and nothing lawmakers do seem to make a dent. And the General Assembly has really tried — putting more work on the health care side than many other issues. But because so much health care policy is controlled at the federal level, state policies can only have so much impact. But the rising energy prices are startling and new. Utility rates have a myriad of culprits behind them, and 2026 will be focused on dealing with those. Everyone has some blame on this one: utility companies living large on massive profits; lawmakers allowing companies to raise rates for many expenses; utility regulators approving hikes that are simply not justified or affordable; and the continued fight over renewables vs. coal.

(Courtesy photo)The landline phone — remember those? — that sat on my desk rang in August 2008. On the line was the Science Museum of Minnesota’s Xcel Energy account manager. He kept the museum in his portfolio — tiny though we were compared to his large government and academic clients — because he liked collaborating with us on innovative energy education projects.
He wanted to introduce the museum to someone achieving remarkable feats of building energy efficiency. So a meeting was set up with him, the museum’s CFO and director of facilities, a lone mechanical engineer and me.
The engineer proceeded to give us his spiel: 
Our large, modern buildings consume enormous quantities of electricity. Electricity inevitably degrades into heat. This heat must be managed, otherwise building interiors would quickly overheat. How is this heat typically managed?  We expel it from our buildings and then use other forms of energy to do work that could have been performed with the heat energy we just threw away.
Two years later, after raising sufficient funds, the museum contracted with the consultant to conduct a top-to-bottom building energy analysis. He returned several months later with his report. 
His topline insight: The museum was producing 30 trillion BTUs of waste heat annually. We nodded politely. Sounds like a big number. 
And then you expel this heat energy from your building? 
We again nodded because that was the way the museum was designed, constructed and operated. 
But you’re buying 15 trillion BTUs of heat energy annually. Why are you throwing away an enormous amount of heat and then turning around and buying a huge amount? 
We shrugged. No one had pointed out this ridiculous situation before.
By fall 2013, with financing secured, the museum proceeded to implement the consultant’s retrofit recommendations. 
By spring 2015, we had completed the recommissioning of a new energy management system to enable the museum’s HVAC system to be more aware of and responsive to external and internal conditions, as well as two heat recovery chillers to capture and reuse previously discarded heat energy. 
The results were impressive. The museum’s carbon emissions were cut by 32% and utility expenses dropped by $231,000 annually — savings that we reinvested in our scientific and educational mission.
But there were broader benefits from the 2013-2015 building energy retrofit. The museum helped employ the factory workers in LaCrosse, Wisconsin, who built its heat recovery chillers; the truck drivers who delivered the machines to St. Paul; the riggers who carefully lifted them off of the truck and maneuvered them into the building; the concrete workers who poured the pads for them; and the numerous pipefitters, electricians, software engineers and other skilled tradespeople who worked to retrofit just this one building over two years.
The museum’s 2013-2015 retrofit set in motion an ongoing recommissioning process, whereby we continually reviewed how to further improve energy performance. 
Through 2023, the museum had reduced its energy use by 39% from the early 2000s; cut carbon emissions by 90% from their 2014 peak; and, its utility expenditures were virtually unchanged from when it opened in its current location in 1999, although energy costs have doubled over those 24 years. 
If the museum was still using as much energy now as it was 20 years ago, its annual utility bills would be $600,000 higher. 
Hundreds of skilled tradespeople have since worked in the museum over the past decade, helping us to make the building operate more efficiently, safely and cleanly. These are homegrown jobs that cannot be offshored. And while AI no doubt will provide valuable insights into how buildings can better perform, it will not replace those who actually do the work of  implementing and maintaining those improvements.
The 111 million buildings in the U.S. are responsible for 40% of all energy use in the country at an estimated annual cost of $370 billion. 
Imagine the economic, employment, educational and environmental benefits if energy-efficient buildings were not rare but commonplace. 
Yet the Trump administration has cut funding for residential and commercial building energy efficiency. Promoting building energy efficiency is yet another missed opportunity by this administration to grow secure, good-paying jobs for American workers.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Heat-recovery-chiller-2-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-12-19 07:58:08.119462

Mike Parson that from 1987 to 2020 the state underfunded Lincoln University by about $361 million in per-student support compared with the University of Missouri.
It was a figure highlighted by the U.S. Department of Agriculture and outlets such as KCUR as part of a broader pattern of underfunding Black land-grant universities.
As lawmakers hammer out this year’s higher-education budget, that letter still sits on the table. It is not just a historical audit. It is a warning about how Missouri treats its Black land-grant university and about the risk that the state squanders federal dollars meant for farmers, rural communities and students.
Missouri actually has two land-grant universities. The state first designated the University of Missouri under the Morrill Act of 1862. After Congress passed the Second Morrill Act in 1890, segregated states that wanted to keep their white land-grant campuses had to create and equitably fund a separate institution for Black students. Missouri chose that path.
Lincoln University — founded in 1866 by Black Civil War veterans pooling their pay to build a school — became the state’s 1890 land-grant institution.
On paper, MU and Lincoln share the same mandate: use research, teaching and extension to support the state’s agricultural base and workforce. In practice, the federal government’s analysis shows Lincoln was shortchanged by roughly $361 million over three decades. You can see traces of that gap on Lincoln’s hilltop campus: patchwork repairs on aging buildings, labs with outdated equipment and too many courses and advising responsibilities loaded onto too few full-time instructors.
Land-grant status comes with obligations, not just benefits. For Black land-grant universities created under the 1890 law, federal “capacity” grants for research and extension typically require a 100% state match, with the U.S. Department of Agriculture allowed to waive part of that requirement only in limited circumstances.
Missouri’s own budget documents acknowledge that Lincoln must match its federal land-grant appropriations dollar-for-dollar with state resources.
For years, Missouri failed to provide the full match for Lincoln that it provided for MU. Analyses describe how 1890 campuses have had to seek waivers and reshuffle internal budgets simply to approach the required match, leaving federal dollars on the table and feeding the slow decay of buildings, farms and academic programs.
In 2022, Missouri lawmakers finally took what Lincoln called a “historic step”: for the first time, the legislature appropriated the full state match Lincoln needed to draw down its entire federal land-grant allocation. That is real progress. But better budget years do not erase three decades of shortfalls — or the message those shortfalls send to Washington, where Cardona and Vilsack have urged concrete catch-up plans for the 1890 campuses.
Meanwhile, federal backing is growing more fragile. This winter, the U.S. Department of Agriculture suspended the 1890 National Scholars Program, a flagship scholarship that had been providing full tuition and fees for agriculture students at the 19 Black land-grant universities.
Reporting indicates the program awarded roughly $19 million in scholarships to about 94 students in 2024 before being placed “under review.” When key federal programs are frozen or reconsidered, states that have not met their own obligations are in a weaker position to argue that the money should keep flowing.
Governance matters as much as money. Lincoln’s accreditor, the Higher Learning Commission, expects effective boards, adequate resources and a meaningful faculty role in academic decisions.
In 2020, Lincoln declared financial exigency — an emergency status that allows sweeping cuts — and moved to close its history department and loosen protections for tenured faculty, drawing scrutiny from national higher-education media and from the American Association of University Professors. For a small land-grant HBCU already under financial strain, the chain is easy to trace: years of underfunding lead to crisis; crisis invites emergency decisions; emergency governance weakens faculty voice and heightens accreditation risk.
If Lincoln were ever to stumble on accreditation, the first people to feel it would be students.
Missouri has already shown it can do better; now it needs to make that commitment durable and transparent. Lawmakers should lock in parity by statute, guaranteeing Lincoln the same per-student operating support and land-grant match percentage that MU receives.
The state should also begin paying down the $361 million gap federal officials have documented, whether through a dedicated fund, bonds or scheduled appropriations, with a clear timetable for repairing the damage to Lincoln’s facilities and core academic programs. New investments should be tied to public metrics — building conditions, faculty-to-student ratios, research capacity, extension work in rural communities and student success — so Missourians can see how each dollar strengthens the state’s agricultural base and workforce.
Lincoln University is not a special-interest line item; it is one of Missouri’s two land-grant trustees. How lawmakers respond now will show whether “land-grant” really means “for all Missourians.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/100223_lincoln1-1024x640.jpg,,,2025-12-19 06:57:27.384086

Vermont Medicaid hopes that implementing these changes will root out duplicitous payments. Providers say that’s not how it works.

To get himself ready to leave the house each morning, Kingston Emilo goes through a series of to-dos outlined in little pictures on a story board. When he puts his socks on, he moves the velcro square from “To-Do” to “Done.” He repeats the ritual when putting on his shoes, his coat, his backpack. 
Transitions are hard for the 5-year-old with autism, explained his mother, Jocelyn Emilo. Visual cues like the story board help Kingston prepare for what comes next. It’s been crucial to reducing his tantrums and anxiety around leaving one activity and moving to the next. Their house is now filled with these story boards, his mom said.
But, she said she never would have realized that her child learns best this way without the clinical support of the board certified behavior analyst he sees.
Kingston attends an Applied Behavior Analysis, or ABA, center called Bounce. The Essex program looks like a preschool, but it’s a clinical space where he and 46 other students receive personalized ABA treatment designed to reduce their problem behaviors and increase their skills — things like articulating their needs and feelings, potty-training and putting on clothes. Bounce is one of 20 ABA providers in Vermont who receive Medicaid — nearly half of those are other clinics. 
But, proposed changes to Vermont Medicaid billing rules have made several ABA providers across the state fearful about their ability to continue doing this work. 
On Nov. 10, the Department of Vermont Health Access, which administers the state’s Medicaid program, alerted ABA providers that starting on Jan. 1, 2026, the department intends to implement a series of changes. Of those, one proposal that would prevent billing for two different providers’ concurrent services has providers and parents reeling. A public comment period on the proposed changes is open until Dec. 25.

The department hopes that implementing these changes will root out excess payments. Alex McCracken, communication director at the Department of Vermont Health Access, said the concurrent billing essentially duplicates payments. 
Those who administer the clinic-based care say the concurrent billing is necessary to pay two different specialists for their work providing two different services, and they say the changes could be an existential threat.
Billing and ABA explained
State law requires private and Medicaid insurance plans to cover medically necessary, evidence-based treatment of autism spectrum disorders — including applied behavioral analysis — for children from birth until they are 21 years old. Young people can receive this treatment at home, in public schools, remotely or in a center like Bounce. 
ABA centers like Bounce operate by pairing a child, like Kingston, one-on-one with a behavior technician, someone who stays with them throughout the day going through lessons, implementing a clinical plan and noting how the child responds and progresses. 
Typically, a board certified behavior analyst assesses a child and then designs a specific protocol for them to gain skills while reducing distressing behavior. For instance, a child with autism may hit their head because they know that doing so will elicit a response and attention from their caregiver. A provider can work with them on communication skills so that they can replace the hitting while still expressing what they need.
Kingston, for example, worked on his ability to adapt to transitions throughout the day.
But the person who designs the protocol is different from the one who implements it day to day. The board certified behavior analyst, or BCBA, needs at least a master’s level training for certification, and in Vermont, a BCBA needs a license to practice. They are the ones writing and guiding care decisions. They have many patients under their care. 
The behavior technician (also called a BT) works one-on-one with the child to practice the skills and lessons outlined in the BCBA’s plan, and this provider does not need a license, formal certification or a bachelor’s degree.
Elaina Hanson, the clinical director of Bounce, explained that for the therapy to work, the two roles cannot be separated.

“We can’t function this way. There’s no world where this makes sense,” she said of the proposed billing changes. 
She likened it to seeing both a hygienist and a dentist: The dentist gives treatment directives and outlines a plan for the patient, even though the hygienist spends the most time with the patient while they’re in the office. Both providers get paid.
She’s not sure how Bounce would be able to sustain itself under the new Medicaid rules. Right now, her clinic is able to submit separate claims for the behavior technician’s implementation and the BCBA’s guidance of a child’s therapy plan. 
She suspects that when, or if, the Medicaid changes go into effect, the BCBA will not be reimbursed for the hours they spend with a child. At Bounce, a BCBA spends about seven hours a week assessing and observing each individual child. 
Hanson estimates that not being able to bill for these services for Bounce’s Medicaid patients, like Kingston Emilo, would result in a 20% loss of revenue.
“Medicaid is the backbone of this whole system, not just for us, but for every company. The vast majority of clients are Medicaid beneficiaries, and so without them, everything kind of crumbles,” she said. “It’s the most vulnerable population that would get the brunt of this and with nowhere else to go, because everybody is in the same situation.” 
However, the Department of Vermont Health Access maintains that the change isn’t meant to alter service or availability for Medicaid beneficiaries.
McCracken, the director of communications for the department, said the way that Medicaid currently bills for a BCBA “inherently includes supervision” of the behavior therapist’s implementation. 
The way that BCBA’s bill for their time with a patient should already account for that fact that it’s two-on-one time — and should include the fact that the behavior therapist is with them, she said. The Medicaid billing code for a BCBA’s care stipulates that it “may include simultaneous direction of technician, face-to-face with one patient.” The way Medicaid sees it, separately billing for both the BCBA’s care and the behavior technician’s care would, essentially, be redundant, McCracken said. 
Providers still can bill for the behavior therapist as well as the BCBA — just not at the same time. 
McCracken said the change is meant to ensure that Medicaid pays for the time that its beneficiaries spend receiving care, rather than the time providers spend administering it.
“We’re not actually changing any of the service availability or availability for members. It is just how the reimbursement and billing works for the provider.”

A leak in the house
But providers across the state say that reducing their specialists’ ability to bill will inherently reduce access. 
“I honestly think this is a mistake,” Hanson, at Bounce, said. “I don’t think anybody’s really understanding what it’s going to look like if this happens.”
Cortney and Chris Keene are both BCBAs and run an ABA clinic in White River Junction. They employ four other BCBAs, one assistant BCBA, and 26 registered behavior technicians — enough so that each one of the 22 children who receive care there will always have an adult with them. Each BCBA has about five patients on their caseload.
As their patients reach their goals and phase out of an ABA center’s care, they can enter traditional education settings. In the coming year, Cortney Keene said, she and her husband are going to have to think critically about whether they can afford to take on new Medicaid patients when their current caseload phases out.
But, they intend to take the financial hit until then.
“We are not planning on dropping them immediately. That is against everything in how we do business, how we believe to treat our families. It is just against all of our ethics,” Cortney Keene said.
The proposed changes have sent the community of ABA providers spiralling. Keene said she is working “literally all night” to get the word out about these changes before the Department of Vermont Health Access’s public comment period closes on Dec. 25. Providers have set up a voter voice petition for people to write to the department. They are writing pleas to legislators and families for help. Kingston’s mom, Jocelyn, has set up her own Change.org petition.
“One of the biggest problems we have is that this happened in silence,” Chris Keene said. He was especially surprised because he felt like ABA centers and Vermont Medicaid have historically had a strong, collaborative relationship. When the department proposed these changes, Keene felt like they came out of nowhere. 
The department is, in part, trying to keep up with federal oversight of Vermont Medicaid. Under President Donald Trump, the executive branch and Congress have particularly focused on “waste, fraud, and abuse” in Medicaid. 
“In order to ensure that we’re safeguarding the ABA benefit, we want to be extra sure that we’re compliant with all federal regulations, because there has been this increased scrutiny nationwide,” McCracken said. She hopes that a “proactive” change can protect the program from facing more tangible threats from the federal government.
“Ultimately, these are changes we have to make, and we will be there to support providers through the process, but we don’t believe these will have a great impact on the services that members are able to access,” she said.
Chris Keene said he thinks rooting out abuse is like dealing with leaky pipes.
“Instead of going to pinpoint and target where the leaks are, this is bulldozing the house. Sure, you’re gonna wipe out waste, fraud and abuse, but you’re actually gonna wipe out your entire support structure and set it back for years,” he said, adding that ABA providers, like him and his wife, are the ones who could help find the leaks and better protect the system.  
Keene and his wife both worried that removing eligibility for concurrent billing will actually open the door for abuse, since it prevents the master’s-level providers from directing the care that the behavior technicians implement.
“If there’s not a qualified health professional overseeing something like that, you run the risk of poor implementation of programming that’s not being run as written. That could harm a child,” Cortney Keene said. 
It’s something she worries about when serving one of the most vulnerable patient bases in the state. 
“Almost all of our kids have failed somewhere else first, and that’s why they land with ABA. They’re kicked out of daycare. They’re kicked out of childcare. Parents pull them out of school,” she said. “One of the really critical aspects is it works when nothing else works.”

Oct. 22. | Photo by Katherine Dailey/Michigan Advance.A months-long court case over a homeless encampment on the north side of Lansing has reached its resolution as the city agreed to house the encampment’s residents in the Causeway Bay Lansing Hotel for at least six weeks. 
Lawyers for the city said in a court hearing on Wednesday that the hotel rooms are available as soon as residents want to take advantage of them, and that the city would provide transportation to the hotel on at least one day early next week. 
Any individuals remaining on the property as of Dec. 23 will be considered trespassers and will be removed by the city, the order states. After that point, the property owners — the defendants in the case — have been instructed to secure the property and clean up residual trash or debris. 
Following the six-week window at the hotel — which could be extended if city budgets allow, depending on how many people choose to reside there — more permanent solutions are expected to be offered, as well as social services like job assistance and aid with getting proper IDs and medical treatment.  SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Judge Rosemarie Aquilina, who has presided over the case since it was first filed in May, celebrated the city’s action. In November, she extended an order that would have required the area to be cleared by mid-November in order to ensure that those living in the encampment had a safe place to go. 
“I don’t want you removed and discarded, because you are all valuable human beings who have fallen on hard times,” she said, a sentiment that she has repeated throughout hearings on this case. “You will be together at the Causeway. You’ll still have connection. You can still reach out to each other, but in this way, you’ll be safe. It is unconstitutional, as far as I’m concerned, and inhumane, to leave you out in the cold.”
Aquilina also reiterated that, though this order closed the case, she was retaining jurisdiction and would help resolve any future issues. 
“If there’s a problem, on either side, or any of you want to bring it to me, I’m still here,” Aquilina said. “I need you to be safe, warm, happy and together. Everybody worked really hard to make sure you can stay together. Your animals can be with you, and you can bring your belongings on the buses.”

Every banner celebrates the 16 overall A grades that schools in the rural eastern Oklahoma district have received since 2013 on state report cards. A fresh one printed in 2025 signifies Warner’s high school and K-8 school were again among the top 5% highest-performing public schools in the state.
The A grades, though a heavy focus in the 800-student district, aren’t the point, Warner Superintendent David Vinson said. They’re a byproduct of students’ and teachers’ hard work. And if Warner can do it, he said, any district can.
“You have to make sure your students understand the why,” Vinson said. “It’s about their education. It’s about bettering their lives. It’s not about getting an A on the report card or about getting high marks as a school district. That’s a result or a fallout of them being high achievers individually.”
Public schools across Oklahoma are now implementing strategies Warner has been employing for years — a cellphone ban throughout the school day, frequent benchmark testing and tracking of students’ individual scores. The district changed its culture and policies more than a decade ago after receiving disappointing results on state report cards.

The town of Warner, home to 1,500 residents and Connors State College, doesn’t have a wealth of industry to keep its school district flush with local tax revenue, Vinson said. State funding and community support for bond issues fill in the gap.
About 60% of Warner students come from households at or near the federal poverty line, state records show. Many district students — 42% of whom are Native American, 31% white and 20% two or more races — have parents who work in farming and ranching in the area or drive 20 minutes north to Muskogee for industry jobs, Vinson said.
Not that he particularly pays attention to demographics. Those details, Vinson said, “tend to be used as excuses.”
High academic expectations and strict discipline are core to the district’s success, he said. Principals are quick to handle behavioral issues, leaving teachers free to teach and students better able to learn without disruptions.
The principal’s office is not a “revolving door,” he said. Any student sent in must leave with a consequence.
“I think education in general across the board has lost sight of that mentality, has lost sight of that philosophy,” Vinson said. “And that’s why you have schools that are in chaos, and you have entire schools scoring 0% proficient on assessments because the school has become so chaotic that teachers can’t teach and kids can’t learn. And there are just as smart of kids in those schools as there are in my school. They’re just not being afforded that opportunity to learn like our kids are.”
Small behavioral problems are addressed consistently, and big incidents are punished “severely,” he said. 
In Warner, that includes the rare use of corporal punishment, a method of discipline that more than 100 Oklahoma districts still permit. Simply having it on the table as an option, Vinson said, usually is enough to discourage most students from bad behavior.
While administrators handle discipline, teachers are expected to maximize every minute of their class time, a concept known in Warner as “bell-to-bell teaching.” That means no movies and no downtime, said Charla Jackson, the district’s curriculum director and elementary counselor.

Middle and high school students are discouraged from mingling in the hallways during passing periods. Instead they’re expected to hustle to their lockers and then to their next class, where a bellringer assignment is usually waiting. They’re expected to read a book if they finish their classwork early.
Literacy is a major emphasis in Warner, Jackson said. Several Warner Elementary teachers have completed in-depth training on the science of reading, and the school provides reading interventionists and tutoring for students who need extra help.
“They are the experts,” Jackson said of Warner’s teachers. “They are the ones making the difference. We just try to support them and allow them to do their job. So, that’s first and foremost.”
High morale keeps teacher turnover low, Jackson said. Class sizes, though increasing with Warner’s enrollment growth, max out at about 24 students per classroom.
But, Warner isn’t immune from the teacher shortage impacting public schools across Oklahoma.
About half of the teachers at Warner High School entered the classroom through non-traditional means, like adjunct teaching and alternative or emergency certification, Vinson said. The district tries to support those educators with training, pre-written curriculum plans and co-teaching hours with a veteran teacher.
Having fewer classroom disruptions, too, “just makes everybody a better teacher,” he said.

Several district teachers told Oklahoma Voice that behavioral issues are rarely a problem in their classrooms, but when they do occur, school administrators readily step in.
When asked what sets Warner apart, kindergarten teacher Lisa Lee pointed to elementary Principal Alan Gordon’s desk. 
“This man right here, he’s great,” Lee said. “The administration here, it just makes you feel good. You know what I mean? Like they’re backing us. They believe in us. They push us, and that makes a huge difference.”
Fourth-grade math teacher Pam White said she was ready to quit teaching before she came to Warner Elementary five years ago. White, 65, is eligible to retire but has chosen not to “because I love this school so much.”
She said the supportive administration has been “huge.”
“They’re in our classrooms,” she said. “They’ll take care of problems immediately.”
During a visit to White’s classroom, students in her afternoon math class were equally enthusiastic about their school, complimenting the quality of their teachers, school staff and principal.

But, Warner didn’t always have this culture of success. The turning point was 2012. That year, the district scored straight C’s on state report cards.
Vinson, then in his first year as superintendent, sent an email to Warner families to inform them “we are not pleased with the overall grade on these report cards for our schools.” The district’s administrators and teachers were already implementing changes, he wrote in the email. He still keeps a copy.
That’s when Warner adopted a more structured and disciplined culture, banned cellphones, started adhering to bell-to-bell teaching and aimed to have 90% of students make a proficient score on state tests. 
The following year, the district met or exceeded the statewide average on nearly every state exam.
That trajectory continued over the following decade, despite state test scoring becoming more rigorous in 2017 and COVID-19 interrupting schooling in 2020. In 2025, Warner students scored above the state average in every tested grade level, the district’s report card shows.
Families in the area have taken notice. While the town of Warner has experienced little population change, its school district has grown from 600 students at the start of the turnaround to more than 800 today. Student transfers are a major source of the spike.  
“I think a big thing is we established a culture here where kids want to succeed,” middle and high school counselor Misty Durrett said. “It’s something they take pride in.
“They know our ranking. They know where we stand. They want to maintain that.”

It’s not all structure and discipline, Vinson said. School still needs to be fun.
That’s why Warner has expanded extracurricular activities, electives and class options available to students. It’s added a competition choir, an art program, boys and girls wrestling, and a high school construction class, where students are building a house that should be ready to sell this spring.

School spirit events, like Homecoming, consume entire school days. With the winter holidays approaching, the interior of every Warner school is decorated for Christmas with lights, trees and door decals.
“You have to create those opportunities for kids to enjoy school,” Vinson said. “It can’t be structure, discipline, learning, structure, discipline, learning 170 days a year.”

(Photo by Leslie Bonilla Muñiz/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Indiana’s top legislative leaders on Thursday sketched out a restrained agenda — including tweaks to a contentious property tax law — ahead of an unusually short Statehouse session that is also expected to feature movement on health care, child care and utilities.
The Indiana General Assembly is scheduled to reconvene Jan. 5 for a breakneck eight-week session.
Lawmakers can meet until mid-March during a non-budget year, but plan to adjourn early to offset the two weeks they spent this month on a failed partisan redistricting proposal.
“We’ve adjusted the calendar,” House Speaker Todd Huston, R-Fishers, said. “We will finish before the end of February … and people are going to have early March off to watch basketball.”
Gov. Braun touts first-year wins amid redistricting fallout

He and other key lawmakers spoke Thursday at the annual Dentons Legislative Conference, held at the Indiana Convention Center in downtown Indianapolis.
The compressed schedule will present “the No. 1 limiting factor this session,” said Sen. Mike Crider, R-Greenfield. Crider, a Senate committee chair, said the panels may only have time for one hearing each.
Bills that don’t get committee votes won’t advance further in the legislative process.
Crider appeared in place of the Senate’s absent GOP leader, President Pro Tempore Rodric Bray.
The Martinsville senator has faced heavy criticism from fellow Republicans over the maps’ defeat.
Bray “had a longstanding in-district commitment that was on his calendar before he was even invited to Denton’s, so he wasn’t able to participate this year,” spokeswoman Molly Swigart said.
House Minority Leader Phil GiaQuinta, D-Fort Wayne, encouraged lawmakers to be “very careful” crafting their bills amid the time pressures.
“I felt like Senate Enrolled Act 1 was done very quickly … and we’re seeing that there are problems with that,” he told reporters, referring to a behemoth local government finance law approved in April.

“I do think that if you rush through legislation, you end up making some harmful mistakes, and so we’ve got to be very careful about that,” GiaQuinta added.
Edits are expected on the local government finance law, which offers Hoosiers property tax relief while expanding income taxing potential. But schools, libraries and other units are still set to lose out on millions of dollars they would have otherwise collected.
Some communities “are just concerned about how they’re going to make that difference up,” said Sen. Travis Holdman, the Senate’s tax policy head. “We need some time to talk about that.”
“I’ve been a proponent of pushing some of these dates out a little further on the timeline, just to give us some more time to figure some things out,” added Holdman, R-Markle.
He and others are also “looking really hard” at the amounts that could be gained via local income tax.
Controlling costs
Social safety net scrutiny could continue, despite a rosier revenue forecast unveiled Thursday.
This year’s Senate Bill 1 — the number reserved for the majority caucus’ top priority — “will look at aligning Indiana statutes with what passed at the federal level,” Crider said, including changes to work requirements for Medicaid and the anti-hunger Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program.
Indiana enrollment in Medicaid, the low-income health care program, has dropped by about 300,000 people throughout the year, totaling 1.7 million in November, according to the forecast.
That hasn’t halted spending worries.
“We have people in the program that need to be off … We couldn’t take folks off the program during the Covid years,” Holdman said. “I think we’ll get there. But at the current rate, it’s just not sustainable.”
Indiana already conducted a year-long “unwinding” process post-COVID.
Huston, the House’s GOP leader, predicted an otherwise “quieter” 2026 session for health care.
“We’ve done a lot. I think this session we probably need to let some stuff bake,” he said. “… Let’s see how it works and get some of the data back that we’ve requested.”

But the 2027 session “will be all about health care,” as the General Assembly grapples with federal changes that shift Medicaid costs onto states.
During a lunchtime fireside chat, Indiana Gov. Mike Braun reiterated that cutting health care costs for patients is his top priority, but didn’t offer specific policy proposals. He didn’t take reporter questions.
Legislation to support hard-hit child care providers and parents is also expected.
Rep. Dave Heine, R-Fort Wayne, discussed plans to use the education scholarship model on child care.
“What we’re going to do is establish a public-private partnership, and we’re going to use the same format, the same structure,” he said. People or groups would give money to a scholarship granting organization and specify that it be used to support those who can’t afford child care.
The state closed enrollment in the Child Care Development Fund voucher program a year ago and won’t reopen to other low-income children until at least the end of 2026. A waitlist is growing.
Providers say the waitlist has crushed enrollment — particularly in infant and toddler rooms, since would-be voucher-holders weren’t yet born when the waitlist was implemented — while lower state reimbursement rates don’t cover costs for kids who do have vouchers.

Low-income parents often can’t access vouchers, while full-price-payers are still seeing providers close.
“I think we have a child care crisis right now. I mean, I’ve seen these centers closing,” said GiaQuinta, the House’s Democratic leader.
He and Senate Minority Leader Shelli Yoder, D-Bloomington, indicated their caucuses will also file child care affordability bills.
Widespread outcry over rising utility bills is expected to prompt action, too.
House Republicans will consider performance-based ratemaking, while their Democratic counterparts seek to eliminate the 7% sales tax on utility service.
In the Senate, Yoder’s caucus wants to bar utilities from charging ratepayers for lobbying, litigation and more, and ban summertime shutoffs to low-income customers.
Lawmakers throughout the conference expressed excitement about the Chicago Bears’ interest in northwest Indiana, but were noncommittal on the state’s role in luring the franchise.

Claims that wolves have rescued Yellowstone National Park's aspen trees through a ""trophic cascade"" oversimplify a complex story.
The post Have wolves saved Yellowstone’s aspens? appeared first on WyoFile .","This story was originally published by Mountain Journal.
Around Crystal Creek, where the road bridges the Lamar River at the fringe of Yellowstone National Park’s Lamar Valley, a grove of aspens has new life. In 1997, the first year scientists began systematically measuring the park’s aspen population, the stand consisted of towering, century-old trees with no fresh growth in the understory.
Today, the scene is dramatically different. A thicket of young aspens now blankets the ground. Many of the saplings are already taller than the researchers who study them. The grove is not only denser, but its footprint has expanded.
Crystal Creek has become synonymous with the ecological benefits of wolf restoration. It’s home to one of the pens where wolves were kept during their 1995 reintroduction, and it’s also a hotspot where aspen growth has surged over the past three decades. 
Quaking aspens grow in colonies, sending up genetically identical shoots from a shared root system. In much of the 1900s, massive elk herds devoured virtually every new aspen shoot that broke through the soil, stifling the growth of new trees.
But shortly after the ‘95 wolf reintroduction, the elk population fell and some aspen sprouts slipped past the hungry herbivores. While a flood of news articles, Facebook posts and YouTube videos have attributed the change to wolves, scientific evidence for this conclusion is limited. And some scientists believe that aspen regrowth in the park has been exaggerated.

Before wolf restoration
The idea that canines protect Yellowstone’s aspens from herbivores dates back at least a century. In the late 1800s and early 1900s, rangers in the park shot hundreds of wolves, bears, cougars and coyotes in a bid to boost deer and elk numbers. In 1926, the same year park rangers wiped out Yellowstone’s last wolf pack, biologist Edward Warren was already warning that the carnivore purge was harming the park’s aspen groves.
“There has doubtless been a great increase in the number of beaver in the Yellowstone Park of late years,” he wrote in his 222-page report. “When over two hundred coyotes are killed in a single season, as in 1922, the animals which formed part of their food are bound to profit by it and to increase in numbers. The result has been what is probably an unnatural expansion of the beaver population.”
Warren went on to describe what zoologist Robert Paine would 54 years later call the “trophic cascade.” The expanded beaver population had chomped down nearly all of the large aspen trees near the streams and ponds of Tower-Roosevelt. While thickets of young sprouts remained, most trees near beaver dams with a trunk greater than two inches had become food or building material.

By 1955, both beavers and aspens had disappeared from the ponds and creeks of Tower-Roosevelt. Beavers had chewed down the old trees, while the soaring elk population had consumed the young ones, suggested William Barmore, a park biologist who studied the park’s elk herds. Aspens continued to survive beyond the beavers’ reach, but these groves, which Barmore described in a 1965 research report, looked very different from the ones Warren photographed.
“In most stands the only aspen age classes present were decadent, overmature trees and root sprouts from one to a few years old that were browsed off to a height of one or two feet each winter,” Barmore wrote. He noted that hungry elk chomped down on aspen shoots each winter when grass was scarce, preventing any sprouts from becoming mature trees. 
An individual aspen seldom lives more than 200 years. Without successful regeneration, entire stands disappeared as the old trees died.
Barmore believed that elk were responsible. “Sometime after 1880 the relative number of elk utilizing park ranges, particularly during the winter, began to increase,” he wrote, listing hunting and development north of the park, as well as “predator destruction,” as possible causes. “Whether the increased use of park winter ranges resulted from an actual drastic increase in the herd or from a bottling up of an abnormally large number of animals on previously marginal winter range is not known,” he added.
Decades of heavy elk browsing left a lasting impact. Studies have found that between 1921 and 1999, new aspen trees grew only on scree slopes and among fallen trees that physically blocked elk access.

A trophic cascade
At the dawn of the 21st century, the situation began to change. The winter elk population in northern Yellowstone fell from a record high of 17,000 in 1995 to less than 2,000 by 2012. Multiple studies conducted in the early 2000s showed that some aspen sprouts were escaping elk browsing and growing tall.
A study published in July 2025 summarized more than two decades of data, finding that the number of young trees taller than six feet increased more than tenfold between 1998 and 2021. While new aspen trees were virtually absent from northern Yellowstone in 1998, the study found, 43% of stands contained them by 2021.
The surge in new growth seemed to parallel the ‘95 wolf reintroduction, and media coverage highlighted the connection. “Since wolves’ return, Yellowstone’s aspens are recovering,” read one Washington Post headline in August 2025. “Aspen trees are returning in Yellowstone, thanks to wolves,” read a July 2025 headline from the aptly-named Aspen Public Radio in Aspen, Colorado.
Daniel MacNulty, an ecologist at Utah State University, took issue with these conclusions. In a recent critique, he highlighted a small number of exceptional stands that drove the large increase in trees described in the study, while most aspens showed little change over the same period.
Luke Painter, the Oregon State University ecologist behind the study, agreed that the headlines simplified the data. “There are significant changes, and there are beginnings of recovery, but it’s patchy and it isn’t happening everywhere,” Painter told Mountain Journal. “But a trophic cascade does not have to be everywhere to be significant.” 
In a recent master’s thesis from MacNulty’s Utah State lab, scientists argue that the surge in young trees might be less impactful than previously stated. They used aerial photos to measure the physical area covered by 73 aspen stands on the Northern Range in 1954, 1991 and 2020. The results, which have not been previously reported by any media outlet, show that most aspen stands have continued shrinking since wolf reintroduction.
Maybe there’s some good regeneration in the heart of the stand. But the rate of contraction actually increased after wolves were introduced.Nicholas Bergeron, researcher, utah state university
Between 1954 and 1991, when elk populations in Yellowstone reached record highs, the average size of the 73 stands studied dropped 54%. Aspen groves then shrank another 59% between 1991 and 2020, despite wolf reintroduction in 1995. Only seven of the 73 stands grew larger after 1991, and Crystal Creek was one of them.
It remains to be seen whether enough young aspens are surviving to reverse the decades-long decline. “Maybe there’s some good regeneration in the heart of the stand,” said Nicholas Bergeron, author of the thesis. “But the rate of contraction actually increased after wolves were introduced.”
Painter believes aspens appear to be declining because many aspens on the Northern Range are near the end of their lives. “The older trees have been dying off at an accelerated rate since the 1990s,” Painter said in response to the thesis. “Of course, it looks like the stands are shrinking. Some of them have lost all their large trees.”
Even where aspens are making a comeback, scientists debate the role that wolves have played.
Tying it to wolves
The grasslands and sagebrush steppe of Yellowstone’s Northern Range support the park’s largest elk herd. Each winter, when snow piles up in the high country, thousands of elk descend into the valleys of northern Yellowstone and adjacent lands. The herd has shrunk dramatically over the past three decades: from 17,000 in 1995 to 6,673 in 2022, according to some of the most recent data from the Park Service
“Elk have declined a lot since wolves were reintroduced, but it’s not clear that that’s due to wolves,” said Chris Wilmers, an ecologist at the University of California, Santa Cruz and the author of another recent study that assessed the impacts of large carnivore recovery across North America. “Other predators have been recovering, there’s been a lot of human hunting of elk, there’s a growing bison population that’s competing substantially with elk, and outside the park, ranchers are increasingly tolerant of elk feeding in their irrigated pastures, so they have less of a need to migrate into the park in the first place.”
“Most ecologists suspect that wolves and other predators have something to do with the decline of elk,” Wilmers continued. “But how much can be attributed to wolves, how much can be attributed to predators in general, how much is attributed to those other causes hasn’t been worked out yet.”

Cougars, hunted aggressively within the park in the early 1900s, have increased in numbers since the 1980s. As well, the number of grizzly bears in Greater Yellowstone spiked from 136 in 1975 to about 1,030 in 2024 due to federal protections. Between 1998 and 2004, cougars probably killed more Northern Range elk than wolves, and grizzly bears are the main predators of elk calves, potentially contributing to their lower numbers.
“Elk population dynamics are extraordinarily complex and you really can’t pin elk numbers to any one thing,” said wildlife biologist Doug Smith, who led the park’s wolf program from 1995 until his retirement in 2022. He said that the reduced elk population boils down to three factors: carnivores, people and climate.
Human hunting, which killed more elk than wolves between 1995 and 2004, has declined, allowing more elk to survive outside the park in winter, said Smith, adding that warming winters are also luring elk into snow-free valleys north of Yellowstone. “Forty years ago, 80% of the elk herd wintered inside the park,” he said. “Now, 80 to 90% winter outside the park.” 
Decades of research shows that elk generally eat aspens in winter when other foods are scarce.

Smith emphasizes that predators have been a fundamental driver of the change in elk numbers and distribution, and that wolves are one of the park’s most important predators.
The popular video, How Wolves Change Rivers, says that fear of wolves “radically” changed elk behavior by making them avoid aspen thickets and steep riverbanks where they might become an easy meal. Some studies from the 2000s supported that conclusion, but more recent research has cast doubt on this idea.
A 2024 study compared the likelihood that an aspen would be eaten by elk to where wolves kill elk, where wolves spend most of their time, and eight other variables that could show whether an area was unsafe for elk. The results showed little correlation between aspen browsing and the risk of wolf predation. 
“If elk are avoiding wolves at those risky sites, they’re going back at a different time of day and still eating the aspens,” said study lead author Elaine Brice, a researcher at Cornell and a former PhD student in MacNulty’s lab. “It’s not at a big enough timescale to push them off of aspen in a way that will be meaningful for aspen growth.”
Brice’s analysis identified the single best predictor of aspen browsing: the number of elk in a certain place at a certain time. Wolves may indirectly protect aspens by suppressing elk populations, but not by scaring them away from specific patches, she said.

Brice, who has also published research suggesting that the rate of aspen recovery has been exaggerated, said aspen recovery could take many decades. In addition, wildfire stimulates aspen growth, and many stands might grow back stronger after the next major fire resets the forest.
Aspen recovery might also be limited by record-high bison populations that trample and eat aspen sprouts in some areas, according to Painter.
MacNulty says the future of aspens in northern Yellowstone is far from certain. Research modeling the climate of Yellowstone indicates that most of the Northern Range might be too hot and dry for quaking aspens by the year 2100.
Regardless of what the future holds for the iconic aspen trees, a number of scientists believe the story has stepped over the data. “It’s undeniable that there has been some benefit to wolf reintroduction,” Bergeron said. “But the narrative that wolves are a kind of silver bullet that saved the aspen in Northern Yellowstone is oversimplified.”

Why sprinkle your cookies when you could paint them? 
The post Cookie canvas: How to add more color to your holiday treats appeared first on WyoFile .","Roll out that dough and get your royal icing ready because it’s sugar cookie decorating time. 
But instead of covering your cookies — and your kitchen counters — with sprinkles and colorful sanding sugars, try watercolor painting them.
“It’s really easy,” Karen Vaughan said. “It’s a very simple crowd pleaser.” 
Vaughan, a former University of Wyoming soil scientist, now runs her own business — The Art of Soil — making watercolor paints with pigments sourced from Wyoming soils. 
“I’m always thinking about ways to share watercolor painting,” she said, whereas her 11-year-old daughter loves to bake. “So she’s always trying to be in the kitchen, and I am always painting.” 
The watercolor sugar cookie “was a way to fuse two things we both love to do,” Vaughan said. 
Bake your favorite sugar cookie recipe, then frost them with royal icing — homemade or store-bought. Leave the frosted cookies overnight to ensure they’re hard before painting. 
Dilute gel food coloring with clear extract — such as almond, vanilla or mint — to make the paints. A dinner plate works as a palette to mix colors.
Then, with a clean watercolor brush, turn that cookie canvas into a masterpiece.

“If you have different-sized paint brushes, you can do different effects on the cookies,” Vaughan suggests. “You could have a flat brush or a round brush or tiny detail brush, but anything works, whatever you’ve got.”
Paint a holiday scene or go abstract, Vaughan encouraged. “It’s something really fun you can do with anyone of any ability.”

Wyoming cannot survive on nostalgia, cuts and culture wars, writes columnist Christy Mathes.
The post When it comes to a community, ‘just say no’ doesn’t work appeared first on WyoFile .","I grew up in Gillette, inside a boomtown rhythm that I did not realize was unusual.
We had 24-hour grocery stores, rec sports for every kid and computer labs before most towns even knew what to do with them. Our public library felt like a small university. True, half the town had dirt roads and buildings that looked temporary, but beneath that rough exterior was a community that believed in purposeful growth, working hard, playing harder. Gillette invested like hell in kids and possibility.

Opinion

We said yes a lot back then. Yes to teams. Yes to libraries. Yes to new ideas. Yes to the future. I grew up thinking that was normal.
Then I went to college out of state.
The university library was a joke compared to the one I had grown up with. Businesses closed by early evening. Recreation meant driving an hour and hoping someone unlocked a gym with aging equipment. Things I had taken for granted growing up were luxuries elsewhere.
Looking back now, maybe we were a little too prone to saying yes. But we were building something. We believed our kids deserved more than survival. We believed a frontier town could grow into something special.
And now, decades later, I am watching that instinct disappear.
Not all at once. Just quietly. In meetings. In headlines. In the tightening of budgets and the narrowing of imagination. The same place that once said yes to growth now flinches at it. The same state that once reached for the future now argues that reaching is dangerous.
What is harder to accept is that many of the loudest voices weren’t here for the building. They didn’t watch dirt roads turn into neighborhoods or grow up inside the libraries and programs a community fought to create. They inherited what we built and mistook it for a hive: something that simply existed, something that would always produce on its own.
But the deepest damage comes not from outsiders who never loved this place, but from those who helped build it and still choose to stand beside those letting Gillette backslide.

They prospered because the community said yes to growth. They made their fortunes inside that dream. And from the comfort of those earned privileges, they now shout no. From porches paid for by boomtown labor and collective sacrifice, they use their clout not to extend opportunity, but to choke it. Not to carry the dream forward, but to freeze the state at the exact moment that best preserves their comfort.
They are willing to let the community age with them. And if it withers afterward, that is someone else’s problem.
This is a moment of crisis, a true hinge point. The future is asking which way we will turn, and instead of reaching for it, Wyoming has fallen in love with saying no.
No to solar. No to wind. No to carbon capture. No to advanced nuclear manufacturing. No to modern gaming revenue. No to technology infrastructure. No to economic diversification.
Project by project. Bill by bill. Meeting after meeting. That pattern is the same.
No.
Wrapped in words like “freedom” and “sovereignty,” this reflexive rejection has become a political identity. It is not strategy. It is not stewardship. It is performance. And it is putting Wyoming on a slow starvation diet.
We are watching a faction of leadership oppose diversification while simultaneously voting to cut the very systems that keep rural Wyoming alive. They choke off new revenue, then act shocked when budgets bleed. They wave away the math, then punish schools, infrastructure and local services for the consequences.
This isn’t conservatism. It’s demolition with better branding.
The record shows it plainly. We blocked renewable expansion with moratorium attempts. We attacked carbon capture the moment it became viable. We chased off nuclear manufacturing jobs with theatrics, and we killed modern gaming revenue because acknowledging it felt uncomfortable. Then those same lawmakers turned around and demanded budget cuts and called it responsibility.
That isn’t fiscal discipline. That’s policy arson followed by a speech on fire safety.
And if anyone doubts how unserious this has become, look at the bill literally nicknamed “Make Carbon Dioxide Great Again.” A proposal to declare CO2 a “beneficial substance,” repeal low-carbon standards, and weaken carbon capture; not because science changed, but because politics wanted a performance. All while the state simultaneously markets itself as a carbon-negative innovation hub.

You cannot recruit investors with one hand while lighting the contract on fire with the other.
This same reflex played out locally this year with the proposed CAM-PLEX expansion in Campbell County. A shovel-ready economic engine, livestock shows, youth sports, concerts, expos, visitors filling hotels and restaurants were dismissed not with analysis but with suspicion and fear of change. Another door half-closed. Once again, no.
This is what cultural self-sabotage looks like. We claim to want thriving communities, but recoil the moment thriving requires traffic, investment, or growth.
Coal revenue is down. Lease bonus revenue has cratered. Mineral backfill shrinks every year. And here is the truth that no culture war can erase:
You cannot cut your way to prosperity.
You cannot posture your way to stability.
And you cannot “no” your way into a functioning 21st-century economy.
We should say no to magical thinking. No to pretending yesterday’s revenue model is coming back. No to performing ideology instead of governing.
We should say no to the lie that Wyoming can survive on nostalgia alone. Pride in our past is not a budget plan. Rugged individualism does not pave highways. Culture wars do not staff hospitals.
We do not need to “just say no” to our future.
We need to say no to the people who think governance is theater and economic decline is an acceptable price for ideology.
Say no to magical thinking. Say no to breaking the state just to prove a point.
And then, with everything we have left, say no to killing Wyoming economically.
Because Wyoming is not dying on its own.
It is being starved by design.

Steve Daines proposed a bill to address new information the Chinese spy balloon contained American technology. (Provided by the office of Sen. Daines, R-Montana.)Montanans are extremely fortunate and eternally grateful for the visionary move by our highly-lauded former Senator Lee Metcalf, who designated significant Wilderness Areas for present and future generations.  Leaving these lands beyond the reach of development, as quiet refuges for the vast array of fish and wildlife that call them home was truly Metcalf’s greatest gift to the future. 
Knowing full well that extraction and development interests would otherwise degrade them, as they have so many other public lands and waters, he also designated a number of Wilderness Study Areas where development would be prohibited, thus allowing future generations the opportunity to provide full wilderness protection for these parcels. 
Comes now a considerably less visionary Senator in the person of Steve Daines, who is once again introducing legislation to undo Metcalf’s work and open existing Wilderness Study Areas to logging, mining, motorized recreation and the spiderweb of roads bulldozed in to support those polluting and habitat-fragmenting uses of public lands.
This is not the first time Daines has tried this despicable move, having failed to even get a hearing on his first two bills or advance his third attempt to the Senate floor.  
Yet, despite his quick reversal on selling off public lands earlier this year, here he is, hacking at the Wilderness Study Areas again despite the vast amount of Montana’s public lands already available for extractive industries and motorized use. 
What’s puzzling is his apparent disregard for long-standing support for wilderness and conservation by poll after poll after poll.  Maybe he spends so much time in D.C. he’s unaware of the fact that Montanans are more than a little alarmed at what’s going on here at home. Namely, that would be the influx of wealthy out-of-state interests that see Montana as ripe for the picking for their nefarious get-rich-quick schemes — while also locking Montanans out of public lands and waters.
Take the Crazy Mountain Ranch, for instance — owned by Boston-based Crossharbor Partners Capital that also own the exclusive Yellowstone Club for mega-wealthy members as well as Big Sky, Spanish Peaks, and Moonlight Basin — all of which have seriously degraded the Gallatin River.  The same Crazy Mountain Ranch that is now being sued by the state for violating the Montana Water Use Act by illegally irrigating its new golf course, oblivious to the law, the state, and the claims of senior water rights holders.
Or maybe Daines might note that runaway and unsustainable development has turned our major river valleys into endless subdivisions that, increasingly, are struggling to provide water for their developments.
Perhaps if he comes “home” for Christmas he might notice our bare mountains, unseasonably warm temperatures bringing rain, not snow, in mid-December in Montana.  Perhaps, if he bothered to think about it, he just might wonder where the water is going to come from to keep our rivers alive and sustain our world-famous trout fisheries this summer — and the recreation economy that now outpaces the extractive industries of logging and mining without leaving Superfund sites behind for future generations to remediate.
That he has been joined by newbies Sen. Tim Sheehy and Rep. Troy Downing seems to indicate all three of them need to spend more time with Montanans than D.C. lobbyists to get their priorities straight.  But they don’t do town halls now, do they?
Given that Daines and Downing will both be up for election next year, and this is Daines’ fourth attempt at undoing Metcalf’s legacy, perhaps it’s time to send them a message for so blatantly disregarding Montanans’ commitment to protect, not develop, what’s left of our state’s wilderness lands.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Daines-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-12-19 06:57:27.384086

Snake River Oil and Gas wants to build a well with a drilling site accessible off of U.S. Highway 95 and NW 16th St. in Fruitland. 
The company filed an application with the state for an integration order for property owners who have not reached agreements with Snake River Oil and Gas to allow for drilling. 
But Fruitland resident Charles Otte and several local residents spoke in opposition to the proposal during a public hearing Wednesday at Fruitland City Hall. 
Otte and others cited potential health, safety and environmental concerns, saying the well would be located a few hundred feet away from residential neighborhoods and other areas frequented by children.
“I have several objections to this, and really they all have to do with the fact that the proposed drilling site is very close to residential areas,” Otte said. “There can be a lot of people that are living very close to there. And I think there’s definitely some risks that are involved with oil and gas, having wells.”
“The spacing unit is very close to many residences in the city of Fruitland and Payette County, and drilling and extraction operations, which have some inherent environmental risks, should not be conducted so close to people’s homes,” Otte added.
 Not all residents have agreed with proposal to build a well near Fruitland neighborhoods

Snake River Oil and Gas has secured lease agreements with the holders of about 61% of the acres of land within the affected geographic spacing unit, according to state records and testimony at Wednesday’s public hearing.

Spacing units are essentially the area that can be drained by one well for development. 
The people who hold about 38% of the acres in the spacing unit have not agreed to oil and gas leases with Snake River Oil and Gas.
Under Idaho state law, applicants such as Snake River Oil and Gas who have secured leases for at least 55% of the acres can apply for an integration order to integrate the uncommitted tracts of land into the spacing order to allow for the drilling of a well.
In October, attorney James Piotrowski filed an objection to Snake River Oil and Gas’ application for the integration order, saying the integration order would violate the rights of land owners who did not agree to leases with the company.
Fruitland City Administrator Stuart Grimes also opposed the proposed integration order.
“Approval of this application force-pooling those remaining properties is going to facilitate a well being drilled just a few hundred feet from hundreds of homes belonging to city of Fruitland and Payette County residents – just over the fence from one of our subdivisions,” said Grimes, who said he was speaking on behalf of the mayor and City Council as well.
“We just have general concerns about the safety and welfare for residents being this close,” Grimes added. 
Wade Moore, who helped secure leases for Snake River Oil and Gas for the project, said Wednesday the royalty fees and bonus payments offered for the project were fair for Idaho.
In most cases, the company offered landowners a one-eighth royalty fee and a bonus of $150 per net acre for signing the lease. A one-eighth royalty fee for oil, gas or natural gas produced, proportional to the owner’s interest in the minimum royalty fee allowed under state law. 
 Decision on Snake River Oil and Gas’s application could come in January

No decisions were made during the evidentiary hearing and public comment period Wednesday. The Idaho Oil and Gas Conservation Commission will accept written public comment on the proposal until Dec. 24. Anyone wishing to comment can send an email to filings@oah.idaho.gov.
Looking forward, a hearing officer from the Idaho Office of Administrative Hearings may issue a recommendation on the proposal by mid-January. The Idaho Department of Lands is expected to issue a final decision on the proposal by Jan. 30.

(Screengrab from Beaman's Senate haring, C-SPAN.) The U.S. Senate confirmed four Trump nominees to the Tennessee Valley Board of Directors Wednesday night but left out Nashville car magnate and political donor Lee Beaman.
Beaman was removed from the nomination process and would have to receive a new nomination to be considered for the post, according to the Sierra Club, an environmental advocacy group that monitors TVA appointments.
Senators voted 53-47 to confirm Mitch Graves, Jeff Hagood, Randall Jones and Arthur Graham. President Donald Trump also nominated Beaman to serve on the board for the federally-owned utility that provides power to seven states in the Southeast, including Tennessee, but his nomination stalled in a committee last week.
The nominations came after Trump removed Biden appointees to the board after taking office, leaving it without enough members for a quorum to hold votes.
“At a time when Americans across the nation are struggling to pay their energy bills, it’s even more important that a utility as unique as TVA be responsible and compassionate to the needs of its ratepayers,” the Sierra Club said in a statement. “We welcome the return of a functional, voting board and are here to work with them to keep power in the public’s hands and protect this beautiful region we call home.”
Car magnate Beaman draws fire during TVA board confirmation hearing

The Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works postponed Beaman’s confirmation vote last week amid questions about two Washington, D.C. rowhouses he owns that are rented to members of Congress through a nonprofit organization run by his pastor, Steve Berger.
Democratic senators also raised questions about Beaman’s connection to U.S. Rep. Andy Ogles, a Columbia Republican targeted by the House Ethics Committee, which found he likely violated campaign finance laws by reporting an inflated personal loan of $320,000 to make his bid for office look stronger in 2022. Beaman was listed as campaign treasurer for four months in 2022 as questions surfaced about Ogles’ fundraising.
Beaman told senators in his initial hearing that he was Ogles’ treasurer for only four months, but in written responses to questions, he said he never agreed to serve in the post while also acknowledging he thought it was only an “honorary” position. He said he asked to be removed from the job after seeing his name on a political ad.
Besides problems with Ogles’ fundraising, Beaman told the committee in written responses he bought two houses totaling 6,500 square feet in D.C. in the name of Crockett Ventures and leased them to the nonprofit organization Ambassador Services International for $1 a year. The group is run by Berger, who accompanied Beaman at his first hearing and has made inflammatory statements about LGBTQ people, saying he wants to beat them to death with a baseball bat.
House Speaker Mike Johnson and Ogles are among the members of Congress believed to be living in the row houses, creating a conflict of interest for Beaman to serve on the TVA board, senators said.
Beaman told senators in written responses that he has no interest or control over the nonprofit organization, nor does he make decisions about who sub-leases from Ambassador Services International.
Yet Democratic senators also raised the issue that Berger could be considered a lobbyist under federal law, creating another conflict of interest for the tenants and Beaman. Berger founded a “discipleship program in Washington, D.C. to educate, equip, and inspire statesmen to live with compassion and confidence during their time in public service,” according to the transcript.  
Beaman, a major Republican political donor, planned to raise $4 million in 2017 when Ogles announced a U.S. Senate bid that never took off. He also served as treasurer for U.S. Rep. Matt Van Epps, who recently took office after winning a special election to replace Mark Green.

A bipartisan Congressional investigation has begun regarding Hegseth's role in ordering U.S. military strikes on small boats in the waters off Venezuela that have killed scores of people, which Hegseth said are intended ""to stop lethal drugs, destroy narco-boats and kill the narco-terrorists who are poisoning the American people.” (Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)Idaho’s U.S. Sen. Jim Risch proclaimed in a Dec. 11 meeting of the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee that the “attacks in the Caribbean are absolutely, totally and 100% legal under U.S. law and international law.” 
Those strikes have produced a body count nearing 100 since Sept. 2. Oregon U.S. Sen. Jeff Merkley effectively debunked Risch’s argument, pointing out that only Congress has the power to declare war under the U.S. Constitution.

Risch incorrectly claimed that the killings were “clearly not a war, but kinetic action,” as though that somehow got around the Constitution. His response makes no sense because the violence of war is always kinetic action. 
There is no need to get into the legal weeds about the legality of Trump’s Caribbean killings because that has been well established in the last three months. Even the Department Of Defense’s new AI chatbox, which Secretary Pete Hegseth proudly announced on Dec. 9, said that an order to kill two survivors of a boat strike would be “an unambiguously illegal order.” 
On Oct. 28, Reuters reported that some U.S. military officials have been required to sign non-disclosure agreements with regard to Trump’s Latin American adventures. That adds an element of guilt awareness to those operations.
Let me give the input of someone who was in the position of pulling the trigger on suspect people on the ground during the Vietnam War. I spent hundreds of hours as an aerial observer flying at about 800 feet in the air in a small two-seat “bird dog” aircraft. I had at my disposal six 8-inch guns (200-pound shells) and six 175 mm guns (165- pound shells) from my heavy artillery battalion. 
Most of my combat missions were over “free fire zones” where everyone was presumed to be an enemy. The war had been approved by Congress in the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution (later found to have been based on false information).
Even though we could fire on practically anyone in the free fire zones, we were prohibited from firing on civilians. I would not have done so anyway. I lived with South Vietnamese soldiers, respected the Vietnamese people and would not have exposed civilians to danger. 
On the other hand, I had no qualms about calling fire upon North Vietnamese Army soldiers because my job was protecting U.S. troops and our South Vietnamese friends.
When you saw people near the edges of the free fire zones, you had to evaluate the circumstances and determine whether or not there were indications of military affiliation. The two kids with a water buffalo on the edge of the free fire zones were definitely not targets. The man driving his donkey cart into the free fire zones was most likely a woodchopper. The three guys on bikes in the middle of the free fire zones were definitely North Vietnamese Army and legitimate targets. 
The other aerial observers that I knew, and the pilots who flew them, acted in a similar manner. We followed the rule of engagement, which included U.S. and international rules of war.
Had I been overhead for any of the Trump/Hegseth strikes, I would not have pulled the trigger — no declared war, no enemy combatants, clearly civilians and no justification for “kinetic action.” The proper course of action would be to call the U.S. Coast Guard to interdict and search the boats, like they have historically done. Last year, the Coast Guard seized 225 metric tons of cocaine. The U.S. would have to destroy a heck of a lot of narco speed boats to equal that tonnage.
These present boat strikes have a feature that was not in existence back in Vietnam days. Then, the aerial observer and pilot were the only people who knew the situation on the ground. We were largely on the honor system in deciding who should live or die. 
Now military personnel up and down the ladder may have eyes on the situation. Not only that, but a video record is being made of each strike. Any person who sees a strike being carried out and does not raise concerns about its legality may be called to account, even years later. 
Keep in mind that both Trump and Hegseth have gleefully announced the strikes and vowed to kill all other alleged “narco-terrorists.” They might be surprised to learn that several victims of the Sept. 2 strike were not drug merchants. 
The U.S. Supreme Court essentially immunized Trump against any kind of charges that could result from the strikes, but Hegseth and the military personnel with eyes-on participation in the strikes could find themselves in legal hot water down the road for these summary executions.
Sen. Risch should study the law and avoid covering up for MAGA lawbreakers.

(Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)With whooping cough cases in West Virginia at a record high this year, a physician said residents should consider getting a booster dose of the Tdap vaccine to protect them and the children around them.
As of this week, cases of whooping cough, or pertussis, had reached 199 — the highest number reported in West Virginia since 2010, according to data from the state Bureau for Public Health. Of those cases, 76 were active as of Dec. 15. 
Last year, West Virginia reported 46 cases of the illness, according to state health officials. 
Gailyn Markham, director of communication for the state Office of Shared Administration, said several factors may have contributed to this year’s surge, including potential mutations of the bacteria that causes pertussis and a natural three- to five-year peak. Nationally, there were six times as many cases reported in 2024 than in 2023, she said. Cases peaked in November 2024 but cases remained elevated this year, she said. 
“We continue to work closely with local health departments, health care providers, and community partners to identify cases quickly, ensure appropriate treatment, and control measures to help reduce the spread of the disease,” Markham said. 
In Kentucky, three unvaccinated infants have reportedly died of the illness this year. 
Dr. Lisa Costello, a pediatrician and associate professor of pediatrics at WVU School of Medicine, said with the increased cases, she’s treated children with the illness for the first time in her career. 
“[Whooping cough] was not something that we saw with that much frequency,” she said. “And certainly with the rise in cases, we are unfortunately seeing more cases, particularly in infants. 
“They’re at higher risk of having more severe symptoms because their airways are small, their immune systems are still developing, and the pertussis or whooping cough can cause really intense coughing fits,” she said. “For infants, sometimes that can even have them stop breathing.”
Symptoms of pertussis start out like a common cold — runny nose and cough, but with whooping cough, the cough persists, Costello said. 
The name whooping cough comes from the sound that children in particular can make when trying to catch their breath during a coughing fit. Children can also throw up after a coughing fit. 
“If you’re having symptoms of a cough described as either of those, getting checked and tested would be important, because immunization is our best way to protect against pertussis,” Costello said. 
Antibiotics are available for those who test positive for the illness and preventative antibiotics are recommended for those in close contact with someone who tests positive. The sooner the person starts on antibiotics, the better, she said. 
Infants and children who get pertussis are at a higher risk of complications like pneumonia, seizures, brain inflammation, dehydration, low oxygen levels and even death. 
“Adults, if they get whooping cough or pertussis, may not have as severe symptoms. However, they could still spread to others who would potentially be impacted more severely, such as infants, pregnant people, immunocompromised people,” Costello said. 
A combination diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus vaccination and boosters are required for students beginning in kindergarten in West Virginia. While the state’s strong school immunization requirements have kept the rates higher for school age children, the state’s pre-school vaccination rates have historically been lower, Costello said. 
“When we’re talking about whooping cough, those who are at most risk are really those infants, so those under one year of age,” she said. “So that would be before school, and for many, even before child care — it just depends upon when you may be going to a child care facility. And certainly those would be areas where there could be increased risk for spread.”
She said it’s important for adults, particularly those who are in contact with people at an increased risk for severe illness, to stay up to date on their vaccines. Adults may not get severe symptoms, but they can pass it on to children who can. 
“My daughter turns 4 in the New Year, and before anyone came to visit her, everybody had to have an updated Tdap [vaccine], because I didn’t want to put her at increased risk,” she said. “And I got vaccinated when I was in my third trimester.”
Pregnant women who get a booster of the vaccine can protect their babies until they’re able to start their vaccination series, she said. 
“I think it’s important for people of all ages to have that discussion with a health care provider about what immunizations it’s important to stay up to date with,” Costello said.

On Saturday, volunteers from Unión Migrante, an immigrant-led civil rights group, responded to a report that federal immigration agents were conducting an arrest inside a gated community in Slidell, with assistance from St. Tammany Fire Protection’s District #1, based in Slidell. TV station WWL aired video from the arrest that showed federal agents in green tactical gear leading construction workers off of a roof, using a ladder from the local fire department.
In an emailed statement shared with Verite News and other media, Lawrence Payne, a Customs and Border Protection spokesperson said Border Patrol agents attempted to arrest “three subjects” on the roof of a construction site using a “makeshift ladder.” The statement said one of the people they were after pushed the ladder, which fell and struck an agent, causing “a minor laceration to his right face” and “breaking his eyeglasses.”
“Several minutes later, agents successfully secured the ladder and climbed to the rooftop, apprehending all three subjects without further incident,” the statement said. “In total, two Honduran nationals, one Mexican national, and one El Salvadorian national were arrested for being illegally present in the United States.”
Also, over the weekend, protesters opposing the operation gathered in Orleans, Jefferson and St. Tammany parishes, including protesters demonstrating in front of a Latin American grocery store in Slidell that drew counter-protesters, WDSU reported.

.In a Thursday press release, the Department of Homeland Security said federal agents had arrested 250 “criminal illegal aliens” in the first eight days of the Louisiana sweeps. However Homeland Security officials said only 23 or less than 10% of the people apprehended have criminal records, according to the Times-Picayune. The offenses range from domestic abuse child endangerment and drug possession to driving while intoxicated and urinating in public.
In that press release, Tricia McLaughlin, a spokesperson for the department, slammed so-called “sanctuary policies” in New Orleans that she said, “have endangered the lives of the citizens and visitors of its beautiful city.”
McLaughlin was likely referring to two separate federally-mandated consent agreements that govern how the New Orleans Police Department and Orleans Parish Sheriff’s Office interact with immigration enforcement agencies.
Last week, Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill sent a letter to NOPD Superintendent Anne Kirkpatrick saying that the department’s policy, which limits collaboration with immigration enforcement agents, “conflict with current state law and also may be interpreted as ‘sanctuary’ policies,” the Louisiana Illuminator reported.
Kirkpatrick responded with a statement saying, “NOPD will continue to follow all state and federal laws while staying focused on public safety and maintaining the trust of our community.”
Despite McLaughlin’s statements on New Orleans, immigration enforcement efforts have appeared more active in areas outside of the city, including Kenner — which has the highest percentage of Hispanic residents in the New Orleans metropolitan area.
Throughout the region, community activists are responding to immigrants’ fears to leave their homes, including for medical emergencies. Verite News public health reporter Halle Parker covered efforts to save a baby’s life after a mother gave birth at home, rather than risk arrest by going to the hospital.
Beyond critical care, groups are providing assistance to community members most impacted by the immigration enforcement operation in the greater New Orleans area.
Meanwhile Border Patrol commander Gregory Bovino, who has been leading enforcement operations around the country, has returned to Chicago — where communities have seen the most heavy-handed approaches, including the use of tear gas against protesters. On Wednesday, WVUE-TV Fox 8 reported that many of the Border Patrol agents that were stationed in Louisiana for “Catahoula Crunch” have temporarily relocated to the greater Chicago area, leaving a slimmer crew to continue operations here.
This week, several outlets, including News Nation, reported that the Department of Homeland Security is shifting its immigration enforcement approach toward focusing on migrants with serious criminal records and away from large-scale raids at locations such as home improvement stores and away from arrests of immigrants who have been in the United States for more than a decade.
“We have always been going after the worst of the worst first. There are no operational changes to announce,” a DHS spokesperson said in an emailed statement on Wednesday.
Records continue to show the vast majority of immigrants detained have no criminal record. Their only offenses are civil immigration violations.

Marsha Blackburn and state lawmakers, including Sen. Jack Johnson and Reps.

(Photo: Sen.Jack Johnson Facebook)To great fanfare, Tennessee officials announced a partnership with Turning Point USA to set up chapters in high schools across the state.
They were so proud of the initiative they decided against inviting the media to the event at the State Capitol, instead sending out a video on a social media site I’ve never heard of, accompanied by yet another video by Gov. Bill Lee, who less than a month ago said he didn’t know anything about the plan.
Senate Majority Leader Jack Johnson and U.S. Sen. Marsha Blackburn put together the event as the group founded by the late Charlie Kirk gathers influence in the wake of his untimely death.
“Partnering with Turning Point USA to support the expansion of Club America chapters in high schools across Tennessee reflects our commitment to the founding ideas of free speech, limited government, and liberty – the values Charlie Kirk stood for,” Johnson said in response to questions from the Lookout. 
Johnson said no state funds will go toward the partnership and explained that it’s a grass-roots organization students can form voluntarily “to celebrate the founding principles of our great nation.” 
“The state of Tennessee stands ready to support those patriotic students’ efforts and ensure their constitutional rights are respected,” Johnson said.
It’s almost as if they’re expecting backlash before this deal starts.

Kirk, who frequently asked students to prove him “wrong,” was shot to death during an event at a Utah university where he was set for a debate. 
Interestingly, Kirk made numerous demeaning remarks about Black women and men by questioning their intellect, urged women such as Taylor Swift to submit to men and, after the mass shooting at The Covenant School in Nashville, said such deaths are the price of Second Amendment rights, according to an article in The Guardian.
President Donald Trump awarded him the Presidential Medal of Freedom in the wake of his death.
Lee declined to comment about Kirk’s inflammatory statements this week but said he “broadly” supports the group’s efforts to bring about “civil discourse” in schools. He added that people need to learn how to “disagree better.”
“I certainly appreciate what they do, but as far as a formal partnership, I don’t know about that,” Lee said, leaving more questions than answers about the state’s endorsement and why a “partnership” is needed.
Some key lawmakers wish Kirk hadn’t made such comments, but they’re comfortable with his organization, which is a template of sorts for Trump’s MAGA movement.
Even though Turning Point USA is a so-called beacon for free speech, numerous people who criticized Kirk after his death were fired.
Clarksville resident Monica Meeks, represented by the national nonprofit, Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression, filed a federal lawsuit over her firing by the Tennessee Department of Commerce and Insurance after she posted a private Facebook comment critical of Kirk.
Former MTSU employee Laura Sosh-Lightsy also filed a federal civil rights lawsuit, as well, against the university after it fired her for a critical post of Kirk. 
The violent act is unforgivable, but the irony here is fascinating. 
Kirk traveled the country debating students and urging free speech and “civil discourse.” Yet the government purged itself of anyone who had the temerity to challenge his statements publicly. 
Is this what Charlie would do? 










I certainly appreciate what they do, but as far as a formal partnership, I don’t know about that.


– Gov. Bill Lee, who appeared in a video announcing the state's partnership with Turning Point


Just as high schools have had Fellowship of Christian Athletes chapters for decades, schools can allow students to start their own Club America groups to meet before school or during break. (You remember FCA. Hardly anyone went to the meetings, but when they took the yearbook picture, half the school showed up to get out of class for a few minutes.)
During these Club America gatherings, students can discuss “limited government” in which the government backs their rights but infringes on other people’s free speech. They can also talk about the governor’s comments that it’s not really a “partnership” and the fact no money is flowing for group activities, at least not this year. The budget is way too tight. But hope springs eternal.
The overriding question, though, is whether students at urban schools such as Nashville’s Pearl-Cohn and Knoxville’s Austin-East will form chapters. Not likely.
Watch your sugar
The U.S. Department of Agriculture has approved Tennessee’s request to cut sugary drinks, snacks and other unhealthy food from people’s SNAP purchases. (That’s stuff bought with what were once referred to as food stamps, now called Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, which is enough to put a bad taste in anyone’s mouth.)
One of the notable things is that people won’t be able to use their SNAP cards, now that we’ve gotten rid of the stamps, to buy prepared fried chicken. Yet they can buy flour, cooking oil, spices and chicken to fry. 
Feds approve Tennessee’s SNAP waivers excluding soda, sugary foods from benefits

Luckily, few people eat fried chicken around Christmas. It’s always ham or turkey (my pre-New Year’s resolution is to cut out pork, except maybe a couple of pepperonis), which leaves turkey, the reason we have Thanksgiving only once a year.
But back to this SNAP deal. Sugary soda pops (also known as cokes) will be prohibited, along with sugary cereals and snacks. Does that mean people can’t buy pecan pies at the store? What about canned cooked apples, which are likely loaded with sugar? And what about sports drinks such as Gatorade and Powerade? I’m told by health freaks they contain a lot of sugar.
Thus, no Cap’n Crunch, no fried chicken, no pop (I’m not really from the North, unless you consider Hendersonville part of Kentucky), and no pecan pies.
This could be the worst Christmas ever for some folks. Or it could drive them to get a job at a fast-food joint, where the food is probably not real food but has plenty of sugar and grease.
Back at you
Republican Sen. Kerry Roberts filed a counter-suit against Knoxville-based Apex Bank, claiming it forced him and his wife to default on a $4.6 million loan for a massive renovation of his historic Springfield home, the Tennessee Journal reported.
Roberts filed the lawsuit in Robertson County Circuit Court, claiming the bank dragged its feet on providing funds for the project that made him lose time on construction and $750,000 in potential income from weddings, corporate retreats and Airbnb reservations, according to the report.
The Springfield senator counter-sued over the bank’s foreclosure after Sumner County General Sessions Judge Kee Bryant-McCormick determined that the bank took advantage of the Roberts but didn’t do anything illegal and should be allowed to acquire the property and adjacent tracts used as collateral, the Tennessee Journal reported. 
Gonna hitch a ride
Always on the lookout for ways to protect Tennesseans, state Rep. Gino Bulso is sponsoring a special bill for pregnant women and just in time for Christmas.
Bulso filed HB 1457, which would classify any person in the second or third trimester of pregnancy as a “disabled driver,” along with those who have a pregnancy deemed a high risk by their doctor.
If this means the woman will be able to obtain a placard allowing them to park in a spot designated for handicapped or disabled people, that might be a good thing. Kudos for the idea, though it could force businesses to leave more open spaces for pregnant women. Of course, how many of us have seen people without handicapped parking placards parking in handicap spots, even though they show no outward signs of disabilities or a pregnant bump.
We also know of women who’ve been forced to go out of state for treatment of a high-risk pregnancy, which means we don’t mind if they park closer to the Walmart door but can’t go to their doctor for the care that could save their lives. 
Maybe the bill needs a tweak or two.
Give me Kmart or give me death
With state departments requesting $300 million for technology in next year’s budget and lawmakers looking at replacing their aging payment and HR system, Finance and Administration Commissioner Jim Bryson told senators this week “society is evolving quickly” (or devolving) and that the state needs to meet constituents “where they are,” whatever that means.
“We cannot be Kmart when our citizens expect Amazon,” he said.
Sam Stockard, on a stump. (Photo: Submitted)
Some old-timers might take exception to that comment. For decades, Kmart was my go-to for underwear, socks and golf balls and not necessarily in that order. Going there was an adventure, too, because even after the stores added 15 checkout counters, they hired only one person to work them.
After standing in line for 30 minutes and losing circulation in my legs, I’d proudly place my items on the counter, and, 99.9% of the time, the checkout person would pick up the pack of Hanes and say, “Did this have a price tag on it?” Response, “Well, it was the only pack.”
Which would require the employee to get on the loud speaker, “I need a price check on men’s underwear!” The words reverberated through the store as women behind me cackled. Fifteen minutes later, the price would arrive. But in spite of this shopping gauntlet at least I could walk out the door with underwear and socks in hand.
Kmart’s problem was not with prices and products. They spent more money on technology than people. Alas, when they closed, the breakup was hard. 
“Baby, I don’t wanna leave you / I ain’t jokin’ woman, I got to ramble.” *

(Photo by Mary Steurer/North Dakota Monitor)A landmark North Dakota law approved this year accidentally lumped in two fake names in a list of critical minerals that appear to be inspired by coal company lawyers who worked on the bill. 
The inclusion of fictional substances is being called an embarrassment by one state official, a possible practical joke by coal industry leaders and mystifying by the lawmakers who worked on the bill.
The fake minerals are friezium and stralium, apparent references to Christopher Friez and David Straley, attorneys for North American Coal who were closely involved in drafting the bill and its amendments. Straley said they were not responsible for adding the fake names. 
“I assume it was put in to embarrass us, or to make light of it, or have a practical joke,” Straley said, adding it could have been a clerical error.
Rare earth minerals seen as a rare opportunity in North Dakota

Agriculture Commissioner Doug Goehring questioned the two substances listed in state law during a Wednesday meeting of the North Dakota Industrial Commission, which is poised to adopt rules based on the legislation.
“This statute and the rules would be the first in the nation,” Goehring said. “It would be kind of embarrassing for the rest of the country to look at us and say ‘Really? Do you guys even know what you’re doing?’”
Friezium and stralium first appeared in the bill on the last afternoon of the legislative session as lawmakers hurried to pass several final bills. The legislation that aims to keep North Dakota on the forefront of critical mineral development received approval from the House after 9 p.m. and the Senate after 10 p.m. 
The amended bill is labeled as prepared by Legislative Council for Rep. Dick Anderson, R-Willow City, the prime sponsor and chair of the conference committee. Anderson said the amendments were prepared by a group of attorneys and legislators, including representatives from the coal industry.

It remains unclear who added the fictional minerals to the amendment and why. 
“I wasn’t part of that team that sat up there and worked on that bill,” Anderson said. “I know it’s my name on it, and I should have checked it out.”
The conference committee that advanced the amendment consisted of Sens. Dale Patten, Jonathan Sickler, Keith Boehm and Reps. Anderson, Anna Novak and Todd Porter. Patten, Anderson and Porter said they were unaware of the last-minute addition of the two fake minerals. Novak, Boehm and Sickler did not immediately return requests for comment. Friez declined to comment, and Straley said Friez was not involved with drafting the amendment.
John Bjornson, director of Legislative Council, said legislative staff are not experts on critical minerals. They take content submitted by legislators and format it. Staff will conduct a more rigorous review if a lawmaker requests it. 
“We kind of take people at their word that they know what they’re doing,” Bjornson said. 
The definition of critical minerals in a North Dakota law includes friezium and stralium, which are not actually critical minerals. (Screenshot from bill text, highlighted by the North Dakota Monitor)
Bjornson said a Legislative Council attorney flagged and removed a fictional mineral, “docterium,” earlier in the session from an unofficial draft of the same bill before it became part of the legislative record. 
Anderson recalls joking about finding docterium, a reference to Rep. Jason Dockter, during a committee hearing. The lawmaker said he noticed the term in an unofficial draft afterward and immediately asked Legislative Council to remove it. 
The Monitor requested a copy of the draft that lists docterium, but Bjornson said it’s protected by legislative privilege, which Anderson declined to waive. The Monitor could not confirm the spelling of the fake mineral, but Anderson said it was spelled “docterium.”
Goehring, a self-proclaimed chemistry geek, said he noticed the inclusion of the mystery minerals while preparing for the Industrial Commission meeting. He’d never heard of them and could find no evidence they existed, so he decided to ask the state geologist about it. 
State Geologist Ed Murphy said he reviewed an earlier list of minerals in the bill but was not asked to review the final version. 
Jonathan Fortner, president of the Lignite Energy Council that represents the coal industry, said it’s unfortunate this happened in such an important bill. 
“From the president on down, everyone’s interested in developing domestic critical minerals for national security reasons,” Fortner said. “While this may have been a legislative joke between some people that somehow got through, the bigger picture is one that is important and is a very serious matter.”

(Photo illustration by Mario Tama/Getty Images)I have spent my career as a physician assistant caring for patients of all ages — listening to their concerns, diagnosing their needs, and helping them navigate treatment plans in ways that are medically sound and humane. That’s why I am alarmed by the rapid spread of a dangerous gray market of counterfeit and illegally compounded GLP-1 medications and active pharmaceutical ingredients.
Colorado families deserve better — and state leaders must act to protect them.
Advances in GLP-1 therapies have transformed our medical approach to obesity — a condition that impacts heart health, metabolic risk, and overall well-being. Here in Colorado, our own Gov. Jared Polis signed legislation this summer to expand access to weight loss treatments, including allowing employers to opt into covering GLP-1s. When used under proper medical supervision these drugs can help patients manage their weight with dignity and support. With obesity impacting more than 24% of adults in the state, increasing access to FDA-approved weight loss drugs keeps Coloradans safe and healthy.
But the dark side of growing demand is that unscrupulous actors are exploiting patients’ real needs: selling unapproved, clandestine, and potentially unsafe “alternatives” that bypass the safeguards of regulated care.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The crisis began when legitimate GLP-1 supplies became scarce: Regulatory shortages prompted compounding pharmacies to step in, as allowed. These compounding efforts were meant as a short-term, carefully regulated bridge. Once shortages ended earlier in 2025, mass compounding should have stopped too.
Instead, some med-spas, telehealth companies, and compounding entities have continued compounding or supplying GLP-1s — frequently sourcing active pharmaceutical ingredients, or APIs, from abroad, sometimes via unregulated importers. These compounds are not FDA-approved, so their manufacturing lacks the rigorous safety, labeling and oversight that patients deserve and expect.
Even more troubling: Some companies are selling raw APIs directly to consumers to be reconstituted at home — turning a medication to be taken under medical supervision into a do-it-yourself experiment. As a clinician, I find this unconscionable. We are talking about medications meant to affect metabolism, hormones and overall health — not benign over-the-counter vitamins. When patients don’t know the purity of a powder or the exact dose, they are risking far more than money.
As of July 2025, federal data show hundreds of adverse events tied to compounded or illicit GLP-1s — hospitalizations, overdoses and even deaths. These are not abstract statistics; these are real people whose lives and trust in the health system have been harmed.
We cannot stand by and let this continue. The federal government should strengthen enforcement to stop illicit APIs from entering U.S. supply chains, like Attorney General Phil Weiser and members of the Colorado congressional delegation have strongly called for. At the same time, Colorado’s regulators, licensing boards and legislators must take action to shut down illegal compounders, hold accountable those who mislead patients, and protect access only to safe, FDA-regulated medications.
I chose to become a PA because I believe in equitable access to safe, effective and compassionate health care. As a clinician, I have looked patients in the eye and walked with them through difficult decisions about their health. As a Coloradan, I believe everyone deserves transparency, dignity and protection — especially when it comes to their health.
If our leaders heed this call, we can help ensure that obesity treatments remain tools of healing, not shortcuts to danger.

In Kentucky, we’ve witnessed that tug-of-war up close through the lens of the coal mining industry and electric utilities that burn coal.
For example, after President Bill Clinton tightened pollution controls on coal-fired power plants through a regulation known as “new source review,” which required new or modified plants that increase emissions to install tighter controls, President George W. Bush’s Environmental Protection Agency sought to reverse course and was at least partially successful.
After Barack Obama followed Bush, his EPA put in place a raft of pollution reduction rules and programs, many of them targeting coal mining and coal burning — significant contributors to water pollution and global warming. Kentucky Sen. Mitch McConnell dubbed those years as “Obama’s war on coal,” and President Donald Trump took steps to reverse many of those environmental initiatives after he was elected in 2016.
Now we have a second Trump administration following President Joe Biden, who did the most of any president to address climate change through legislation (Inflation Reduction Act, for one) and executive actions to boost cleaner power from wind and solar and reduce heat-trapping emissions from cars and other methods of transportation.
This time, when it comes to the federal government’s response to climate change and the environment, what is happening goes far beyond a normal tit-for-tat change in public policy. The Trump administration is taking a wrecking ball to the very infrastructure of climate science — going after the scientists themselves and the institutions that support their work.
Consistent with Project 2025, Trump has sought to neuter NOAA and NASA climate scientists by denying funding and seeking to eliminate climate research programs. And last week, EPA eliminated references to how people were contributing to rising temperatures from some of its climate change webpages.
National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colorado. (NCAR)
News of Trump’s latest assault broke on Dec. 17, with USA Today reporting that the administration is moving to break up the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Colorado, a leading global climate and meteorology research center. Trump officials complained to the newspaper that NCAR was a “hub for climate alarmism.”
The only thing the administration got right in that statement is that NCAR is a hub.
As Katharine Hayhoe, a climate scientist at Texas Tech University, wrote on Linked In, NCAR is “quite literally (atmospheric scientists’) global mothership.” 
Nearly everyone, she wrote, “who conducts research in climate, atmospheric science, and weather  — not only in the U.S. but around the world — has passed through its doors and benefited from its incredible resources.
“NCAR supports the scientists who fly into hurricanes, the meteorologists who develop new radar technology, the physicists who envision and code new weather models, and yes — the largest community climate model in the world. That too.”
Hayhoe concluded: “Dismantling NCAR is like taking a sledgehammer to the keystone holding up our scientific understanding of the planet.”
Fine, let’s have the debate about what, if anything, should be done to address climate change, which credible scientists and scientific institutions agree is caused by burning fossil fuels and other human activities. What are the pros and cons of Kentucky lawmakers, or the Trump administration, adopting policies to keep coal in business and at what cost to electric utility consumers and the environment? 
But stifling science promotes a philosophy that ignorance truly is bliss. It goes along with the administration’s equally anti-democratic attacks on journalists and attempts at intimidating or trying to silence media outlets.
Shutting down this well-respected global climate and weather science lab is stupid and tragic. This is more than shooting ourselves in the foot. It’s shooting the messenger, which is probably the point.
All of this brings to mind the satirical black comedy “Don’t Look Up,” starring Louisville native Jennifer Lawrence and Leonardo DiCaprio as scientists who tried in vain to warn the world of a catastrophic comet collision. “We really did have everything, didn’t we? I mean, when you think about it,” DiCaprio’s character said near the end of the movie.",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/GettyImages-178479362-700x467-1-1.jpg,,,2025-12-19 05:57:17.427228

(Photo by Charlotte Rene Woods/Virginia Mercury)Gov.-elect Abigail Spanberger detailed how she plans to work with legislators to make utility bills more affordable, as the cost of electricity continues to rise across the commonwealth. The incoming Democratic governor’s ideas range from bolstering battery storage capacity to reducing power use and the need for expensive transmission lines.
“I recognize the complexity of our current challenges and threats posed by the future demands, but the answer is not to sit so our problems only get worse,” Spanberger said at the state Capitol Thursday morning, as top Democratic lawmakers looked on.
Spanberger’s interest in increasing battery storage is complimented by a bill being carried by Del. Rip Sullivan, D-Fairfax and Sen. Lamont Bagby, D-Henrico, which will increase the amount of battery storage the major utilities need to invest in as part of the Virginia Clean Economy Act. 
As the battery technology is evolving, it is becoming more affordable and helps solar power be more dispatchable when the power is needed and not being produced. The measure was vetoed by term-limited Gov. Glenn Youngkin in this year’s session.
“We have to expand generation, and in doing so, it is about ensuring we can continue to attract businesses and investment. It’s also about ensuring we can literally keep the lights on for Virginians across our communities,” Spanberger said.
Spanberger also echoed the priorities of House Democrats who want to look into barriers that some homeowners face when trying to utilize efficiency and weatherization programs. One of the bills urges the utilities to expand their efficiency programs.
If the state rejoins the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI), as Spanberger has stated she would make happen, then funding will flow back into the state to help fund efficiency and flood mitigation programs.
“If we were actually leveraging RGGI dollars for weatherization projects as prescribed by the programmer, we could be reducing the cost for Virginians by building up on energy efficiency,” Spanberger said.
Two bills the governor-elect is pushing would also give the State Corporation Commission the ability to create a process to measure how well the current grid infrastructure is being utilized, in hopes of cutting down on the need for new expensive transmission lines to be built. 
Many of the current and recent high-voltage transmission line cases before the SCC have been proposed to push more power directly to data centers, plans that have raised community concerns over routes and cost.
While the legislation in Democrats’ priority affordability package does not directly address data centers and the costs associated with their power demands, another bill Spanberger is supporting pushes the State Corporation Commission to come up with a review process to ensure demand load growth estimations given by utilities are accurate.
Some residents and advocates have questioned if the true amount of power being calculated based on data center proposals may potentially be inflated compared to the real amount that ends up being built. The utilities have their own ways of verifying what they say are accurate counts. This legislation would create a backup check through the SCC.
In an effort to expand small solar projects to bring every electron possible onto the grid, Spanberger said she supports a recommendation from the Commission on Electric Utility Regulation to make small solar projects more accessible, including balcony solar panels that would be exempt from utility approval requirements.
All of these bills will be formally filed and considered in the regular legislative session that begins Jan. 14.

A similarly situated […]","Protestors hold a sign denouncing proposed Medicaid cuts in Richmond, June 2025. (Photo by Nathaniel Cline/Virginia Mercury)In York County and Virginia Beach, a couple of 40-year-olds with two kids and a combined household income of $150,000 could see their health insurance premiums rise by $4,330 per year if the U.S. Senate and House fail to extend health insurance premium tax credits now set to expire on Dec. 31.
A similarly situated family in relatively affluent Albemarle County is looking at a yearly increase of $6,244 in premiums.   
These estimates do not come from Democrats or Republicans. They come from a calculator prepared by KFF, the Kaiser Family Foundation, one of the country’s most reputable health policy organizations.  
Experts predict that huge premium increases to households that would lose expired premium tax credits could leave as many as 100,000 Virginians uninsured.
The cost of human suffering by those forced into bankruptcy due to illness or those who forego treatment because they cannot afford to pay is hard to calculate. What is certain is that the increased cost will devastate people of all political persuasions.
This begs the question of why none of Virginia’s Republicans in the House of Representatives would sign a discharge petition to force a vote on a bill to extend the tax credits for three years. 
Four Republicans, three from Pennsylvania and one from New York, joined 214 Democrats to force debate on the bill this week, after House Speaker Mike Johnson refused to include premium tax credits in a Republican health care reform proposal Wednesday. Johnson then abruptly ended a 204-203 House vote that blocked quick consideration of the discharge bill before Congress adjourns for the holiday season on Friday. 
Conspicuously missing from the list of GOP members challenging Johnson were two representatives from the Old Dominion. 
First Congressional District U.S. Rep. Rob Wittman, whose district includes York County, and Second Congressional District U.S. Rep. Jen Kiggans, whose district includes Virginia Beach, have each made, then broken, promises to go to the mat to control constituents’ health care costs. Kiggans even co-sponsored a bill that would have extended health insurance premium tax credits for two years. It never came to a vote.
Wittman made no promise on premium tax credits. But like Kiggans, during federal budget negotiations he co-signed a letter to Johnson saying he would not vote for a federal budget that cut access to Medicaid, then, like Kiggans, did so twice.
It’s time for Wittman and Kiggans to serve constituents, not Trump

Since then, Wittman and Kiggans have offered continuous pledges to make health care affordable. With their failure to support a discharge petition to force a vote on premium credits, they have once more betrayed constituents. 
Both Republican incumbents risk losing their seats in Congress for ignoring constituents in health care votes and for failing to hold President Donald Trump accountable for economic policies such as tariffs that have already raised the costs of goods and services for those they represent. 
Since November’s Democratic sweep of statewide offices and increased control of both chambers of the state legislature, talk has focused on whether Virginia will redraw congressional districts to favor Democrats as a way to offset Trump’s command to Republican-run states to develop redistricting plans that increase the GOP’s congressional representation. But Wittman and Kiggans would still be in trouble if Virginia left their districts intact.
Health care expenses represent a bipartisan financial crisis. A May 2025 tracking poll by KFF showed “three-quarters of uninsured adults say they have skipped or postponed getting the health care they needed due to cost. Having health insurance, however, does not offer ironclad protection as about four in ten adults with insurance (37%) still report not getting health care they needed due to cost.”
Those are the stakes as the clock winds down on Congress’ failure to extend the premium tax credits, if only for a few years to work out kinks and help the middle and upper middle classes protect their families. Instead, Republicans just voted down a Democratic proposal for a three-year extension of premium tax credits in the Senate and refused to even bring it up in the House.  
Johnson and other Republican leaders who control the Senate and House continue to hurt their own constituents, including essential middle class voters, in the name of partisan purity. Yes, health care premium tax credits are a result of former Democratic President Joe Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act. Yes, those credits also pair with former Democratic President Barack Obama’s signature health care reform bill, the Affordable Care Act (ACA). At this point, though, the Republican obsession with destroying the ACA has turned self-destructive. 
A 2025 Virginia Joint Commission on Health Care report shows why. The state saw reductions in the number of residents without health insurance from 2018 to 2023 due to Medicaid expansion and growth in the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP).
Helping the middle and upper middle classes afford health insurance with tax credits makes for a healthier mix of incomes and individuals. Some Republicans contend this amounts to welfare for those who do not need it. Such criticism drips with hypocrisy coming from GOP majorities in the Senate and House, whose members  — including Virginia’s entire Republican delegation — just voted for a federal budget without health premium tax credit extensions, but with permanent extensions of tax cuts for the country’s richest individuals and corporations. 
Dumping premium credits also ignores the hidden cost of emergency room visits by the uninsured it creates. Those visits often go at least partially unpaid and eventually get passed on in the form of higher insurance premiums to those who do have health coverage. One daunting fact that emerged from Virginia’s 2025 health metrics report is that “the percentage of potentially avoidable emergency department visits in Virginia has steadily increased since 2021.”
As time runs out for extending health insurance premium credits, Republicans have offered little that will effectively replace them. As he did in his first administration, Trump has promoted cheap private health insurance policies that do not cover prior existing conditions, have monetary caps on services, and/or require large deductibles before benefits kick in.
Republicans in Virginia, including Wittman, talk about privatization of health care. Often that includes giving money to individuals for health savings accounts that can be used to buy their own insurance policies or other uses. But the subsidies Republican plans mention  — $1,000 per year for some people and $1,500 for others – would not be enough to pay the costs of a couple of trips to the emergency room, much less the bill for a single in-patient surgery.
The Senate and House need to extend the health insurance premium tax credits at least temporarily, if for no other reason than this: They sustain Americans’ physical and financial health in a country where for-profit medical services enrich everyone except the patients.
Virginia’s Republican delegation to Congress forgets that at its own peril.

(Photo courtesy of Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management Office of Emergency Response)Linda Perri has seen — and smelled — a lot in the more than 40 years she has lived in Washington Park in Providence. Some days are worse than others.
“You can’t open your windows in the summer, you can’t sit outside in your yard, front or back,” Linda Perri, who is president of her neighborhood association, said in a Nov. 14 interview.
For decades, many South Providence residents have suffered from pollution caused by industrial businesses on Allens Avenue and the Port. Some recall being awoken by the pungent odor of asphalt and experiencing nausea, headaches, and fatigue. In 2022, a school was even evacuated due to smells from the Port being mistaken for a gas leak. And though hundreds of air quality complaints have been made, Rhode Island has continued to prioritize economic profit over the wellbeing of its people. The time has come for the state to put the health of its people first and hold these entities accountable.
Allens Avenue, home to asphalt plants, scrap metal dealers, oil and gas companies, and salt distributors, has been called “the most toxic and polluted stretch of roadway in Rhode Island” by the Providence Streets Coalition, a group of over 40 community organizations, local businesses, schools, associations, and individuals supporting safe and healthy streets.
The impact of this pollution on surrounding communities is severe. The combination of noxious emissions from I-95 and pollution from businesses along Allens Avenue and the Port may contribute to Rhode Island’s asthma rate for adults exceeding the national average. In 2021, 12.6% of the state’s adult population had the condition, far above the national average of 9.7%. Rates among Rhode Island youth have decreased in recent years but were at 6.6% compared to the national average of 6.5%.
“It’s a struggle. There’s so much pollution. There’s so much road debris.” Perri said. “There’s a lot of things that could be done in this neighborhood to create a healthier, more environmentally-friendly port area.”
State officials are not doing enough to prevent bad actors from hurting the environment and these communities for their own monetary benefit. Since 2009, Rhode Island Recycled Metals has conducted its operations without proper permits from the state, contaminating the Providence River and Narragansett Bay with runoff and fuel from unlicensed vessels and defying stormwater discharge permits. Even after a series of fires led to its temporary closure in 2024, attempts to bring the company into compliance continue to fail. Meanwhile, nearby communities continue to pay the price.
Over the past few years, government action has shown that the state prioritizes the interests of these industrial businesses over the wellbeing of affected communities. In 2019, Mayor Jorge Elorza applauded the industrial waterfront as a “driver of economic development.” And when asked why some businesses in the area were not being held accountable by the city for environmental violations, Elorza’s office told ecoRI News  that “the City is not responsible for air emissions or coastal regulations,” passing this responsibility to the DEM and Coastal Resources Management Council.
Mayor Brett Smiley’s 2024 Comprehensive Plan has taken a step in the right direction, but further action is needed. The plan emphasizes the development of clean and sustainable industries, laying out objectives to mitigate the environmental and health impacts of pollution. It also notes that “the city may prohibit future industrial uses in the General Industrial District, M-2, that it determines go against the public interest of public health and quality of life in near-industry neighborhoods.” However, will the state actually do this when the time comes? Or will more businesses like Rhode Island Recycled Metals be allowed to emerge? Without concrete accountability measures and enforcement strategies, these goals risk becoming empty words.
It is difficult to strike a balance between economic growth and public wellbeing, but it is essential that the state do so. Without immediate government intervention, the health of thousands of Rhode Islanders will remain at risk. Left to their own devices, these industrial businesses will continue to prioritize economic growth over public health.
Many residents worry that their voices will be drowned out by lobbyists and developers, who have greater influence in determining governmental outcomes. The state should propose an environmental justice law that will give residents in these communities a prominent voice in future developments. The state must enact legislation that reflects not only the interests of industrial developers, but also the concerns of those affected most acutely. Additionally, to decrease industrial operations in specific areas, the state should rezone parts of Allens Avenue and impose stricter penalties on businesses that violate environmental regulations.
I imagine a future where children can play outdoors without worrying about inhaling harmful pollutants – a future where every Rhode Islander has access to clean, healthy air. Thousands are counting on the state to act. 
So the question I ask is this: Will it continue to prioritize economic growth over people’s health, or will it finally listen to the voices of those crying out for help and deliver justice to these communities?

Some Ohio craft brewers are optimistic changes will be made at the federal level to allow THC-infused beverages to continue to be manufactured and sold past next year.
Ohio Senate Bill 56 allows five milligram THC beverages to be manufactured, distributed, and sold until Dec. 31, 2026. The bill also says that if the federal government legalizes THC beverages, Ohio will consider “a more robust regulatory framework of these products,” according to the bill’s language.

“I’m excited we have another year,” said Collin Castore, the co-founder of three central Ohio breweries. “I’m optimistic that the federal side will get cleared up. …The more regulation we can get and clarity on things, the better.”
Ohio Republican lawmakers passed the bill, sending it to Gov. Mike DeWine’s desk for his signature. DeWine has said he will sign the bill. 
“I think (the bill is) positive,” said Bobby Slattery, founder of Fifty West Brewing Company in Cincinnati. 
“I would have hoped that this bill would have, if the federal extends, this bill would have an automatic extension built into it. That’s not exactly how it played it out, but I think it’s something that we can fix down the road.”
However, not all brewers are as hopeful. 
“I’m not optimistic that the federal piece that would trigger that clause will happen in time before the end date of this Ohio bill,” said Scotty Hunter, co-owner and founder at Urban Artifact Brewing, which produces Coastalo THC sodas. 
“I’m still optimistic that the federal (government) will get a regulatory framework in place. I just don’t expect that to happen in under a year …  I expect some period of prohibition in Ohio.”
THC-infused beverages have no alcohol in them and are regulated by the Ohio Department of Agriculture. 
“One of the requirements of these beverages is that you actually have to send your product out to a lab to verify that it meets the milligrams that you are advertising on the can,” Slattery said. 
Fifty West Brewing produces Sunflower THC Seltzer, which has quickly become popular. 
“On the trajectory that it’s on, we can see within the next two years this overtaking and us producing more THC products than craft beer,” Slattery said.
People looking for an alternative to alcohol turn to the THC-infused beverages, Ohio brewers said. 
“If you talk to customers that are drinking them, it’s not because they get you higher or anything along those lines,” Slattery said. “Most of them, they’re just looking for a healthy alternative, whether it be lower calories or it doesn’t mess with their sleep.”
Castore was glad THC-beverages were separated out from intoxicating hemp products in the bill. 
“This is a different category and should be treated differently,” he said. “We felt like we were kind of being good players who were getting tossed into the maybe not so great players.”
THC-infused beverages make up 10-15% of their wholesale business and about 5% on the retail side, said Castore, the co-founder of Seventh Son Brewery, Antiques on High, and Getaway Brewing.
Until he hears otherwise, Castore is keeping things status quo when it comes to THC beverages. He said his breweries are doing some new flavors of THC drinks next year. He said they were going to roll out a 10 milligram THC beverage, but are now changing it to five milligram beverage. 
“We’re overall glad about the regulation, and overall slightly optimistic that things are moving in the right direction,” Castore said. 
A pair of Democratic senators from Oregon recently introduced federal legislation that would undo the federal hemp ban and would, among other things, allow THC-infused beverages to contain up to 10 milligrams per container.

(Photo by Maya Mitchell/New Hampshire Bulletin)Jen Legere, owner and director of A Place to Grow, hangs staff credentials on the walls of her child care centers. Being known for having a quality early childhood program, she said, shows families her program is worth sending their children to. 
“It is super important to us from a marketing perspective,” she said. “When we’re talking about the quality of our schools, 100% it is important to our families.”
One way for child care programs in New Hampshire to invest in quality is through the Granite Steps for Quality, or GSQ, system. The joint federal-state program ensures early education programs maintain quality and operate above the state’s minimum standards, and, as a result, provides educators with support measures, including training and coaching, as well as quarterly and annual funding. 
GSQ is New Hampshire’s version of the national Quality Recognition and Improvement System. According to the National Association for the Education of Young Children, defining and measuring quality is important because it ensures educators “are addressing the essential building blocks of a well-financed, high-quality early childhood education system.” 
For providers like Legere, whose early childhood education business operates in Brentwood, Salem, Durham, and Wingate, North Carolina, GSQ’s incentives and support are beneficial. It helps to subsidize the cost of running a child care business — which is already high — while motivating her staff to improve. She said she gets between $8,000 and $10,000 a year for being in the program. 
Oftentimes, joining GSQ allows early education programs to receive incentives for work they would be doing anyway as a licensed child care program with credentialed staff. The benefit to participating in Granite Steps for Quality is that providers receive extra support in addition to some stimulus funding. 
However, the disadvantages are starting to prevail. Maintaining a high-quality program at GSQ standards is expensive and the Bureau of Child Development and Head Start is becoming more rigid in paying out to providers. Communication between the two groups is starting to dissolve. The bureau also changed how employees are classified in the system, making it even more confusing for busy program directors to navigate. 
“It’s really a system designed for failure, for sinking child care centers that are already struggling and on the margins,” Legere said. “This is broken. We need to fix it.”
And it’s not easy to leave. The impact of no longer being in Granite Steps for Quality would be a 3% tuition increase for parents, Legere said. 
A Place to Grow uses GSQ incentive dollars to fund employee benefits such as telehealth, mental health care, retirement, reduced tuition for children of providers, roadside assistance, and more. GSQ funds are budgeted, so the money has to come from somewhere else. 
The child care industry already exists on thin margins. Program tuition is expensive for most families, and programs do not want to raise rates for fear of pricing families out. According to the New Hampshire Fiscal Policy Institute, the recent data shows the average annual price for an infant in center-based child care was $17,250, and the average price for both an infant and a 4-year-old was $31,868 in 2023.
Providers need money to retain their employees, who are leaving the industry due to low wages, few benefits, and burnout. A 17% turnover in child care employees was anticipated between 2023 and 2025, according to the Fiscal Policy Institute.
Programs often look to the few child care subsidies available in New Hampshire to help balance their budgets and retain their staff. With that in jeopardy, businesses will pull out of the system and have to raise tuition— a solution that helps no one. 
Invoice issues? No payout.
According to the Department of Health and Human Services, 142 early education programs were a part of GSQ in fiscal year 2024-2025, which is about 19.8% of 717 licensed child care programs in New Hampshire as of December 2024. The department said it awarded over $1 million in quarterly incentives. 
Programs can receive between $2,400 and $5,700 per quarter in incentives, depending on the program type and size. The money is authorized for personnel costs such as benefits and employee incentives, implementing state standards and credentialing, purchasing classroom materials, conducting staff and child mental health checks, and more. 
Recently, providers have reported that the Department of Health and Human Services and the Bureau of Child Development and Head Start are no longer accepting late GSQ invoices, resulting in programs not being paid despite having completed the work. 
Legere said she submitted her invoice after the deadline earlier this year. Health and Human Services told her they would not be paying her, a change from past times when she had submitted late paperwork. She said not getting paid for the work she and her employees did was frustrating, and she was willing to let the loss go until she found out she was not alone. 
“If it was just me, I would be much more likely to suck it up, like ‘I’m a s—y bookkeeper.’ But like, when there’s so few of us participating in the system … that’s a system problem,” Legere said. 
Kitty Larochelle, executive director of The Growing Years Center in Manchester, said that when she had not received payment from the department, she was told it was “too late,” even though she had sent the invoice on time. 
“We never get any kind of confirmation that we’ve submitted anything, and we never get any receipt,” she said. In the past, Larochelle said she had issues with New Hampshire Connections, the website where providers submit invoices, so she was not surprised by the problems. She was, however, surprised she wasn’t paid. 
“I have no proof. I didn’t do a screenshot of when I imported it into New Hampshire Connections,” she said. 
Larochelle said that GSQ funding is a way for child care programs to get a few extra dollars “when pennies are tough,” especially now when funding for child care employee recruitment and retention is in limbo. 
At a Child Care Advisory Meeting held on Dec. 11, Jotham Spreeman, director of operations at the Bureau of Child Development, said Health and Human Services would not be paying out late invoices from previous quarters. 
The department’s policy surrounding late payments is not concrete. The current GSQ handbook, last modified on Oct. 5, states that “incentives funding may be denied or paused” if an invoice is not submitted on time. Providers have pointed to the “may” in the sentence, believing that it leaves wiggle room on the rule. 
Health and Human Services did not respond to questions about why they would not pay providers if their paperwork was late but they had completed the work. 
“I want my f—g money,” Legere said. “Why is there no transparency about it? We did the work. Why can we not get paid in a more fluid and easy fashion?”
Measurement and communication issues
To be part of Granite Steps for Quality, programs must meet specific criteria and benchmarks, including credentialing and training their staff, administrators, and directors beyond what is already required of licensed child care programs. Increasing the percentage of a program’s credentialed staff allows it to move onto the next “step” of GSQ, giving programs more access to funding and resources. 
One major problem providers are struggling with is inconsistency in how the state represents staff qualifications. Across the three main qualification systems — state child care licensing, which is required for entry into GSQ; credentialing, the term used for training under New Hampshire’s Early Childhood Professional Development System; and GSQ — an educator can fall under three different qualifications.
For example, under licensing, a “lead teacher” is someone with a high school degree, 18 industry-related college credits, and a minimum of 1,000 hours of work in a licensed program. Under credentialing and GSQ, the title and qualifications for someone who meets the criteria differ.
“You’ve already been through all these inspections, you’ve already proved yourself to be licensed. It should be front-door access,” Larochelle said.
Dealing with this is an administrative burden for program directors. In Larochelle’s eyes, it is a result of child care providers not being included enough in conversations about issues that involve them. 
“Systems have been built for us without a whole lot of input from those of us who actually use these systems. So ideally, I would love to see the systems have some communication when it comes to licensing.”
The department said it worked with child care providers, advocates, higher education systems, educators, and the legislatively enacted Child Care Advisory Committee on the changes implemented in 2022. They did not respond to questions about qualification redundancies and differences. 
Legere is skeptical of provider input. She is confident providers would have pointed this out if asked. 
“I don’t think they realized what they did when they did this,” she said. “They thought they were helping, but it actually hurts mathematically.” 
Programs have to reapply for GSQ every three years, and in working on her application, Legere realized that under the 2022 changes, she wouldn’t be eligible for GSQ at all. 
“I’ve been at Step Two for three years. Really ready to move into Step Three. But the way that those new changes have happened, I don’t even qualify for Step One anymore,” she said. “I have the most qualified staff I’ve ever had in my life at our schools. But the way this math works makes it look like I’m the worst I’ve ever been.” 
Overall, providers have complained about the lack of communication from the department and the bureau. Complaints include no reminders about deadlines or memos about program and form changes.
“There’s a disregard for the complexities of the lives of us as business owners in this industry,” Legere said. “Do you know how many socks and shows and children and parents and grandparents (I manage) in a day? Like, general courtesy, send me a reminder.”
Larochelle said that when problems arise for her, it is difficult to determine who at the department or bureau is the best person to contact. When she reaches someone, responses are not timely. 
“We do not have a directory,” Larochelle said. “We don’t know who to contact. We don’t know who we’re actually in communication with. It’s rare for an email to be signed.”

Ohio has joined a Federal Trade Commission lawsuit against Uber, alleging the company engaged in deceptive practices as part of its Uber One subscription service. Nineteen other states, the District of Columbia and California’s Alameda County have signed on to the lawsuit as well.
“Uber took consumers for a ride – and it wasn’t what they signed up for,” Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost said in a press release. “A free trial shouldn’t lead to a surprise bill, and canceling shouldn’t become an exercise in frustration.”
Meanwhile, the ride hailing company defends the subscription service, which trades perks like discounts and ride credits for a monthly fee.
“Millions of Americans choose Uber One because it delivers real, measurable value: substantial savings on rides and deliveries, priority service, and exclusive promotions,” the company said in a statement.
“The FTC, and the states that have decided to join this misguided lawsuit, are wrong, and we will vigorously defend these claims in court,” it added.

The case
The Federal Trade Commission and attorneys general contend Uber’s subscription service makes bogus claims about purported savings and makes it very difficult for consumers to cancel.
In its promotional materials, Uber claims customers save on average $25 a month with the subscriptions. The complaint rejects that out of hand.
“In fact, these claims are false,” it states. “Many consumers do not actually save $25 a month by using Uber One.”
The FTC and attorneys general cite internal documents from Uber in 2023 that detail actual savings among subscribers. But those figures are redacted in the court filing. Notably, they add Uber’s savings claim only works if you don’t factor in the cost of the subscription.
Much of the government’s case hinges on violations of the Restore Online Shoppers’ Confidence Act, a consumer protection measure passed by Congress in 2010. Part of that law generally prohibits the sale of goods or services through “negative option marketing” unless there are specific safeguards.
“A negative option is an offer in which the seller treats a consumer’s silence — their
failure to reject an offer or cancel an agreement — as consent to be charged for goods or services,” the complaint explains.
One of the required protections is a simple cancellation process. But the government claims, “Uber utilizes various tactics that prevent or make it hard for consumers to cancel, especially when they attempt to do so within 48 hours of their billing date, often snaring consumers into additional months or even years of a service they no longer want or need.”
The filing details a seven screen, 12 action process customers must navigate to cancel. But in the final 48 hours of a billing cycle, that process grows 32 actions on 23 screens and involves direct contact with customer service. In those circumstances, the app explained their next payment may already be in process.
“In fact, Uber always charged consumers before the supposed billing date and never processed cancellations concluded via the in-app cancellation flow in the final 48-hour window,” the complaint alleges.
The government notes as of September of 2024, Uber had enrolled more than 28.7 million users in the program, and that those subscription fees generated close to a billion dollars in revenue over two years.
Uber’s response
In its statement, Uber pushed back strongly on the government’s characterization of its subscription service.
“If this lawsuit were to succeed, it would upend how virtually every modern subscription service operates,” the company said. “Uber One’s sign-up and cancellation processes are clear, simple, and follow the letter and spirit of the law. Uber does not sign up or charge consumers without their consent, and cancellations can be done anytime in-app and take most people 20 seconds or less”
The company also said it has since eliminated the alternative cancellation process in the final 48 hours of a billing cycle.
“This has not been the case for more than a year,” the company stated, “and we have refunded customers who had reached out to Uber Support to cancel within 48 hours of their next billing period and did not receive benefits greater than the membership fee charged.”

In addition to Christmas and Hanukkah, at least five other traditional celebrations in the Americas, Europe, the Middle East, and East Asia take place this month. 
All fall around the shortest day of the year, the winter solstice, and in Ohio people have been marking it for at least 2,000 years. More than 100 are expected to go to Fort Ancient in southwest Ohio Sunday to mark it yet again. 
It’s unknown exactly why Hopewell peoples went to such great lengths to mark celestial phenomena, but it’s beyond question that they did. 
For centuries after A.D. 1, peace reigned across what is now the eastern United States as people of different cultures shared the same belief system. They made periodic pilgrimages to the Ohio Valley to build vast monuments that are so mathematically and astronomically precise that in 2023, the Hopewell Ceremonial Earthworks were named Ohio’s only World Heritage Site.
The world celebrated Ohio’s most important cultural site. Like so much else, that’s controversial

Requiring more than a century to plan and build, the Octagon Earthworks at Newark mark the 18-year cycle of the moon.
 More than 100 miles to the southwest, Fort Ancient charts the phases of the sun.
The 110-acre hilltop site is enclosed by 3.5 miles of earthen walls, some as high as 23 feet, said Neil Thompson, a spokesman for the Ohio History Connection, which runs and cares for the site. 
Construction was an immense effort, given that the walls had to be built one basket of earth at a time — and had to be built sturdily enough to last for millennia.
“There’s no place in the world quite like this,” Thompson said. “They made the hilltop enclosure so the earthen walls followed the hilltop, and they were still able to code the solar alignment in what they did. I think it’s another human testament to the creative genius that made these places.”
Fort Ancient isn’t just some big, crude structure looking out over the Little Miami Valley.
“At Fort Ancient, the builders literally carved the rhythm of time into the land,” the History Connection’s website says. “Two of the distinctive limestone-capped mounds align to the summer solstice sunrise, and two align to the winter solstice sunrise. These days must have held deep importance for the site’s builders.”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Stand behind one of the mounds on Sunday and you’ll watch the sun rise through the exact center of a gap built into an earthen wall hundreds of yards away. 
Doing so is free and open to the public, and you’ll likely be with people who have traveled from other continents just to see it.
As with other Hopewell sites, artifacts have been found at Fort Ancient that came from as far away as the Rocky Mountains, the Atlantic Ocean, modern Canada and the Gulf Coast. 
That means that vast, intricate trading networks existed when it was built — although there’s no known written record from the time describing them.
Also due to the lack of a written record, it’s unknown why the movements of the sun and moon were so important to the Hopewell people that they’d undertake such a gargantuan effort to mark them. 
But we know why the winter solstice was important to other cultures. 
As the shortest day of the year, it could be a time to check grain and hay stores and decide what animals to slaughter so the rest could survive until spring.
That might call for a feast. And just being in the depths of the gloomiest part of the year might be reason enough for a celebration of light and rebirth and renewal.
Fort Ancient will open at 7 a.m. Sunday, with sunrise to come 50 minutes later. A guide will be there. Click here for a map and directions.
Weather in the area is expected to be clear and in the upper 20s. The museum will be open from 7 a.m. to 10 a.m. and bathrooms are available. The park is open until 5 p.m.

(Photo by Emma Davis/ Maine Morning Star)While commending the passage of a law to limit local involvement in federal immigration work, lawmakers and immigrant rights groups say those restrictions are vital but only one step in guarding against rights violations in Maine.
When the Maine Legislature’s next session begins in January, lawmakers are slated to take up new proposals focused on protecting against erroneous detentions, preventing immigration enforcement in places like schools and hospitals, and clarifying language to ensure jails can refuse to detain people on behalf of federal authorities. 
Originally proposed in collaboration with the restrictions that passed, another bill that seeks to limit local-federal collaboration by banning official contracts with federal immigration authorities will also be returning. 
While immigration is a federal matter, states have tried in various ways to intervene since President Donald Trump began his second term and launched a mass deportation agenda, with federal agents using aggressive tactics to meet record arrest numbers and in some cases bypassing due process. 
Some states have expanded local authorities’ ability to assist in the president’s effort, while others have limited it. 
Maine joins the latter after Gov. Janet Mills announced earlier this week that she will allow a new law that sets specific restrictions on when local authorities can collaborate with federal immigration agencies. 
But there are also other ways lawmakers and advocates are pushing for the state to set limits, including shoring up individuals’ rights against possible violations by federal entities and challenging the current use of jails to house immigration detainees. 
“Our ultimate goal is not having pockets of protection,” said Crystal Cron, founding director of the mutual aid organization Presente! Maine, which is helping craft one of the new bills, “but knowing that we are truly safe in this state that we call home.”
New proposals 
During Trump’s second term, there have been instances of people being erroneously detained and deported. A proposal from Senate Assistant Majority Leader Jill Duson (D-Cumberland) seeks to prevent that from occurring in Maine by creating a right to emergency review.
“The way that federal immigration enforcement has been conducting itself has been extremely concerning to my constituents in Portland and people across Maine,” Duson said. “My goal with this proposed bill is to protect public safety, require due process and respect individual rights. I firmly believe that these three things can be true at the same time.”
Under Duson’s proposal, the text of which is still in the works, if someone is swept up by immigration authorities, detained in a Maine facility and has not been accused of a criminal violation, that person can petition a Maine court for review and release by providing evidence that they are lawfully present. 
“There is a lot of concern that federal immigration enforcement is more focused on meeting quotas than protecting constitutional rights,” Duson said. “Regardless of where you stand on immigration issues, I think we can all agree that no hard-working person who stops at the Home Depot or drops their kid off at school should be disappeared from their family and wrongfully held in custody.”
In September, a parent was detained by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement after dropping off their child at a Portland elementary school. 
Among the many changes the Trump administration has made to immigration enforcement was revoking the “sensitive locations” policy, which previously protected certain areas — such as schools, hospitals and places of worship — from immigration enforcement. 
One of the new proposals Maine lawmakers will consider next session targets that change. 
A bill sponsored by Rep. Ellie Sato (D-Gorham) seeks to add state level protections in those scenarios. Like Duson’s bill and other new legislation, the text of this proposal titled, “An Act to Improve Constitutional Protections Against Unreasonable Search and Seizure in Public Schools and Public Health Facilities,” is currently being drafted.
Sato declined to comment on the details of her proposal at this time, but other lawmakers and immigrant rights advocates described it as a key priority. 
The session that begins in January is the second year of the state’s two-year legislative cycle. Legislation in the second session is limited to budgetary matters, bills from the governor, and proposals considered emergency in nature by the Legislative Council, which is composed of the ten elected members of legislative leadership.
Legislative leaders rejected a proposal from Rep. Grayson Lookner (D-Portland) that sought to prohibit law enforcement from wearing masks that conceal their identities. Across the country, immigration agents have been seen wearing masks during raids and while detaining people, which had generally not been seen previously. 
Another of the new bills accepted targets a particular nuance in state law that has come up in debate over whether Maine jails are required to hold people on behalf of federal immigration authorities. 
Split over views on immigration detention, Cumberland County commissioners postpone vote

Unlike many other states, Maine doesn’t have a dedicated ICE facility, which means local jails are relied on for detentions. Since the spring, the public has been calling for the Cumberland County commissioners to cancel the county jail’s contract with the U.S. Marshals Service. It’s been in place since 2010, paying the county $150 per day per federal detainee. 
Over the summer, the Maine Department of Corrections issued a memo stating that their interpretation of current law is that Maine jails must hold people for federal law enforcement officers. This statute has also been cited by Cumberland County Sheriff Kevin Joyce when contending that he’d still be obligated to hold immigration detainees regardless of what happens with the contract. 
“That’s been one of the biggest barriers for our commissioners — doubts about whether action at the county level will even carry weight,” said Cron with Presente! Maine, whose organization has been a part of the group calling for the board of commissioners to terminate the agreement. 
Bill sponsor Sen. Rachel Talbot Ross (D-Cumberland) did not respond to requests for comment, but Cron said Presente! Maine is helping craft the legislation, which she hopes will demonstrate that the original intent of the law was not to obligate jails to hold detainees on immigration offenses. 
During commission meetings, some have argued ending the contract would only result in people being detained farther away from their family and legal counsel. But Cron argues that thinking is flawed. 
As Maine Morning Star reported back in April and attorneys say remains the case, the majority of immigration detainees in Cumberland County Jail are not residents of nor were they arrested in Maine. Most were transferred to the facility from out of state, and they are often quickly transferred out, too.
Federal authorities may move people for any number of reasons — space, staffing — but legal experts say regardless of intent, this movement creates chaos and makes it more difficult for legal counsel to advocate for their clients and for families to keep in touch. 
That is the broader system Cumberland County Jail is a part of, Cron said. 
“We’ve heard a lot of language about, ‘Oh well, my hands are tied’ and ‘this is the way things are done,’” Cron said. “As community members, as lawmakers, we need to work together to figure out how to make policies and laws align with our values and what we will allow within communities, and not the other way around.”

Returning proposal 
Two of the most hotly debated bills last session were introduced in tandem, offering a two-pronged approach to prevent local and state police from taking on the work of federal immigration enforcement. 
LD 1971, now slated to become law, set limits regardless of formal partnerships with federal authorities. The other, LD 1259, would explicitly prohibit state and local law enforcement agencies from entering into contracts with federal immigration enforcement authorities, such as 287(g) agreements. 
“This win for LD 1971, this promise that it will go into law is absolutely a vital step. It’s a huge win,” said Rep. Ambureen Rana (D-Bangor). “But, there is still work to be done.” 
Rana, the sponsor of LD 1259, says her bill is still needed. She plans for it to remain the same, though noted she’s open to adjustments as long as its intention isn’t altered. 
Elsewhere in the country, participation in ICE’s 287(g) program has been growing since Trump revived it to bolster ICE’s capacity by deputizing local police officers to detain immigrants, an authority otherwise generally reserved to federal authorities. The program was discontinued in 2012 due to the discovery of discriminatory practices such as racial profiling. 
GOP lawmakers in Maine attempted to make it illegal to restrict compliance with immigration enforcement earlier this year, but that proposal failed. 
Wells Police Department was the only Maine agency that opted to join, but the department later ended its contract in October after continuous public opposition. 
Absent official agreements, police in Maine have still looped federal immigration authorities into routine work, such as traffic stops, which have resulted in drivers, passengers and people who later arrived at the scene being detained for alleged immigration violations.",https://mainemorningstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/IMG_4503-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-19 04:57:51.703339

I can tell I’m growing older because I instinctively recoil at the number of receipts and checkout terminals that now include a line for tips. You can hardly buy a meal, drink or some kind of personal service without also being asked to judge someone via gratuity. That’s the kind of complaint that my forefathers and foremothers in the column writing business would have chewed over to their obvious delight in the 1960s or 1970s.

Little things
Small essays on simple subjects.

But take a look at that Kansas minimum wage, still stuck at $7.25 an hour. That works out to $290 a week, or $15,080 per year, both before taxes and assuming you work full time. Meanwhile, according to Forbes, it costs an average of $35,185 a year to live in the Sunflower State.
Those whose income includes tips, meanwhile, can receive a far lower hourly wage — tips are meant to make up the difference.
So pay up, my friends.
I’m old enough to remember when the adults around me considered a 10% tip adequate. Within my quarter-century as an adult, that percentage shifted upward to 15%. At least since the COVID-19 pandemic, a basic tip among civilized folk has hovered at 20%.
This leads to surprising difficulties with arithmetic. Once can figure out 10% easily enough — 15% means a dollar or two above whatever you were going to tip. But calculating 20% requires mental multiplication. Depending on your comfort level with times tables, that’s a challenge.
Those gratuities can also ding the proverbial pocketbook. A dinner for two at mid-level restaurant can easily top $50. A 20% tip, at a minimum means, $10 extra. If you go to a truly nice place or receive exceptional service anywhere, you’ll probably want to throw in a few dollars extra.
We have shifted from tipping being a way to reward exceptional service to an expected charge supporting service workers. In Europe, locals don’t tip much or at all. But companies also pay living wages there. As a U.S. consumer, I’m willing to help make up the difference. 
If the pandemic didn’t teach us any other lessons, it surely proved that those who deliver food orders and shop for us at grocery stores deserve more than the minimum. Period.
Perhaps as a result, we’ve seen tipping spread through the culture like a gelatinous blob.
“The reason people believe this is because it’s true,” Cornell University professor Mike Lynn told AARP. “They’re being asked by more people to leave tips and asked to leave larger amounts.”
That doesn’t mean anyone has to enjoy tipping. I suspect the problem comes down to giving people too much choice. Few of us mind fuel taxes, because service stations include them in the cost of a gallon of gas. Likewise, those with mortgages might notice property taxes less because banks add them to monthly payments. Retirees who own their houses outright pay those taxes separately — and they sure notice them.
In a perfect world, businesses would pay workers what they’re worth. Innumerable tip lines and required calculations would disappear. Just think: The people we rely upon across society to serve us could afford to live in that society!
Tipping might just return to its status as a recognition of superior service.
We don’t live in a perfect world, though. Suck it up and help pay people what they’re worth. They’re only your fellow human beings.

Too few people know about it.,"Guest Commentary written by

Janice Grandi is a primary care physician working in geriatrics


You’ve likely never heard of PACE, but for thousands of California seniors, it’s the reason they’re still living at home. 
PACE stands for Program of All Inclusive Care for the Elderly, and it is an effective option to support older adults whose goal is to safely age in their own homes. As a physician focused on the field of geriatric medicine (a specialty focused on caring for older adults), I believe in the power of PACE. Unfortunately, it remains one of the most underutilized resources in our long-term care system. Although there are several reasons for this, there also exist several attainable solutions.
Each PACE program is community-based and provides wraparound medical and social services. The goal is simple but powerful: help seniors age with dignity and independence while remaining in their communities as long as possible and simultaneously reducing hospitalizations. 
Its comprehensive services range from primary care, physical therapy, social work and dental, to transportation, meals, home care and day center activities. 
Some might think PACE seems too good to be true, that it must be available only to those with ample resources. Well, good news! PACE is funded through Medicare and Medi-Cal, making it a feasible option for a wide range of people. Participants qualify for PACE enrollment if they are 55 or older, live within a PACE program’s service area and need nursing-home-level care. 
PACE sounds nice, but does it actually work? A 2021 study by CalPACE, the state’s PACE advocacy association, found that PACE participants were hospitalized 44% less often than similar non-PACE individuals and had 26% less emergency room usage. Additionally, 98% of PACE participants continued to live in the community, and participants overall experienced lower rates of depression, better medication adherence, and higher satisfaction with care. 
PACE isn’t just the right thing to do for seniors; it’s smart public policy. With Medi-Cal costs rising and nursing home capacity strained, PACE relieves stress on the elder care system and budget. For example, PACE enrollment saved California taxpayers $369.4 million in 2024 alone.
Why then are only about 10% of eligible older adults enrolled in PACE? 
Unfortunately, PACE remains limited by geography, infrastructure and awareness. Thus far PACE serves less than half of California counties. And starting a PACE program requires significant upfront investment and navigating complex state and federal licensing processes.
Even where programs do exist, many eligible seniors, caregivers and healthcare providers don’t know about them. To improve access and use, we should consider focusing state-level funding to help new PACE programs launch — especially in underserved areas — and on streamlining the approval process for PACE centers and investing in outreach to families, caregivers and healthcare professionals.
With nearly one in four Californians projected to be over age 60 by 2030, it’s time to take action and invest in more effective and compassionate care models. 
Models like PACE hold out hope for a future where every older adult can age with the support, grace and respect they deserve.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/060723-Grace-Diaz-Caregiver-LJ-CM-20.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-12-19 08:59:29.039645

In California in 2025, having a landlord has its perks.","In summary
For generations it’s been a near article of faith that homeownership beats out being a renter. In California in 2025, having a landlord has its perks.


It’s the benchmark of success, a milestone of responsible adulthood, a time-tested way to amass wealth for you and your progeny. Homeownership, we’re told again and again, is a status that every right-thinking person should aspire to — the white-picket-fence-fronted embodiment of the American Dream.
But what if it’s also a little overrated?
For generations it has been taken as a near article of faith across the country that ownership is both the financially and socially superior way to inhabit a home and that public policy makers should always promote it. California legislators and housing advocates spent this past year enacting sweeping policies aimed at making it easier to build housing of all kinds. This coming year, many of them indicate that they plan to focus specifically on providing more plentiful paths to homeownership. 
They’ll have their work cut out for them.
The state’s homeownership rate of roughly 55% is second lowest in the nation, above New York, and a full 10 percentage points beneath the national average. Most of that gap, both common sense and researchers at UC Berkeley tell us, isn’t the result of an atypical fondness for the freedoms of renting but comes down to the price tag. The median price of a detached single-family home across in the United States is $426,800. In California, it’s $852,680. In San Francisco it’s well over $1 million.
With borrowing rates still hovering above 6%, those prices translate to estimated monthly mortgage costs between $4,000 to $6,000 or more. Even in all but the toniest neighborhoods of coastal California, that’s far above the cost of renting a typical apartment. In Orange County, the estimated all-in monthly costs on a home (including taxes, insurance, maintenance and any association fees) is four times the average rent, according to a recent analysis by the commercial real estate firm CBRE. In Los Angeles and San Francisco, the “buying premium” is three times greater than renting. Nationally, it’s twice as much.

Is the extra cost worth it? 
Economists and housing finance experts are careful to note that it depends — on a person’s financial circumstances, the particulars of their preferences and the market in which they want to live, how long they plan to occupy a home and, most challenging of all, what the future holds.
But across the country, the gap between renting and owning is “way out of line” with the historic norm, said Laurie Goodman, an economist at the Urban Institute, a liberal-leaning thinktank in Washington D.C. 
In 2018, Goodman co-authored a paper on homeownership in the United States, which came to the fairly unambiguous conclusion that most people most of the time would be better off buying a home (assuming they can afford the monthly payments) compared to renting. 
“Homeownership is not the universal panacea, but the financial returns on homeownership have been more beneficial than renting for most homeowners and will likely remain so if current patterns continue,” Goodman wrote in a corresponding blog post at the time.
Current patterns did not continue: Today we see dizzying prices and interest rates and flat rents in most places. Homeownership isn’t nearly the financial slam dunk it once was, she said.
Take a market like San Francisco. The average price of an admittedly rare single-family home in the city is $1.38 million, according to Zillow. Depending on the size of a buyer’s downpayment, that would work out to a monthly loan payment of roughly $6,500. The average rent for one is $4,350. 
In order for all those extra monthly payments to eventually pay off, the value of the house will need to soar vertiginously into the indefinite future. Or rents, which determine how much a person can save by not buying, will need to shoot up as well. Or the stock market or other possible places a well-heeled renter could park all the extra money they aren’t spending on a mortgage, will need to flatline. 
Or a combination of all of the above. 
A person buying into that market is assuming a very specific and by no means certain version of the financial future, said Goodman. 
Either that, or they’re just “desperate to own in San Francisco because they’re just desperate to own in San Francisco,” she said. “For whatever reason.”
The case for renting forever
For many Californians, this isn’t actually a decision. The number of renters who can buy locally and get away with spending anything less than 40% of their income on monthly homeownership costs are in the single digit percentages in Los Angeles, San Diego, Riverside, Sacramento, San Jose and Ventura, according to the CBRE report. Being a tenant in California is hard enough. More than half of California renters are spending more than 30% of their income on rent as it is. 
But for those lucky enough to rent by choice, it’s not necessarily a bad choice to make. 
Remember that yawning “buying premium” between the monthly cost of owning and renting? A wealthy tenant is in a position to save and invest the difference. Though homeownership is often touted as the best way to build wealth, it’s not the only way. It might not even be the best way: On average and over long stretches of time, the stock market regularly outperforms median home prices — albeit, without quite so many tax benefits and other boosts that federal and state governments shower upon homeowners. 
Rather than pouring every last dollar in disposable income (and then some) into a single depreciating asset that threatens to leak when it rains, parking that money elsewhere also allows a renter the option to diversify.
“I think more people are starting to be interested in renting and saving at the same time, because they’ve been priced out of owning a home, but they still want to achieve their financial goals and they’re looking into those alternatives and getting more savvy about it,” said Redfin economist Daryl Fairweather.
Running the numbers on whether renting and saving is, in fact, the better financial call gets very “murky,” she said. Much of it depends on the future of home prices, local rents, stock prices, interest rates and how long a person plans to stay put. It’s a hugely complex and individual choice and it’s not risk-free. Fairweather touted an online rent-vs-buy calculator produced by the New York Times.
But California’s specific conditions — high prices relative to rents, high maintenance and insurance costs, the relatively large number of tenants protected by rent control policies of one kind or another — the financial argument for renting may be about as good as it’s ever been.
The perks of owning property
Even if renting is a better deal on paper, there are plenty of reasons someone might want to buy that have nothing to do with money.
Space is one: For a host of regulatory and financial reasons, the vast majority of rental units are apartments while detached single-family houses are predominantly reserved for owners. Especially for growing families, the option is often either to cram your spouse and kids into an urban apartment or drive out of the city (and possibly out of the state) until you can afford to buy.

Education is another. Rentals are also more likely than owner-occupied units to be in neighborhoods with poorly performing public schools and elevated crime rates.
For some, homeownership also comes with an entirely non-monetary warm and fuzzy factor, whether it’s independence — deciding when and what color to paint your walls, for instance — or a sense of security.
Finally, just because someone can save and invest the extra hundreds or thousands of dollars a month that would have gone to a mortgage payment, that doesn’t mean they will. No one likes making a mortgage payment, but by converting part of your paycheck each month into home equity, it acts as a kind of forced savings plan. It’s perpetually tempting not to save.
“It takes more discipline to go against the social trend,” said Fairweather.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/09042020_Housing_TK_01.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-12-19 08:59:29.039645

Por temor a compartir información confidencial, los trabajadores agrícolas de California comenzaron a evitar las clínicas médicas móviles tras la toma de posesión del presidente Trump. “Hay mucha desconfianza”, declaró un médico del condado de Fresno. 


This article is also available in English. Read it here.
En un caluroso día de verano, decenas de jornaleros hicieron una pausa en su trabajo de recolección de chiles banana en un campo remoto a 42 kilómetros de Fresno para acudir a una clínica médica temporal. Era una oportunidad para recoger medicamentos y hacerse evaluaciones básicas de salud, como medir la presión arterial y controlar la glucosa.
 Durante casi una década, la Universidad de California en San Francisco ha estado desplegando clínicas móviles como ésta en el condado rural de Fresno para apoyar a una población de inmigrantes no autorizados de difícil acceso que de otro modo evitarían la atención médica de rutina.
 El programa cobró impulso durante la pandemia de COVID-19 y durante la década que California extendió la atención médica a los inmigrantes que se encuentran en el país sin autorización. Pero este año, los médicos están empezando a notar que los trabajadores no acuden a recibir atención como antes.
 Los médicos perciben que la disminución en la participación está relacionada con la agresiva aplicación de las leyes migratorias de la administración Trump. El Dr. Kenny Banh, director de la clínica móvil de salud de la UCSF, afirmó que las visitas de pacientes a sus unidades móviles rurales de salud comenzaron a disminuir a principios de año, cuando el presidente Donald Trump asumió su segundo mandato y prometió tomar medidas drásticas contra la inmigración ilegal.
“Hay mucha desconfianza. Vengo de la universidad y llevo una bata blanca; la gente está preocupada. Hacemos todo lo posible por explicarles cómo protegemos sus datos”, dijo Banh.

Según la UCSF, las visitas a sus clínicas móviles se redujeron en aproximadamente un 36% a medida que aumentaban las operaciones de control migratorio en California. En 2024, las clínicas móviles atendían un promedio de 34 pacientes por visita, pero en los últimos meses, la cantidad de pacientes se ha reducido a aproximadamente 22. Las personas también están menos dispuestas a inscribirse en Medi-Cal , el programa estatal de seguro médico para hogares de bajos ingresos, por temor a compartir sus datos con el gobierno si no están autorizadas a permanecer en el país, explicó Banh.
La situación podría empeorar.
California redujo la ley que permite a todos los residentes elegibles por ingresos —independientemente de su estatus migratorio— recibir seguro médico a través de Medi-Cal al limitar temporalmente la inscripción para el próximo año. Además, los condados se preparan para recortes a Medicaid bajo la ley presupuestaria que Trump firmó a principios de este año, la cual, según afirman, les dificultará mantener programas que atienden a poblaciones específicas, como el que brinda atención médica a los trabajadores agrícolas rurales.
 “Va a ser más restrictivo en cuanto a requisitos laborales, reinscripciones más regulares y requisitos más estrictos para que los estados cumplan con los mandatos federales”, dijo Maria-Elena De Trinidad Young, profesora asociada de salud pública en UC Merced. “Esto es una medida de presión. La política está diseñada para restringir el acceso a Medicaid, o como saben, en California lo llamamos Medi-Cal”.

 Llevando atención sanitaria a comunidades remotas
 La clínica móvil que dirige Banh forma parte de una iniciativa más amplia del Departamento de Salud Pública de Fresno para reducir las enfermedades crónicas y transmisibles en las poblaciones de difícil acceso del condado. Recientemente, obtuvo financiación gracias a una ley de ayuda por la COVID-19 que el condado de Fresno destinó a las clínicas, dirigidas por la UCSF y el Centro Médico Saint Agnes.
El dinero destinado al COVID-19 se está agotando, pero el programa tiene otro año de financiación asegurado.

 Las clínicas de ambas organizaciones se pueden encontrar en eventos comunitarios, campañas de distribución de alimentos en comunidades rurales, escuelas y, a veces, en granjas. La clínica móvil de Santa Inés cuenta con dos salas de examen para la atención de los pacientes.

 Según Ivonne Der Torosian, vicepresidenta de salud y bienestar comunitario del Centro Médico Saint Agnes, el programa está diseñado para brindarles a los estudiantes de medicina la oportunidad de servir a la comunidad y crear acceso a la atención médica.
“Tenemos un contrato explícito para ir al condado rural de Fresno y atender a los trabajadores agrícolas, asociarnos con los empleadores de esos trabajadores agrícolas y también brindar servicios a sus familias”, dijo Der Torosian.

Los trabajadores de salud comunitarios también brindan educación sanitaria y refieren a los que no pueden recibir tratamiento en el lugar a proveedores de atención primaria cercanos.
 “Realizamos evaluaciones básicas, incluyendo atención primaria y preventiva, para muchas de las familias a las que atendemos. Buscamos conectarlas con proveedores de atención primaria”, dijo Der Torosiran. “Les proporcionamos vacunas, les monitorizamos la glucosa y revisamos sus niveles de hipertensión y presión arterial. Son servicios básicos que recibirían en un centro de atención primaria”.

 No hay hospital cercano
 La Dra. Navdeep Lehga, médica residente, comenzó recientemente un turno en la unidad médica de Saint Agnes en el Parque Rojas Pierce de Mendota. Es una comunidad agrícola a menos de una hora al oeste de Fresno. Una fila de personas la esperaba en la acera para recoger alimentos del centro de distribución y para verla a ella y a su equipo para un chequeo.

A medida que avanzaba la mañana, Lehga atendía a un paciente tras otro en la sala de exámenes de la clínica móvil o salía a ver a los pacientes en el estacionamiento, controlando la presión arterial con un medidor en los brazos de sus pacientes y los niveles de glucosa con pinchazos en los dedos.

Lehga dijo que la mayoría de los pacientes que atiende son trabajadores agrícolas e inmigrantes. Gran parte de la población rural no tiene fácil acceso a la atención médica; el hospital más cercano está a 56 kilómetros. Algunos de sus pacientes pueden recurrir a la ambulancia para recibir atención primaria porque no saben adónde ir.
“Por eso vienen aquí. Les contamos lo esencial de lo que está pasando. Pero tenemos suministros limitados y lo que podemos verificar”, dijo.
Lehga afirma que la cantidad de personas que acuden ha disminuido desde que se intensificaron las medidas de control migratorio. Ha escuchado a pacientes hablar con el personal durante la sesión de admisión sobre sus temores de acudir a la camioneta y buscar atención médica después de un verano de intensas redadas migratorias.

 “Nos dimos cuenta de que antes venían muchos más pacientes, pero se asustaron y no querían venir porque no sabían quién vendría”, dijo Lehga. “Antes se sentían cómodos porque sabían que era seguro. Ahora creo que los pacientes, en general, tienen más miedo de venir simplemente porque no saben quién puede venir”.
 La Dra. Arianna Crediford, médica residente principal de Fresno St. Agnes Rural Mobile Health, dijo que las visitas a la camioneta han disminuido entre un 15 y un 20% este año.
 “Podemos especular que se debe a los problemas con la inmigración en este momento, que parecen tener una gran influencia en los trabajadores agrícolas y el envasado de alimentos”, dijo.
 Crediford dijo que ha escuchado a algunos pacientes mencionar la preocupación de buscar atención médica y lo que eso podría implicar para ellos, pero han dejado en claro que no recopilan información de inmigración y que no necesitan hablar con ellos sobre eso en absoluto.

“La idea de que las personas tengan que tener miedo de recibir atención médica es desgarradora. Realmente pondría en riesgo sus condiciones de salud, condiciones que requieren seguimiento semanal, a veces mensual. Somos la última línea de defensa a la que pueden acudir, además de las salas de emergencia, cuando llegan con un evento que pone en peligro su vida. El día que esta población no pueda buscar atención médica de forma cómoda y segura, su salud estará en peligro por ello”, dijo Crediford.
 La población, que a menudo no cuenta con seguro médico, padece altas tasas de hipertensión, diabetes o hiperglucemia y colesterol alto, a menudo sin tratamiento, afirmó Banh. Con frecuencia, el equipo de salud rural es el único profesional de la salud que atiende a los pacientes.

 Banh afirmó que, al haber menos pacientes que acuden a atención preventiva, las personas inevitablemente enfermarán más y terminarán en urgencias. Esto cuesta más dinero y amenaza con colapsar el sistema de salud.
 “La gente no desaparece porque se cambie la política. Siguen necesitando atención. Lo que se está haciendo es retrasar la atención hasta que los resultados sean peores, y no hay mucho que se pueda hacer salvo hospitalizar al paciente”, dijo.

(Photo by MIchael Moline/Florida Phoenix)Niki Isaak was approximately 33 miles into the Central Florida Classic bike ride near Brooksville in October when a group of motorcyclists entered the bike path and began riding dangerously close to her.
Despite there being a wide-open road, one motorcyclist narrowly passed Isaak on the right shoulder, another pinned her in on the left, and a third finally hit her from behind.
The sudden impact smashed her body to the ground, puncturing her anal canal and fracturing her tailbone, among other injuries. She was immediately rushed to HCA Florida Bayonet Point Hospital, where she remained in the trauma center for three days before being released to return to her home in Fort Myers.
Two months later, she is still doing physical therapy and has created a GoFundMe page to help with the medical bills now totaling more than $400,000 as she tries to pick up the pieces in her life.
“The impact is so big,” she said in a Zoom conversation last month. “It’s ruined our lives in so many ways, and we don’t even know the outcome. I just hope people can see that it’s just getting worse.”
Despite the seriousness of the accident, the offending motorcyclist was only charged with a citation for careless driving, a moving violation.
Frustration among cycling advocates 
“What is the response of the local law enforcement officers? Nothing,” fumes Matt Scarborough, Isaak’s attorney who specializes in defending cyclists involved in accidents. “We’re seeing in my practice that cyclists are just being ignored. If this was a motor vehicle vs. another motor vehicle causing this much damage to somebody, I think it would be a much different story.”
One of Scarborough’s other cases involves pro triathlete Gabrielle Suver, who was cycling along the side of a county road in Lake County on  Nov. 15 when a driver sideswiped her, resulting in a broken back, a fractured neck, a broken leg, fractured kneecap, liver laceration, scapula and sternum fractures and concussion, according to WESH-TV. She was released from the hospital this past Sunday after 28 days.
For decades, Florida’s roads have been listed as the most dangerous in the nation for pedestrians and bicyclists, and there has certainly been more awareness regarding safety concerns in the Sunshine State. But observers lament that conditions aren’t getting better.
A recently released report from the Bicycle Accident Lawyers group concluded that Florida remains the most dangerous state in the nation for bicyclists, looking at combined 2022 and 2023 data. And there were another 207 bicycle fatalities in 2024, according to the Florida Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles.
These troubling statistics continue despite the fact that Florida lawmakers in 2006 passed a law requiring motorists to give cyclists at least three feet of space when driving along or passing them.
Cynics question how often that’s being enforced. Just 130 motorists were cited for violating that law in 2024, according to the annual uniform traffic citation report produced by the state.
Florida’s 3 foot rule
“The 3-foot rule is not the 3-foot rule,” says Tampa attorney Steele Olmstead, who has represented injured cyclists. “The statute says that the motorist has to pass at a safe distance. Not less than 3 feet? Well, cops fall back on that and go, ‘Oh, well. I can’t get out and measure it. I couldn’t tell whether it was 3 feet or not.”
Florida statute 316.083 (2) says that that any driver overtaking a bicycle or other nonmotorized vehicle or an electric bicycle occupying the travel lane must pass that vehicle “at a safe distance of not less than 3 feet or, if such movement cannot be safely accomplished, must remain at a safe distance behind the bicycle or other nonmotorized vehicle or electric bicycle until the driver can safely pass at a distance of not less than 3 feet and must safely clear the overtaken bicycle or other nonmotorized vehicle or electric bicycle.”
Olmstead says he “might have” won one case over the past decade in which a motorist received a ticket for unsafe passing.
Officials say increasing bicycle deaths is a national problem but note that there is a greater proximity to higher speed roads in Florida.
“There’s often a transition from a 20-25 miles per hour neighborhood development that’s relatively self-contained or something like a quasi-gated community, and then you’re immediately on a 45 mph road,” said Ken McLeod, policy director for the League of American Bicyclists. “And at 45 mph, any mistake by a driver is more likely to cause a death for a person biking or walking.”
And while more Florida cities have incorporated separated paths for people to bike and walk, there remain plenty of unprotected bike lanes. “All it takes is driver looking down at their phone and drifting down into the bike lane at 45 mph, and you have a crash that could be a fatality, because you have that high speed and that kinetic energy potential is there to cause the death,” McLeod said. “If it was 35 or 30, you have a lower chance of death when that crash occurred.”
The League of American Bicyclists “Benchmarking Report” released in December 2024 showed that the percentages of bicyclist deaths have increased in Florida from an average of 143 between 2014 and 2018 to 197 between 2019 and 2023, a 38% increase.
And, according to preliminary data compiled by the state of Florida, as of Dec. 13, there had been 185 bicycling fatalities this year (along with 9,277 injuries from bicycle crashes).
(A group called “Ghost Bikes” places white-painted bicycles at sites where someone was hit or killed while riding.)
Some law enforcement officials say the fault often lies with cyclists. In a YouTube video posted last month, Pinellas County Sheriff Sgt. Jessica Mackesy said that at least four cyclists were critically injured or killed in crashes with vehicles because they didn’t stop at a stop sign or a red light.
“Physics doesn’t care if you’ve done it 100 times before. A 4,000-pound vehicle versus a bike, there’s only one outcome,” Mackesy said. “And looking both ways isn’t enough when there’s a driver who has the right of way and expects you to stop. Stop means stop — on the road, on the trail — every time.”
The Florida Department of Transportation last updated its Pedestrian and Bicycle Strategic Safety Plan in October 2021. In it, the agency reported that, between 2016 and 2020, 90% of all pedestrian and bicyclist fatalities and serious injuries on state roadways occurred in just 25 of the state’s 67 counties. (The top five counties for fatalities and serious injuries were Miami-Dade, Broward, Orange, Hillsborough, and Duval).
Potential solutions?
Pinellas County Democratic Rep. Lindsay Cross is a cyclist who can be seen riding her bike to the Capitol during the legislative session. She says there are common-sense things that government can do to enhance safety for pedestrians and cyclists, such as creating more protected bike lanes and pedestrian crosswalks, but she believes part of the problem is with how local governments develop communities.

“They’re all focused on having a car,” she said. “People by and large will choose places that are more walkable, that have mixed uses where you can walk to your grocery store or to a coffee shop. People like that, but a lot of the new development doesn’t have that as an option. You’ve got to drive to get into your community. You probably have to go a couple of miles to get to a grocery store.
“Maybe there’s sidewalks in your community, but they’re not leading to anywhere. They’re just a loop within the community. So, I think fundamentally, we need to shift the way our development is happening, so it’s geared towards people moving at a slower pace. Cars are also going to have to slow down and make it safer. That also helps to just enhance our quality of life, make it more accessible for people who are aging to have those options.”
John Sinibaldi Jr. is president of the St. Petersburg Bicycle Club. He has been hit twice by motorists while biking, the last time in 2010 when a collision with a distracted driver led to two lower-back surgeries and two cervical spinal-fusion surgeries. He offers two changes that he thinks could significantly improve bike safety in Florida.
“I would increase communications dramatically between the state and the people who drive on our roads,” said Sinibaldi, whose late father, John Sinibaldi Sr., was a two-time Olympic cyclist in 1932 and 1936. “That would include visual things like billboards and public service announcements on TV. That would  include better driver education before you get your license, [and] driver education when you renew your licenses.”
His other idea is less prescriptive, and more philosophical.
“The second thing is we have to get our local police out of the mindset that if a motorist in a car hits a cyclist, the default option should not be to just assume that the cyclist did something wrong. And yet that’s often the case,” he said.
The Phoenix reached out to law enforcement agencies in Florida for reaction.
“Law enforcement works to enforce the law, and they will treat everyone with respect in that process, that includes both motorists and cyclists,” said Logan Lewkow, deputy executive director of operations for the Florida Sheriffs Association. “You can look around the state — sheriffs’ offices have created visibility enforcement programs specifically to make roads safer for pedestrians and cyclists. The safety of pedestrians and cyclists is very important to law enforcement.”


The Florida Highway Patrol did not respond to a request for comment.

Legislation
The Florida Bicycle Association says its top legislative goal is for the state to pass a comprehensive “Hands Free” law that would make it illegal to hold a phone while operating a motor vehicle. The group says such legislation must go beyond “texting and driving” to encompass all activities that take a driver’s hands and attention away from the road, including scrolling through social media, streaming videos, and any other non-driving activity requiring manual interaction with a handheld device.
Sen. Erin Grall, R-Vero Beach, sponsored a bill to do just that during the 2025 session, which passed in the Senate, 37-9. But its House companion never moved at all.
No similar bill has been filed yet for the 2026 session.
Bills addressing bike safety have been introduced for the coming Florida legislative session, but only regarding electric or e-bikes, a relatively new phenomenon resulting in a spike in injuries around the state.
Lots of people — from kids to seniors — began using e-bikes during the COVID pandemic. “A new subculture” of seniors who never rode a bike before are using e-bikes seeking the freedom they’re looking for, Sinibaldi said, adding that he sees younger people who have lost their licenses or can’t drive for whatever reason who are also using these new bikes.
“They’re terrorizing the Pinellas Trail — there’s no other way to put it — because they don’t know anything about trail etiquette,” he said. The trail occupies old railroad right of way between St. Pete and Tarpon Springs.
A bill (HB 243) sponsored by Republicans Yvette Benarroch from Collier County and Kim Kendall from St. Johns County would require a person using or renting a class 3 electric bike to hold a driver’s license or learner’s permit. Class 3 electric bikes are the fastest legal bikes with a maximum speed of 28 miles per hour. Anyone caught purposefully modifying an E-bike to boost its motor-powered speed would face a fine up to $100. Subsequent violations could go up to $250.
And Hillsborough County Republican state Rep. Susan Valdés filed legislation last week (HB 667) that would require anyone under 18 to wear a helmet while operating or riding an e-bike.",https://floridaphoenix.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/ghostbikeIMG_0918-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-12-19 01:01:04.344058

The crew gathers at your house, and you snap some photos for social media before strolling to your local train station. 
Once aboard you chit-chat placidly while gliding to your destination. There’s no traffic, no missed turns, no endless circling to find a parking spot. After the curtains come down, you wander back to a station and catch the train home, buzzing with excitement right up to the moment your head hits the pillow.

This kind of convenient, safe, and affordable travel should be the norm, but Connecticut’s extant rail network is underutilized. While Gov. Ned Lamont and other state leaders have supported investment in rail improvement projects, ridership remains below pre-pandemic levels. This issue is partly due to limited public awareness. Most Connecticut travelers assume that driving is the only means of reaching their destination, unaware that public transit may be cheaper, is statistically safer, and is always better for the environment. 
If we can get more people to take the train more frequently, they will experience first-hand the efficacy of rail transportation. This awareness will induce a greater public appetite for rail improvements and expansion, which can in turn reduce congestion on our roads, limit deadly car accidents, and lower our state’s carbon footprint. 
To facilitate a higher rate of ridership on existing rail lines, Connecticut should start by subsidizing Metro-North rides to concerts at the Hartford Healthcare Amphitheater in Bridgeport. Riders could simply show their concert ticket to conductors within an hour of an event’s start or conclusion to qualify. 
A similar program already works in Phoenix, AZ, where Valley Metro Light Rail provides free rides to the PHX Arena. Connecticut should study this model with the intent of implementing their own version. Such a program would boost awareness of public transit while reducing post-concert car traffic.
Downtown Bridgeport is the ideal place to implement this transit-oriented policy. The amphitheater was built to serve as a cultural hub, and pedestrian walkways connect the existing Metro-North train station directly to the venue. Despite this, many amphitheater attendees still drive. 
Incentivizing train travel as a cost-efficient alternative to driving would not only streamline concert-goers’ experience but also benefit local businesses, as pedestrians are more likely than motorists to stop at restaurants and shops on their way to and from events. The boost to Bridgeport’s local economy from increased foot traffic would be substantial, accelerating the city’s renewal. 
If successful, the program could be extended to other transit-adjacent venues like College Street Music Hall in New Haven, Fairfield Theater Company, or Waterbury’s Palace Theater. Critics may argue that free train rides are a “handout,” but once people have a pleasant and convenient experience on public transportation they are more inclined to use it again, even when they have to pay. This increase in ridership would generate more revenue, better service, and greater public interest in rail expansion across the state.  More opportunities to take the train means less traffic on roads, which leads to cleaner skies and smaller road maintenance budgets. 
Creed frontman Scott Stapp once asked, “Can you take me higher?” The state of Connecticut can. By offering free train rides to events at Hartford Healthcare Amphitheater, we can elevate our cultural offerings, grow local economies, and raise residents’ quality of life. When we connect the Nutmeg State by rail, there’s nowhere to go but up.

Defeat has taken over my body as my mind gives in to the anxiety of doing a skill I thought I had mastered. Despite being a cheerleader for over a decade, I am hit with a mental block.  
Mental blocks are known to psychologists as lost move syndrome. This is a condition in which an athlete is unable to perform a skill that was once automatic. Mental blocks can be challenging obstacles for cheerleaders and require resilience and patience to overcome.  
This past year I experienced mental blocks. I have been a competitive cheerleader for 14 years and a youth cheer coach for four years.  In all this time, I have never run up against an obstacle as debilitating as a mental block.  



When I became a collegiate cheerleader at Central Connecticut State University, I knew I needed to improve my tumbling skills and to learn a standing back handspring. Every day during the summer, I would practice in my backyard with my sister or dad. After hundreds of tries, I finally was throwing the back handspring with ease. I was proud of my hard work and grateful to do the skill I’d dreamed of.
Until one day I couldn’t.  
At practice I tried to transfer the skill from the cushioned mat onto the hardwood floor in preparation for basketball season. When I began to count myself in like I have done hundreds of times, my body froze up, my mind went blank, panic set in and fear clouded my head. 
I had heard stories of cheerleaders and gymnasts experiencing mental blocks but never imagined it would happen to me. Was all my hard work this summer for nothing? Would I have to start over? Was I no longer good enough to be a college cheerleader? These were the troubling thoughts that flowed through my mind every time I stood at the edge of the blue mat preparing to throw my back handspring.  

Emily Sousa

Many people do not understand the physical and mental demands that go into perfecting competitive cheerleading skills. Cheerleaders are taught to smile and perform no matter what. If the stunt falls, keep going. If you mess up, keep smiling. This pressure of perfection can mask the physical and mental difficulties we athletes face in preparing to take the floor, knowing that we could get hurt. The National Center for Catastrophic Sport Injury Research said that collegiate cheerleading accounted for 70.5% of all female catastrophic sports injuries between 1982 and 2007.  
Lost move syndrome, however, can be overcome. Jada Wooten, featured on Season 2 of the Netflix series “Cheer” was the 2021 NCA Collegiate National Champion with Trinity Valley Community College in Athens, Texas. She said in the YouTube video “How She Overcame Her Mental Block” that after making her dream team and suffering from a mental block, she considered giving up the sport she loved: “So I fought and fought, and yeah, I fell, but I kept fighting. … It was part of my growth. It taught me to keep battling. … I still go through hard times, don’t get me wrong. But I have learned not to fear them.” 
Mental blocks were not the end of my cheerleading journey. I dedicated the following months of practice to regaining my confidence and changing my mindset. I tested my limits and pushed myself beyond my mental barriers.  
By continuing to show up for myself and practicing patience, my hard work paid off. I was able to compete with my back handspring at the National Cheerleaders Association’s College Nationals Championships. 
Mental toughness is still a challenge I work on every day, both on and off the mat. But like Jada Wooten, my experience working through mental blocks has made me into a stronger athlete and individual.

Brown,,,,,https://marylandmatters.org/2025/12/18/transportation-officials-approve-rough-plans-on-chesapeake-bay-bridge-replacement/,The Maryland Transportation Authority Board gave preliminary approval Thursday to a long-range plan to replace the Chesapeake Bay Bridge spans with two parallel spans that would add four driving lanes as well as a shoulder lane in each direction.,"As part of an ongoing study on a third crossing of the Chesapeake Bay, transportation officials are examining possible uses for pedestrians, cyclists and other modes of transit. Photo from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.The Maryland Transportation Authority Board gave preliminary approval Thursday to a long-range plan that would replace the current Chesapeake Bay Bridge spans with two parallel spans that would add four driving lanes as well as a shoulder lane in each direction.
The “alternative C” plan would also raise the bridge height to allow for larger cargo ships to pass under and would cost between $16.1 billion and $17.6 billion if the final design includes “shared-use paths” for bicycles and pedestrians. Dropping that option would save about $1.3 billion from the final cost, according to state estimates.
Choosing the alignment and size of the replacement bridge is just another step in a years-long planning process, that kicks off several more years of hearings and planning on the project that would not begin construction until 2032 at the earliest. ButMdTA Executive Director Bruce Gartner was happy with the progress of the Bay Bridge replacement project that has been decades in the making.
“It’s been an incredibly successful development to get to this point” Gartner said. “This is just another step in the process … But this is a kick-off of really needing to get citizen input on that project.”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Melissa Williams, MdTA’s director of planning and program development, said a new bridge is needed due to the “aging infrastructure” of the current William Lane Preston Jr. Memorial Bridge. Besides the current lanes — two eastbound and three westbound — not being enough to meet current traffic demands, the lack of shoulders does not allow for emergency vehicles to access the bridge easily.
The new design would build a four-lane eastbound span parallel to the current eastbound bridge, which would then be torn down, and the process would be repeated for the westbound bridges. The bridge would also be raised to a 230-foot vertical clearance to allow larger ships through, matching the height of the proposed replacement for the Francis Scott Key Bridge in Baltimore.
Alternative C was the least costly of the seven alternative designs that were under study. Those costs, from $14.8 billion to $17.6 billion, “are planning-level costs estimated in 2025 dollars. These are very preliminary dollars,” Williams reminded the board.
The design plan under consideration also had the least environmental impact compared to other design plans presented to transportation officials. The new bridge could yield between $17 billion and $23 billion into the local economy, and bring in over 61,000 jobs during construction.
MDTA voted unanimously to focus on Alternative C. The next step will be a report on the design’s potential environmental impact, which would be released in January 2026. There will be public hearings in February where Marylanders and other stakeholders can respond to the report.

A final decision on design construction is projected to occur in Spring 2028, with construction beginning around Summer 2032. Williams said it was too early in the project to estimate when completion of the new bridge would occur.
“We are still in the planning phase,” she said. “Once we get our designers on board and our construction team on board, the details of exactly how we move forward, and what the timing would be and the construction sequencing would be, will be ironed out.”
Consideration for the Chesapeake Bay bridge replacement comes at a time when state officials are also working to replace the fallen Francis Scott Key Bridge.
“It’s rather daunting to think about taking on construction of two very large bridges in short periods of time,” said Board Member Cynthia D. Penny-Ardinger. “One due to disaster, and one that’s been in the works for a very long time.”
But she and the other board members were ready to take on the challenge.
“We have a great team, and we can do hard things,” said Chair Samantha J. Biddle. “We can walk and chew gum at the same time.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Chesapeake-Bay-Bridge-1.jpg,,,2025-12-19 07:58:08.119462

(Photo by William J. Ford/Maryland Matters)The board that oversees Maryland’s multibillion-dollar education reform plan formally threw its support Thursday behind a list of legislative priorities adopted last week by the state Board of Education.
The Blueprint for Maryland’s Future Accountability and Implementation Board will back the school board’s three legislative priorities: changing the current star-rating system for schools, also known as the state’s annual report; investing in the professional teacher development program known as coaching; and funding stipends to let experienced principals help mentor aspiring school leaders.
“I sincerely believe that these investments that this body can support now, to ensure that we deliver on the promise of the Blueprint, can restore Maryland as an education destination that is top 10 in the nation,” said state Superintendent Carey Wright, who spoke before the Blueprint board for almost 35 minutes during  Thursday’s online meeting.
“This is so important for us to be able to collectively deliver for the 890,000 kids around the state,” Wright said.
The coaching and principal initiatives were approved in the 2025 legislative session — but without funding — as part of the Excellence in Maryland Public Schools Act. Wright and other education advocates plan to press lawmakers for funding in the 2026 session that starts Jan. 14.
The Academic Excellence Program is a statewide literacy and math instructional coaching program that has as part of its goal “to address persisting achievement gaps and provide additional support to underserved communities.”
The principal initiative is under the Maryland School Leadership Academy that seeks to support and develop education leaders. Stipends would be for experienced principals to mentor aspiring and novice principals in community and low-performing schools.
State Board of Education to study new school rating system, but changes could be years off

In terms of a new rating system to assess student achievement, the state Board of Education reviewed possible changes last week based on a recommendation from the Accountability Advisory Committee to eliminate the current star system. School leaders have said the system, which give schools one to four stars, does not adequately capture the quality of a school, and shortchanges schools with a large number of low-income students.
Educators will be asking for funding for those programs at a difficult time, as lawmakers face a potential $1.5 billion budget deficit for the next fiscal year.
“There may be questions as it relates to the timing, in some degree the cost, because that’s a real challenge for us in this age and time, given the budgetary restraints that we have,” said Blueprint Board President Isiah “Ike” Leggett, who agrees with Wright on the need to invest in those initiatives.
Blueprint board member Robin Werner, director of teaching and learning for Talbot County Public Schools, asked Wright if there’s a strategy for local schools to replace an experienced educator who may leave the classroom to become a coach.
Wright said part of the plan is that any educator who applies to become a coach would have to work in a certain region of the state, which could be in the same or a nearby school district. But she also noted that a superintendent must “agree to sign off on it. If they don’t sign off on it, then that teacher would not be selected from that district.”
Endorsing the school board’s legislative priorities come just weeks after the Blueprint board adopted its own legislative priorities for the 2026 session. Those include an extension of the policy to “hold harmless” funding for multilingual learners, students in poverty and those in special education. That provision, which protects those students from potential per pupil funding cuts, is currently set through fiscal 2027; the board wants it extended through fiscal 2028.
Move-in update
The Accountability and Implementation Board, with more than a dozen people on staff, could be close to moving into its office in Annapolis in March — about a year after a long search secured office space on West Street in Annapolis. The goal then was to have the first workers in the office by fall 2o25.
“Very excited at some point in the spring we can have an in-person board meeting.” AIB Executive Director Rachel Hise told board members.
“I’ll believe it when I see it,” Leggett said.

Wes Moore (D) named Kelly Speakes-Backman the new director of the Maryland Energy Administration on Thursday.
She replaces Paul Pinsky, the long-tenured state legislator who retired as MEA director at the end of November. Speakes-Backman will officially take the post on Christmas Eve, according to a news release from Moore’s administration. Ian Ullman, Pinsky’s longtime aide, has been serving as acting director of the agency since Pinsky’s departure.
Speakes-Backman arrives from Chicago-based energy firm Invenergy, for which she served as executive vice president of public affairs. The company develops and operates about 200 energy generation projects worldwide, including a mixture of natural gas, solar, battery storage, land-based wind and transmission infrastructure.

But in her past, Speakes-Backman worked in government and regulatory spheres, including a stint in former President Joe Biden’s (D) Department of Energy, as principal deputy assistant secretary for the agency’s Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy.
Thursday’s appointment marks Speakes-Backman’s return to state government. From 2011 to 2015, she served as a commissioner on the Maryland Public Service Commission, which is in charge of regulating utilities and their rates. Before that, she was the director of clean energy at the Maryland Energy Administration.
The Energy Administration focuses on promoting clean and affordable energy in Maryland, and doles out about $200 million annually in energy-related grants and rebates to Maryland residents, communities, nonprofit organizations and businesses.
Moore taps former FAA administrator for MDOT
Moore on Thursday also announced the appointment of Kathryn “Katie” Thomson as his new state transportation secretary.
“Maryland is at a critical juncture—we must tackle significant challenges in infrastructure modernization, resilience, and reliability, all at the same time. I am confident that Katie Thomson will help us achieve each of these goals, with capable stewardship and effective leadership,” Moore said in a statement. “Katie is a world-class public servant who has managed some of the most complex transportation systems in the country. She is uniquely up to the task of leading the department as we continue our work to leave no one behind.”
Moore described Thomson, who starts Jan. 7, as a veteran of the U.S. Department of Transportation.
She worked for nearly 19 years as an attorney and later partner at Sidley Austin, an environmental law practice. She left that position in 2009 to become principal adviser to Ray LaHood, transportation secretary under President Barack Obama. Three years later she was named chief legal counsel to the Federal Aviation Administration. She later was named general counsel to the federal DOT and a special adviser to the secretary for Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority oversight.
Her resume also includes time as an attorney with the Transportation Group and vice president and general counsel at Amazon on worldwide transportation and sustainability, before returning to the federal DOT, where she held three positions over three years, most recently as deputy administrator of the FAA.
For the last nine months she’s worked at Duncan Park Strategies, a transportation and aerospace consulting firm she founded.
Thomson takes over from Samantha Biddle, a longtime veteran of the Maryland DOT who has served as acting state transportation secretary for the last five months, after former Secretary Paul Wiedefeld retired Aug. 1. .
Changes afoot in Speaker’s office
With a new leader of the House, changes are expected. House Speaker Joseline Peña-Melnyk appears to be wasting little time putting her stamp on her new job.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLEPeña-Melnyk was elected speaker Tuesday. During that special session, she announced the creation of a seventh standing committee, splitting Health and Government Operations in two, cleaving Health from Government Operations.
Members and leaders of the committee have yet to be named. It’s expected the new committees will also require some subject matter shuffling.
Soon after that special session, Peña-Melnyk also made personnel changes, removing Chief of Staff Matt Jackson, Deputy Chief of Staff Michelle Lambert and Marty McGowan, communications director.
Press inquiries were referred to Michell Firmin, who served as assistant to Peña-Melnyk when she chaired the Health and Government Operations Committee.
“As you may know, this is a period of transition, and I am currently finalizing my team,” Peña-Melnyk said in a text response to questions from a reporter. “Once staffing decisions are complete, my office will issue formal notice and corresponding communications. Thank you for the grace.”
Another kind of government shutdown
There’s a good chance no one’s going to try to block this government shutdown.
President Donald Trump (R) signed an executive order Thursday giving federal workers the day off on both Christmas Eve and the day after Christmas. That means federal workers — those who haven’t been RIFed yet, at least — will have just a two-day workweek next week.
While it’s not unheard of for presidents to give federal workers an extra day before or after Christmas, depending on the day of the week the holiday falls on, giving both is unusual. The executive order is subject to the usual boilerplate about agency heads being able to override the order for offices that need to stay open through the holiday.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/54975093807_994f7113d8_o-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-19 08:59:29.039645

Alander Rocha/Georgia RecorderState regulators are set to vote Friday on a massive energy capacity request from Georgia Power that proponents say protects ratepayers but environmental and consumer groups warn relies on uncertain data center demand, which critics say could cost customers billions.
The Georgia Public Service Commission is considering the utility’s request to approve nearly 10,000 megawatts of new energy infrastructure, roughly five Hoover Dams’ worth of energy, primarily to serve a projected surge in data centers. Commission staff and Georgia Power recently reached an agreement that allows the utility to proceed with its full request under specific conditions. Under the deal, the utility has agreed to protect existing customers from rate increases until 2031 if the projected data center boom fails to materialize.
“Staff now supports the stipulation with Georgia Power, which addresses the core concern of protecting ratepayers from speculative load forecasts,” said PSC Electric Unit Director Robert Trokey at the Dec. 10 hearing.

Trokey and other commission staff testified that the provision allows at least $8.50 per month in “downward pressure” on residential rates during this period, even if the spike in demand does not materialize as forecasted, and that Georgia Power would assume financial risk through 2031.
Before the agreement was made public, commission staff recommended a more conservative approach, approving only one-third of the utility’s 10,000-megawatt request and giving conditional approval to another third.
Last-minute surprise agreement with Georgia Power is met with outrage at regulatory hearing

Environmental and consumer advocacy groups, including the Southern Environmental Law Center, Georgia Interfaith Power and Light and Southface Institute, are asking the commission to reject the plan. In a closing brief, the groups argued that, with interest included, customers could end up paying as much as $60 billion of the cost of building out the massive energy infrastructure. The groups also argued that the protections in the agreement are insufficient, warning the commission that overbuilding for data centers that may never materialize is a risk to its customers.
“This 10,000 megawatt request is not about reliability, or the risk of blackouts; it is about on what ‘timeline’ Georgia Power may accommodate prospective new large load customers,” the SELC wrote in its filing ahead of the vote. “For existing customers in Georgia Power’s territory, the risk of underbuilding — which only arises if Georgia Power chooses to cancel a conditionally certified resource — is that Georgia Power may have to ask prospective customers for a longer load ramp, something they already are doing.”
A new report commissioned by SELC and produced by Greenlink Analytics and Science for Georgia challenges the utility’s energy demand projections, suggesting they are statistically improbable. The report indicates that Georgia Power is basing its 10,000-megawatt request on a highly improbable 1-in-500 scenario, asking for more capacity alone than the 2,400 to 6,700 megawatts of growth they projected for the entire Southeast.
“Infrastructure planning or investment decisions that rely on high demand forecasts risk driving unnecessary investments and infrastructure,” according to the report. “We recommend healthy skepticism of aggressive utility forecasts to avoid underutilized or stranded assets and increased retail electricity costs for ratepayers.”",https://georgiarecorder.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/DSC06774-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-18 21:58:37.232665

One of the most notable wreath laying ceremonies this year was in Sunset, Utah, where for the first time the day was honored at the site of the Agent Orange Memorial in Sunset Veterans Park. 
The official groundbreaking ceremony for the Agent Orange Memorial took place on Nov. 15. The monument’s construction began two days later and is still in progress. 
Even though the memorial has not yet been completed, the Utah Agent Orange Veterans Foundation (UAOVF) scheduled a wreath laying ceremony to honor victims of Agent Orange and other toxic chemicals. 
Those victims number in the hundreds of thousands and include Vietnam veterans, Gulf War veterans, and post-9/11 veterans. Service members from all three groups were exposed to extremely hazardous chemicals. 
An information stand located in front of the Agent Orange Memorial contains details about veterans exposed to toxic chemicals. Those details indicate where chemical exposure occurred and other relevant data. 
Some of the information provided at the memorial site relates to Vietnam veteran Larry Kerr, founder and chairman of the UAOVF. This is due to Larry’s exposure to Agent Orange during his service in Vietnam. 
As one consequence of Larry’s exposure to toxic herbicides sprayed in Vietnam, his voice is not quite what it used to be. As he spoke at the ceremony, however, Larry gave a voice to countless Agent Orange victims who no longer have one. 
Larry also played a major role in planning the wreath laying ceremony, where an appropriately decorated wreath was placed in front of the information stand with the solemnity fitting such a revered occasion.
While the wreath laying ceremony was brief, its significance endures.

Pete Ricketts for his work attracting out-of-state law enforcement officers. (Aaron Sanderford/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — Nebraska Attorney General Mike Hilgers criticized President Donald Trump’s efforts to loosen federal restrictions on marijuana as local advocates applauded the change.
Trump, via a new executive order he signed Thursday, seeks to expedite a move started under President Joe Biden to federally downgrade marijuana from a Schedule I to a Schedule III drug. Schedule I drugs, such as heroin, LSD, ecstasy and peyote, are drugs the federal government has classified with a high likelihood of abuse and no currently accepted medical value.
Schedule III drugs are defined as those with moderate to low potential for physical and psychological dependence, such as Tylenol with codeine, ketamine, anabolic steroids and testosterone.
Trump signs order to loosen federal restrictions on marijuana, but it’s still illegal

Trump’s order directs U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi to “take all necessary steps” to complete the rulemaking process related to rescheduling marijuana and to do so in the “most expeditious manner” possible.
“We will evaluate the order closely to determine how we can best continue to engage, protect the public health, and ensure the safety of our citizens,” Hilgers and seven other Republican attorneys general said in a joint statement.
Hilgers was joined by attorneys general from Indiana, Iowa, Idaho, Kansas, Louisiana, Oklahoma and Wyoming. 
In Thursday’s joint statement, the attorneys said they had argued against rescheduling for years. The officials also said they believe science around marijuana shows it is correctly listed as a Schedule I drug and that they have “seen firsthand the harm the drug has caused in our communities.”
“The negative impacts of expanded marijuana use, especially on children and adolescents, are worrisome,” the attorneys general said.
Last year, Hilgers’ office, on behalf of Nebraska and 10 other states, submitted a public comment against rescheduling.

Meanwhile, Nebraskans for Medical Marijuana, which ushered in two laws through Nebraska ballot measures in 2024 to legalize and regulate the drug as medicine, applauded the move and said it recognizes the medical value of cannabis, corrects “false narratives” around addiction and allows “long-overdue” research.
“With marijuana now rescheduled, the excuses for inaction are gone, and state leaders can no longer hide behind scheduling as a reason to do nothing,” said Crista Eggers, executive director of the organization.
The order “doesn’t legalize marijuana in any way, shape or form and in no way sanctions its use as a recreational drug,” Trump said Thursday. “Just as the prescription painkillers may have legitimate uses, but can also do irreversible damage … it’s never safe to use powerful controlled substances in recreational matters.”
Trump’s executive order cites a U.S. Department of Health and Human Services determination that marijuana has medical uses, based on a finding that more than 30,000 health practitioners across 43 U.S. jurisdictions are authorized to recommend medical marijuana. The drug has been recommended to more than 6 million registered patients for at least 15 medical conditions, the order states.
Trump also cited a finding by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for using marijuana to treat pain, anorexia in some situations and nausea or vomiting induced by chemotherapy.
Earlier this week, U.S. Sen. Pete Ricketts, R-Neb., joined 21 other Senate Republicans urging Trump not to reclassify marijuana. Ricketts has long opposed marijuana and, in 2021, made national headlines when he said, “If you legalize marijuana, you’re gonna kill your kids.”

The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration says no deaths from overdose of marijuana have been reported. National critics, including Hilgers, have said the drug has broader harms.
“We cannot reindustrialize America if we encourage marijuana use,” Ricketts told 10/11 on Thursday. “This change could put our roads, workplaces and communities at risk. Those pushing this are giving bad advice.”
The continued fight could matter in Nebraska, as a voter-created commission, appointees of Gov. Jim Pillen, continues to write rules and regulations around the medicine. The Nebraska Legislature might also act in 2026.
Marijuana could also matter electorally. Jacy Todd of York, a challenger to Pillen in the 2026 Republican gubernatorial primary, helped the 2024 medical cannabis campaign, and possible rematch candidate Charles Herbster — who has not yet entered the race — has sharply criticized Pillen on marijuana. 
Dan Osborn of Omaha, a registered nonpartisan challenging Ricketts in the 2026 U.S. Senate race, has pointed to their differences on marijuana.
“I’m not sure what Pete is smoking, since it’s apparently not weed, but these 1930s-style scare tactics and the prohibition of cannabis has only harmed patients and caregivers,” Osborn said Thursday in a campaign statement. “Grow up, Pete.”
Eggers said her group looks forward to working with Hilgers, Pillen and Ricketts “to ensure Nebraska reflects science, supports patients and adheres to voters’ mandate.”

(Photo by Yereth Rosen/Alaska Beacon)Alaska Attorney general-designee Stephen Cox is asking two of Alaska’s largest electrical utilities to reconsider years-old charity programs that have benefited local nonprofits.
In a pair of letters sent to Golden Valley Electric Association and Matanuska Electric Association on Thursday, Cox says he believes their charitable round-up programs may violate state law and the U.S. Constitution.
“My office is not asking for Operation RoundUp to be discontinued, but rather reformed so that it fully honors transparency, consumer rights, and constitutional rights,” Cox wrote in the letter to MEA CEO Tony Izzo.
The Department of Law sent copies of the letters to the Alaska Beacon in response to questions about why the attorney general had raised concerns about a proposed program by Chugach Electric but not two older, already-operating programs elsewhere in the state.
In its newsletter to consumers this month, Chugach Electric Association — the state’s largest electrical cooperative — said it was continuing an indefinite suspension of its planned “Cents of Community” effort because of “legal concerns raised by the Alaska attorney general.”
“The Attorney General’s Office previously took no action against similar programs operated by Matanuska Electric Association Inc. and Golden Valley Electric Association Inc., for more than 15 years,” the newsletter stated.
All three utilities are member-owned and -governed, and in all three cases, members voted to install programs that round up utility bills to the next dollar. Proceeds from that rounding are collected and distributed to nonprofits chosen by the utilities.
In each case, the programs are opt-out — members are automatically enrolled but can unsubscribe from the round-up program if they want to. 
In 2023, when Chugach Electric customers were asked about the program, it was described as “all in,” and members approved it by a wide margin.
Similar programs are common across the country. When GVEA created its Good¢ents program in 2011, more than 260 electrical cooperatives had similar programs, said GVEA spokeswoman Ashley Bradish.
“Over half of GVEA’s membership opt to round-up their monthly bill and their small change continues to make a big impact on the communities we serve,” she said by email.
Altogether, GVEA’s program has distributed almost $1.9 million to a variety of nonprofits in the Fairbanks area. Recipients are chosen by a volunteer, six-member board.
Local voters approved MEA’s Operation RoundUp in 2011.
“Approximately 67% of our co-op membership participates in the program which provides on average $50,000 in grants on a quarterly basis to local community organizations and projects,” said Jennifer Castro, senior manager of communications and community engagement for the cooperative.
Writing on Tuesday, two days before the attorney general’s letter, Castro said MEA “absolutely” intended to continue the program.
“It’s successful. Our members love being able to support their community and it’s also personal,” she said. “Whereas when you go to the grocery store and the electronic pad prompts you to round up to support a national organization that you’ve never heard of — with our program our co-op members change goes directly to making positive change within the community we power.”
Chugach Electric had intended to begin its program in October but postponed its implementation when Cox challenged the program soon after Gov. Mike Dunleavy designated him as attorney general in late August. 
In a September filing with the Regulatory Commission of Alaska, which controls electric utility rates, attorneys for the Alaska Department of Law questioned the legality of Chugach’s program.
The commission ultimately decided that it lacked jurisdiction over the issue, but Cox said he could pursue the matter in state court.
It isn’t clear why Cox initially challenged Chugach’s prospective program but not those already operating in Fairbanks and the Mat-Su. 
Julie Hasquet, a spokesperson for Chugach, said the utility doesn’t know. 
The Department of Law did not provide an explanation for the three-month gap between the action against Chugach and the letters sent to MEA and GVEA.
In the action against Chugach and in the new letters, Cox said he believes an opt-out program could be considered a negative option marketing scheme, something prohibited by law.
Recipients of the MEA and GVEA programs are chosen by a volunteer board, but Cox said “members do not control where their money goes.”
“The U.S. Supreme Court has repeatedly held that individuals have a right not to subsidize speech or causes with which they disagree. An opt-out mechanism does not fully resolve that concern when participation is presumed rather than chosen,” his letter to MEA and GVEA states.
That argument resembles one the Department of Law used for five years in an unsuccessful legal campaign to require public employee unions to reauthorize their membership annually. The Alaska Supreme Court ruled against the state on that issue, and the U.S. Supreme Court declined to take up the topic.
“I am hopeful that MEA will consider the concerns in this letter and switch to an affirmative opt-in program, which would substantially mitigate the legal concerns while preserving the program’s charitable mission,” Cox wrote, using similar language in his letter to GVEA.
Hasquet, at Chugach, said the board of that utility will vote in early 2026 about whether to go ahead with its round-up program or not.
“The key to a successful return would be resolution of any legal issues brought forward by the Alaska Attorney General,” she said.
If the utility goes forward with the program, Chugach expects it would result in about $400,000 per year for charities in its coverage area.
“One of the principles of a member-owned electric cooperative is concern for community. We were looking forward to the opportunity to support charities in our service territory, especially now with dollars dwindling on other fronts (state and federal),” Hasquet wrote by email.
“The program was approved by Chugach members, and a Board of Trustees, made up of Chugach members, was appointed by the Chugach Board of Directors. The Board of Trustees would be the individuals reviewing and approving the grants. We believe this is a great opportunity to support charitable organizations with member-directed dollars,” she said.
“We remain committed to the cooperative spirit of concern for community and to pursuing initiatives that support charitable and community efforts.”

(Wisconsin Examiner photo)Vaccination rates for influenza and COVID-19 are low in Wisconsin, and on Thursday, the Wisconsin Department of Health Services announced that two children have died within the last month: one from the flu in northeast Wisconsin and one from COVID-19 in the western part of the state.
 
For people without health insurance
The Vaccines for Children program makes shots available for people who have no health insurance or whose health insurance plans don’t cover vaccines.  Wisconsin also has a Vaccines for Adults program that provides free or low-cost vaccines for adults 19 or older who have no health insurance coverage or whose insurance doesn’t cover vaccines.


Citing concerns for family privacy, DHS is not releasing the ages of the children. At a media briefing, Tom Haupt, the DHS respiratory epidemiologist, said they were the first deaths of people under 18 from those illnesses since the start of the flu season Oct. 1.
Although year-to-year comparisons in mid-season are difficult, “we are definitely seeing an increase in influenza and COVID-19 at this particular point,” Haupt said.
Haupt said DHS has not yet verified whether either of the two children were vaccinated. Both had “some underlying conditions that would increase their risk” for more serious illness, he said.
Five people under 18 died from flu in January and early February 2025, Haupt said. DHS monitors certain illnesses, including flu and COVID-19, through data from hospital emergency rooms, lab tests and studying municipal wastewater for evidence of the viruses responsible.
Vaccination is the best tool for preventing serious illness from both flu and COVID-19, Haupt said.
“Our vaccination status for children for both COVID-19 and influenza are very low,” he said. “We want them to be increased significantly.”
Across all ages, about 28% of Wisconsinites have been vaccinated against the flu and 10.6% against COVID-19. “These numbers are lower than what we’ve seen over the past few years and that’s very unfortunate,” Haupt said.
DHS recommends both vaccines for everyone 6 months or older. The COVID-19 and the flu shots can both be given at the same time.
Flu can have outcomes much worse than its usual symptoms.
“Influenza could lead to cardiac problems for both children and adults. It can lead to encephalitis,” Haupt said. “So, it’s not only the acute acute part of influenza, it’s what can happen later on.” With vaccination people are “protecting yourself and protecting those people who are around you.
For a third serious respiratory illness, respiratory syncytial virus, or RSV, DHS recommends the maternal RSV vaccine for expectant mothers who are 32 to 36 weeks pregnant, to protect their infants after they’re born.
DHS recommends the RSV vaccine for infants younger than 8 months if they were born to mothers who did not get the vaccine during pregnancy. DHS also recommends the vaccine for children 8 to 19 months old with a higher risk of RSV, as well as for adults 75 and older and for adults 50 to 74 years old who have an increased risk for the virus.
Haupt said doctors have told DHS that they’re encountering more vaccine hesitancy in the general public than in the past. One cause appears to be confusion about shifting recommendations from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the CDC advisory council that makes recommendations on vaccines, he said.
Haupt said that for people hesitating about getting vaccines for themselves or their children, the “most accurate sources” for information are the state health department, local public health departments, community clinics, pharmacies and primary care doctors.

Tony Evers meets with children at a Fitchburg child care center in September 2023. (Photo by Erik Gunn/Wisconsin Examiner)Gov. Tony Evers approved an administrative rule change Thursday meant to make it easier to place children, who are in foster care because they are unable to safely remain in their home, with relatives or “like-kin” caregivers.
“We know that kids do better when they have supportive and loving people around them, and they’re in settings where they feel safe and can be their best and full selves. Keeping adults in kids’ lives who know and love them can go a long way toward making sure a kid has the stability they need so they can be focused on being a kid,” Evers said in a statement. “This is about doing what’s best for our kids and helping increase the likelihood of youth being in an environment with their family and loved ones, especially during difficult, chaotic times in their lives.”
According to the Evers administration, the rule change will help by providing a separate, streamlined licensing pathway for relative and “like-kin” caregivers as well as ensure that there is fair financial support available for them.
The rule change is a continuation of work on the issue. In 2024, the state Legislature passed and Gov. Tony Evers signed 2023 Wisconsin Act 119 which expanded the definition of those eligible to be kinship caregivers to include first cousins once removed and adults with a “like-kin” relationship with the child, meaning people with a significant emotional relationship with a child.
According to the Department of Children and Families, in 2024, 39% of children in Wisconsin who entered out-of-home care were initially placed with relatives, increasing the likelihood that they would be placed with their siblings, experience more stability during their placement and help them achieve permanency with family.
“We know kids do better when they’re with family — however they define it. And families do better when they can spend less time running up against unnecessary administrative and financial barriers and more time together, being a family,” DCF Secretary Jeff Pertl said in a statement.

The Montana Public Service Commission will likely lose its fourth executive director in as many years.
The Helena City Commission announced Wednesday it voted to appoint Alana Lake as its city manager contingent upon successful negotiations. MTN said she was selected on a 3-2 vote.
Lake took the PSC executive director job in March and would be the fourth in that role to leave in one year or less.
Lake said Thursday she has been asked to withhold comments until an employment contract is finalized.
She was announced as a finalist for the city manager role on Dec. 1.
The Public Service Commission is made up of five elected commissioners who regulate monopoly utilities in Montana. It has struggled recently with internal clashes and, several years ago, with poor audits.
The agency hired its first executive director in August 2021 after it received a critical audit in the spring from the Legislative Audit Division.
In response to the audit, then-PSC President Jim Brown said the new position was already in the works as part of the agency’s proactive approach to address shortcomings.
In August 2021, the agency announced its first director, but the following summer, Erik Wilkerson, a former school superintendent, left for another superintendent job.
In January 2023, the agency said it hoped for stability in that role when former state legislator Brad Tschida took the job, but the Republican departed in September the same year. He had maintained a residence in Missoula.
The PSC announced David Sanders accepted the job in January 2024, but he left at the end of the year to serve as chief of staff for Brown, a Republican elected as state auditor that November after serving on the Public Service Commission.
Sanders has since announced his candidacy for the Public Service Commission.
Lake, of Frenchtown, holds a bachelor’s in international relations and political science from Montana State University and an associate degree in Korean language from the Defense Language Institute, according to the Helena City Commission announcement.
She joined the U.S. Air Force and spent a decade in leadership and also served as a counterintelligence officer for the Idaho National Laboratory, the announcement said.
At the PSC, Lake oversees a budget of $6 million and staff of more than 40, the city said.
Thursday, a PSC spokesperson said she would address questions about whether the agency plans to recruit for another executive director and potential timeline after Lake accepts the city manager position.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/600x200-PSC.jpg,,,2025-12-18 20:56:54.962680

(Juan Salinas II/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — About 1,600 people attended job fairs and other events held over the past two weeks in the Lexington area for workers impacted by the Tyson Foods plant closure, Nebraska Gov. Jim Pillen announced Thursday.
The state and local efforts were designed to connect displaced workers with potential jobs and state workforce support services. Nearly 600 individuals registered with the state Department of Labor’s employment website.
Such outreach followed the announcement by Tyson Foods that it will close its longtime Lexington beef plant, eliminating 3,200 jobs. The plant is to close in mid-January. Tyson is the biggest employer in the town of about 11,000.

“We are helping people identify ways that they can make the most of this situation,” said Erick Carrillo, director of reemployment services with the Labor Department. He said the process is different for each worker.
Labor Commissioner Katie Thurber said she attended several of the events the department hosted. More than 150 employers took part in job fairs and other outreach focused on the Tyson workforce. 
Employers are encouraged to post their jobs at NEworks.nebraska.gov. Participating employers, a summary of job openings and community resources are listed at opportunity.nebraska.gov/Lexington. 
A hotline (308)-407-1517 also is now available 8 a.m. to 5 p.m., Monday through Friday, for Lexington workers seeking assistance through the Nebraska Departments of Labor and Health and Human Services.
“The hotline aims to streamline access for individuals with questions regarding programs that may benefit them most during this time,” Pillen said. 
The Labor Department has scheduled other events at the Dawson County Fairgrounds for those losing Tyson jobs. NEworks sessions help people register for NEworks.nebraska.gov, the website where they can find employment and file for unemployment benefits when a job ends. 
The events:

Nicholas Scutari said he hasn't abandoned his plan to create a New Jersey inspector general to probe complaints against law enforcement.,"Senate President Nicholas Scutari had tried to weaken the state comptroller's investigatory powers, to the dismay of his critics. (Photo by Dana DiFilippo/New Jersey Monitor)The New Jersey legislator behind a botched attempt to weaken the power of the state comptroller said he’ll attempt next year to pass a similar bill, but one that wouldn’t touch the comptroller’s office.
Sen. Nicholas Scutari (D-Union) said Thursday that he will introduce legislation in the next session, which begins Jan. 13, to create a state inspector general to field complaints about law enforcement, and that new position will be based in the State Commission of Investigation.
His remarks came a week after he said he would not move forward with the older version of the bill, which critics said was a bald attempt to kneecap an office tasked with guarding against public fraud, waste, and abuse.
Scutari, talking with reporters after a Senate voting session in Trenton, bristled at that suggestion.
“It was never a comptroller bill. It was an SCI bill,” he said.

Any legislation he introduces in the next session “will have nothing to do with the comptroller whatsoever,” he said.
A bill Scutari introduced just days before Thanksgiving would have transferred the investigatory powers of the comptroller’s office to the commission.
Scutari characterized the move as consolidation. Acting Comptroller Kevin Walsh blasted the bill, and other critics suggested it was retaliatory.
Walsh’s office has investigated public officials — including Scutari’s former chief of staff and other allies — around the state, issuing more than 25 reports this year alone that have irritated powerful people at all levels of politics. The State Commission of Investigation, in comparison, issued no reports this year. Critics warned that stripping the comptroller’s office of its investigative powers would allow corruption to flourish.
Scutari, as Senate president, largely controls what legislation moves in the Statehouse and fast-tracked his bill after about 18 months of mounting backlash to Walsh’s work.
Scutari insisted his motive has been to save money and eliminate a duplication of watchdog efforts.
“Apparently, we have lots of money to allow multiple places to do that,” Scutari said. “I don’t want to be seen that I want to hide any waste, fraud, abuse or corruption, which I don’t. But I don’t want to spend ungodly sums of money on these things when sometimes they don’t seem to lead to anything. But regardless of that fact, I heard the objections.”
A Senate hearing on the bill earlier this month devolved into a shouting match, with Sen. James Beach (D-Camden), the committee’s chairman, limiting critics’ testimony while giving supporters more time to speak. Beach also made Walsh, U.S. Sen. Andy Kim, and Attorney General Matt Platkin, all critics of the proposal, testify last, even though they were among the first to sign up to speak.
Scutari declined to comment Thursday on how Beach handled the hearing.
“These hearings are the way they are. I can’t chair every committee,” Scutari said. “I thought the testimony that I heard in the beginning was well thought out. And, you know, people did not agree with a lot of the stuff that was in there, but that’s pretty much it.”

Gov. Jacqueline Coleman would also cut their […],"The Kentucky Capitol in Frankfort, Kentucky, on February 27, 2024. Photo by Arden BarnesDemocratic Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear says he is planning a roughly 3% budget cut to “many agencies” in Kentucky’s executive branch in response to a revenue shortfall in the current fiscal year. 
Beshear said during a Thursday press conference that his office and the office of Democratic Lt. Gov. Jacqueline Coleman would also cut their budgets by about 3% to help cover a projected $156 million shortfall.
He also called on other state constitutional officers — all Republicans — to reduce their budgets by 3% as well. He said such reductions could be made not filling or eliminating vacant positions.
“We’re going to be able to manage this shortfall and still provide necessary services to Kentuckians,” Beshear said.
Beshear said many cabinets in state government are choosing to not fill vacant positions, though “absolutely necessary” vacant positions would still be kept. He said the state’s budget reduction plan does not make cuts to K-12 school systems, higher education, pension funding for state employees and educators and public safety funding including State Police and juvenile justice programs. He said the executive branch cuts would result in $77.7 million in General Fund reductions; he did not say how the remainder of the shortfall would be covered. 
That budget reduction request has been met with pushback by at least two Republican officeholders, and his move to cut executive branch agencies also drew caution from GOP leadership in the Kentucky House of Representatives. 
“We have seen reports of temporary cuts and strongly urge the governor to reject broad, across-the-board budget cuts and instead make deliberate, strategic decisions,” said House Speaker David Osborne in a statement through a spokesperson. “Across-board cuts may help the governor avoid difficult decisions at the state level, but they do not distinguish between effective programs and those that can absorb reductions, and they risk serious harm to essential services that individuals and communities across the state depend on.” 
The Consensus Forecasting Group, a committee of economists that forecasts Kentucky government revenues, slightly upgraded its outlook earlier this week when it projected the state’s revenue shortfall for the current fiscal year would be $156 million instead of an earlier projection of $305 million. 
Beshear said during the press conference his administration had not received formal plans yet to reduce budgets from Attorney General Russell Coleman, Agriculture Commissioner Jonathan Shell and Secretary of State Michael Adams. 
But he said State Auditor Allison Ball and State Treasurer Mark Metcalf are “refusing” to go along with the request, breaking decades-long precedent “to do their part to be fiscally responsible and to take part in the budget reduction.” 
“There is nothing partisan or political about a budget reduction,” Beshear said. 
Kentucky Democratic Party Chair Colman Elridge in a statement following the press conference said in part that the state constitutional officers’ “refusal breaks more than three decades of precedent and adds insult to economic injury by forcing families who are losing access to food and health care to cover the expenses of elected officials who refuse to take even a 1% funding cut.” 
Republican pushback
But both Ball and Metcalf took strong issue with Beshear’s characterization. Both of the Republicans stressed their offices were independent of the governor’s administration.
Clay Skaggs, a spokesperson for Metcalf, in an emailed statement said the state treasurer “has not refused to participate in budget reductions and continues to act responsibly with taxpayer dollars.” 
Skaggs said Metcalf on Dec. 9 had “formally acknowledged the obligations of the Budget Reduction Plan to the State Budget Director and noted that his office will manage the Treasury’s budget internally.”

“The treasurer is an independently elected constitutional officer — he answers to the people of Kentucky, not to the governor’s inflated sense of authority,” Skaggs said, mentioning the Kentucky State Treasury would “achieve the required savings.” 
Both Metcalf and Ball also pointed to language in the last two-year state budget passed by the GOP-controlled legislature that appears to allow state constitutional officers to choose whether to comply with a budget reduction request by the governor. 
Ball in a statement provided through her spokesperson said the governor “demanded that my office reduce its budget, even though state law says he cannot demand that of constitutional officers.” 
“My office is responsible for identifying waste, fraud, and abuse, and I identified five times the amount of wasteful spending that could be cut to avoid the budget shortfall entirely,” Ball said in her statement. “If the governor would just follow our recommendations, there would be no shortfall.”  
Joy Markland, Ball’s spokesperson, shared with the Lantern letters between State Budget Director John Hicks and Ball, dated from late September through November, highlighting disputes between the Beshear administration and Ball over the requested budget reduction. 
One of Ball’s letters to Hicks mentions language in House Bill 6, the two-year executive branch budget bill passed by the GOP-controlled legislature in 2024, that gives constitutional officers the choice whether to follow along with a request from the governor to reduce budgets during a revenue shortfall. Ball’s letters to Hicks also mention various audits her office has conducted of the executive branch.
Hicks in a letter dated Oct. 24 to Ball wrote it was his understanding “that you have said you will not participate in the General Fund budget reduction plan.” 
“And as a matter of context, it may be the first time an executive branch agency has refused to do their part. The Auditor’s office appropriation has been reduced in every mid-year General Fund budget reduction plan but one over the last 25 years,” Hicks wrote. 
Hicks wrote that the state auditor’s office in a submitted budget proposal had 13 vacant, full-time positions representing $1.3 million in costs “with the bulk financed from the General Fund.” He wrote a 2% General Fund cut from the auditor’s office would represent a $263,100 reduction and that many state agencies were participating in the budget reduction by not filling vacant positions.

Ball in a reply letter on Nov. 7 wrote: “We have no problem with you implementing a budget reduction plan. We simply believe that it should come in the form of targeting the executive-branch agencies that are actually responsible for creating budget problems and not those agencies that are actively working toward fixing them.” 
Andrew McNeill, a deputy state budget director under former Republican Gov. Matt Bevin and president of the free-market think tank Kentucky Forum for Rights, Economics and Education, said he implemented a few budget reductions during his time with the administration. 
Two big differences from back then compared to now: the state has billions of dollars in its Budget Reserve Trust Fund, colloquially known as a “rainy day” fund, to rely on; and lawmakers had passed language that allows state constitutional officers to choose whether they want to reduce budgets when requested by the governor. 
During his time working with the state budget office, “we had the authority to unilaterally reduce the allotments of the constitutional officer budgets.” 
“When we were doing these budget reductions, we didn’t have any choice but to impose these reductions on everybody because there wasn’t any money,” McNeill said. “That’s really the big difference here.”",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/240227Lantern059-scaled-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-18 19:57:12.754991

(Photo by Peter Hall/Capital-Star)Federal regulators directed the operator of the nation’s largest electricity grid to establish transparent rules for AI data centers to connect directly to power plants.
The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission said the revisions will help to manage electricity costs as the race to develop artificial intelligence drives an unprecedented increase in electricity use across the country. 
In Thursday’s meeting, the commission unanimously approved an order directing PJM Interconnection to revise its tariff — a compilation of rate schedules and terms of a particular company or utility — to detail the terms and conditions for customers to follow when using generating facilities to serve co-located load. The order directs PJM to offer customers who want to co-locate four options to manage how data centers and other large loads interact with the grid.
Montgomery County-headquartered PJM manages the wholesale electricity market and grid for about 65 million customers in Pennsylvania and 12 other states plus Washington, D.C.
US Energy Secretary says Three Mile Island restart delivers on Trump administration promises

“PJM has been actively engaged with stakeholders throughout 2025 to address the rapid growth of data centers and the related increase in demand for electricity,” spokesman Jeff Shields said in a statement. 
Shields added the PJM board intends to move forward with a proposal to FERC derived from its own process in which stakeholders have provided their input on possible solutions.
“We share FERC’s focus on clear and transparent rules as data centers expand their role as an engine of the U.S. economy. PJM is reviewing the order and will assess how it impacts efforts already underway.”
FERC Chairperson Laura Swett said Thursday the decision would advance the nation in the AI and manufacturing revolution while safeguarding the prices consumers pay for electricity.
“While uncertainty has abounded across our country on how we will facilitate data centers, this morning, my colleagues and I are taking a critical step to give investors and consumers more certainty on how FERC believes we can solve the problem,” Swett said.
In February, FERC initiated a proceeding to review issues associated with the co-location of AI data centers, which can use as much electricity as a small city, and generators to ensure the clarity of the rates, terms and conditions of service that apply to co-location arrangements.
“Co-location arrangements are a fairly new phenomenon that entail huge ramifications for grid reliability and consumer costs,” former Chairperson Mark Christie said in February.  “Given these ramifications, the commission truly needs to ‘get it right’ when it comes to evaluating co-location issues.”    
Advanced Energy United, an association for the renewable energy industry, said the order has potential to bring welcome regulatory clarity for large load customers and safeguards to minimize the impact of co-location on the electric rates and system reliability of all other customers.
Caitlin Marquis, managing director at Advanced Energy United, said demand is outpacing the ability of the market alone to reliably and affordably serve data centers and existing customers.
“Advanced energy solutions like battery storage, solar, wind, demand response, and distributed energy resources are well-suited to reliability and affordably serve new large loads in PJM and across the country,” Marquis said. “The advanced energy industry will welcome new rules within PJM that empower large load customers to bring their own new clean energy to the system, benefiting all energy users.”
Co-location, the group noted, is attractive to AI hyperscalers because it can result in faster connections for data centers, which companies like Amazon Web Services and Microsoft are competing to bring online first.

Microsoft has a $1.6 billion deal with Constellation Energy to restart the remaining nuclear reactor at Three Mile Island in Dauphin County to power its data centers elsewhere in the PJM service area. Amazon announced an agreement to buy a data center development adjacent to Talen Energy’s Susquehanna Steam Electric nuclear power station in Luzerne County. 
Co-location also raises questions about who will pay for additional transmission infrastructure and how large loads or other customers will be affected by fluctuations in electricity supply across the grid.
Todd Snitchler, president and CEO of the Electric Power Supply Association, which represents competitive power generators, said the order provides options, recognizing that there are a variety of approaches to co-locating large electricity users and generating stations. 
“Clearly, this is the first step in a process that will require quick action and durable consensus from many stakeholders and highlights the urgency in getting solutions onto the system and for that we applaud FERC’s approach,” Snitchler said.",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_6060-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-12-18 19:57:12.754991

(Photo by New Jersey Monitor)A Senate panel advanced more than a dozen judicial nominees Thursday that could bring court vacancies to their lowest levels in years after confirmation votes that are planned to go before the full chamber next week.
If confirmed, the 13 would-be Superior Court judges, plus the one jurist confirmed during Thursday’s voting session in the Senate, would drop vacancies on New Jersey’s bench to 30, a level top court officials have said is sustainable for the judiciary.
“There are hardly going to be any vacancies left,” Senate President Nicholas Scutari (D-Union) told reporters following Thursday’s voting session.
Senate committee advances bill to end municipal public defender fees

There were 44 vacancies in New Jersey’s courts on Thursday, up from 33 at the start of July. That number will fall to 43 once New Brunswick Chief Municipal Court Judge James Hoebich, who was confirmed to the Superior Court Thursday, is sworn in.
The 13 court nominees advanced through the Senate Judiciary Committee Thursday are set to be confirmed by the full chamber during Monday’s voting session, according to Sen. Brian Stack (D-Hudson), the Senate judiciary chairman.

The judiciary committee intends to meet again to advance more judges before the current legislative session ends in mid-January, Stack said.
“I think we’ll have another one or two meetings, depending on the Senate president’s direction on it. Definitely one more. Possibly two more,” he told the New Jersey Monitor.
The nominees advanced Thursday include Murphy administration attorneys Valentina DiPippo, Melissa Medoway, and Kerry Soranno, plus Dan Kelly, a longtime advisor who runs the governor’s disaster recovery office.
“Each of these talented individuals have worked diligently to advance our state. I am confident they will excel in their new roles on the bench,” Gov. Phil Murphy said in a statement.
There are 17 remaining Superior Court hopefuls who have been nominated by Murphy, who leaves office on Jan. 20. Murphy’s nominations expire when new legislators are sworn in at noon on Jan. 13.
Though most of the court nominees awaiting committee hearings were nominated in recent weeks or months, three have been waiting longer.
Murphy nominated Department of Corrections Commissioner Victoria Kuhn and former Newark Municipal Chief Judge Richard Nunes in June. Shantika Dorsey, an attorney for East Orange, has been awaiting confirmation votes for just over a year.
In New Jersey, individual senators can indefinitely and unilaterally block judicial nominees who reside in their home county or legislative district by invoking an unwritten rule called senatorial courtesy. The practice could block the confirmations of some nominees, though it’s unclear how many.
When asked whether there were court nominees awaiting courtesy sign-offs, Stack said, “I believe there might be, but I’m not 100% sure.” 
Court observers who have long urged legislators to speed judicial confirmations — and Murphy to nominate judges — welcomed this week’s progress. Christine Amalfe, president of the New Jersey State Bar Association, said vacancies have strained the state’s courts and swelled case backlogs.
“Passing today’s slate of judicial nominees will meaningfully ease that burden, and the NJSBA thanks the Governor and Legislature for taking this important action,” she said. “The NJSBA will continue to urge state leaders to fulfill their constitutional responsibilities and restore the Judiciary as a co-equal branch of government by confirming a full complement of judges. We look forward to further progress.”
The judiciary reported 36,396 backlogged cases in October, down from the record 97,032 cases reached in September 2021, but the number remains about 52% above prepandemic levels.
In March 2020, before COVID-19 forced the judiciary to shutter courthouses and hold proceedings virtually, the judiciary reported 23,917 backlogged cases.
Court officials mark a case as backlogged if it has not been heard after a period of time, which varies based on the type of case.
If confirmed by the full Senate, the nominees advanced Thursday would fully erase the Mercer Vicinage’s six vacancies and cut vacancies in Atlantic County from one to zero.
Middlesex’s vacancies would fall from four to three, then two once Hoebich is sworn in. Ocean, Burlington, and Monmouth counties would each see their vacancies reduced by one if the nominees are confirmed.
Judicial vacancies have been a longstanding problem under Murphy. Though just nine seats on the bench were empty after Gov. Chris Christie left office in January 2018 following a court expansion that added 20 new judgeships to aid then-nascent bail reform, vacancies ballooned early in Murphy’s tenure.
Only one of his judicial nominees was confirmed in 2018, when the governor found himself at odds with legislative leaders from his own party. The clash extended to budget negotiations, only narrowly avoiding a government shutdown.

Cox/Getty Images).Kansas legislative leaders will meet Monday to take one of the final steps toward luring the Kansas City Chiefs across the state line, floating bonds worth hundreds of millions so the team can build a domed stadium and an entertainment district.
With a year-end deadline looming, the Legislative Coordinating Council will consider approving Sales Tax and Revenue Bond agreements with the Chiefs. Monday is the council’s last scheduled meeting of the year.
With the bonds’ approval, the Kansas City Chiefs could move closer to uprooting six decades of NFL history in Missouri and relocate to Kansas. The deal is said to call for placing the new stadium near the Legends, a regional shopping mall and commercial area in the Village West development in Kansas City, Kansas.
The council will not consider any deals with the Kansas City Royals on Monday.
Legislative and state leaders refused to offer specifics about the meeting and would say only that the Chiefs will be on the agenda. Kansas Senate President Ty Masterson, a Republican running for governor, said he has worked diligently to explore the change to bring the Chiefs to Kansas without raising taxes.
“He remains fully committed to these efforts and will continue working tirelessly up to and through the upcoming Legislative Coordinating Council meeting to facilitate this exciting opportunity for Kansas,” said Megan Stookey, Masterson’s spokesperson.
Missouri or Kansas? Business leaders don’t care as long as Chiefs and Royals stay near KC

Kansas Senate Minority Leader Dinah Sykes, a Lenexa Democrat, said she was told the council, which is composed of legislative leadership from both parties, would be talking about the Chiefs on Monday — but not the Royals.
“We will be talking about the Chiefs,” Sykes said. “It sounds like there is some proposal that we will be looking at.”
The Kansas Department of Commerce, which handles such deals, posted on Facebook that the state is in active discussions with the Chiefs about “building a new stadium and other facilities in Kansas.”
“No final agreement has been reached, but this would be a massive economic win for Kansas and benefit Kansans for generations to come,” the statement said. “We are aggressively pursuing this opportunity.”
The Kansas City Chiefs didn’t return an email seeking comment.
In an interview Tuesday, Kansas Gov. Laura Kelly declined to say whether the Chiefs or Royals were coming to Kansas.
“You really think I’m going to answer that question?” Kelly said.
Missouri Gov, Mike Kehoe said his team remains in frequent communication with the Royals and the Chiefs and wants to keep the teams in Missouri.
“He believes Missouri is the best home for both teams and continues working with the teams to make the right decision to grow and invest in the Show-Me State,” said Gabby Picard, his communications director.
Kansas City Mayor Quinton Lucas issued a statement Thursday saying the city doesn’t negotiate in public.
“As the city and our Missouri partners continue discussions with our long-term partners at the Chiefs and the Royals, we remain steadfast in working toward an arrangement in the best interest of our community and the greatest success of our teams on and off the field,” Lucas said.
After a ping-pong of public-financing proposals offered by the two states, the Chiefs face a decision on Kansas’ deal, which could cover up to 70% of the project through bonds. Missouri’s plan offered 50%.
Missouri hit a wall in its bid to keep the Chiefs after voters rejected a sales tax extension in April 2024, throwing in jeopardy a plan that would have helped fund a new $2 billion downtown ballpark for the Royals and $800 million in renovations to Arrowhead Stadium. That’s when Kansas lawmakers aggressively stepped in, authorizing STAR bonds to finance 70% of development projects with a minimum investment of a billion dollars.
Kansas legislative leaders will meet Monday to consider using STAR bonds to finance a stadium for the Kansas City Chiefs that could be built near the Legends shopping area (Grace Hills for Kansas Reflector).
Kansas Sen. David Haley, a Democrat from Wyandotte County, said Thursday he’s hearing talk that the team is headed to the Legends.
The site of the new stadium could be west of the Kansas Speedway, at the junction of Interstate 435 and Interstate 70. The potential entertainment district surrounding the stadium would be placed near other existing businesses, like Legends Outlets, the Hollywood Casino, and Sporting KC’s soccer stadium.
The Kansas Legislature during a special session last summer created a financial incentive package designed to lure the Chiefs and Royals across state lines. The law allows for STAR bonds to pay for 70% of a development project with a minimum investment of a billion dollars. The bonds would be paid through liquor sales and retail sales tax revenue in the development area, with a window up to 30 years.
Reaching a deal now could allow a stadium to open by 2031, when the team’s leases with Jackson County, Missouri, expire.
The Chiefs began playing in Kansas City in 1963 after owner Lamar Hunt moved the franchise from Dallas. The team first played at Municipal Stadium, at 22nd Street and Brooklyn Avenue, then moved to Arrowhead in 1971. The Truman Sports Complex, on the city’s east side, is also home to the Royals and the teams share parking lots.
The Chiefs sold naming rights in 2021 to the Government Employees Health Association and the official name became GEHA Field at Arrowhead Stadium.
The Chiefs’ negotiations with Kansas intensified last month when the team floated a request for proposals from firms to design a domed stadium, which would be available for use during the Super Bowl and other winter events. The team was said to be negotiating with NASCAR for land near the Speedway.
Five months earlier, in June, the Chiefs requested an extension to a deadline for a stadium financing package from the state of Kansas, which was an indication the NFL franchise’s move across the state line was a real possibility.
But that same month, Kehoe called lawmakers into a special session to offer a competing stadium financing deal, hoping for something that could keep both the Chiefs and the Royals on that side of the state line. The Missouri Legislature approved the plan, which authorized bonds covering up to half of the cost of new or renovated stadiums, plus up to $50 million in tax credits for each stadium and more aid from local governments.

A federal judge in San Francisco is reversing the terminations of hundreds of federal employees finalized during the recent government shutdown.
U.S. District Judge Susan Illston issued a preliminary injuction, late Wednesday that orders the departments of Education and State, the Small Business Administration and the General Services Administration, to rescind reduction-in-force notices for employees who were terminated between Oct. 1 and Nov. 12 — the start and end dates of the government shutdown.
“Absent a contrary ruling from a higher court,” Illston is giving agencies until Tuesday to carry out the terms of her injunction.
“Defendants must do what the continuing resolution says. They may not take any further steps to implement or carry out a RIF through January 30, 2026, regardless of when the RIF notice first issued,” Illston wrote.
These agencies sent RIF notices to employees before the recent government shutdown, with separations in most cases scheduled to take effect in October or November, during the shutdown.
The American Federation of Government Employees and the American Foreign Service Association, who are leading a lawsuit with other unions, argued agencies that finalized RIFs during the government shutdown, regardless of when they were issued, violated a stopgap spending bill passed by Congress that prohibited layoffs through Jan. 30, 2026.
Illston issued a temporary restraining order earlier this month that blocked the finalization of layoffs of nearly 250 Foreign Service officers at the State Department. Those layoffs were originally scheduled for Nov. 10, but were pushed back to Dec. 5, and remain on hold.
In Trump rebuke, US House approves bill to overturn collective bargaining limit

The Trump administration has followed a narrower interpretation of the stopgap spending bill, and has only reinstated federal employees who received RIF notices between Oct. 1 and Nov. 12.
The continuing resolution Congress passed on Nov. 12 to reopen the government states that between Nov. 12, 2025 and Jan. 30, 2026, “no federal funds may be used to initiate, carry out, implement, or otherwise notice a reduction in force to reduce the number of employees within any department.”
It also states that “any reduction in force proposed, noticed, initiated, executed, implemented, or otherwise taken by an executive agency between October 1, 2025, and the date of enactment, shall have no force or effect.”
At a hearing in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, Illston said she would grant the preliminary injunction requested by the unions, because the “chaotic nature of these RIFs has been continuing.”
“The continuing resolution, ending the longest shutdown the government has experienced to date, said that no federal funds would be spent RIF-ing people through Jan. 30. But that is not what is happening in some of these agencies,” Illston said.
The judge’s order will impact about 680 total federal employees: The nearly 250 Foreign Service officers, 200 employees at GSA, 150 at the Education Department’s Office for Civil Rights and nearly 80 at SBA.
Illston agreed to the Justice Department’s request to delay her preliminary injunction from taking effect until Dec. 23, while the Trump administration considered whether to ask a higher court to stay her ruling. Illston said this would minimize some of the “whiplash” some federal employees have felt in other court cases, in which lower courts have reinstated them, only for an appeals court to allow layoffs to continue.
“They’d have to send a notice, and then another notice, and a notice saying, ‘Forget what we said yesterday.’ It would be terrible,” Illston said.
Brad Rosenberg, a DOJ attorney, said that rescinding layoffs now would be “logistically a big lift” for agencies, especially if the courts later allow those RIFs to proceed.

“If a RIF is rescinded, and if this court either decides at final judgment in this case, or if the government were to appeal, and an appellate court were to stay or vacate this Court’s preliminary injunction, government agencies would presumably have to start all over again with that, with that process, and it would be awfully hard to unscramble that egg,” Rosenberg said.
“That’s not going to provide the type of long-term relief that I suspect plaintiffs are seeking here,” he added.
Rosenberg argued that employees should bring their individual cases before the Merit Systems Protection Board. An appeals court recently allowed President Donald Trump to proceed with firing a Democratic member of the MSPB.
“This is merely the administration trying to carry out its policy objectives. And I realize that those policy objectives have consequences for individuals, and that they can be significant consequences, although we do think that those consequences can be remediated through proper channeling to the Merit Systems Protection Board,” he said.
Danielle Leonard, an attorney representing the plaintiff unions, said the “mandate was clear” from Congress, and that agencies should “nullify those RIFs.”
“We have Congress stepping in here and being incredibly clear about what the public interest needs in this very circumstance, and the public interest is in restoring these employees to their employment status and giving them clarity,” Leonard said. “Congress could have just said, ‘Stop.’ Congress could have just said, ‘Halt, let’s just freeze everything.’ They went further than that.”
OPM advises agencies to consider reducing senior executive staffing

Leonard said recently separated federal employees face “real and ongoing harm,” including eviction notices and unpaid bills.
“We have seen agencies exploit their lack of communication to keep employees in the dark, to keep them confused. They have not even told them whether they’re still employed when they directly ask. There absolutely has been harm,” she said.
AFGE National President Everett Kelley called Illston’s ruling “another victory for federal employees and for the rule of law.”
“When Congress voted to end the longest government shutdown in history, it spoke clearly and unambiguously that further reductions-in-force were prohibited, and any RIFs that occurred during the shutdown were required to be reversed. The administration’s continued defiance of that mandate is part of a troubling pattern of egregious actions against federal employees and the American public,” Kelley said.
John Dinkelman, president of the American Foreign Service Association, said Congress was clear that “reductions in force were prohibited” when it passed the continuing resolution, and that the administration’s efforts to proceed with RIFs were “unlawful.”
“Today’s ruling confirms this,” Dinkelman said.  “We will continue to fight to ensure that Foreign Service professionals are treated with the respect the law demands.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-03-28-at-9.39.12-PM-1024x677.jpeg,,,2025-12-18 19:57:12.754991
,Mississippi Today,2025-12-19 00:37:31+00:00,Mississippi Today,"The number of vacancies among teachers is going up in Mississippi, new survey shows",Devna Bose,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/12/18/k12-teacher-vacancies-increase/,"Mississippi had 6,907 vacancies among teachers, administrators and school support staff as of November — 1,747 more than last year.","Nearly 4,000 teaching positions remain unfilled in Mississippi, hundreds more than last year. 
The Mississippi Department of Education released results from the latest iteration of its annual teacher shortage and educator recruitment surveys Thursday at the state Board of Education’s last meeting of 2025. The surveys paint a sobering picture of the education sector in Mississippi, and validate what teachers have been ringing the alarm bell about for years — low pay is driving the state’s teacher shortage.
Responses from the state’s public schools show that, as of November, there were 6,907 vacancies among teachers, administrators and school support staff across the state. That’s 1,747 more than last year. 
The decrease is the biggest jump in recent years. Teachers received pay raises during the 2021-22 and 2022-23 school years and, subsequently, there were fewer vacancies during that period. And during the COVID-19 pandemic, licensure testing suspensions that made it easier for college students to become teachers likely contributed to fewer vacancies, the agency said in a news release. 
Teacher vacancies are concentrated in special education and elementary education, Courtney Van Cleve, executive director of the Office of Educator Continuum, told state board members. Together, the two categories account for half of all teacher vacancies in Mississippi.
“This does indeed remain one of our greatest areas of need,” she said.
Another area of concern, according to Van Cleve: teacher assistant vacancies. She said that pool is often where the agency looks for prospective teachers. 
A retention and recruitment survey, which the state Education Department released for the first time in conjunction with the educator shortage survey, provided insight into the reasons behind the vacancies. Teachers say a top reason is low pay. 
The National Education Association says Mississippi’s average teacher salary is $53,704, nearly $20,000 less than the national average. That average salary is also the lowest of all 50 states and third-lowest when adjusted for cost of living. 
Educators recently told Mississippi Today they have to take second jobs or forgo necessities to make ends meet financially, and State Auditor Shad White released a report this week drawing attention to the low salaries. 
In recent months, education researchers, teachers and administrators have called on state lawmakers to raise the teacher pay floor once again during the 2026 legislative session, which kicks off in January. 
“The pay has to go up if we’re going to entice people coming from other professions,” said Darein Spann, president of the Mississippi Association of Educators. “We’re going to need more base pay for those with families and those coming from more competitive industries.”
His statewide organization, which advocates on behalf of teachers, regularly contacts educators to poll them about their needs. Spann also hears from mayors and superintendents about obstacles they face in counteracting high teacher vacancies in their communities.
Vacancies increased the most in U.S. Rep. Bennie Thompson’s 2nd Congressional District, which encompasses the Delta, the region with the largest population of Black people and low-income households in the state. While some districts offer financial stipends to bolster teacher pay, many Delta districts can’t afford to do the same. 
“The tax base is not as lucrative to support pay supplements that might entice new teachers,” Spann said. “This has been a problem in southwest Mississippi and the Delta for a while.”
Moving forward, the agency plans to address the growing crisis by continuing to loosen licensure standards, especially in crisis areas. 
In response to last year’s educator shortage survey results, the agency allowed college students studying education to start teaching elementary school classes on a provisional license while taking a free course to satisfy the Foundation of Reading test requirements. The state Education Department also removed its reading test requirement for prospective special education teachers with “mild to moderate students” or special education students who can be taught in general education classrooms. 
The education agency is reviewing its criteria for secondary mathematics education supplemental endorsements. 
Some educators have scrutinized those licensure decisions. Others, like Spann, say they’re necessary to recruit teachers. 
“I do think we need to open up more opportunities for people to become certified while we work on recruitment statewide,” he said. 
This year, the state Education Department rolled out a revamped teacher recruitment website aimed at making the pathway to teaching more accessible, and the Legislature put $3 million toward the state’s teacher residency program, which paid for tuition and expenses associated with teacher licensure for 201 additional students at nine Mississippi universities.

(Photo by Grace Hills for Kansas Reflector)Kansas legislative leaders will meet Monday to take one of the final steps toward luring the Kansas City Chiefs across the state line, floating bonds worth hundreds of millions so the team can build a domed stadium and an entertainment district.
With a year-end deadline looming, the Legislative Coordinating Council will consider approving Sales Tax and Revenue Bond agreements with the Chiefs. Monday is the council’s last scheduled meeting of the year.
With the bonds’ approval, the Kansas City Chiefs could move closer to uprooting six decades of NFL history in Missouri and relocate to Kansas. The deal is said to call for placing the new stadium near the Legends, a regional shopping mall and commercial area in the Village West development in Kansas City, Kansas.
The council will not consider any deals with the Kansas City Royals on Monday.
Legislative and state leaders refused to offer specifics about the meeting and would say only that the Chiefs will be on the agenda. Senate President Ty Masterson, a Republican running for governor, said he has worked diligently to explore the change to bring the Chiefs to Kansas without raising taxes.
“He remains fully committed to these efforts and will continue working tirelessly up to and through the upcoming Legislative Coordinating Council meeting to facilitate this exciting opportunity for Kansas,” said Megan Stookey, Masterson’s spokesperson.
Senate Minority Leader Dinah Sykes, a Lenexa Democrat, said she was told the council, which is composed of legislative leadership from both parties, would be talking about the Chiefs on Monday — but not the Royals.
“We will be talking about the Chiefs,” Sykes said. “It sounds like there is some proposal that we will be looking at.”
The Kansas Department of Commerce, which handles such deals, posted on Facebook that the state is in active discussions with the Chiefs about “building a new stadium and other facilities in Kansas.”
“No final agreement has been reached, but this would be a massive economic win for Kansas and benefit Kansans for generations to come,” the statement said. “We are aggressively pursuing this opportunity.”
The Kansas City Chiefs didn’t return an email seeking comment.
In an interview Tuesday, Gov. Laura Kelly declined to say whether the Chiefs or Royals were coming to Kansas.
“You really think I’m going to answer that question?” Kelly said.
Missouri Gov, Mike Kehoe said his team remains in frequent communication with the Royals and the Chiefs and wants to keep the teams in Missouri.
“He believes Missouri is the best home for both teams and continues working with the teams to make the right decision to grow and invest in the Show-Me State,” said his communications director, Gabby Picard.
Kansas City Mayor Quinton Lucas issued a statement Thursday saying the city doesn’t negotiate in public.
“As the city and our Missouri partners continue discussions with our long-term partners at the Chiefs and the Royals, we remain steadfast in working toward an arrangement in the best interest of our community and the greatest success of our teams on and off the field,” Lucas said.
After a ping-pong of public-financing proposals offered by the two states, the Chiefs face a decision on Kansas’ deal, which could cover up to 70% of the project through bonds. Missouri’s plan offered 50%.
Missouri hit a wall in its bid to keep the Chiefs after voters rejected a sales tax extension in April 2024, throwing in jeopardy a plan that would have helped fund a new $2 billion downtown ballpark for the Royals and $800 million in renovations to Arrowhead Stadium. That’s when Kansas lawmakers aggressively stepped in, authorizing STAR bonds to finance 70% of development projects with a minimum investment of a billion dollars.
Kansas Sen. David Haley, a Democrat from Wyandotte County, said Thursday he’s hearing talk that the team is headed to the Legends.
The site of the new stadium could be west of the Kansas Speedway, at the junction of Interstate 435 and Interstate 70. The potential entertainment district surrounding the stadium would be placed near other existing businesses, like Legends Outlets, the Hollywood Casino, and Sporting KC’s soccer stadium.

The Kansas Legislature during a special session last summer created a financial incentive package designed to lure the Chiefs and Royals across state lines. The law allows for STAR bonds to pay for 70% of a development project with a minimum investment of a billion dollars. The bonds would be paid through liquor sales and retail sales tax revenue in the development area, with a window up to 30 years.
Reaching a deal now could allow a stadium to open by 2031, when the team’s leases with Jackson County, Missouri, expire.
The Chiefs began playing in Kansas City in 1963 after owner Lamar Hunt moved the franchise from Dallas. The team first played at Municipal Stadium, at 22nd Street and Brooklyn Avenue, then moved to Arrowhead in 1971. The Truman Sports Complex, on the city’s east side, is also home to the Royals and the teams share parking lots.
The Chiefs sold naming rights in 2021 to the Government Employees Health Association and the official name became GEHA Field at Arrowhead Stadium.
The Chiefs’ negotiations with Kansas intensified last month when the team floated a request for proposals from firms to design a domed stadium, which would be available for use during the Super Bowl and other winter events. The team was said to be negotiating with NASCAR for land near the Speedway.
Five months earlier, in June, the Chiefs requested an extension to a deadline for a stadium financing package from the state of Kansas, which was an indication the NFL franchise’s move across the state line was a real possibility.
But that same month, Missouri’s Kehoe called lawmakers into a special session to offer a competing stadium financing deal, hoping for something that could keep both the Chiefs and the Royals on that side of the state line. The Missouri Legislature approved the plan, which authorized bonds covering up to half of the cost of new or renovated stadiums, plus up to $50 million in tax credits for each stadium and more aid from local governments.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Legends-signage-2--1024x576.jpg,,,2025-12-18 19:57:12.754991

(Photo by Robin Opsahl/Iowa Capital Dispatch)Iowa state officials on Thursday announced events and initiatives set for 2026 throughout Iowa as the state participates in national America 250 celebrations.
In addition to participation in national efforts, Iowa’s America 250 Initiative co-chairs Lt. Gov. Chris Cournoyer and Agriculture Sec. Mike Naig said Iowa will be hosting several efforts throughout the next year that showcase the important role Iowa plays in the U.S. — especially in agriculture.
Thursday’s event in the Iowa Capitol’s rotunda was focused on unveiling Iowa’s plans for the upcoming year. The Iowa Young Patriots’ Club performed several songs at the event and a flag ceremony was conducted by the Civil Air Patrol Color Guard.
Each participating state is planning unique, signature events for the initiative — and Cournoyer said Iowa will be “leaning into our DNA” with an signature event called “America’s Harvest.”
“Throughout 2026 we’re going to lead the nation in celebrating how agriculture, gardening and horticulture have proven the very freedoms we enjoy as Americans,” Cournoyer said. “We’ll host webinars, share our agricultural journeys on social media, and then on about — stay tuned — Oct. 24 2026, we will gather for a massive harvest festival that celebrates Iowa’s integral role in feeding and fueling the world for 250 years.”
These are not the only events planned in 2026 to celebrate the nation’s founding. Cournoyer highlighted other efforts like the Masons of Iowa decorating graves of Revolutionary War soldiers in Iowa, planned tea events with actors playing George and Martha Washington, and a State Historical Society program to “renew the historic John Brown trail through southern Iowa.” More on planned events can be found on the state’s website for the America250 initiative.
“It’s a celebration of the Iowans who built this country and the Iowans who are leading it into the next 250 years,” Cournoyer said.
Iowa Secretary of State Paul Pate said his office will also be hosting a “Ready, Set, Vote” initiative as part of the 250th anniversary celebration. Registering to vote is a way to celebrate the U.S. by connecting “Iowa’s rich history with our collective civic future, empowering Iowans to take action today for a stronger tomorrow,” he said.
“For the past 250 years, our nation has been at the forefront of civic engagement and the democratic process,” Pate said. “We remain committed to championing those values, and one of the most impactful ways to do that is by registering to vote. It’s the first step in making your voice heard at the ballot box and shaping the future of our representative government.”
Plans to celebrate the country’s 250th anniversary have been in the works for several years, with Iowa beginning to work with the federal America250 effort in 2023. Iowa has also played a role already in some celebrations, with President Donald Trump holding an event July 3 this year at the Iowa State Fairgrounds, where he discussed events planned throughout the country leading up to July 4, 2026.
Naig said while there are multiple events and efforts already launched, the state wanted to make sure America250 celebrations were open to all.
“This is hardly a top-down type of approach,” Naig siad. “I think maybe what I’m even most excited about is what will come up from across the state, opportunities for communities and organizations and schools and churches, businesses and families all across Iowa to take part in their own special and unique ways.”

(Washington Department of Fish & Wildlife)In a vote on Thursday afternoon, the U.S. House of Representatives passed a bill that will delist the gray wolf from the endangered species list throughout the country.
H.R. 845, brought by Colorado Rep. Lauren Boebert and cosponsored by Montana Rep. Troy Downing, titled the “Pet and Livestock Protection Act,” directs the Secretary of the Interior to reissue a rule delisting the species.
“Montanans should be able to secure their herds, crops, and personal safety without fear of undue legal repercussions,” Downing said in a statement on Thursday. “As written, the ESA makes the gray wolf out to be a liability to avoid, not a resource to be protected. It is critical that we trust the science and look towards a more precise conservation approach when dealing with unique populations. I was proud to support this measure today and look forward to seeing it signed into law.”
Montana Rep. Ryan Zinke, a former Interior Secretary during President Donald Trump’s first term, voted in favor of delisting the species. In a statement posted on X, Zinke wrote that “The ESA was created to protect endangered animals, not to be weaponized for a radical agenda by activist judges. The last four administrations have all agreed that the gray wolf has recovered. Let’s follow the science and Montana’s lead and delist.”
Conservation groups immediately decried the move, saying removing federal protections amounted to creating an open season on the species.
“Rep. Boebert’s bill is a deadly invitation to trophy hunt wolves to extinction,” Stephanie Kurose, deputy director of government affairs at the Center for Biological Diversity, said in a statement. “Stripping these amazing animals of protection while they’re still fighting to survive isn’t conservation, it’s cruelty. Wolves belong in the wild, not mounted on someone’s wall.”
Other groups, including the Human World Action Fund, said that the decision to delist an endangered species should not be made by Congress.
“The Endangered Species Act has worked for decades because decisions are made by scientists, not politicians,” Sara Amundson, president of Human World Action Fund, said in a statement. “Congress shouldn’t override expert agencies and the courts just to fast-track wolf hunts, and it certainly shouldn’t ignore how deeply Americans care about wolves. The Senate should stop this meritless bill dead in its tracks and keep in place the vital protections that are making wolf recovery possible.”
When gray wolves were initially delisted in Montana and the other western states in 2011, it was done through a similar provision.
Montana’s then-Sen. Jon Tester, a Democrat, placed a rider on a federal budget bill to remove ESA protections from wolves in the Rocky mountains. It also contained a provision that the courts could not intervene.
 Wolf whiplash

Gray wolves were almost entirely eliminated from the lower-48 states by the 1970s, leading to their listing under the Endangered Species Act.
In 2009, the species was delisted, an action that led to immediate litigation and paused the change in status. In 2011 Congressional action officially turned management of the species in Montana, Idaho, Wyoming and the eastern thirds of Oregon and Washington over to the respective states.
Currently, gray wolves are listed as a threatened species in Minnesota and endangered in the remaining 44 states.
According to a 2022 report by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, which formed the basis for its later determination, there were approximately 2,797 wolves in the western U.S. — including roughly 1,000 wolves in both Montana and Idaho, fewer than 400 in Wyoming, and around 200 in Oregon and Washington. The federal agency estimated an additional 20 wolves are in California and Utah and two in Colorado.
In 2023, Colorado began relocating wolves to the state, with four established packs reported as of this summer.
Under the Trump administration in 2020, the Fish and Wildlife Service had decided to delist gray wolves in the states outside of the northern Rockies where they had been protected by the Endangered Species Act. But a federal judge in California reversed that decision in February 2022, which led the service to publish a rule in November to comply with the order.
Conservation groups filed a lawsuit last summer against the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in an attempt to force the agency to reapply ESA protections to the species across the western portion of the country.
A federal judge in Missoula ruled in favor of the groups in August and found the federal government had erred in a determination that further protections were unwarranted.
Judge Donald Molloy said the federal government “made numerous unfounded assumptions regarding the future condition of the gray wolf despite recognizing either limitation on those conditions or bias in the population estimates utilized,” Molloy wrote. “Because these deficiencies are serious and pervasive, they weigh in favor of vacating the portion of the 2024 Finding that determined that the gray wolf in the Western United States does not meet the definition of an endangered or threatened species.”
Montana officials called the ruling a move by an “activist” judge favoring environmental extremists.
Subsequently, the federal government decided not to prepare a national gray wolf recovery plan, which led to more legal action by conservation organizations, led by the Center for Biological Diversity.
In the state, Montana’s own wolf hunting regulations are tied up in dueling lawsuits.
This year, Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks and the Fish and Wildlife Commission — the agency’s rule-making body — increased the quota of wolves to be killed during the 2025-26 hunting season.
A group of conservation organizations sued, saying the quota is too high and risks decimating the wolf population, while a group of outfitters and legislators also sued, saying the quota was too low and would not reduce the wolf population enough.
A hearing on the case was held in November, and a ruling is still pending.
According to a state Fish, Wildlife and Park’s dashboard, hunters and trappers have killed 82 wolves so far this season out of a statewide quota of 452. One hunting area, just outside of Yellowstone National Park, has closed after hunters and trappers reached its three-wolf quota.
The hunting and trapping season lasts until March 15.
The House bill will now advance to the U.S. Senate, where it will need 60 votes to pass.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/gray-wolf-1536x1229-1-1024x819.jpg,,,2025-12-18 19:57:12.754991

(Photo by Kyle Martin/For the North Dakota Monitor)A court case involving Greenpeace and the Dakota Access Pipeline developer went before the North Dakota Supreme Court on Thursday, with justices asked to stop a counter-suit pending in the Netherlands.
Amsterdam-based Greenpeace International is a defendant in an ongoing lawsuit in North Dakota district court, where Energy Transfer accuses it and two other Greenpeace entities of conspiring to use unlawful tactics to stop the Dakota Access Pipeline from being built.
All three Greenpeace defendants deny the allegations and claim the case is a tactic to waste their time and money as punishment for opposing the pipeline.
This led Greenpeace International to counter-sue Energy Transfer in a Dutch court in February under a European Union directive that provides recourse to those targeted by frivolous lawsuits for exercising their free speech.
The overseas lawsuit also argues Energy Transfer harmed Greenpeace International by bringing a similar federal lawsuit against it in 2017, which was dismissed, and for defaming the environmental group.
Greenpeace International wants the Dutch court to order Energy Transfer to award it monetary damages. 
Energy Transfer this summer asked Southwest Judicial District Court Judge James Gion to suspend the Dutch lawsuit until the North Dakota case plays out, which Gion denied in September. Energy Transfer appealed the decision.
“Rather than take responsibility for its misconduct, Greenpeace ran to Amsterdam seeking ‘protection’ from this lawsuit,” Brad Hubbard, an attorney arguing for the pipeline developer, told the North Dakota Supreme Court on Thursday.

Gion found that the lawsuits are about fundamentally different legal claims, so he didn’t think it necessary to stop the foreign action.
Hubbard disputed Gion’s conclusion that the cases don’t overlap. He said the European Union directive is designed to undermine the authority of foreign courts.
“This court’s intervention is needed to block the wasteful litigation of the issues tried and decided by the jury,” he said.
Betsy Elsberry, an attorney representing Greenpeace International, said the overseas lawsuit is wholly separate from the case before Gion. 
Elsberry also argued that Gion acted within his discretion as district court judge when he denied Energy Transfer’s request.
“It is Judge Gion who listened to the North Dakota claims for three weeks,” she told the high court. “He determined that they are not the same as those being brought forth in the Dutch court.”
Greenpeace says North Dakota judge shouldn’t meddle with international free speech case

Jurisdiction was another recurring issue during the hearing.
Some of the justices asked why Greenpeace International filed the suit in the Netherlands as opposed to seeking relief by bringing counterclaims in North Dakota.
Elsberry said it would be improper to bring such claims in North Dakota since Greenpeace International is a Dutch organization, and Energy Transfer is headquartered in Texas. North Dakota courts wouldn’t have jurisdiction, she said.
Gion doesn’t have the authority to stop the Dutch case for similar reasons, Elsberry added. 
Chief Justice Jon Jensen said the North Dakota Supreme Court will take the matter under advisement. District court judges James Shockman and Stephanie Hayden sat on the court in place of Justices Douglas Bahr and Daniel Crothers, who recused.
Gion has yet to make a final decision on the outcome of the lawsuit.
A Morton County jury in March handed down a more than $660 million verdict against Greenpeace after a three-and-a-half week trial. Gion recently cut that sum by about half.
Energy Transfer said previously it planned to ask the North Dakota Supreme Court to reverse Gion’s revisions to the defamation and conspiracy awards.
Marco Simons, interim general counsel for Greenpeace’s USA affiliate, said once Gion enters a final judgment, they plan to ask for a new trial. If that request is unsuccessful, they will appeal.
Greenpeace was one of many activist groups that backed a movement led by the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe to halt construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline, which drew thousands of activists to protest in south-central North Dakota in 2016 and 2017.
The pipeline, often referred to as DAPL, carries crude oil from wells in northwest North Dakota to Illinois and has been in operation since 2017.

Josh Kimbrell says voters should not to count him out, even as a lawsuit from a former business partner has overshadowed his run for the South Carolina Governor’s Mansion.
Kimbrell, in a 21-minute Facebook video, called the months of legal drama that have dogged him since the start of his campaign “the roughest period of life since I’ve been on the planet.”
In an interview with the SC Daily Gazette, Kimbrell went on to blast his former associate, Frank Rogers, as a “raging narcissist” who had destroyed his business and left him forced to sell his home to pay his ongoing legal fees.
An attorney for Rogers did not respond to phone calls from the SC Daily Gazette Thursday.
The legal drama started two weeks after Kimbrell’s June gubernatorial launch. Rogers sued him, alleging the legislator had diverted more than $2 million out of their joint company and used the money for personal and campaign expenses.
Kimbrell denied the allegations and counter-sued for defamation.
Now, the Boiling Springs Republican is urging voters not to dismiss him in the five-way Republican primary, despite his low profile and nearly non-existent fundraising compared to other candidates.
“Anybody that’s writing me off as irrelevant does so at their peril,” he told the SC Daily Gazette.
Kimbrell highlighted his record of co-sponsoring anti-abortion and tax-cutting laws and said he’ll further prove himself to voters in the upcoming legislative session.
But what the former conservative Christian radio host is probably best known for are a pair of special budget rules: one threatening to pull state funding for public libraries unless they restrict children’s access to books deemed inappropriate and another yanking funds for any city with bans on so-called conversion therapy for LGBTQ+ minors.
Exodus Aircraft
In addition to his radio career, Kimbrell founded Exodus Aircraft, a company that charters private flights, in 2017. Five years later, Rogers bought a half-stake in the company, according to his July lawsuit.
Kimbrell said he was in the process of selling the business when Rogers sued him. Rogers, in court filings, claims he wasn’t adequately informed of the sale plans.
Kimbrell told the SC Daily Gazette that he believed, after Rogers sued him, that Rogers would soon “destroy” the company and wanted to sever ties as soon as possible.
He agreed to resign and turn over all Exodus business records in anticipation of counter-suing.
In a dueling lawsuit, several Exodus investors sued alleging Rogers was fully aware of the impending sale and blew up the deal by orchestrating a “hostile takeover.”
About two weeks after Rogers filed suit, both he and Kimbrell signed on to an agreement saying that Kimbrell would resign from Exodus Aircraft and surrender all company assets and business records. Rogers’ lawyers have argued in recent filings that Kimbrell has not abided by terms of that agreement. They alleged Kimbrell has contacted former Exodus employees and investors and has not turned over all business records Rogers’ lawyers requested.
Meanwhile, the legal mess continues to grow as Rogers and Kimbrell each seek to drag more people and businesses into the fray. A judge will hear arguments about potential new parties in the suit Friday.
According to recent quarterly fundraising reports, Kimbrell has raised $23,000 for his run for governor. Three of his Republican competitors have raised over a million dollars; the fourth has raised over $800,000.

The state legislature allocates charter school funding, but the lawsuit contends that the decision of which schools get funded should lie with the state Board of Education.
The board’s ruling, and the subsequent failure of the legislature to allocate funds to the previously approved school, has left Capital Preparatory’s plans to open a school in Middletown in the lurch.
In the lawsuit, the school asks a New Britain judge to decide whether the power to fund such schools lies with the state Board of Education or not. 
At an impassioned press conference in the Cross Street AME Zion Church in Middletown, representatives of Capital Preparatory Schools said they were compelled to file the lawsuit after many previous attempts to resolve the issue with members of the legislature, the state Board of Education and Gov. Ned Lamont.
“We hope this lawsuit will expose flaws in the current funding and selection process,” said Michele Clay, the co-chair of the Capital Preparatory School planning committee. Clay said that “when transparency is replaced with backroom decisions,”  the system of allocating funding becomes a barrier for school success. “This is a systemic issue and it deserves a systemic solution.”
In March 2023, the state Board of Education voted to grant an initial certificate of approval for Capital Preparatory Schools to open a charter school in Middletown. In doing so, it overrode the recommendations of Education Commissioner Charlene Russell-Tucker, who wanted to give community members more time to submit comments to the board. But the school ultimately has never received funding.
The group then appealed directly to Gov. Ned Lamont and were met with what they described as a “stern” response from his office. That response, from Natalie Braswell, an attorney for Lamont, states that Capital Preparatory’s allegation that the state Board of Education acted unlawfully in its failure to fund the school is “both baseless and concerning, as it misrepresents the SDE’s legal authority and the legislative process that governs charter school funding,” according to a copy of the document reviewed by The Connecticut Mirror.
Responding to a request for comment, a spokesperson for Gov. Ned Lamont said his office cannot comment on ongoing litigation. A spokesperson for the State Department of Education declined to comment for the same reason. 
At the press conference, supporters of the school also named Sen. Matthew Lesser, D-Middletown, Senate President Pro Tem Martin Looney, D-New Haven, and Sen. Jan Hochadel, D-Meriden, as key figures that undermined the funding of the school. Looney, Hochadel and Lesser did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
“What they’re trying to argue is that one state legislator has a one person vote. So, Matt Lesser did speak to Marty Looney with Jan Hochadel, and they said, ‘take Middletown out of the budget,'” Steve Perry, founder of Capital Preparatory Charter School, told the CT Mirror. “Even if they said that, they don’t have the authority to do it.”
Years ago, a charter school only needed approval from the state Board of Education to begin the process of opening. 
But in 2015, the legislature changed the law to require lawmakers to approve the school’s funding. Earlier this year, Capital Preparatory asked the state Board of Education to specify which body is responsible for funding specific charter schools. 
In that petition, Capital Preparatory argued that it should be up to the Board of Education to decide which schools receive the funds. Representatives of the proposed school have repeatedly argued that because Capital Preparatory Middletown’s application for initial approval was awarded the highest score of any the board approved that year, it should be funded first. That did not happen.
Other charter schools have also faced opposition in Connecticut, like an effort to open a charter school in Danbury. There, Danbury lawmakers urged fellow legislators not to fund the school.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_6757-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-12-18 18:57:42.976915

(Photo by Michael Achterling/North Dakota Monitor)Former Republican-endorsed candidate Alex Balazs announced Thursday he will challenge Republican Rep. Julie Fedorchak for North Dakota’s only U.S. House seat.
In his campaign announcement, Balazs pledged to hold regular, in-person town halls and advocate for citizen-led service, veterans, fiscal discipline, border security and America First priorities.
Balazs, of Cando, received the endorsement of North Dakota Republicans for the open U.S. House seat during the 2024 state convention in Fargo. However, the support came after Fedorchak withdrew her name from consideration. 
Balazs finished fourth out of five candidates during the 2024 primary election for North Dakota’s at-large U.S. House seat with 4% of the statewide vote. Fedorchak won the primary with 46% voter support.
Fedorchak went on to defeat Democratic-NPL Party candidate Trygve Hammer during the 2024 general election with 69% voter support.
Balazs served in three different military branches across 25 years of service. He also served as a project manager for the State Department at different locations around the globe.
While aligned with the Republican platform, Balazs said he will remain an independent thinker on representing North Dakota.
“My background in national security and fiscal responsibility has prepared me to tackle these challenges with clarity and resolve,” he said.
Rep. Julie Fedorchak
Kate Roberts, spokeswoman for Julie Fedorchak for Congress, said Fedorchak received President Donald Trump’s endorsement for reelection in August. 
“She understands North Dakota and delivers results,” Roberts said in a text message. “She enjoys wide support and looks forward to a successful reelection campaign.”
A formal reelection announcement for Fedorchak is expected at a later date.
Candidates must file signature petitions or endorsement documents with the North Dakota Secretary of State’s Office by April 6 to be considered for the 2026 primary election on June 9. The 2026 general election will be Nov. 3.

Bob Ferguson announced new proposed housing investments on Thursday, Dec. 18, 2025, in Seattle, Washington. (Photo by Jake Goldstein-Street/Washington State Standard)SEATTLE — Washington Gov. Bob Ferguson is asking lawmakers to fund $244 million in additional housing investments as part of a budget proposal released Thursday.
His plan comes as the state grapples with an ongoing shortage of affordable housing, and after lawmakers have already pumped hundreds of millions of dollars toward the state’s main housing account over the past few years. Some of the funding Ferguson is proposing would go to help people whose homes were damaged in record flooding over the past two weeks.
Almost all of the money would be from the state’s capital budget, which is healthier than the cash-strapped operating budget. 
The governor also signed an executive order to get the ball rolling on establishing a new cabinet-level Department of Housing. 
“I’m enormously gratified to stand here today and be able to make the following statement: We have a housing governor,” Lt. Gov. Denny Heck, who has advised Ferguson on housing issues, said during a press conference at an affordable housing complex in south Seattle.
Of that $244 million, $50 million is for housing preservation, including to repair flood-damaged homes, Ferguson said. Another $5 million will go specifically to a grant program to help low-income homeowners with flood-related repairs.  
Ferguson said he would work with lawmakers early in the legislative session that begins next month to open up that money quickly. The governor called the funding a “down payment” as the state determines the scope of the flood damage. It’ll also serve as a bridge as the state works to get disaster aid from the federal government in the aftermath. 
“When you ask for disaster relief, the state is saying we can’t handle the scope of the damage that’s being caused,” Ferguson said. “But we’re working to make sure we do everything we can in the short term to help folks out, to make sure we get support during this really critical time.”
Ferguson’s housing proposals are in response to an estimated million-home shortfall the state faces over the next two decades. It’s estimated that half of those homes need to be affordable to those making less than half of the median income. 
The sum Ferguson is proposing builds upon $760 million in spending on affordable housing that lawmakers authorized in Washington’s construction budget this year. Of that, $605 million is directed to the Housing Trust Fund. That’s up from $527 million shoveled into the fund in the previous two-year budget. 
The details
Most of the additional $244 million Ferguson is calling for would go toward the Housing Trust Fund. 
It includes $81 million to develop nearly 2,000 new affordable housing units, he said. Another $73 million to build over 600 units for first-time homebuyers, and $20 million would go to acquire and preserve mobile and manufactured home communities.
There is also $6 million to speed up development by “modernizing permitting systems.”
The proposed spending would largely come from state bonds. A small amount is included in the operating budget proposal and some money from carbon auction proceeds under the state’s Climate Commitment Act, said Ferguson’s budget director, K.D. Chapman-See. 
“We feel very confident that we have absolutely maximized every dollar that is possibly available in our budget to go to housing,” Ferguson said. 
Ferguson described the funding ask as potentially the biggest housing investment in a supplemental budget in the state’s history. 
Legislators will also look at more policy solutions to get and keep people housed. 
This year, they passed legislation to push more housing development around transit stops, increase condo development, cap residential rent increases, ease parking requirements that serve as an impediment to construction and allow for more lot splitting.
Ferguson is partnering with Sen. Emily Alvarado, D-Seattle, on a housing bill this next session. The legislation would require cities and counties to permit residential and mixed-use development in commercial zones. The Democratic governor said he’ll also be supporting other housing legislation next year.

Denny Heck and Housing Development Consortium Executive Director Patience Malaba on Thursday, Dec. 18, 2025. (Photo by Jake Goldstein-Street/Washington State Standard)
“There are tens of thousands of parcels where housing is prohibited and where real barriers exist that make development infeasible,” Alvarado said. “Think about it, vacant strip malls or big box stores that are boarded up or empty parking lots, and now imagine the transformation of those places into homes. What a better future for our communities.” 
Former Gov. Christine Gregoire has been a vocal supporter of the proposed legislation. 
Other housing policy priorities next year include barring jurisdictions from denying permits for permanent supportive housing, transitional housing or indoor emergency housing or shelter in certain residential and commercial zones and limiting corporate homeownership, Alvarado said. 
The state faces new housing challenges this year, as the Trump administration looks to shift federal funding away from permanent supportive housing. Washington and other states are suing over the move. A hearing in the case is set for Friday in federal court in Rhode Island.
Even with this recent development, housing has always been a top priority for Ferguson as governor, he said. 
“I’m not sure I needed any extra motivation,” he said. 
Ferguson’s executive order on the new Department of Housing creates a task force to develop it. The task force is required to file a report by Nov. 15, 2026, with recommendations for the agency that lawmakers can consider in the 2027 legislative session.
The governor will release his proposals focused on supplemental funding for the transportation and operating budgets before Tuesday, the statutory deadline. Lawmakers begin their 60-day session Jan. 12 and will consider Ferguson’s plans.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_5537-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-12-18 18:57:42.976915

The Burlington School District has reached a $475,000 settlement with a former female athletic director who accused the district of gender-based wage discrimination.
Jeanne Hulsen, who worked at Burlington High School for 22 years, told VTDigger in a telephone interview that she filed a lawsuit in U.S. District Court in 2020 after the school district redefined the athletic director position and hired a younger and less experienced man at a starting salary that dwarfed hers by more than $30,000.
After years of what felt like going through life with a wet blanket draped over, Hulsen, 65, of South Burlington, said the settlement brings validation and closure.
“There’s this sense of freedom now that it’s over,” she said. 
According to the settlement, the lawsuit is dismissed with prejudice, and the school district will pay Hulsen $295,000 “in compensation for lost wages” and her lawyer $180,000 for legal costs.

John Franco, who represented Hulsen in the case, said they were scheduled to go to trial on Dec. 1. But both sides opted for mediation, which led to the settlement agreement dated Nov. 12.
While exhaustion was a factor in that decision, Franco said he found the case to be particularly egregious. 
“Jeanne was by far the most exploited employee based upon gender wage discrimination that I’ve ever come across,” he said. “She got a fraction of what her damages were.” 
She was originally seeking damages to the tune of almost $2 million, Franco said.
The district was prepared to go to trial, but the insurance carrier, which has ultimate settlement authority, made the decision to settle to avoid the cost of a trial, according to Russ Elek, spokesperson for the Burlington School District. The funds will be paid via insurance and the district will only pay the $5,000 deductible and any applicable payroll taxes, he added.
The settlement agreement “represents a compromise to avoid litigation” and further states that neither party “makes any admission concerning the strength or weakness of any claim or admits any liability therefore.”
The complaint came a year after the Burlington High School girls’ soccer team’s calls for gender pay equality went viral, receiving national attention.
At the time, Hulsen said, she was proud of their activism. But she said “it was very perplexing” given that she was “a prime example of that situation right in their backyard.”
It was also a time when she was among a very small number of athletic directors statewide who were women. She wasn’t a part of a union and received annual raises “almost without any discussion” or opportunity to negotiate. The amount was “typically lesser” than what people in bargaining units could secure, according to the lawsuit. Plus, the job grew immensely over those years, but the salary did not keep pace, she said.
“BSD provided significant support to the amazing student athletes involved in the Equal Pay movement, and we remain in full support of the cause,” Elek said in an email. “The vast majority of BSD wages are negotiated through bargaining units, a practice that has not changed since litigation began. Other wages are influenced by research, including regional comparisons. If we identify a pay discrepancy, we correct it as promptly as possible.”
In the civil complaint filed November 2020, Hulsen alleged that the Burlington School District violated the federal Equal Pay Act and the equal pay provisions of the Vermont Fair Employment Practices Act, and sought “appropriate relief, including back pay, liquidated damages, prejudgment interest, plus attorney’s fees, and litigation costs.”
Hulsen worked in the school district for a starting salary of $30,000 in 1998 and said she drew $70,000 when she left in 2020. After 22 years, her position was redefined, and she was not rehired. The district instead hired a younger man with two years of work experience at a starting salary of $87,405.50 in August 2020, the complaint stated. 
“Even adjusting Ms. Hulsen’s starting salary for inflation, Burlington School District paid her male successor a starting salary which was almost $39,700 higher in 2020 dollars,” the complaint stated.

The decision dropped all three major investor-owned power companies’ returns by 0.3%, bringing the shareholder return for Pacific Gas & Electric to just below double digits for the first time in at least two decades. A decision proposed last month would have imposed a slightly larger profit cut of 0.35%.
All of the utilities asked for a return of more than 10%. The decision is unlikely to significantly impact customer bills, which remain the second-highest in the nation after Hawaii.
Darcie Houck was the only “no” vote on the California Public Utilities Commission, saying the decision did not properly take into account the cost to ratepayers. 
“Every economic indicator tells us that we’re living in a time of extreme precarity for working Californians,” she said. “I do not think the decision threads the needle sufficiently to consider the full impact to the customer interest.”
Utilities say that a high potential rate of return for shareholders is important to bring in needed funding for infrastructure projects, which are typically paid for up front by investors and bonds and later reimbursed by ratepayers once regulators approve costs. This return is considered compensation for the risk of doing business.
The returns are not listed specifically on customers’ bills, instead baked into the rate customers pay.
The decision set 2026 potential shareholder returns for PG&E at 9.98%, Edison at 10.03%, and San Diego Gas & Electric at 9.93%. These returns are not guaranteed and can be affected by a utility’s financial performance throughout the year, going down if a utility has cost overruns. Historically, only San Diego Gas & Electric achieves its full shareholder return, while PG&E and Edison typically fall short of the full amount.
The three utilities’ approved returns have hovered around 10% for decades, which is also the national average for utility shareholder returns, often going above that. Academics and ratepayer advocates have argued for years that this is a problem because a higher return rate is meant to compensate for risk, but utilities are a historically low-risk industry. Their rates are set by regulators and their income is largely predictable and effectively guaranteed by ratepayers, who will continue needing services like electricity. U.S. 10-year Treasury bonds, which are considered the baseline for a risk-free investment, are about half of the utilities’ approved rate. Utilities regularly push back on this point, saying that wildfires in particular have made their industry more risky.
Utilities criticized the proposed drop in shareholder rates, saying it would exacerbate already high bills for ratepayers. The California Public Advocates Office, which advocates for ratepayers before the commission, pushed back on this, saying that claim is “entirely without merit.”
“The evidentiary record shows the [utilities’] claims for increasing their respective [returns] are based on flawed methods and would inevitably result in unreasonably high customer rates,” it said in a December response to utilities’ comments.
The utilities said the decision isn’t an accurate reflection of the risks their industry faces in the state.
“We think the reduction from current ROEs doesn’t reflect the unique risk environment facing California IOUs and their investors,” David Eisenhauer, spokesperson for Edison, said.
Similarly, PG&E was “disappointed that the final decision fails to acknowledge current elevated risks to help attract the needed investment for California’s energy systems,” Mike Gazda, PG&E spokesperson, said. “We will keep working with regulators and state leaders to ensure adequate funding needs and reasonable long-term rates for customers, so we can continue stabilizing our energy prices and funding critical energy system improvements for customers.”
Anthony Wagner, spokesperson for SDG&E, did not address the regulators’ decision directly, saying the company is “working every day to manage our costs responsibly while continuing to provide the essential service our communities depend on – offering tools and resources to ensure every customer has access to the support they need.”
The shareholder profits are a percentage of a utility’s “rate base” – the total value of its assets that it can earn a return on. This includes things such as power plants. While a utility’s approved shareholder returns fluctuate, the rate bases for California’s three utilities steadily rise. Each utility’s rate base is billions of dollars, earning hundreds of millions for shareholders even if a utility doesn’t reach its full shareholder return.
In 2023, for example, Edison had a rate base of $29.7 billion, and it was allowed to earn $198 million for shareholders that year. If its approved return was one percentage point lower, it would still have been allowed to earn $178 million for shareholders. Though it came in far short of this that year, it still brought shareholders $91 million from ratepayers.
In Houck’s dissent, she noted that the rate bases for the utilities, including Edison’s natural gas arm, are expected to go up by about 10% each year, with the combined authorized potential returns approaching $1 billion more than 2025. Her analysis for this included Edison’s natural gas arm, SoCalGas.
Houck recommended that regulators revisit this issue annually instead of every three years. California ratepayers are facing an affordability crisis for power bills because of factors such as wildfire recovery and hardening. Shareholder profits, which impact bills, have also risen in recent years because of utilities’ growing rate bases.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/092022-Power-Lines-RL-CM-24.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-12-18 18:57:42.976915

(Patrick Lohmann/Source NM)A coalition of New Mexico environmental advocacy groups this week endorsed $218 million in funding requests that would bolster water conservation and restoration projects. Lawmakers are expected to tackle these projects as they craft the state’s budget in January’s legislative session.
Projects in the group’s list range from relatively small — $1.5 million to upgrade an IT system in the Office of the State Engineer — to large — $50 million to meet the terms of the settlement agreement in a yearslong legal battle over Rio Grande water between Texas and New Mexico.
Many of the projects aim at giving New Mexico’s waterways preventative care to reduce the amount of costly disaster relief that’s often needed after wildfires give way to floods, advocates said.
“It is cheaper to invest before the big fire, before the big flood,” Dan Roper, New Mexico lead for Trout Unlimited, said during a news conference Wednesday that included representatives from nonprofit groups including Trout Unlimited, the New Mexico Acequia Association, New Mexico Wild and Western Resource Advocates. “We are getting fewer and fewer drops of water these days…these projects keep water, whether it falls as snow or monsoon rains, on the landscape longer. In doing that, we make sure that water is available downstream when it’s needed for things like irrigation and agriculture.” 
Roper and his colleagues also back a proposed law, known as the Land Grant-Merced and Acequia Infrastructure Act, which would create funds that support infrastructure and disaster recovery in rural and historic communities.
Together, representatives from the four advocacy organizations highlighted nearly a dozen budget requests from state agencies as the projects they see as most urgent for New Mexico’s environment. 
New Mexico Environment Department
Advocates expressed support for a $50 million request that would aid the department’s River Stewardship Program, which funds projects that address poor water quality in the state’s rivers. The funding is critical for waterways damaged by recent wildfires, such as those near the Hermits Peak-Calf Canyon burn scar and those in Ruidoso, advocates said.
They praised a $25 million ask for the department’s Neglected and Contaminated Site Fund, which would consider hundreds of contaminated or threatened groundwater sources across the state.
They also endorsed $3.5 million for the department’s Surface Water Permitting Program, which state leaders created in the wake of the U.S. Supreme Court’s Sackett v. EPA ruling. The decision removed protections from about half of the nation’s wetlands. 
New Mexico Office of the State Engineer
Environmental advocates said they want to see a $1 million appropriation for the Office of the State Engineer to develop tools and strategies to navigate interstate water agreements and mitigate the effects of long-term drought.
They also backed a request of $1.5 million to upgrade the office’s dated IT system. The Water Administration Technical Engineering Resource System, known as WATERS, database is the “backbone” for state officials who deal with rights, permitting and other legal issues regarding water. However, advocates said it’s been in need of an update for nearly 30 years and cannot perform basic functions, like digitizing existing records.
Interstate Stream Commission
Advocates backed a $10 million request for the Interstate Stream Commission’s infrastructure fund to pay for acequia and community ditch needs and disaster recovery.
They recommended $5 million for the commission’s regional water planning efforts, which stems from the 2023 Water Security Planning Act. The funding would pay for regional planning councils and public education initiatives, such as Main Stream New Mexico.
They highlighted a $15 million appropriation for the state’s Strategic Water Reserve, which allows people to sell or lease their water rights to the Interstate Stream Commission for various purposes, including pumping water underground and supporting endangered species. The money would go to a fund, which Senate Bill 37 created earlier this year, and give the Strategic Water Reserve a consistent lifeline.
The group also called out a $50 million request to help the Interstate Stream Commission meet the settlement terms of a lengthy legal dispute over Rio Grande water between Texas and New Mexico. The settlement requires “significant” groundwater purchases, advocates said, to reduce depletions on the Rio Grande.
The group championed a potential appropriation of $35 million for the Indian Water Rights Settlement Fund, which will help to pay for resolving Indigenous water rights claims.
New Mexico Bureau of Geology and Mineral Resources
Climate advocates said they want to see lawmakers appropriate $22 million for ongoing aquifer mapping and monitoring in the New Mexico Bureau of Geology and Mineral Resources. These mapping projects are meant to give state leaders a clear picture of the quantity and quality of groundwater resources across the state.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_0549-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-12-18 18:57:42.976915

The Mississippi Institutions of Higher Learning Board of Trustees, which oversees the state’s public universities, voted Thursday to waive part of a policy that would prevent an interim president from applying for the permanent position at the institution they lead, according to a news release from IHL.
The waiver only applies to the current JSU president search, and the vote was unanimous, said John Sewell, IHL’s communications director. 
Without the waiver, if Jones Gregory wanted to apply for the permanent role as president, she would first have to step down from the interim position. 
The vote reflects feedback the board received from JSU alumni and some students this summer questioning the fairness of the search process and criticizing the approach for a repeated lack of transparency. At a July meeting, some JSU stakeholders asked if Jones Gregory would get a fair shot at the permanent role. 
Jones Gregory, a JSU alumna, was the university’s provost and vice president of academic affairs before stepping into the interim leadership role. 
In a statement released in May after her appointment as a temporary leader, Jones Gregory expressed her appreciation for the chance to lead the university. 
“It has been my privilege to serve Jackson State as provost, and I am deeply grateful for the opportunity to continue serving my alma mater in this new role,” she said. “My commitment is to uphold the standard of excellence that defines Jackson State in every area of university life.
“As a proud graduate of JSU, I know what this university means to the people it serves because it has shaped every part of my life. This legacy grounds me and guides me.”
Jones Gregory could not immediately be reached for comment Thursday. 
The Thursday vote was not the first time the IHL board temporarily waived its policy related to interim presidents applying for the permanent position. 
In 2023, the IHL board voted 7-5 to allow Elayne Hayes Anthony, who was the temporary acting president, to apply for the permanent role. Dr. Steven Cunningham, the only Jackson State alumnus on the board and the trustee leading that university’s presidential search, voted no. He said he didn’t want to dissuade outside candidates from applying for the role. After conducting an international search and interviewing 79 applicants, the board hired Marcus Thompson. 
The top role at Jackson State has been vacant since May, when Thompson resigned as president less than two years into his tenure.
Jackson State’s next president will be its fourth since 2020, when then-President William Bynum, who was appointed in 2017, left after his arrest on multiple charges including possessing marijuana, giving a “false statement of identity” and “procuring the services of prostitute.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/21134934/Institute-of-Higher-Learning-Board-Meeting-2.jpg,,,2025-12-18 18:57:42.976915

Overall, grizzlies, which are classified as “threatened” under the Endangered Species Act, continued their decades-long recovery and reoccupied 4% more habitat over the past two years. That equates to a rangewide expansion of roughly 2,250 square miles, or an area about two-thirds the size of Yellowstone National Park.

But bruins that dwell in the tri-state Yellowstone area were the exception. The estimated 1,050 grizzlies there occupied about 3.5% less ground, or about 963 fewer square miles, than they did two years ago. The report does not address what drove the change, but lead author and Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks research biologist Cecily Costello said it’s likely related to grizzlies running out of ideal habitat in the modern West.
“When you look at the habitat to the east of the Yellowstone Ecosystem, to the south of Yellowstone, you’re looking at a lot of open prairie,” Costello said. “There’s not really big river valleys those bears could move into. There’s a little bit of a limitation in terms of the range expansion in those directions.” 
Wyoming grizzly managers see it similarly, attributing the slight retreat to bears losing spaces where they can live without getting into trouble. 
“I think it’s just indicative of where the population is,” said Dan Thompson, large carnivore supervisor for the Wyoming Game and Fish Department. “I don’t think we should expect it to expand.”

Matt Gould, the Interagency Grizzly Bear Study Team’s new leader, agreed. His predecessor, Frank van Manen, predicted about a decade ago that the grizzly population in the Yellowstone region would soon stabilize — and now it seems to be doing just that. 
“Occupied range has kind of waned up, and now it’s kind of slightly decreasing,” Gould said. “It’ll be interesting to see: ‘Does it drastically drop, or is it going to stay steady and bounce around?’” 
Stopped expanding
Biologists first documented the end of a half-century-long era of grizzly range expansion in the Yellowstone area two years ago. At the time, federal scientists observed a 0.5% reduction in the species’ overall distribution — a retreat of 142 square miles. 
The mapping Costello and her co-authors just completed examined the period from 2010 to 2024. Distribution in the Yellowstone and Northern Continental Divide ecosystem is based on hard data — from tracked bears, conflicts and other verified observations — over a 15-year rolling window. 
The data is smoothed out based on the whereabouts of all grizzlies known to exist in any given area. For that reason, bears that make “outlier” movements, like the subadult male that reachedthe Bighorns in 2024, don’t usually influence the distribution maps.
Contraction in the Yellowstone Ecosystem’s occupied range comes at a time when there has been a record number of bears dying, though grizzly biologists say they don’t necessarily see the two trends as being related.

Mortality hit a high in 2024, with 72 known grizzlies that died that calendar year, Gould said. The death toll this year is almost the same, at 71, which is about 35% greater than the 10-year average of 54 mortalities. 
The leading causes of death, according to Gould, were livestock conflict (21 grizzlies killed as a result), followed by “site conflicts with humans” (16 grizzlies), self-defense killings (12 grizzlies), accidental deaths (nine grizzlies) and natural causes like predation (six grizzlies). 
This year, three in four Yellowstone-area grizzly deaths were within a zone in the core of the ecosystem known as the “demographic monitoring area.” That’s a slightly higher rate than average. 
Where habitat’s retreating
Wildlife managers count bears in the demographic monitoring area. This area was declared fully occupied by bears in 2019. 
In Costello’s distribution report, this “core” area represented 71% of where grizzlies were found in 2024. The other 29% of the occupied range fell outside of this core area on the fringes of the mountainous, public land-dominated ecosystem. This is where grizzly range has been retreating. When Yellowstone ecosystem grizzly distribution reached its peak in 2021, more than 40% of occupied range was mapped outside the core zone.
Last year, the largest contraction in occupied Yellowstone habitat was located in eastern Idaho in the Big Hole Mountains and Snake River Range. Another recession appears in Montana’s Ruby Range, maps from the report show, and there’s a small loss of occupied range in the South Pass area off the tip of the Wyoming River Range. 
Costello, who compiled the maps, said she doesn’t put a “whole lot of stock” into small regional changes.
“The edges are a little bit uncertain,” she said, “because you have less [grizzly data] about the edges than you do about the middle.”
The other major population of grizzly bears in the Lower 48 dwell in Montana’s Northern Continental Divide Ecosystem. Occupied grizzly range stretched by 2,500 square miles, a nearly 12% increase. These bears mostly pressed into new habitat on the eastern and southern sides of the ecosystem, gaining ground in the Sapphire Range, and Boulder and Big Belt Mountains, maps show.
There are more than 24,000 square miles of occupied grizzly bear range in the Northern Continental Divide Ecosystem, a 12% increase from an assessment two years ago. (Cecily Costello)
The Northern Continental Divide Ecosystem’s occupied range encompasses much more open prairie than to the south in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem.
Partly, that’s explained by Montana grizzlies moving down big river corridors, Costello said. When a bunch of them make the movement, the occupied range line can “pull out really quickly.” Smoothing of the data can then make it look like they’ve reoccupied big chunks of open country, she said.
Habitat is another explanation for why western Montana occupied grizzly range keeps stretching while Yellowstone-area bears have held steady and retreated in places.   
“When you look at the plant communities and mountains that exist in western Montana, there’s still a lot of what could be considered decent bear habitat,” Costello said. “It’s the expectation that we’ll probably continue to see bears moving into those habitats.” 
A lot of that growth is expected to take grizzly populations toward Idaho’s Bitterroot Ecosystem, which has been unoccupied since the species was wiped out there in the 1950s.

(Photo by Carmen Forman/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — Reductions to a child care subsidy program will remain in place for now despite a lawsuit from an advocacy group challenging the legality, an Oklahoma County judge said. 
Judge Natalie Mai, at a hearing Thursday, declined to order the Oklahoma Department of Human Services to fully restore a pandemic-era child care subsidy program and said there was a lack of evidence to issue a temporary restraining order. Litigation will continue. 
The Licensed Child Care Association of Oklahoma sued the Oklahoma Department of Human Services after the agency notified providers over email in October that a $5 per child, per day subsidy for school-age children would be paused because federal relief funding had been exhausted and DHS could no longer afford to continue the full program.
The group sought an emergency injunction that would require the agency to continue to pay the subsidies and alleges the state agency failed to follow proper rule-making procedure, as outlined in state statute, when announcing the change.
New applications and renewals for child care subsidies are also paused and the “$5 per day COVID-era add-on incentive for school-age children” ended Nov. 1 because of funding lost during the federal government shutdown, according to the agency’s website. Subsidies are unaffected for children in foster care, adoptions, children with disabilities who are approved for a special needs rate and the unhoused population.
Andrew Bowman, an attorney representing DHS, said the subsidy changes are “absolutely” a budget issue and are “paused,” not ended. For the full program to resume, the agency will need further funding from the Oklahoma Legislature and is awaiting federal guidance, he said. 
“We understand that this is a difficult issue,” Bowman said. “We share in the frustrations about the lack of funding, but at the end of the day that’s what this is, a funding decision, and we’re doing what we can to focus our efforts on the families and children who are in the most need in this regard.”
Eve Spaulding, an attorney representing the child care advocacy group, said Thursday was only an emergency hearing so there will still be a future day in court.
“We will obviously continue moving forward, because this is not a simple matter,” she said. “This affects many. It affects all the families that receive subsidy here in the state, and it affects the child care facilities. Unfortunately, they are closing. I’ve gotten notice this week that multiple have already had to shut their doors.”
Shane Williams, a child care provider in Guymon, said about 80% of the children they care for are subsidized, with about 60% who are “school aged.”
With the current subsidy structure, Williams said his child care facility can last however long they want to “borrow money to keep operating.”
“So what happens then is we are basically personally subsidizing child care in our town, and we can’t do that,” he said. 
The agency is requesting $70 million in funding from the Oklahoma Legislature in an effort to “stabilize” the child care industry and “prevent future funding cliffs,” according to a news release.
This request will be “too late” to help child care providers who are closing now, Williams said. 
“When there’s not any discussion about these kinds of things … then I feel like we’re not being told the truth about what’s going on,” he said. “For child care for rural Oklahoma, this is going to be extremely detrimental. There aren’t other options like you have in a metropolitan area.”

The University of Delaware Fightin’ Blue Hens defeated the Louisiana Ragin’ Cajuns, 20-13, in the 68 Ventures Bowl, December 17, in Mobile, Alabama.
 
Louisiana quarterback Lunch Winfield gathered his team to the line of scrimmage in a hurry as time ticked down late in the fourth quarter. Delaware defensive end Noah Matthews tackled Winfield in bounds the play before, causing the scramble to the line. With no timeouts to stop the clock, Winfield managed to get everyone set. He spiked the ball with two seconds remaining in the game, setting up one final chance to tie or win the game from the UD seven yard line.
Following a timeout from the Delaware sideline, Winfield and the Louisiana offense lined up in the shotgun with three receivers near the right sideline, a running back to the quarterbacks right and a single receiver out to the left. Winfield received the snap and threw toward the middle of the endzone hoping to connect with fellow redshirt sophomore Caden Jensen running an in-breaking route from the three receiver set. Instead, the ball ricocheted off the tight end’s right forearm as Delaware safety KT Seay flew in to make the tackle, ensuring the ball would hit the ground and UD would leave Alabama with a winning season.  
The Blue Hens became the second school in FBS history to win a bowl game in their first season of FBS football after defeating the Ragin’ Cajuns, 20-13, Wednesday night, in the 68 Ventures Bowl.  
UD’s win in its first FBS postseason action brings its final record to 7-6 ending the program’s historic season with success. Head coach Ryan Carty donned a celebratory beaded necklace while celebrating the victory along with his team after the defense made the final play. Quarterback Nick Minicucci was the first person off the bench running to celebrate with the defense.
Minicucci was one of four Blue Hen players to win an award from the game. Minicucci took home the offensive MVP trophy. Nate Evans won the defensive MVP award and Nate Reed won the special teams MVP. Senior running back Jo Silver received the biggest honor, being named the game MVP.
Silver’s MVP award was well deserved after he finished the game with 116 rushing yards on only 14 carries and a touchdown that provided the spark for Delaware’s offense in the first quarter. 
The touchdown came late in the first frame in a game that neither offense could get much going in the first half. Louisiana was able to get down the field, but were stopped twice in the red zone. The first stop resulted in a missed field goal and the second was the first of three turnovers for the Ragin’ Cajuns on a Evans’ interception in the endzone. 
The Blue Hens started at their own 20-yard line following the turnover and ran four plays getting them to their own 39. On the fifth play, Minicucci handed the ball off to Silver, sending the New Jersey product streaking up the middle of the offensive line. Silver was barely touched, breaking through the first two levels of the defense and once he found open space there was no stopping him en route to a 61 yard score — the third longest run in the bowl game’s history.
Silver’s was the only touchdown scored in the first half. Louisiana knocked in a field goal on its first possession in the second quarter and Reed kicked one in for Delaware, giving the Blue Hens a seven point advantage at halftime. 
Silver and the run game provided the spark for Delaware’s offense which throughout the season routinely relied on the passing game to supply the majority of the production. The Blue Hens finished the regular season as Conference USA’s leading passing attack, but ranked ninth in rushing offense. On Wednesday, the rushing attack fell just 18 yards shy of matching the passing game’s yardage. 
The Blue Hens turned to the air coming out of halftime throwing the ball on all six plays of their first drive of the second half. Minicucci completed five of his six attempts amassing 70 yards and ending the drive by connecting with sophomore receiver Sean Wilson up the right seam for a 35-yard touchdown. Reed knocked in his second field goal on UD’s next drive, putting the Blue Hens up 17 with under seven minutes to go in the third quarter.
Delaware’s defense dominated throughout most of the game holding The Sun Belt’s seventh ranked offense at bay. The Blue Hens kept Louisiana scoreless for a little over 34 straight minutes before Tony Sterner converted on a 39-yard field goal late in the third quarter. Delaware attempted to answer with its own field goal on its ensuing drive, but Reed’s 52-yard attempt was blocked. The Ragin’ Cajuns used the good field position to drive 46 yards in ten plays scoring their lone touchdown of the evening on an eight yard completion to the LSU transfer Shelton Sampson Jr.
The Blue Hens defense stopped the scoring there and finished the bowl game with three takeaways, two sacks and five tackles for loss. Delaware stopped Louisiana on half of their redzone trips and held the offense to a 35 percent conversion rate on third down. 
UD and fellow CUSA member Jacksonville State are the only teams in FBS history to win a bowl game in its first season as FBS schools. In a fun sports coincidence, the Ragin’ Cajuns were on the losing end of both historical wins. 
The Blue Hens signed 19 high school athletes to join the ranks next year and with the transfer portal opening on January 2, 2026, and a bowl win under their belts the future could be bright for the University of Delaware football program.",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Gemini_Generated_Image_xf6g6rxf6g6rxf6g.png,,,2025-12-18 18:57:42.976915

Wes Moore to study midcycle congressional redistricting is expected to call for Moore to move ahead with redrawing the state's congressional map, an outcome one panel member blasted as ""pre-ordained"" and ""predetermined.""","The steps of the Maryland State House. (Photo by Danielle E. Gaines/Maryland Matters)A panel appointed by Gov. Wes Moore (D) to make recommendations on midcycle congressional redistricting is expected to call for the governor to move forward with redrawing the state’s eight congressional districts, an outcome one commission member blasted as “pre-ordained” and “predetermined.”
Senate President Bill Ferguson (D-Baltimore City) issued his scathing statement just moments before the Governor’s Redistricting Advisory Commission was set to meet behind closed doors at 5 p.m. Ferguson, one of the five commission members, and an outspoken opponent of hyper-partisan midcycle redistricting, said he issued the statement in response to reporters’ request for comment on the commission “approving a decision to move forward consideration of new Congressional maps.”
“The meeting is scheduled for 5:00 p.m. – it has not happened, but the outcome is already known. Clearly, the Commission’s work was pre-determined from the moment the GRAC was announced,” his statement said.
The fact that the meeting was to include a vote on a recommendation — if not a possible map — would likely surprise others on the panel. Cumberland Mayor Ray Morriss, in an interview early Thursday afternoon, said he expected the meeting to be “administrative” in nature, “to determine steps going forward and sort of lay out a plan for the for the future meetings … that we’re going to have, either about continuing down this path, or discussions about about maps.”
“Because, quite frankly, there have been no real discussions about maps that at this point in time. I haven’t seen anything. Nobody’s asked me anything about what I believe would be appropriate congressional district lines or anything like that,” Morriss said. “So, more than anything, I think that’s what today’s meeting will be … pretty much administrative and sort of figuring out the roadmap going forward.”

Previous meetings of the panel, which is chaired by Sen. Angela Alsobrooks (D-Md.), were all held in public, and virtually. None featured maps that the public or commission members could look at. Meetings were often added along the way. without a clear idea whehter the panel would hold in-person meetings, produce maps for comment or even if there was an expected end date to proceedings.
When asked if the meeting should be public, Morriss agreed that if a decision was to be made, it should be open. It’s why, “to a great extent,” he hung on to the belief that Thursday’s meeting would be “just administrative and [about] a timeline going forward.”
“I don’t believe it’s going to be a real discussion about maps or anything like that,” he said. “It may be a discussion about that we would be receiving data to be able to then have a discussion about a map, is the way I would see it, if it’s going to be done properly.”
Two other commission members contacted earlier in the day expressed similar beliefs about what would be discussed in the meeting, but they asked not to be named.
The governor’s office did not respond to a request for comment made earlier in the day.
Ferguson’s statement said he agreed to sit on the commission “because we were tasked with hearing from Marylanders as to whether to move forward with mid-cycle redistricting. The cumulative oral and written testimony received to date demonstrates by a large margin that Marylanders oppose mid-cycle redistricting. Moreover, we did not engage in a thoughtful, informed conversation that would have included, at the very least, testimony from the Office of the Attorney General, or our State and local boards of elections.”
“Pushing forward a pre-ordained recommendation outside the public eye is irresponsible and lacks transparency,” his statement said
Morriss agreed that the combination of written and in-person testimony led him to believe that Marylanders were not overwhelmingly in favor of redrawing the congressional maps.
Ferguson, in his statement, pointed to recent polling that he said showed state residents have bigger issues on their minds.
“Our state’s residents have been clear in front of this commission and through polling,” his statement said. “The overwhelming majority do not want a new congressional map. They want their government focused on fostering growth, affordability, and real protections against this lawless federal Administration. The Senate of Maryland remains focused on this important agenda as we continue to try to tackle a $1.4 billion budget shortfall in Maryland’s state budget.”

(Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images)Prosecutors made their closing arguments in the federal trial against Milwaukee Circuit Court Judge Hannah Dugan Thursday, asking jurors to consider what happens when judges decide what laws they want to follow based on their own personal beliefs. Dugan is accused of interfering with federal agents as they tried to make an immigration arrest outside her courtroom, and with helping their target to evade arrest. Jurors, the prosecution said, must draw a line, without which “there is only chaos,” and that “chaos is what the rule of law is intended to prevent. 
Calling immigration enforcement a “polarizing issue” nationwide, prosecutors said that Dugan is not on trial for her personal beliefs, but because she “stepped outside of the law.” As they flashed slides and footage to the jury, the prosecution heavily featured statements from Milwaukee County Circuit Court Judge Kristela Cervera, who accompanied Dugan into the hallway at the courthouse to confront the agents. Cervera testified against Dugan saying “judges shouldn’t be helping defendants evade arrest,” a quote prosecutors highlighted to the jury. 
Dugan knew that the agents had a warrant, prosecutors argued, yet  concealed Eduardo Flores-Ruiz, the immigrant they were there to arrest. Dugan’s obstruction of the agents was completed the moment she led Flores-Ruiz and his attorney, Mercedes de la Rosa, to a non-public door to exit her courtroom. Flores-Ruiz exited into the same hallway where agents were waiting for him, and they arrested him shortly afterwards outside the courthouse. But “it simply does not matter what happened next,” prosecutors said. 
The Wisconsin Examiner’s Criminal Justice Reporting Project shines a light on incarceration, law enforcement and criminal justice issues with support from the Public Welfare Foundation.
Although de la Rosa, who prosecutors described as “naive and inexperienced,” took the door to the public hallway where agents were waiting, they told the jury Dugan intended  for Flores-Ruiz and his attorney  to use a staircase to exit on  the fifth floor. To buttress their argument, prosecutors played courtroom audio that captured Dugan talking with court reporter Joan Butz and saying “down the stairs” as well as Dugan saying, “I’ll do it…I’ll take the heat,” and Butz responding, “I’d rather get in trouble.” 
Prosecutors argued that had Flores-Ruiz taken the stairs instead of going out into the hallway, that the agents “would have never found” the Mexican-born man, who was in the country without legal authorization. Repeatedly, prosecutors said that no one should ever “second guess” the decisions of ICE agents and law enforcement. 
Dugan was described as “stern” and “angrily pointing” in the hallway, rounding up nearly the entire arrest team and telling them to go to the chief judge’s office. Cervera led the agents to the office, testifying that she felt “abandoned” by Dugan and  “roped into” Dugan’s plan. “No one is above the law,” the prosecution stressed.
Attorney Jason Luczak, delivering the closing  for Dugan’s defense, tried to poke holes in the prosecution’s narrative. “This is a very important case; this is a very unprecedented trial,” Luczak said. “Make no mistake…the government is trying to make an example” out of Dugan, he said. He added that  the jury has the power to check what he described as “overreach” by the federal government. 
Luczak stressed that prior to the second Trump administration, ICE arrests had never occurred at the Milwaukee County Courthouse before. When the arrests began in late March, individuals had been reportedly arrested in elevators and before attending family court, actions which should have been reported up the agency’s chain of command but weren’t, he said. “They’re not even following their own policies,” Luczak said. “This caused concerns, legitimate concerns, among the judges.” 
The jury was asked to consider whether they really believe that Dugan would put her career at risk for Flores-Ruiz. “This case is riddled with doubts,” said Luczak, stressing that the jury can only convict if they find Dugan guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. “There are consequences on rubberstamping what the government wants you to rubberstamp.”
Jurors were reminded of the many emails sent by various judges asking for a policy, sharing stories of having people detained during court, and the slew of questions they had about how the county courthouse could respond. Chief Judge Carl Ashley had released a statement saying that ICE presence at the courthouse discouraged participation in the justice process and eroded trust in the courts’ integrity. 
Luczak also cast doubt on Cervera’s testimony. Jurors were played mute security camera video and asked to decide whether they believe Cervera that Dugan told the agents three times that they needed a judicial warrant, something that didn’t appear to happen in the video. “Judge Cervera is wrong,” said Luczak. “I don’t know if she’s lying, but I could think of some reasons why.” Cervera, the attorney argued, was trying to save herself by throwing Dugan under the bus. “You’re either a friend or an enemy of the government,” he said, asking the jury to consider why prosecutors relied on her statements so heavily. 
When Dugan spoke with the agents, Luczak said, “she’s not being confrontational, she’s being a judge.” He also highlighted that agents contradicted themselves in testimony and in the interviews they gave to FBI agents after the incident. Luczak pointed out that the agents never ran down the hallway to the elevators, as they’d implied. The audio evidence provided by prosecutors had also been taken from multiple microphones and put into one file, and was not audible in many areas, Luczak told the jury, adding, “I don’t think you can see this as very good evidence at all.” 
“If you don’t trust the evidence that the government is putting forward, it’s just another reasonable doubt,” Luczak said. Dugan never concealed Flores-Ruiz from the agents, who never entered her court to keep eyes on him, he said, adding that she never told de la Rosa to take the stairs. Luczak highlighted that prosecutors showed the jury video of the hall, with the filmer going down the stairs and not into the hallway, the opposite of what actually occurred. He called the government’s downplaying of concerns around ICE “tone deaf,” and questioned why Cervera herself texted her sister to warn her about sweeping arrests coming to the courthouse if she, too, didn’t have concerns.
“Justice is not what the government is seeking today,” Luczak. “They’re just wrong.” He told the jury to rely on Dugan’s emails to determine her state of mind, including one where she wrote: “We are in some uncharted waters with some very serious and even potential tragic community interests at risk in the balance.” 
The jury was given instructions by Adelman, and began deliberations shortly after 2 P.M. At around 3:45 P.M., the jury sent out a question to the judge. Interim U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Wisconsin Brad Schimel, who lost a bid for the Wisconsin Supreme Court earlier this year, made an appearance in the gallery as Adelman read the question from jurors about whether they were allowed to see ICE policies, which were included among the exhibits. 
Defense calls former Mayor Barrett as character witness
As witness testimony in the trial against Dugan concluded Thursday morning, Milwaukee County judges and public defenders spoke about the confusion and questions they faced when Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) began arresting people at the county courthouse. Former Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett was also called to the stand as a character witness, testifying that he’s  known Dugan for over 50 years since they were in high school together. 
Milwaukee County Circuit Court Judges Katie Kegel and Laura Gramling-Perez testified for the defense about emails local judges sent each other, asking for guidance and sharing stories about having people “snatched” out of their courtrooms and seeing ICE agents sitting in cars outside the court. 
One judge chimed in on the chain, “does this mean that Milwaukee County is cooperating with ICE?” Milwaukee County does not cooperate with ICE detainer requests in  the jail. The Milwaukee Police Department also has its own policies limiting cooperation with ICE.
Judges air concerns about courthouse arrests
In one of her emails, Gramling-Perez strongly urged the creation of a policy on courthouse arrests by ICE. Under such a policy, she testified, ICE agents would be required to check in with the chief judge before conducting any enforcement. When the arrest team arrived the morning of April 18, they checked in with security who notified their supervisors at the Milwaukee County Sheriff’s Office. Security initially believed the agents would need to be escorted by the sheriff’s office, but a sergeant told them that wouldn’t be necessary. 
Gramling-Perez reviewed emails on the stand that said “the historic protocols are now shifting quickly,” and explaining  that although state and local law enforcement have conducted arrests around the court in the past, those activities were always guided by clear policies or practices which were respected by law enforcement. “The ICE detentions are a different animal,” one email stated.
Prosecutors repeatedly attempted to get Gramling-Perez to say that ICE arrests were allowed in public hallways, per the “key takeaways” that she outlined in her email to Dugan and other judges. Gramling-Perez, however, didn’t budge. When prosecutors showed her images of documents they claimed were part of her presentation, she said she’d never seen them before. When they pressed her to say that ICE arrests could happen in public hallways, she countered that her emailed explanations were not all inclusive, that she is not an expert on the matter, but that even public hallway arrests have their limits. 
Gramling-Perez testified that although discussion of a policy had begun, no policy had yet been established by the chief judge. 
Attorney Maura Gingerich, a public defender, was also called to the stand as a defense witness. Gingerich testified wearing a black suit with a black mask she said she wore for health reasons — attire similar to what she wore on April 18, when security cameras captured her photographing the plain-clothes ICE, FBI, DEA, and Border Patrol task force members in the courthouse hallway. Gingerich testified that she took photographs of  the agents to send to her supervisor, so that the chief judge would be notified that the agents had returned and could offer guidance. 
“I think that it was very stressful to see what I thought were a number of law enforcement on the sixth floor without uniform,” Gingerich testified, noting she had already gone to another courtroom when Dugan approached the agents. One of the prosecutors  suggested  Gingerich followed the agents to another courtroom and was cooperating with Dugan,  saying, “I know what you guys were trying to do,” but Gingrich denied that characterization. Gingrich said she never saw Dugan that morning. 
Barrett calls Dugan ‘extremely honest’; Dugan invokes the Fifth Amendment
Former Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett testified as a character witness for Dugan, saying he has known her and the Dugan family for half a century. They first met when they attended the same high school.
Barrett described Dugan as very active in the community, an enthusiastic participant in community organizations and in  her church. “I think that she is extremely honest and I know that she will tell you exactly how she feels,” Barrett testified, adding that he feels that Dugan is a good person. 
The defense rested its case ahead of a lunch break. Dugan invoked her Fifth Amendment rights not to testify.

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch) The Iowa Department of Natural Resources confirmed Thursday that Canada geese at two southern Iowa lakes tested positive for highly pathogenic avian influenza. 
The outbreak was detected following reports of dead geese at Green Valley Lake, near Creston. 
Rachel Ruden, the state wildlife veterinarian with DNR, said this is the first time mass mortality events from the bird flu have impacted southwest Iowa since the start of the HPAI outbreak in 2022. 
“We’ve been kind of buffered in southwest from seeing great activity,” Ruden said. “Whereas other parts of the state, central Iowa and northeast, it’s been pretty routine to get activity in the fall (and) winter.” 
Since 2022, according to national data from U.S. Department of Agriculture, more than 184 million domestic poultry have died from the virus, and more than 8,500 cases of the flu have been detected in wild birds.
According to DNR, staff received reports of dead geese at Green Valley Lake Dec. 11 and began collecting birds to submit for testing at Iowa State University’s Veterinary Diagnostic Lab. Results from the test revealed geese died from the H5N1 avian influenza. 
Ruden said reports of dead geese circulated around the same time for Lake of Three Fires, in Bedford, where the other documented outbreak occurred. 
Because the birds are wild, can sink in the water or be taken off by scavenging animals, Ruden said it’s difficult to gather an exact count of the number of dead birds during an outbreak. She said last year, wild bird deaths across the state totaled in the low thousands. So far, in southwestern Iowa where the outbreaks have been concentrated this winter, Ruden estimated bird deaths totaled a “couple hundred.” 
Canada geese migration increased in late November with the cold and snowy conditions across Iowa. According to DNR, a Dec. 12 survey of waterfowl found the Canada geese populations had increased by more than 30% from the week prior. 
DNR said it’s “uncertain” how long the outbreak will last, but staff expect waterfowl will “disperse” and therefore reduce opportunities for transmission, as rain and mild weather move in. 
Ruden said it will be interesting, from a scientific perspective, to see how the scavenging population in southwest Iowa reacts to the outbreak. In the past, she said, there has been a concern about bald eagles contracting bird flu after scavenging bird carcasses but as it turns out, many of the mature bald eagles have shown they have antibodies to avian influenza. 
“But, that might not hold true in the southwest, where they really haven’t seen the same level of exposure,” Ruden said. 
People should avoid contact with dead or sick birds, according to DNR and to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. While the public health risk of HPAI is low, there have been more than 70 cases of the virus in people who were exposed to sick poultry or dairy cattle. 
DNR also advises Iowans keep their pets from dead or sick birds as they can also get sick from the virus. 
Iowans who see 20 or more bird carcasses are encouraged to call their local wildlife staff, a directory of which can be found online. 
The state has additional guidelines for Iowans who find a bird carcass on their property and want to collect and dispose of it safely.
“We encourage the public to report sick birds or other wildlife to your local wildlife biologist or conservation officer to help us track impacts of this disease,” Ruden said in the news release. “We all have a part to play in keeping Iowa’s wildlife healthy.”

(CSPAN screengrab)The economy’s great, like nobody’s ever seen before, so quit your whining, Trump told the nation in a TV address Wednesday night.
Besides, while the economy is great at levels that have never been seen, if there is something about it that bothers you, obviously that’s Biden’s fault, Trump added.
So everybody stop complaining and instead start writing heartfelt thank-you notes to Trump for making all your lives so marvelous.
The inflation report released Thursday morning did find a lower rate in November than in September. (There was no October report because of the government shutdown.) The overall inflation rate in September was 3%, but in November it was down to 2.7%.
When the inflation rate goes down, that doesn’t mean prices are going down, of course. But at least it means they’re not rising as fast.
Alas, a lot of people are throwing a lot of shade at the report, some of them having warned earlier that shutdown-related data collection snags which torpedoed the October report altogether would continue to distort findings in the November report.
I’m not qualified to say if this is a reflection of that, but I did notice the breakdown by detailed expenditure category in Thursday morning’s report has no info on some expenses. A couple that caught my eye: Motor vehicle insurance, and admission to sporting events. (There was also no November inflation data on “whiskey at home,” but I digress.)
And while the overall inflation rate was slightly lower than 3% — which was not only the September rate but also the rate when Trump took office in January — several items rose by a lot more than that.
Beef was 16% more expensive in November than it was a year ago.
Frozen fish and seafood, 12%. Coffee, 19%. Electricity, 7%. Natural gas, 9%. Motor vehicle repair, 10%. Tenants’ and household insurance, 7%. Care of invalids and elderly at home, 11%.
“Food away from home” was up 3.7% in November, and “full service food away from home” was up 4.3%. While not notably higher than the 2.7% increase for all items, like beef or coffee or natural gas was, the cost of food away from home has been rising more than the topline consumer price index inflation rate for months.
The rising cost of food away from home hurts more in Nevada than in a lot of other states, because of Nevada’s pretty high sales tax rates (about which few to no elected officials in the state give a damn, but again I digress).
But the cost to Nevadans who eat out isn’t the only reason I mention the rising prices of food away from home. 
“Accommodation and food services” is by far Nevada’s largest employment sector, accounting for more than 20% of the state’s jobs. And as I’ve noted before, in a metro area of 2.4 million people, it’s safe to assume those 2.4 million residents, not tourists, are the largest Southern Nevada customer base for food away from home on any given day. The last thing we need is weakness in spending by locals brought on by food inflation jeopardizing food service jobs throughout the valley.
Fortunately, we don’t have to worry about that, because the economy is great, like nobody’s ever seen before! So to reiterate, quit your whining, right?

Dec. 18, 2025 | Photo By Kyle Davidson/Michigan AdvanceAmid calls for transparency from the Attorney General’s Office, environmental activists and thousands of residents from across the state, the Michigan Public Service Commission met on Thursday to consider a set of contracts for one of the state’s largest utilities to provide energy to a massive data center project.
The regulatory body’s three commissioners voted unanimously to conditionally approve DTE Energy’s contracts to supply 1.4 gigawatts of power to a data center planned for construction in Saline Township in Washtenaw County by tech giant Oracle and developer Related Digital.
The decision, which came one day after potential financing for the project was withdrawn, sparked disappointment and frustration amongst several audience members who stood opposed to the deal and the lack of public transparency leading up to its approval.
DTE Energy filed an ex parte request with the commission on Oct. 31, drawing criticism from Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel, who noted that this procedure would allow the case to move forward without allowing outside parties to intervene, file testimony and conduct legal discovery on the deal.
In addition to her arguments that DTE’s application fails to provide sufficient evidence that the 1.4 gigawatt data center will not bring higher costs to customers, Nessel has also criticized the company for heavy redactions in the publicly available version of the contracts.
Jill Wilmot, DTE’s Director of Corporate Communications, previously told Michigan Advance that the company was following proper procedure, as the state allows companies to file for an uncontested approval of contracts if there is no cost of service increase to customers.
The company has also repeatedly pointed to language in the law establishing sales and use tax exemptions for data center construction and equipment that bars data centers from accepting an energy deal which shifts costs onto other ratepayers. However, that language is the part of the conditions for receiving the tax break, rather than a regulation on data center operations.
During the meeting, the commission’s Chief Operating Officer Mike Byrne told the commissioners before their vote that the order up for consideration determined that the case would not bring additional costs to customers. 
However, Byrne also broke down several of the stipulations that DTE would need to meet in order to reach the conditions of the contracts’ approval, including making a commitment to ensuring that the costs of supplying power to the project will be covered solely by the data center, and not by other ratepayers. 
The contracts would also require the company to tweak its rate structure for large load customers like data centers to ensure these facilities cover the costs associated with connecting to the grid. The order also requires DTE to update its emergency procedures to ensure that the data center would have its electricity reduced or interrupted before the company interrupts service to its other customers.
While public comments pointed to issues with noise pollution, water usage and other concerns on data centers, Commissioner Katherine Peretick noted that the Public Service Commission’s jurisdiction is limited to decisions around electrical supply.
She also emphasized that the order before the commissioners was conditional, and that if the safeguards included in the contract fail to protect customers, those risks will fall on DTE.
“If DTE is not comfortable bearing the risk. They’re welcome to refile their application as a contested case,” Peretick said. 
In a statement, DTE spokesperson Ryan Lowry applauded the commission’s decision. 
“DTE Energy has an obligation to serve any customer, including data centers, that come into our electric service territory in southeast Michigan. That’s why we’ve been so focused on making sure our broader customer base is protected with these contracts to ensure they will not subsidize data center rates,” Lowry said. “We acknowledge there’s a range of viewpoints and emotions about this decision. We remain deeply committed to supporting our customers and the communities we serve by delivering the safe, reliable energy they depend on each day.”
Nessel, on the other hand, shared her disappointment in the commission’s decision to grant DTE its contracts. 
“While I am relieved that the Commission at least purports to have placed some conditions on DTE’s application, without being able to see the full, unredacted contract, and study the predicate conditions and enforcement mechanisms set by the Commission, it is impossible to verify any of these claims today,” Nessel said in a statement. “As Michigan’s chief consumer advocate, my office is reviewing the Commission’s order and considering what next steps we may be able to take to protect our residents.”

The assurances provided by the commissioners also failed to sway those opposed to the project, including several Saline Township residents who spoke up during the meeting’s public comment period.
“What you did is hurting real families,” said Kathryn Haushalter, who lives near the data center site. “You can say and justify it however you want, but I want you to remember my kids and remember me. You’re hurting us. You do not serve me.”
Ash Haushalter, her husband, argued the commission had set a dangerous precedent, and that they’d allowed businesses to come in and set their own terms. 
Nichole Keway Biber, mid-Michigan Campaign Organizer for Clean Water Action, called on the commission to serve the public interest, rather than “[tying] a pretty bow on our ex-parte blindfolds.”
In a statement released after the decision, Katie Duckworth, a senior associate attorney with the Environmental Law and Policy Center, said the decision to approve the project without a contested case marked a missed opportunity to examine how the massive facility could impact DTE’s generation portfolio and Michigan’s renewable energy goals – including the impact of the proposed battery storage system the data center will be paying to develop as part of the project.
“The proposed battery storage system could be beneficial, but it’s critical to understand what will charge those batteries – clean energy or fossil fuels,” Duckworth said. “Fast-tracking approval only defers consideration of the renewable energy implications until next year’s integrated resource planning, which will only make these issues more difficult to thoughtfully address.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_7596-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-18 18:00:13.727185
,Mississippi Today,2025-12-18 22:41:32+00:00,Mississippi Today,Mississippi Department of Mental Health says fewer people who need mental health services are being held in county jails,Allen Siegler,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/12/18/mississippi-mental-health-jails/,"Before 2024 state legislation went into effect, people going through the civil commitment process could be jailed if county officials determined they did not have another place to hold them.","OXFORD – The Mississippi Department of Mental Health said significantly fewer people they oversee who needed mental health services in the state ended up in county jails over the last year, findings it attributed to a 2024 bill lawmakers passed to reduce how often people are placed in that position.
Sharing statistics from the department’s fiscal year 2025 annual report at the agency’s board meeting Thursday, Executive Director Wendy Bailey said there was a 31% decrease in state hospital admissions from jails since the House Bill 1640 became law in July 2024. 
Before the new legislation, people going through the civil commitment process could be jailed if county officials determined they did not have another place to hold them. Now, local community mental health center staffers screen people who are reported to be a potential danger to themself or others before they are taken into state custody and must note why a less restrictive treatment is not an option. A person cannot be held in jail unless all other options for care have been exhausted, they are “actively violent” and never for more than 48 hours. 
Among people jailed while awaiting mental health treatment at a state hospital, the department found that their wait behind bars decreased from about two days before the law went into effect to about one day after. Bailey attributed these changes to a part of the law that requires a provider to screen someone being committed for severe mental illness before they are sent to jail. 
In 2023, Mississippi Today and ProPublica found that the state routinely jailed people in need of severe mental health treatment who were never charged with a crime, which often endangered their lives. It was the only state in the country that regularly did that, according to a survey conducted by the newsrooms. 
The mental health department’s statistics are only one measure of how many people end up in jails with mental health needs and no criminal charges. Chancery clerks and community mental health centers are also supposed to keep track of the number of people in this position. Unlike the state agency, their statistics include those who are released to places other than the state hospitals. 
In January, Mississippi Today found that these three groups of recordkeepers had inconsistent numbers, making it difficult to say whether the 2024 law was doing what lawmakers said it would. 
After the board meeting, Adam Moore, spokesperson for the Department of Mental Health, said that although the agency’s annual report findings did not account for everyone, they still indicated that the new law was having a positive effect.
“We think it’s a correlation, and we think it’s a positive correlation,” he said.
House Public Health and Human Services Chairman Sam Creekmore, a Republican from New Albany, was the lead sponsor of the 2024 bill, and he said the Mississippi Today and ProPublica’s Investigation was a big reason he co-authored it. 
After the board meeting, Creekmore said he was proud of the Legislature’s efforts to reform the civil commitment process. But that law alone won’t ensure that the most mentally vulnerable Mississippians will avoid danger while trying to get help. 
He said that goal would take more work from the Legislature next year.
“It’s not perfect by any means.”

Operation Prairie Thunder, announced in July by Republican Gov. Larry Rhoden, has put additional state troopers in cities across South Dakota on eight occasions. 
Last week, the state said it had jailed 75 people on drug charges during two sets of patrols in the cities of Yankton, Huron and Belle Fourche. Earlier patrols had focused on the city of Sioux Falls. 
Brad Reiners, spokesman for the Highway Patrol, told South Dakota Searchlight the state logged $43,000 worth of overtime hours for troopers during the days the patrols took place.
“There are minimal lodging, travel, and fuel costs as well,” Reiners wrote in an email, adding that those expenses were covered by the Highway Patrol’s operational budget.
He also said troopers would have logged some overtime hours during the saturation patrol time frames even if those patrols had not taken place.

He declined to say how many additional troopers were involved in each patrol, or to offer the total annual overtime budget for the agency. He wrote that the overtime budget is “complex,” because “there are several accounts from which overtime may be drawn.” The Highway Patrol’s total budget for the current fiscal year is about $45 million.
The budget impact of saturation patrols extends beyond the Highway Patrol.
Minnehaha County Public Defender Traci Smith told South Dakota Searchlight she has not broken down the exact number of additional cases her office now has as a result of the patrols, but that “the increase we felt was anecdotally due to the higher number of arrests during those times.”
Smith also wrote that she had recently asked the Minnehaha County Commission for a $190,000 budget supplement. The commission approved her request on Tuesday.
The Nov. 21 letter requesting that money did not mention Operation Prairie Thunder, but pointed more generally to “unanticipated operational needs and workload-driven expenses” and a “sustained increase in felony, drug, and violent-offense cases.”
Immigration connection
During the saturation patrols, state troopers are questioning people they suspect of being in the U.S. without documentation, facilitated in part by a cooperation agreement inked between the agency and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement this year.
Such questioning, some of which results in detainment for ICE, takes place during regular traffic stops.
The mayor and a state representative from Huron, one of South Dakota’s most diverse cities per capita, told Searchlight that the troopers’ presence in town sparked fears of ICE immigration crackdowns.
The state does not publicly announce the dates for its patrols in advance, but the city of Brookings posted a press release late last week announcing that Operation Prairie Thunder patrols would take place in the city from Wednesday through Friday, and that “the city of Brookings will not be participating in these operations.”
Brookings Mayor Ope Neimeyer told The Dakota Scout newspaper that the release was meant to “inform our citizens.”
Josie Harms, a spokeswoman for Rhoden, declined to say on Tuesday if anything had changed in terms of the Highway Patrol’s plans for Brookings.
“For security reasons, we are not going to comment on operational specifics,” she wrote in a statement. “It’s unfortunate that the city of Brookings would jeopardize an anti-crime operation and put the safety of our officers at risk by publishing this information. In South Dakota, we enforce the rule of law.”",https://southdakotasearchlight.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Rhoden-and-ICE-e1753734439834-1024x825.jpg,,,2025-12-18 18:00:13.727185

Chief Operating Officer Ryan Coholan said weekend ridership is nearly back to 2019 levels. Overall ridership sits at 77 percent of 2019 levels, and weekday ridership is at 73 percent of 2019 levels, he added. 
“It’s a testament to what we’ve been able to produce and the work that we’re doing and the work that we’re going to do,” Coholan said at the board’s final meeting of 2025. “More and more people are returning, it really is a monumental comeback story.”
Coholan said he thought rising weekend ridership could be due to the ease with which people in Boston can get around with improved train service and connection. Weekday ridership figures are “reflective of just how work patterns have evolved” since the pandemic, he said.
In a lookback video played Thursday, T General Manager and interim MassDOT Secretary Phil Eng — donning a T-inspired holiday sweater — called 2025 a year of “bold goals, complex challenges and meaningful progress.”
Eng was not in-person at the Thursday meeting because he was attending funeral services out of state, according to T Chair Tom McGee.
Eng said that the number of scheduled weekday trips on the Red, Orange and Blue lines have increased 55 percent, 50 percent and 16 percent, respectively, since the spring of 2024. The T is providing nearly one million trips each day, which he called the highest ridership since the pandemic. 
Service in the core tunnel and all four Green Line branches has been suspended since December 8 and is set to reopen December 22. Coholan said that workers have been able to “tackle” all 13,000 feet of an aging, 130-year-old wooden trough with new composite fixtures. During the diversion, steel work was done at Boylston station, concrete and lighting work was done at Copley station, and work began on a radio replacement program, he said. They also began to install new messenger wire and cabling for upcoming signal upgrades.
The T is looking ahead to its role in major events in 2026, including FIFA World Cup, Massachusetts’ 250th anniversary and the return of tall ships to Boston Harbor.
“We installed a temporary platform, and are advancing the construction of permanent level boarding platform at Foxboro Station, positioning us to serve over 20,000 spectators for each FIFA Men’s World Cup game,” Eng said.
Later in the meeting, MBTA Transit Police Chief Kenneth Green said that there are 10 trains available to help transport the influx of people during the World Cup stint next summer. They’re still trying to figure out how the “queueing” of trains will work during that period, he said.
Following discussion about the recent Daniels-Finegoldsettlement, the board voted to update its service delivery policy to incorporate an accessibility metric. The board voted to add a “station staffing” metric to the service delivery policy, which would designate locations in stations for dedicated customer service staff. Each location would be assigned a “tier,” which would dictate the minimum staffing standards.
“This is about codifying a minimum standard that we have been meeting for the last few years,” Assistant General Manager of System-Wide Accessibility Laura Brelsbord told the board. The T established station staffing standards and a staffing plan to fulfill it in 2021, and the standard has largely been met since fiscal year 2024, when in-station staffing was increased, according to her report.
The board also voted to approve an updated 2026 transit safety plan.
The board approved the initial plan at an August 12 meeting, though Department of Public Utilities comments required a resubmittal of the plan in December. The board voted on DPU adjustments, which included updates to safety performance targets and the risk reduction program. After some confusion among a couple of board members about how the targets would be calculated, McGee suggested the board approve the updates but requested there be briefings or explanations about the plan shared in “layman’s terms.” 
T Chief Safety Officer Tim Lesniak pointed to improved safety rates year-over-year with regard to events reportable to the Federal Transit Administration and DPU.
“As you look at the FTA reportable events, we’re actually down approximately 25 percent from 2024 to 2025. And for DPU, we’re down approximately 15 percent from 2024 to 2025,” Lesniak said.
A Transit Police update showed that year-to-date “Part I” crimes — which include crimes such as aggravated assault, larceny and burglary — are down 14 percent. Offenses between January 1 and December 15 in 2024 totaled 798, while that same time period in 2025 saw 687 offenses. 
Green also noted hiring process changes in a 2024 economic development law that enable a new “hybrid” civil service model. The transit police will now be able to hire more officers outside of the civil service hiring process, he explained, which “taps into a much bigger applicant pool.”
“We can get college students now,” Green said. “You can get women, you can get minorities in the greater Boston area that know the system. It gives us the chance to diversify.”",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Transportation_MBTA_Orange-Line_Station.png?fit=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-12-18 18:00:13.727185

(Photo by Arshia Khan for Arkansas Advocate)Arkansas regulators have asked that an Oklahoma city’s appeal of a wastewater permit get tossed, saying lawyers who filed the appeal are ineligible because they are not licensed in the state.
The challenge to Decatur’s wastewater permit was filed last month by the city of Tulsa. Tulsa argued a permit modification granted by the Arkansas Department of Environmental Quality earlier this year violated the state’s water pollution standards. Tulsa also said the modified permit violates a 2003 federal settlement agreement among Tulsa, Decatur and several poultry companies over nutrient pollution in the water.
The Department of Environmental Quality argued that since the Tulsa-based attorneys for the permit appeal are not licensed in Arkansas, they’re prohibited from representing the city before the panel taking up the issue.
In Arkansas, those who object to an environmental quality permit decision have 30 days from the agency’s final decision to request a hearing before the Pollution Control and Ecology Commission, which kicks off the appeal process. But DEQ said since Tulsa’s attorneys weren’t licensed in Arkansas, that request was not properly filed by the deadline, making the request null and void.

""Patients must come first.""","WASHINGTON (AP) — The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services on Thursday unveiled a series of regulatory actions designed to block access to gender-affirming care for minors, building on broader Trump administration restrictions targeting transgender Americans.
The sweeping proposals — the most significant moves this administration has taken so far to restrict the use of puberty blockers, hormone therapy and surgical interventions for transgender children — include cutting off federal Medicaid and Medicare funding from hospitals that provide gender-affirming care to children and prohibiting federal Medicaid dollars from being used to fund such procedures.
“This is not medicine, it is malpractice,” Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said of gender-affirming procedures in a news conference on Thursday. “Sex-rejecting procedures rob children of their futures.”
Thursday’s announcements would imperil access in nearly two dozen states where drug treatments and surgical procedures remain legal and covered by Medicaid, which is funded by federal and state dollars.
A statement from the Connecticut Hospital Association Thursday said the move could “jeopardize care for all patients” by putting hospitals and providers in a challenging position. 
“These latest actions are aggressive, alarming, and follow a pattern of efforts by federal agencies — including the Department of Health and Human Services, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, the Department of Justice, and the Federal Trade Commission — that seek to bring the full weight of the federal government to bear on this issue,” the statement read. “Patients must come first and Connecticut hospitals are continuing to help families navigate care. Threatening healthcare providers and holding Medicare and Medicaid funding hostage are devastating tactics intended to leave hospitals with little choice.”
The Trump administration proposals run counter to the recommendations of major U.S. medical societies. And advocates for transgender children strongly refuted the administration’s claims about gender-affirming care, saying Thursday’s moves would put lives at risk.
“The multitude of efforts we are seeing from federal legislators to strip transgender and nonbinary youth of the health care they need is deeply troubling,” said Rodrigo Heng-Lehtinen, of The Trevor Project, a nonprofit suicide prevention organization for LBGTQ+ youth.
Proposed rules would threaten youth gender-affirming care in states where it remains legal
Medicaid programs in slightly less than half of states currently cover gender-affirming care. At least 27 states have adopted laws restricting or banning the care. The Supreme Court’s recent decision upholding Tennessee’s ban means most other state laws are likely to remain in place.
The proposals announced by Kennedy and his deputies are not final or legally binding. Officials must go through a lengthy rulemaking process, including periods of public comment and document rewrites, before the restrictions become permanent. They are also likely to face legal challenges.
But the proposed rules will likely further discourage health care providers from offering gender-affirming care to children and many hospitals have already ceased such care in anticipation of federal action.

Hannah Edwards, executive director of Transforming Families, a support organization for families of transgender youth in Minnesota, said she expects some patients will still be able to get care at private clinics that don’t participate in Medicaid and Medicare.
But that won’t be a solution for all kids seeking care.
Edwards has a 15-year-old transgender daughter and said that there’s a growing sense of fear because of federal government actions, even in a state that’s become a destination for families with transgender children.
“The conversation that constantly happens for my family personally is: Where is our red line when we need to flee the country?” she said.
Nearly all U.S. hospitals care for patients enrolled in Medicare and Medicaid, the federal government’s largest health plans that cover seniors, people with disabilities and low-income Americans. Losing access to those payments would imperil most U.S. hospitals and medical providers.
The same funding restrictions would apply to a smaller health plan, the State Children’s Health Insurance Program, when it comes to care for people under the age of 19, according to a federal notice posted Thursday morning.
“This sets a very dangerous precedent for all areas of health care, if the government can cherry-pick one area of medicine to use to withhold necessary funding from entire groups of people,” said Dr. Scott Leibowitz, a psychiatrist and board member for the World Professional Association for Transgender Health. The group develops standards of care for transgender patients globally.
Kennedy also announced Thursday that the HHS Office of Civil Rights will propose a rule excluding gender dysphoria from the definition of a disability. Gender dysphoria is a formal medical diagnosis that describes the distress felt when someone’s gender expression does not match their sex assigned at birth.
Young people who persistently experience gender dysphoria are first evaluated by a team of professionals. Some may try a social transition, involving changing a hairstyle or pronouns. Some may later also receive hormone-blocking drugs that delay puberty, followed by testosterone or estrogen to bring about the desired physical changes sought by patients. Surgery is rare for minors.
Moves contradict advice from medical organizations and transgender advocates
Dr. Mehmet Oz, the administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, on Thursday called transgender treatments “a Band-Aid on a much deeper pathology,” and suggested children with gender dysphoria are “confused, lost and need help.”
Polling shows many Americans agree with the administration’s view. An Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research survey conducted in May found that about half of U.S. adults approved of how Trump was handling transgender issues.
Chloe Cole, a conservative activist known for speaking about her gender-transition reversal, spoke at the news conference to express appreciation. She said cries for help from her and others in her situation, “have finally been heard.”
But the approach contradicts the recommendations of most major U.S. medical organizations, including the American Medical Association, which has urged states not to restrict transgender care and services. The American Academy of Pediatrics called on HHS to reverse course Thursday, saying “children and families will bear the consequences.”
“These rules are a baseless intrusion into the patient-physician relationship. Patients, their families, and their physicians—not politicians or government officials —should be the ones to make decisions together about what care is best for them,” said Dr. Susan Kressly, AAP president.
Actions build on a larger effort to restrict transgender rights
The announcements build on a wave of actions President Donald Trump, his administration and Republicans in Congress have taken to target the rights of transgender people nationwide.
On his first day in office, Trump signed an executive order that declared the federal government would recognize only two immutable sexes: male and female. He also has signed orders barring transgender athletes from participating in girls’ and women’s sports and cutting federal spending for transition-related care, which prompted Thursday’s announcement.
On Wednesday, a bill that would open transgender health care providers to prison time if they treat people under the age of 18 passed the U.S. House and heads to the Senate. Another bill under consideration in the House on Thursday aims to ban Medicaid coverage for gender-affirming care for children.

(Elise Plunk/Louisiana Illuminator)Environmental groups are yet again challenging Louisiana regu their decision to reissue a previously suspended permit for a liquified natural gas export facility in Cameron Parish. 
The Sierra Club, Turtle Island Restoration Network and Louisiana Bucket Brigade filed a lawsuit in Louisiana’s 38th judicial district against the Louisiana Department of Conservation and Energy. 
The environmental groups say that the agency “violated its constitutional, statutory and regulatory duties,” as well as the court’s previous judgment when it reissued a permit for the construction of Commonwealth LNG’s export facility on the coast of Cameron Parish. 
​​“We are objecting to this permit because it was hastily reissued and did not give the judge’s  valid concerns the genuine scrutiny they deserved,” said Anne Rolfes, director of the Louisiana Bucket Brigade.
“The communities who would be impacted by Commonwealth LNG have made it very clear that this project is not needed and not wanted,” said Eric Huber, Sierra Club managing attorney. 
Huber said the Department of Conservation and Energy “is attempting to shrug off its responsibility” by relying on studies done by other agencies— the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality and Federal Energy Regulatory Commission— rather than doing its own analysis. 
The lawsuit is the latest in back-and-forth between regulators, environmentalists and industry as the liquified natural gas industry pursues its expansion along the Gulf Coast.
 Louisiana district judge Penelope Richard ruled in a surprise move in October that the state agency did not adequately consider the effects of climate change and impacts to environmental justice communities nearby the planned facility when it issued its first permit to Commonwealth LNG. 
About a month later, the state reissued the permit, citing the need for haste in part to align with the Trump administration’s “energy dominance” agenda. 
The United States was the largest exporter of LNG in the world in 2024, 11.9 billion cubic feet per day around the globe, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Louisiana handled around 61% of those LNG exports.",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/IMG_9101-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-18 18:00:13.727185

The measure was considered during the chamber’s last vote series before a two-week break, and 18 members did not vote.Sen. Ron Johnson, a Wisconsin Republican, has sponsored a companion bill in that chamber. The measure faces an uphill road in the Senate, where passage of partisan bills is rarer due to the 60-vote threshold for most legislation.The bill would remove gray wolves from the ESA list, even though they have not reached population figures that the Fish and Wildlife Service has said would indicate full recovery.Rep. Donald S. Beyer, a Democrat from Virginia, said it would be reasonable to adjust population thresholds, but that congressionally mandated delisting was unwise and illegal.“This bill fails to recognize the status of gray wolves today, taking us back to an outdated rulemaking that didn't hold up in court,” Beyer said on the House floor Thursday.House Natural Resources Committee ranking Democrat Jared Huffman of California said the bill set a “troubling” precedent by blocking judicial review.“It tells the American people they no longer have the right to challenge unlawful government actions,” he said. “The ESA is simple and effective. It ensures decisions are grounded in science — that's the heart of it — and this bill throws that principle out the window.”Several Republicans on the Natural Resources Committee spoke in favor of the bill, saying it would delegate wolf management to states.In a statement, Natural Resources Chairman Bruce Westerman, an Arkansas Republican, said the gray wolf has been “fully recovered” for two decades.“States are more than capable of managing thriving wolf populations. This legislation restores a common-sense, science-based approach to wolf management, returning decision-making to states,” he said.Republicans also argued the bill would protect livestock and humans.Rep. Pete Stauber showed a photo from his district in Ely, Minnesota, of a wolf in a school parking lot.“Because of the gray wolf’s listing status, nothing could be done to protect the lives of the students there,” the Republican said. “The broken ESA is putting my constituents' lives at risk.”",,,,2025-12-18 18:00:13.727185

(Photo by Amy Bushatz/Mat-Su Sentinel)PALMER — The Matanuska-Susitna Borough Assembly this week voted to indefinitely delay a resolution that would have allowed formal talks with a group seeking to annex the Chugiak-Eagle River area into the Mat-Su Borough.
The resolution would have authorized the borough to enter into official “discussions and considerations” with Chugiak and Eagle River residents who want to separate from the Municipality of Anchorage and instead join Mat-Su.
That effort, known as Annex Now, is led by seven Eagle River and Chugiak residents, organizer and former Eagle River-Chugiak Rep. Ken McCarty said in an interview Tuesday.







Annex Now is separate from a longer-term push known as Eaglexit, which aims to peel the region away from Anchorage and create a new independent borough. That proposal is currently under review by the state’s Local Boundary Commission. A decision on whether Eaglexit can submit signatures for a ballot initiative on the matter is expected next month.
The Mat-Su Assembly voted 6-1 to indefinitely postpone the resolution supporting annexation discussions — a move that effectively kills the proposal — and instead wait for the commission to decide whether Eagle River can form its own borough.
“I don’t want to do anything that is going to give the boundary commission the idea that we want to get involved in annexing Chugiak and Eagle River,” said Assembly member Bill Gamble, whose district includes Big Lake. “I think it sends a very confusing mixed message.”
Assembly member Dmitri Fonov, who sponsored the resolution, voted no because he wanted to delay the discussion rather than dismiss it completely, he said. Fonov’s district includes portions of Palmer and Wasilla.
McCarty said the Annex Now effort offers Chugiak and Eagle River residents an alternative option if the commission rejects Eaglexit’s stand-alone borough plan. Any final decision to annex the area would require voter approval both there and in the Mat-Su Borough, he said.

Supporters of Eaglexit told the assembly that even greenlighting official discussions about annexation could confuse Chugiak and Eagle River residents and potentially hurt their chances of winning approval from the commission.
“We worked so hard on this, and I just beg you to table this indefinitely — give us a chance to get this done,” said Matthew Hickey, an Eagle River businessman who supports the Eaglexit effort, during public comment Tuesday. “This is like our worst nightmare happening, and we don’t get it.”
Regardless of whether the commission allows the issue to move forward, breaking away may not be financially viable, one Anchorage city official warned.
Not only would residents need to fund their own school district, but they would likely need to buy out the city’s assets in the area, Anchorage Assembly Chair Christopher Constant told the Anchorage Daily News in an interview last month.
“The cash-out costs would be extraordinary. They would need to go into massive debt,” Constant said. “It’s going to be very, very, very, very, very expensive. Five verys.”
How much annexing the region into Mat-Su could ultimately cost the borough or Eagle River-Chugiak residents — or what the legal path for doing so would involve — was not immediately clear. Borough Attorney Nick Spiropoulos said his office is focused on other matters and has not looked into the issue.
“I don’t have the time or the inclination to chase things that we’re not involved with,” he said during Tuesday’s meeting.

People in the […]","The state agency overseeing mental health must hire more people, including teams to respond to people in crisis, under a settlement agreement with the U.S. Department of Justice. (Photo provided/Department of Mental Health)COLUMBIA — South Carolina agreed to bolster programs that help people with severe mental illness live on their own as part of a settlement agreement with the federal Department of Justice.
The federal agency sued the state last December, claiming South Carolina’s agencies kept people in restrictive residential housing longer than necessary. People in the state’s care had few opportunities to go out in public or learn necessary social skills, making it difficult to meet the requirements to transition out of state-run facilities and into their own housing, the lawsuit claimed.
Not providing adults with severe mental illness who are capable of taking care of themselves with the supports needed to live on their own violates the 1990 Americans with Disabilities Act, which protects people with disabilities from discrimination, the justice department’s Civil Rights Division argued.
South Carolina, which denied the lawsuit’s claims, did not admit to doing anything wrong. The state has programs in place to address the Department of Justice’s demands, but over the next three years, the Department of Behavioral Health and Developmental Disabilities will expand those programs in an effort to help more people transition out of residential care and, when possible, treat people in their own homes, according to the settlement announced Thursday.
“We are pleased that the parties were able to reach an agreement to resolve this suit,” said Robert Kittle, a spokesman for the state attorney general, in an email.
The agency’s mental health office was pleased with the agreement, spokeswoman Tracy LaPointe said in an email. She noted that the state already meets some of the federal agency’s requirements, which the settlement requires the agency to maintain in the coming years.
“The office looks forward to expanding the identified services as needed to ensure those in need have access to high quality services in the least restrictive setting possible and continue to develop additional resources and partnerships to further this goal,” LaPointe said.
Last year, when the lawsuit was filed, more than 1,000 people were living in the state’s 362 facilities, which are often the first stop for people discharged from state-run psychiatric hospitals, according to the initial complaint. Seven of those were run through the state Office of Mental Health, LaPointe said.
Many of the people living in those care homes could live on their own with the right supports, the lawsuit argued. And some wouldn’t have to go there in the first place if the state had more resources to help people in crisis stay in their homes, federal attorneys wrote.
If the agency doesn’t meet the goals laid out in the agreement, the Department of Justice could sue again, according to the agreement. Since any funding for expanded programs must go through the Legislature, the federal and state agencies will meet to discuss next steps if legislators opt not to fund the programs.
The state’s behavioral health department, which formed this year from three other health-related agencies, is asking for $1.1 million to start putting changes in place. That’s in addition to the $3 million in the state budget that runs through the end of June for similar efforts. The agency expects to make another request for funding for the 2026-2027 budget, according to its budget request.
“The Department and South Carolina are working together to ensure that people with serious mental illnesses can be served in the community when they want to be,” said Harmeet K. Dhillon, an assistant U.S. attorney general, in a news release. “This is a great day for the people of South Carolina and demonstrates the substantial work that can happen when the federal government and states work together.”
Most of the settlement’s requirements had to do with hiring and retaining employees.
Some changes could prevent unnecessary hospitalizations, keeping people from going into residential treatment in the first place, according to the settlement.
For instance, the state must make sure it has at least two dedicated peer support specialists at each of its 16 community centers across the state. The specialists have been through their own recoveries and can share their experiences to help people in similar situations, who may not always trust medical professionals, according to the lawsuit.
The mental health office also needs more teams to visit people’s homes to help them with everyday treatment needs and other daily tasks. When the lawsuit was filed, the state operated two Assertive Community Treatment teams, composed of nurses, psychiatrists and peer support specialists. It needs another 11, including six larger teams capable of treating upward of 50 clients each, the settlement reads.
For people experiencing mental health emergencies, the state should have more two-person mobile crisis teams, which respond to calls made to 988, the suicide and crisis hotline. For that, the justice department didn’t give a specific number of teams, saying only that the state must have enough to respond to two incidents in a county at a time. Each of the 16 community centers, which serve all of the state’s counties, has a dedicated crisis team, LaPointe said.
If a person does need to stay at a residential treatment center, once they are stable and no longer need around-the-clock care, the state should work to get them back into the community as quickly as possible, according to the agreement.
To keep people from staying in residential care indefinitely, case managers should create a plan for how they will get housing, a job and at-home treatment, if necessary, within a month of a patient deciding they want to leave. No resident should stay longer than three months after they are able to secure housing and any other necessary supports under the agreement.
Adults who prefer residential care don’t have to leave, but they should have that choice, the settlement reads.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Columbia-Area-Highway-to-Hope-RV-1024x792.jpg,,,2025-12-18 16:58:34.200973

Nobody understood that one until about 30 minutes ago,” Trump said. “We made a lot more money than anybody thought because of tariffs, and the (reconciliation) bill helped us along. Nobody deserves it more than our military, and I say congratulations to everybody,” he continued in his 18-minute address.Politico first reported the money would not come from tariffs, as the president implied, but from a housing stipend already approved by Congress in this summer’s budget reconciliation bill, a massive tax and spending cuts measure often dubbed the “one big, beautiful bill,” which Trump signed into law on the Fourth of July. A senior White House administration official confirmed to States Newsroom via email Thursday afternoon that Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth has directed the department to disburse $2.6 billion “as a one-time basic allowance for housing supplement” to eligible service members at the rank of senior officer and below. The official also specified the one-time payment will go to “eligible recipients not receiving” a basic allowance for housing.The email specified that Congress appropriated $2.9 billion to the Department of Defense, which the White House refers to as the Department of War, to supplement the basic housing allowance entitlement.  The amount can be found in Title II of July’s budget reconciliation law.“This one-time payment exemplifies the Department’s ongoing commitment to improving the housing and quality of life for our military members and their families,” the administration official wrote in the email.The White House did not respond to follow-up questions pointing to Trump’s attribution in his speech to tariff revenue.When asked for comment, the Pentagon directed States Newsroom to a social media post on the White House Rapid Response account that slammed Politico’s reporting as “highly misleading.”One-time paymentA Department of Defense article published Thursday by “Pentagon News” states, “Money to pay for the Warrior Dividend came earlier this year as part of the president's One Big Beautiful Bill” and does not mention tariffs.The article, written by C. Todd Lopez, quotes Jules W. Hurst III, assistant secretary of the Army “who is performing the duties of comptroller for the War Department,” as saying, “This payment is a ‘thank you’ from President Trump, the American people and Congress.” U.S. Sen. Roger Wicker, R-Miss., who chairs the Senate Committee on Armed Services, issued a statement Thursday commending Trump’s “swift action to implement the additional funding Congress provided to help offset housing costs for service members.”“This one-time payment, combined with an average 4.2 percent increase to the Basic Allowance for Housing and 3.8 percent military pay raise in 2026, will put real money in the pockets of our servicemembers and their families, helping provide greater stability and improved housing options as they manage the unique demands of military life,” Wicker said.",,,,2025-12-18 16:58:34.200973

However, the cooperative also said hurricane-force winds damaged the grid more extensively than originally assessed.
“Crews are at work addressing multiple outages and expect to make slow and steady progress today (Thursday),” the cooperative said in a social media update. “There are over 150 outages currently impacting the system.
The cooperative said some areas have experienced “severe damage” and the widespread outage is expected to last multiple days. It encouraged people to plan accordingly.
“This damage will take time to resolve because crews are encountering wet, saturated ground conditions which, combined with massive, uprooted trees laying across lines and muddy ground, are making it extremely difficult for heavy trucks and equipment to safely reach damaged lines and poles,” the cooperative said.
NorthWestern Energy said dangerous weather conditions required crews to pause work overnight in some areas, including Elk Park north of Butte and Lincoln.
Crews were back in the field Thursday morning and will continue working until all customers are restored, the utility said.
However, NorthWestern Energy also noted a new weather system is expected to bring more snow and wind to Montana on Thursday evening.
It encouraged people to fully charge their electronic and mobile devices, power banks and other backups, and to prepare emergency outage kits with essentials.
“NorthWestern Energy is preparing with crews staffed, equipment and supplies ready to respond to any outages as quickly as possible, safely, to restore service,” the utility said.
In Helena, NorthWestern crews worked through Wednesday night to restore power to the Helena Regional Airport, the utility said.
In Superior, a generator was installed at the Town Pump convenience store to keep gasoline sales operating amid widespread outages along I-90 west of Missoula, NorthWestern said.
“Call volume to NorthWestern Energy’s Customer Service Center on Wednesday alone was equivalent to a typical full month, underscoring the impact of the storm across the state and the increase in customer calls that were being responded to by customer service representatives working around the clock,” NorthWestern said.
The utility said for the safety of customers and communities, power lines are being manually patrolled before being reenergized, which results in a longer restoration time for some outages.
“We appreciate customers’ patience during this challenging event,” NorthWestern Energy said.
 


Tips from NorthWestern
Safety Reminder
As residents inspect their property after the storm, watch for downed power lines hidden under debris. Always assume any downed line is energized and dangerous — stay far away and report it immediately.
Check your meter mast and base
Heavy windstorms can damage the meter bases and masts on homes and buildings.
If your meter base is damaged, you must contact a licensed electrician to make repairs before service can be restored safely.
Even if damage is visible, never attempt to make repairs yourself. Service lines can carry up to 240 volts of electricity, which can cause severe injury or start a fire.
Repairs can only be made by a licensed electrician.

The Trump administration pushes nuclear power center stage. Vermont’s congressional delegation works to help communities storing the radioactive fuel left behind.

While the nuclear renaissance grips Washington, Vermont’s congressional delegation introduced a bill this week seeking more local control over the closure of nuclear plants.
U.S. Sens. Peter Welch, D-Vt., and Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., along with U.S. Rep. Becca Balint,  D-Vt., joined with others to give states a more meaningful role in the development and approval of shutting down old nuclear reactors through the Nuclear Plant Decommissioning Act of 2025. 
Local groups that oversee the shutdown process, called community advisory boards, would receive more support under the law, and communities that host the reactors would get more money through grant programs. Those communities would also get more say in what happens when plants close or change ownership. 
In Vermont, the town of Vernon saw its nuclear plant close down in 2014, leading to job loss and economic disruption in a rural community. In the decade since, more than 1,000 tons of nuclear waste have been left behind, according to cleanup contractor NorthStar.
Adding parameters suggested in the bill to federal statute could become salient as nuclear energy grows, with plans to add 15 new reactors globally in 2026, including formerly retired U.S. plants.
“For too long, working class communities across the country have been forced to deal with the safety and economic consequences of nuclear power plant(s) while having virtually no say in the plans, which the people of Vernon understand all too well,” Sanders said in a media release.
The shuttering of Vermont Yankee
Vernon is the host community for the Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Station, a 650-megawatt plant that opened in 1972 on a curve along the Connecticut River. The plant produced more than a third of the state’s electricity while operating, but it closed in 2014, outcompeted by cheap natural gas and following decades of anti-nuclear activism in the state.
The closure came after a battle between the state and Entergy Nuclear Vermont Yankee, a Louisiana-based energy company that bought the facility a decade earlier. That company wanted to keep the plant open until 2032; the state wanted the plant to close in 2012, at the end of its operational license. Lawsuits followed, including a nationally watched debate over who had more control over nuclear energy: the state or the federal government. In the end, the parties settled.

Entergy transferred ownership of the site to a cleanup contractor, NorthStar Group Services Inc., which will decommission the plant by the end of 2026, four years ahead of schedule, according to a September report. A community group, the Vermont Nuclear Decommissioning Citizen Advisory Panel, formed under state statute to follow the progress in quarterly meetings, because decommissioning plans were convoluted and difficult to track.
“In Vernon, the loss of steady information, limited local capacity and the lack of predictable planning dollars made it much harder for the region to adapt,” said Adam Grinold, executive director of the Brattleboro Development Credit Corporation, an economic growth engine in the region that endorsed the legislation, in a statement. “A community can only react for so long before momentum slips away.”
The era of old nuclear fuel
The nation has no solution for long-term storage of nuclear waste, known as spent nuclear fuel, from such plants. 
While other countries have successfully sited long-term storage facilities — managed waste sites where fuel is stored thousands of feet underground — the U.S. is nowhere close to such construction after decades-long plans to store the waste at Nevada’s Yucca Mountain were canned during former President Barack Obama’s tenure. 
Right now, spent fuel is often stored on or near the decommissioned site in dry casks meant to keep people and the environment safe from dangerous levels of radiation. That’s the situation in Vernon, where 58 dry casks are stored on site. 
Under the Senate bill introduced by Welch and others, host communities like Vernon could be paid $15 per kilogram of waste. Vermont Yankee houses 1.2 million kilograms of waste in its dry casks. Under the bill, the nearby community could earn more than $10 million annually, according to Welch’s office, or about $90 million through fiscal year 2035, if the bill passes during the 2026 congressional session.
But that passage is unlikely, according to Welch’s office.
While support for nuclear power is a rare overlap between Republicans and Democrats, the bill did not receive bipartisan support, a point made when state leaders and community members assembled at a virtual Dec. 8 meeting hosted by the citizens advisory panel. 
That’s partly because the bill is asking for a lot of money for nuclear communities, according to Welch’s office. The law also comes in response to moves by the Trump administration to weaken the independence of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, the independent federal body that oversees the licensing and safety regulations of U.S. nuclear sites.

An uncertain future
Vernon’s nuclear future remains uncertain. Under the Trump administration, the U.S. Department of Energy is pushing to find a home for stranded nuclear waste, including in communities like Windham County.
In November, a pro-nuclear energy nonprofit based in California, the Good Energy Collective, hosted a two-day meeting in Vernon to discuss why a community might be interested in hosting a consolidated 15,000 metric tons of spent nuclear fuel. That’s more than 12 times the amount of waste stored in Vernon today. While no communities have signed on to hosting such a high volume of waste, the federal government is searching for one.
The Energy Department has the sole legal authority and responsibility to remove spent fuel from the Vermont Yankee site, according to Scott State, NorthStar CEO and chief nuclear officer. Some of those low-level radioactive materials from the decommissioning process are stored at a facility in Andrews County, Texas. NorthStar once hoped to send more nuclear waste to Texas until a federal court decision blocked the transportation in 2023.
This summer, that decision was overturned by the U.S. Supreme Court. The Texas site “provides a safe and economical interim storage option for spent fuel from Vermont Yankee,” State said in an email. But the Energy Department hasn’t developed the infrastructure needed to transport spent fuel there, State said.
“NorthStar has no control over either the timing of spent fuel removal or the choice of final or interim storage location,” State wrote. “NorthStar’s only responsibility is to ensure that spent fuel remains safely and securely stored while it remains on the Vermont Yankee site.”

(Photo by Streeter Lecka/Getty Images)Former Gov. Jim Hunt, the longest serving governor in North Carolina history, who championed education and served as a decades-long stalwart for the state’s Democratic Party, died Thursday, according to Lt. Gov. Rachel Hunt, his daughter. He was 88.  
“It is with deep sadness that I share the passing of my beloved daddy and hero, former Gov. Jim Hunt,” Rachel Hunt said in a statement Thursday. “He devoted his life to serving the people of North Carolina, guided by a belief that public service should expand opportunity, strengthen communities, and always put people first. His leadership and compassion left a lasting impact on the lives of countless North Carolinians.
“To our family, he was a loving husband, dad, and granddad whose kindness and steady hand shaped our lives in immeasurable ways,” she continued. “We are profoundly grateful for the outpouring of love and support as we mourn and celebrate his extraordinary life.”
Hunt served four terms as North Carolina governor, from 1977-1985 and then again from 1993-2000. 
In 1984, he ran for U.S. Senate against incumbent Republican Jesse Helms, but lost after a hard-fought, bruising campaign that was the most expensive Senate race in history at the time. 
He was known as the “education governor,” promoting pre-kindergarten — he created the state’s “Smart Start” program in the 1990s — as well as higher teacher pay. He founded the N.C. School of Science and Mathematics in Durham.  
Hunt was also an advocate for technology-centered economic development, establishing the N.C. Biotechnology Center and helping to recruit a number of major tenants to Research Triangle Park. 
Hunt also convinced North Carolina voters in 1996 to amend the state’s constitution to give the governor veto power. The amendment was approved by a 3-to-1 margin.   
Born in Greensboro, Hunt earned degrees at NC State and UNC School of Law. He worked in Nepal and on Democratic campaigns before running and winning his own campaign for lieutenant governor in 1972.
After four years as lieutenant governor, during which he helped lead efforts to make kindergarten mandatory and raise teacher pay, he ran and won the governorship. 
Even after he retired from elected office, Hunt continued to be a driving force in the North Carolina Democratic Party for many years, shaping the state-level candidates who followed him, and stumping and fundraising for a who’s-who list of Democratic presidential candidates. 
In his later years, he also founded the Hunt Institute at Duke University, a nonprofit education policy think tank, as well as the Institute for Emerging Issues at N.C. State, a nonprofit that studies a broader range of public policy issues.
Gov. Josh Stein, in a statement Thursday, said he “can think of no one who shaped North Carolina’s recent successes as much as Gov. Jim Hunt.”
“Governor for 16 years, he was a visionary who founded Smart Start, raised teacher pay, protected air quality, and created the NC Biotech Center,” Stein said. On a personal level, he was a mentor and dear friend. Anna and I are keeping Carolyn, Rachel, and the entire Hunt family in our thoughts and prayers. May Gov. Hunt’s memory be a blessing. He certainly was for North Carolina.”

,Mississippi Today,2025-12-18 21:37:51+00:00,Mississippi Today,Greenwood Leflore Hospital reaches deal with state Medicaid officials to repay remainder of its $5.5 million debt,Gwen Dilworth,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/12/18/greenwood-leflore-medicaid-debt/,The overpayments stemmed from calculations by the Division of Medicaid based on old data that did not reflect lower patient volumes after the hospital closed its labor and delivery and intensive care units in 2022.,"Greenwood Leflore Hospital and the Mississippi Division of Medicaid reached an agreement Thursday in a dispute that hospital leaders said could otherwise force the facility to close.
The compromise, reached during a Hinds County Chancery Court hearing, gives both sides more time to negotiate a plan for the hospital to repay $5.5 million in Medicaid overpayments made last year. The agency has already recouped about $2 million of the funds. Under the deal, the Greenwood public hospital must secure a property bond by Jan. 31 to guarantee repayment of the debt or the Division of Medicaid could withhold scheduled payments to the hospital.
The conflict began after the Division of Medicaid notified the hospital in June it would recoup $5.5 million in state-directed payments, or supplemental funds intended to offset low Medicaid reimbursement rates. Hospital leaders warned the agency in September that the proposed repayment schedule of $900,000 a quarter — with about $2 million already recovered this year — would severely strain the long-struggling hospital and could lead to its closure. The facility serves about 300,000 patients in the Mississippi Delta, a region of the state with limited access to medical care. 
The overpayments stemmed from calculations by the Division of Medicaid based on old data that did not reflect lower patient volumes after the hospital closed its labor and delivery and intensive care units in 2022. Hospitals were notified two years ago that a reconciliation would occur in 2025, according to the Division of Medicaid, though they did not know at the time how much they would owe. 
Greenwood Leflore is one of 30 hospitals overpaid a total of $48 million during the state’s 2024 fiscal year, Marchand previously told Mississippi Today.
The recoupment amount is significant for the 35-bed hospital, which operates a physician-staffed emergency room and offers general, vascular and outpatient orthopedic surgery, cancer care and a full suite of diagnostic services. The hospital’s total operating expenses were $74.7 million in the 2023 fiscal year, according to an audit performed that year. 
Tensions escalated this month after the Division of Medicaid reversed an earlier repayment agreement and instead accelerated the recovery, saying it would withhold $2.5 million in supplemental payments this month, according to an affidavit filed in court by the hospital. Weeks earlier, on Dec. 1, the agency said it would pause recoupments until March of next year, according to hospital leaders. 
“We will make our last payroll tomorrow,” interim hospital CEO Gary Marchand testified at the Dec. 18 court hearing before the agreement was reached. He warned that once the hospital announces layoffs, licensed professionals on staff will take jobs elsewhere and make it difficult to reopen the hospital, even under new leadership.

After the Division of Medicaid paused recovery of the funds for two months, Greenwood Leflore Hospital proposed several plans for repayment within three years. The hospital said these plans would buy it time to first begin receiving higher payments for Medicare patients, which are expected as a result of the hospital’s acceptance to the federal Rural Community Hospital Demonstration Program earlier this year. The program allows selected hospitals to be reimbursed based on their actual costs for inpatient care instead of a fixed amount. The designation is expected to increase the hospital’s Medicare inpatient payments by about $1.3 million a year, said Marchand in a Dec. 18 memo to staff and board members.
“We thought we had finally climbed out of the COVID hole,” Marchand said Thursday of the hospital’s acceptance into the program. The hospital also began providing skilled nursing care for people recovering after hospital stays this year, but will not begin receiving the higher payments for these services until late 2026.
But the Division of Medicaid said in September it did not agree with the solutions for repayment proposed by the hospital and denied the hospital’s request for an administrative appeal process on the matter. The hospital then appealed the matter in Hinds County Chancery Court, asking a judge to uphold the hospital’s right to recourse and pause the pending recoupments. 
Janet McMurtray, an attorney representing Mississippi Medicaid, argued the hospital did not have the grounds to appeal and it is not the responsibility of Medicaid to bail the hospital out of its ongoing dire financial straits. 
“They have not put their house in order,” she said. “…I don’t know what is going to save this hospital, but it’s not going to be Medicaid.”
The Division of Medicaid said it needed security before discussing a repayment plan, she said, emphasizing the agency’s responsibility to recoup the payment in order to keep the supplemental payments program in balance for all hospitals. 
In a letter dated Dec. 17, Senate Public Health Committee Chairman Hob Bryan, a Democrat from Amory, and House Public Health Committee Chairman Sam Creekmore, a Republican from New Albany, encouraged Judge J. Dewayne Thomas to pause the repayments to give lawmakers time to pursue remedies during the upcoming Legislative session. 
“Greenwood Leflore Hospital serves as a critical lifeline for thousands of residents, providing essential medical services that would otherwise be inaccessible,” wrote the chairmen. “Greenwood Leflore Hospital also serves as an important economic anchor in the Leflore County and wider Delta communities, employing more than 400 individuals.”
The hospital has faced a litany of financial challenges over the past several years. Before the COVID-19 pandemic began, the hospital was losing between $7 million to $9 million a year, Marchand previously told Mississippi Today.
The pandemic only worsened the hospital’s precarious financial condition. To keep its doors open, the hospital shut down departments and clinics, went up for lease multiple times, drew down millions of dollars in credit, applied for grants from the state Legislature and pursued a more lucrative hospital designation. In 2023, the hospital suspended the use of 173 beds to control costs, according to an audit. 
Marchand, who plans to step down Jan. 1, repeatedly warned local leaders and state lawmakers that the hospital was on the verge of closure. 
To become more financially secure, the facility vied in 2023 to be designated a critical access hospital. These facilities are reimbursed by Medicare at a rate of 101%, theoretically allowing for a 1% profit. But its initial application was denied because critical access hospitals must be located 35 miles from the nearest hospital, and South Sunflower County Hospital in Indianola is closer, at 28 miles away. 
Greenwood Leflore was one of three hospitals in the state chosen for the Rural Community Hospital Demonstration Program in April.
The state-directed payments helped to stabilize Greenwood Leflore’s finances after it was forced to close valued services. But those payments are set to be reduced over time beginning in 2028 as a result of federal cuts to Medicaid included in the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” signed by President Donald Trump in July. The hospital will remain open for now, but its long-term financial outlook may depend on how it adapts as those payments are gradually reduced.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/06091110/3X0A9410-scaled.jpg,,,2025-12-18 16:58:34.200973

(Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)The Tennessee Court of Appeals has agreed to hear the state’s appeal of a Nashville judge’s decision to temporarily block the Tennessee National Guard’s deployment to Memphis. 
The appeals court, setting an expedited timeline, has set a March 5 oral arguments date. 
The appellate court will review a Nov. 21 ruling by Davidson County Chancellor Patricia Head Moskal to grant a temporary injunction barring the Guard from patrolling the streets of Memphis. The Guard was deployed to Memphis by Gov. Bill Lee as part of the Memphis Safe Task Force convened in September by President Donald Trump. 
In Memphis, volunteers document Task Force arrests and provide aid to those left behind

Moskal’s order never took effect; anticipating the state would appeal, her ruling was conditioned on an appeal being filed. The case is now on hold pending a ruling from the higher court.
Shelby County Mayor Lee Harris and six other Democratic officials filed suit in October against Gov. Bill Lee, Tennessee Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti and Major General Warner Ross III of the Tennessee National Guard,  challenging the deployment as contrary to Tennessee law and the state constitution. 
The suit cited a 2021 opinion by former Tennessee Attorney General Herbert Slatery III that concluded, under the Tennessee Constitution, “only circumstances amounting to a rebellion or invasion permit the governor to call out the militia, and even then, the legislature must declare, by law, that the public safety requires it.” 
Skrmetti’s revised the decision in April 2024, writing that the Tennessee National Guard is only a militia for the purposes of a federal deployment. It was Lee who deployed the guard to Memphis, unlike other cities across the country that currently have a National Guard presence, ordered by the federal government.
Tennessee lawmaker says AG omitted, altered Guard deployment opinions

The lawsuit also cited state law that entrusts local officials with determining whether there has been a breakdown in law and order requiring the presence of the guard. 
State lawyers have argued the Tennessee National Guard is an “army” and not a militia constrained by Tennessee law and the constitution.
“The Governor, the sole State official elected by the entire voting population of Tennessee, is established as commander-in-chief by both Constitution and statute,” they wrote. “Fettering the Governor’s authority to identify those rare occasions when the Guard is necessary and mobilize the Guard accordingly will put future Tennesseans at grave risk.”
Members of the Guard have been patrolling the streets of Memphis since October as part of the Memphis Safe Task Force convened by Trump to restore law and order to Memphis, whose violent crime rates have risen in recent years. Local officials have noted the rates had begun to fall before the Task Force was created. 
The number of National Guard in Memphis has fluctuated, but court filings last month said more than 700 are currently in the city. 
The appeals court asked both sides to weigh in on one additional question, beyond the arguments heard in Nashville: whether the case should have come before a three-judge panel instead of a single Chancery Court judge. Tennessee law requires certain challenges to state actions be heard in front of a panel of judges, one representing each geographic division of the state.

(Chase Woodruff/Colorado Newsline)Colorado air quality regulators on Thursday adopted new rules aimed at limiting emissions of methane, a potent greenhouse gas, from the state’s landfills.
Members of the Air Quality Control Commission voted 6-0 to approve the new rules, concluding a yearlong rulemaking process that resulted in a compromise plan agreed to by environmental groups and public and private landfill operators.
Food waste and other organic material dumped in landfills produces methane and other pollutants as it decomposes. Colorado’s 59 landfills emit a combined 1.3 million tons of carbon-dioxide-equivalent emissions every year, a little over 1% of the state’s overall greenhouse gas emissions.

“Today’s decision is a meaningful victory for the health of Colorado communities,” Nikita Habermehl, a pediatrician and advocate with Healthy Air & Water Colorado, said in a statement. “Methane is a powerful climate pollutant that also worsens the air quality issues driving asthma, respiratory illness, and other preventable health harms — especially for children and those living closest to landfills.”
The new rules approved Thursday will require landfill operators to take a variety of steps to limit their emissions, including increased monitoring for leaks and requirements on the amount and types of soil that can be used as landfill cover.
Under Environmental Protection Agency rules, 12 of Colorado’s largest landfills are required to maintain gas collection and control systems, which can capture the waste methane, or combust it in a flare system to convert it to carbon dioxide, a less potent greenhouse gas. The AQCC’s rule would extend those requirements to approximately 16 additional mid-sized landfills, though the state’s smallest operators would still be exempt. It also requires open flares to be phased out and replaced by more efficient enclosed alternatives by 2029.










The rule approved by the commission is an important step forward on landfill emissions in Colorado.


– Alexandra Schluntz, attorney with Earthjustice


“The rule approved by the commission is an important step forward on landfill emissions in Colorado,” said Alexandra Schluntz, an attorney with environmental group Earthjustice. “While this does not do everything we hoped to see, it will make a real difference for the health of surrounding communities.”
After the AQCC held a formal rulemaking hearing on the proposal in August, staff from the state’s Air Pollution Control Division last month submitted a series of revisions to the rule, weakening it at the request of waste industry groups and local governments that operate public landfills.
Prior to the vote, AQCC commissioner Jon Slutsky said the revised rule didn’t go far enough to meet the state’s greenhouse gas reduction goals, objecting to an increase in the emissions threshold that triggers monitoring requirements and corrective action, which he called the “heart of the regulation.” Slutsky moved to strike the revisions from the rule, but his fellow commissioners declined to discuss or second his motion.
“It’s always good to have a consensus,” said commissioner Martha Rudolph. “Not everybody likes what happens in a consensus, but I personally believe that the perfect should not be the enemy of the good.”

Who is eligible for CARE Court? How do I file a petition? Can this program force someone into treatment? Read on to find out.


Information accurate as of December 2025. Please be aware that CalMatters is not continuously updating this story. 
What is CARE Court?
CARE, which stands for Community Assistance, Recovery and Empowerment, is a court-based way to deliver mental health and substance use treatment to Californians struggling with a severe mental illness. The program launched in a handful of California counties in October 2023, and rolled out in the entire state in December 2024.
Who is CARE Court for?
To be eligible for CARE Court, someone must be diagnosed with a schizophrenia spectrum disorder, or another similar psychotic disorder. They must be 18 years old, and not already receiving adequate mental health care.
Starting on January 1, the program will expand to include people who experience psychotic symptoms as a result of bipolar disorder.
Who can refer someone into CARE Court?
One thing that makes CARE Court unique is that it’s not just doctors who can refer someone into the program – family members, EMTs and others also have that ability. 
A petition for CARE Court can be filed by a person’s immediate family (parents, siblings, grandparents or children) or by their roommate. First responders (law enforcement, firefighters, paramedics, crisis response teams and homeless outreach workers) can also file petitions, as can hospitals and other behavioral health providers. If someone is in a conservatorship, the public guardian can file a petition to move the person down from conservatorship into CARE Court. And the court can refer someone into CARE Court if they have been charged with a misdemeanor.
Someone can also file a petition for themselves, known as a self-petition. 
How do you file a petition?
First, fill out a CARE Court petition, available here. You must also fill out a mental health declaration (available here), or provide evidence that the person was held for intensive treatment at least twice, including once in the past 60 days. 
Next, file the paperwork with the correct division in your county courthouse. In some places, you can do that electronically. Otherwise, make three copies of each form and either bring them to the courthouse in person, or mail them. 
The court will then determine if the petition meets its requirements. If the petition is accepted, whoever filed the petition must appear at the first court hearing, at which point the court will decide if the person can participate in CARE Court.
Then what happens?
If someone is accepted into CARE Court, the court orders the county to work with them on a voluntary “CARE agreement,” which can include mental health and substance abuse treatment, housing, and other services, as needed. The CARE Court participant is represented by counsel during this process – often a public defender. Then, the participant attends regular court hearings for the next year to report on their progress, bring up questions or complaints, or request different or additional services.
If they cannot reach a CARE agreement, the court can order a CARE plan (see below).
After one year, the participant can either graduate from the program or continue for up to one more year.
Can CARE Court force someone into treatment?
No, not really. When Gov. Newsom first proposed the program in 2022, he said it would come with ways to hold participants accountable if they didn’t follow through with their treatment. But coercive treatment is controversial, after the country’s troubled history of locking patients in psychiatric hospitals led to the mass closure of those facilities in the 1950s and 1960s. 
Participants in the program can sign up for a voluntary “CARE agreement,” through which they can get access to housing, mental health care and other services. If they refuse, a judge can impose a court-ordered “CARE plan.” But that’s very rare. So far, judges have ordered CARE plans just 22 times throughout the entire state. Some counties have eschewed CARE plans altogether, preferring instead to make the program entirely voluntary.
Even if a judge does order a CARE plan, the program has no teeth to enforce the order. Clinicians cannot force CARE Court participants to take medication, nor can a participant be punished for refusing medication. If someone fails to complete an ordered CARE plan, the court could put them on a path to conservatorship, according to the state.

(Photo by Michelle Griffith/Minnesota Reformer)A Minnesota safety net program was so easy to scam, it attracted tourists, Assistant U.S. Attorney Joe Thompson said Thursday.
Two Philadelphia men, Anthony Waddell Jefferson, 37, and Lester Brown, 53, heard that Minnesota’s Housing Stabilization Services program was “easy money,” so they traveled to Minnesota, enrolled their companies into the program, returned to Philly and submitted fraudulent claims from there, Thompson said in a news conference announcing charges against the two men and several others. They obtained $3.5 million in Medicaid payments through this “fraud tourism,” Thompson said.
The extent of fraud in Minnesota human services programs — which has become infamous across the country — is even higher than the public knew.
Providers in 14 “high-risk,” state-run Medicaid programs being audited by the state have billed $18 billion since 2018, and “half or more” is possibly fraudulent, Thompson said.
“The fraud is not small. It isn’t isolated. The magnitude cannot be overstated,” Thompson said. “What we see in Minnesota is not a handful of bad actors committing crimes. It’s a staggering, industrial-scale fraud. It’s swamping Minnesota and calling into question everything we know about our state.”
It’s unclear how much of the $18 billion in the 14 Medicaid services comes from state taxpayer dollars; around 36% of all Minnesota Medicaid dollars comes from the state, while the rest is funded by the federal government.
Federal prosecutors also charged three other individuals who allegedly defrauded House Stabilization Services and two individuals for defrauding an autism treatment program called Early Intensive Development and Behavior Intervention. Federal prosecutors have already charged eight people in HSS and one person for defrauding the autism program.
The Department of Human Services in August shut down the Housing Stabilization Services, citing “credible allegations of fraud.”
“I am grateful for the U.S. Attorney’s actions to prosecute criminals attacking and stealing from Minnesota’s programs,” said temporary DHS Commissioner Shireen Gandhi in a statement. “We will continue to support their efforts by sharing any data and information we have that can hold these criminals accountable.”
Thompson said that there’s no indication that fraudsters have sent money to terrorist groups, contrary to a November article saying that Minnesota taxpayer dollars have funded the Somali terrorist group al-Shabaab — a claim that has led to President Donald Trump’s current attacks on Minnesota’s Somali-American community.
Thompson added that money from fraud could have indirectly ended up in the hands of al-Shabaab, which taxes businesses in the areas of Somalia it controls.

New federal investigation into fraud in disability program
Federal agents raided the Bloomington office of another provider, Ultimate Home Health Services, Thursday morning, executing a search warrant that is the first indication of a federal investigation into Integrated Community Supports, another state-run Medicaid program.
Integrated Community Supports started in 2021 and is designed to help disabled adults live more independently in apartments rather than in an institution. The program is vulnerable to fraud and has seen soaring cost increases since it began, paying out $170 million in 2024 compared to $4.6 million in 2021, according to the search warrant filed by the feds.
The ongoing federal investigation found that, instead of providing services, many Integrated Community Supports providers simply rented apartments to Medicaid recipients and billed the program for services they didn’t provide, Thompson said. The program allows providers to bill hundreds of dollars a day, often adding up to $100,000 to $200,000 a year, per client, he said.
Ultimate Home Health Services billed the program $1.1 million between June 2024 and August 2025 for services for multiple individuals it didn’t provide, according to a statement from the U.S. Attorney General’s office and the search warrant.
The search warrant also referenced a KARE 11 report from November about a man found dead in the care of Ultimate Home Health Services in March. Though the provider was billing DHS for 12 hours of one-on-one care for the man, an employee of Ultimate told St. Paul Police that he only checked on him once a day.
Following the report, the Department of Human Services suspended Ultimate Home Health Services’ payments and license in December, citing that the agency found in October that Ultimate Home Health wasn’t adequately providing services and failed to properly report cases of maltreatment and the death of a person.
As of late November, DHS has withheld payments to more than 17 Integrated Community Supports providers suspected of fraud or affiliated with allegedly fraudulent providers, according to a statement at the time from DHS. Amid DHS’s effort to crack down on fraud in the Medicaid program, attorneys for program recipients have criticized the state agency for neglecting its responsibilities toward disabled people who depend on the program for critical services.
The Thursday raid drew the attention of immigrant rights activists, who have been closely tracking Immigration and Customs Enforcement activity. Many responded to the scene of the raid, but the majority dispersed after it became apparent that the activity was not immigration-related.
A handful of observers watched as agents loaded boxes of evidence into vans, leaving behind a broken office door window and damaged door frame.
Democrats’ response
Fraud has roiled Minnesota politics in recent years and it will continue to dominate headlines through the midterm elections. Shortly before Thursday’s press conference, Gov. Tim Walz and House and Senate Democrats criticized the House Fraud Prevention and State Oversight Committee for “playing politics” with fraud.
During a fraud committee hearing Wednesday Rep. Kristin Robbins, R-Maple Grove, alleged that DHS paid state money to a defendant in the Feeding Our Future case through the assisted living program while they were awaiting trial.
Democrats criticized her for presenting her allegations in a public forum rather than going to state investigators.
Walz on Thursday praised the federal charges and said Minnesota doesn’t tolerate fraud.
“This is exactly the type of strong action we need from prosecutors to ensure fraudsters are put behind bars,” Walz said in a statement. “This infuriating greed and criminal activity is why we took action earlier this year to shut down Housing Stabilization Services and hired an outside firm to audit these programs and stop payments to fraudulent providers.”

There’s still more than 10 months until Floridians elect a successor to Ron DeSantis, but there’s no question the Naples Republican is in the pole position after his campaign announced Thursday that he has raised more than $40 million since February.
How impressive is that?
“For perspective, that is 2½ times what then-candidate Ron DeSantis raised and $3 million more than Adam Putnam raised in total in the last open Republican gubernatorial primary in 2018,” writes Ryan Smith, the Donalds’ campaign’s chief strategist, in a memo published Thursday.
Donalds also continues to dominate in most public-opinion polls of the candidates running in the August 2026 Republican primary, despite having yet to air a single television ad.
A survey of 800 Republican primary voters taken Dec. 8-9 by The American Promise showed Donalds with a 27-point lead over Florida Lt. Gov. Jay Collins, 38%-9%. (While Collins is not a declared candidate for governor, a political committee has been running ads for weeks in certain key Florida media markets touting him as such. Pollster Ryan Tyson said in a memo that the survey was taken to determine whether those ads helped Collins at all. It appears they have not).
In addition to being endorsed by Donald Trump, Donalds is backed by Florida U.S. Sen. Rick Scott as well as 17 of the state’s 20 members of Congress and 63 members of the Florida House of Representatives.
The other major Republican candidates are former House Speaker Paul Renner and investment firm CEO James Fishback.

The ruling is the latest setback for the Vermont Attorney General’s Office in its legal actions against the New York-based company. An earlier lawsuit brought by the state was also dismissed.

A Vermont judge has tossed out a lawsuit brought by the state against a New York-based facial recognition software company, alleging violations of consumer protection laws.
Washington County Superior Court Judge Daniel Richardson this week granted Clearview AI’s motion to dismiss the lawsuit, which was brought earlier this year by the Vermont Attorney General’s Office.
“The largely uncontested record here shows that Clearview conducts no substantial business in Vermont and never has,” Richardson wrote the eight-page ruling, throwing out the case on jurisdictional grounds. 
“It does not have any Vermont customers using its database,” Richardson added of Clearview, “and there is no allegation that Clearview’s data-collection activity bears any connection specific to Vermont whatsoever.”
The state’s suit against Clearview alleged the company had violated Vermont’s Consumer Protection Act by collecting photographs from the internet and then storing the unique facial biometric identifiers of Vermonters — including children — in its database, all without the knowledge or consent of Vermonters.The company has drawn the ire of privacy advocates over its practices, leading to other legal actions.
Asked Thursday if she planned to appeal the ruling, Vermont Attorney General Charity Clark said in a statement to VTDigger that her office was considering its options.
“Unfortunately,” Clark said “the ruling focused on the contacts by Clearview to a purchaser of their product, but not the likely hundreds of thousands of Vermonters whose faces make up the product. We aren’t the purchaser; we are the purchased.”
Clark said Vermont lawmakers should look into how to address the issue raised by the state in the lawsuit.  
“This ruling is a call to the Legislature to act to protect Vermonters — the court has told us they cannot help us,” Clark said. “This is a classic example of technology outpacing the law.”
Clearview, in a statement Thursday to VTDigger, praised the judge’s ruling.“Clearview AI does not operate in Vermont, and today’s ruling appropriately recognizes that courts should exercise jurisdiction over companies with which they have a meaningful connection,” the statement read.
According to the lawsuit, while Vermont law provides limits on the use of biometric information by state and local law enforcement, Clearview sells access to other state and federal law enforcement.
The state also alleged that Clearview’s actions were invading the privacy of Vermonters, exposing their personal data to potential theft and fraud by bad actors, and provided no way for Vermonters to opt out. 
The lawsuit sought a declaration that Clearview violated the Vermont Consumer Protection Act, permanent injunctions against most of its business practices related to Vermont, civil penalties, and a requirement that all Vermont consumers’ photographs be deleted from their databases.
In announcing the filing of the lawsuit in April, Clark said in a statement she was “highly disturbed” that Clearview’s actions were taken without the consent of Vermonters, particularly when it came to children. 
“This practice violates Vermont law and is chilling in this moment when the federal government’s overreach in matters like immigration enforcement are impacting our communities here in Vermont,” Clark said at the time.
An earlier lawsuit brought by the state against Clearview in Chittenden County Superior civil court in Burlington was also thrown out by a state judge, who ruled it was not the proper venue for the case.
The refiled case by Clark was brought in Washington County Superior civil court in Montpelier, where the lawsuit stated the venue is proper “because Plaintiff the State of Vermont is deemed to reside in Washington County for purposes of civil actions.”

(Photo by Mitch Perry/Florida Phoenix)Florida Democratic Party Chair Nikki Fried is blasting proposed legislation introduced this week by Florida Chief Financial Officer (CFO) Blaise Ingoglia aimed at increasing local government spending transparency — specifically, a provision that would allow removal of local officials found to have committed “financial abuse.”
The legislation, scheduled to be filed ahead of the coming legislative session in the Florida House by Rep. Monique Miller, R-Palm Bay, and in the Senate by Nick DiCeglie, R-Indian Rocks Beach, would increase local government transparency and formally establish Ingoglia’s Florida Agency for Fiscal Oversight (FAFO) effort into statute.
The proposal includes a provision that would codify the state’s CFO’s ability to recommend removal of any elected official who is found to have committed “financial abuse, malfeasance or misfeasance.”
“I have heard zero from our new CFO about what he plans on doing to hold our property insurance companies accountable,” Fried said on a Zoom conference call on Thursday. “Instead, he’s bullying our local governments, creating fictitious formulas, and now he wants to overreach even more by putting a clause in there about removing elected local officials.”
More than any recent governor, Ron DeSantis has aggressively exercised the power within his office to remove elected officials from office, including school board members, sheriffs, and most controversially, two Democratic state prosecutors, Andrew Warren in Hillsborough County and Monique Worrell in Orange and Osceola counties.
Worrell rebounded from her 2023 suspension, winning re-election by a large margin in 2024.
“We see how Ron DeSantis has abused that power throughout his eight years in this administration, and so that is just them bullying our local governments that are the ones who are closest to the people,” Fried added.
In addition to those above listed suspensions, Attorney General James Uthmeier threatened other local governments officials in Florida earlier this year in Orange County and Key West when they raised objections to signing 287(g) agreements with Immigration and Customs Enforcement.
In the case of Orange County, Mayor Jerry Demings said in August that he signed an updated agreement with ICE under “protest and extreme duress” after Uthmeier threatened the mayor and all six county commissioners that their failure to do so would result in their removal from office by Gov. Ron DeSantis.
Other provisions in the legislation introduced by Ingoglia at a press conference in Tampa on Wednesday include allowing the Department of Financial Services to pursue financial penalties from local governments if they don’t respond to inquiries “promptly,” including by withholding any state funds until they do so.
“If we ask for the information on a Monday, and we’re giving you five days to compile the information — get it in five days; if you don’t, then you face a $1,000 a day penalty,” he said at the press conference.
The legislation comes as Ingoglia continues to make the case that local governments have been engaged in “excessive and wasteful spending” by comparing their fiscal year 2024-2025 budgets with what they were spending in 2019-2020. So far, after reviewing the budgets of 11 local governments this year, he says they have engaged collectively in $1.86 billion in alleged wasteful and excessive spending.
Local government officials who have received those FAFO audits have questioned the accuracy of the methodology used by the CFO’s auditors. Ingoglia has called such criticisms “bogus” and “not well thought out.”
Fried argued that if Ingoglia were serious about cutting excessive government spending, he should look inside the DeSantis administration’s own spending excesses. She referred to a Tampa Bay Times/Miami Herald story published last week reporting that the DeSantis administration spent $36.2 million in taxpayer funds last year to purchase ads against the proposed marijuana and abortion ballot measures, both of which were contested by the governor.
“If [Ingoglia] wants to talk about saving dollars and making sure that the people are getting a return to the taxes they have put into this state, he should be focused on what’s happening in Tallahassee,” she said. “Ron DeSantis stole $38 million from the people of this state, and so that’s really where the attacks should be. That’s where his energy should be.”",https://floridaphoenix.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/0-10-1024x771.jpeg,,,2025-12-18 16:58:34.200973

Brandon Steele, an attorney by trade who represented the Beckley area in the state House of Delegates and who often gave impassioned speeches during legislative proceedings, resigned from his elected position on Thursday.
He submitted his resignation through a letter sent to the House Clerk before 9 a.m. on Thursday, according to House Communications Director Ann Ali. In the letter, he said the resignation was effective immediately.
Steele, a Republican, told Lootpress — an online publication he founded in 2020 and continues to own — that his resignation was necessary due to “professional opportunities” arising that would “interfere” with his work in the House.
He said he was “honored” to serve his constituents and will “always cherish the time” he spent in the body.
Steele has served in the House since 2018 and previously served as chair of the House Committee on Government Organization. 
His resignation this week comes nearly a year after he was involved in a domestic disturbance where, according to a police report, his wife called 911 due to Steele drunkenly handling assault rifles and screaming at people in their neighborhood on Dec. 23, 2024. 
In 911 calls, Brianne Steele told police that Brandon Steele was “extremely agitated and very, very drunk” and that their three children, who were home at the time of the incident, were “terrified.” No arrests were made.
On Jan. 7, 2025 Brandon Steele was selected to serve as chairman on the House Judiciary Committee. That same day, a copy of the police report and recordings of the 911 calls from the disturbance were sent to members of the media and House leadership. The next day, Brandon Steele skipped his swearing in ceremony and on Jan. 17, he was removed as chairman of House Judiciary after a private conversation with House Speaker Roger Hanshaw.
Brandon Steele told West Virginia Watch in January that the “rumors” being spread surrounding the domestic disturbance were “vicious and disheartening.” He denied any wrongdoing.
In August, according to The Real WV, Brianne Steele — who works as the Raleigh County Circuit Clerk — filed an emergency protective order against Brandon Steele. That protective order mandated that Brandon Steele not be within 100 yards of Brianne Steele or her residence. 
Brandon Steele was reelected to his House seat in 2024, meaning a year remains in his term. Following his resignation, the Raleigh County Republican Executive Committee will submit three candidates to Gov. Patrick Morrisey to serve the remainder of the term. Morrisey will then appoint one of those candidates to the seat. 
The 2026 regular legislative session is scheduled to start on Jan. 14, 2026.

,DC,2025-12-18 21:03:50+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,Trump health agency proposes rules to limit gender-affirming care for youth,Shauneen Miranda,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-health-agency-proposes-rules-limit-gender-affirming-care-youth,,"WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump’s administration took major steps Thursday in a campaign to block minors’ access to gender-affirming care nationwide. Under two proposed new rules from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, hospitals would be barred from providing gender transition treatment for children as a condition of participating in Medicare and Medicaid programs, and Medicaid funding would be prohibited from being used to fund such care for minors. As most hospitals receive Medicare and Medicaid funding, the rules would essentially have the effect of a nationwide ban if they are finalized. The announcement came a day after the U.S. House passed a bill that would impose federal criminal penalties for gender-affirming care for minors and hours before it advanced a separate measure that would prohibit Medicaid funding for gender transition treatment for minors. The proposed regulations, which will next undergo a period of public comments, are certain to draw legal challenges.The efforts build on Trump’s executive order in January that restricted access to gender-affirming care for kids. More than half of states already have laws or policies aimed at limiting youth access to gender-affirming care, according to the nonpartisan health research organization KFF. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and CMS Administrator Dr. Mehmet Oz announced the proposals alongside several other health officials at a press conference at HHS headquarters in Washington, D.C. The room featured a handful of GOP members of Congress. At least two Republican state attorneys general — Ken Paxton of Texas and Todd Rokita of Indiana — were also in attendance.At the press conference, Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Dr. Marty Makary said the FDA is also sending “warning letters” to 12 breast binder manufacturers and sellers for “illegal marketing of breast binders for children for the purposes of treating gender dysphoria.” Breast binders are used to flatten tissue in the chest.  Kennedy said his agency’s Office for Civil Rights is moving to “reverse the Biden administration’s attempt to include gender dysphoria within the definition of disability.” House passes anti-transgender bills The proposed rules are part of the Trump administration’s broader anti-trans agenda. Trump has signed executive orders that make it the “policy of the United States to recognize two sexes, male and female,” aimed to bar openly transgender service members from the U.S. military, and sought to prohibit trans athletes from competing on women’s sports teams consistent with their gender identity.Meanwhile, efforts at the congressional level to restrict youth access to gender-affirming care face a dismal path in the Senate, where any legislation would likely need the backing of at least 60 senators to advance past the filibuster.The House passed a measure Wednesday night, 216-211, that would subject medical professionals to up to 10 years in prison for providing gender-affirming care for minors. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, who sponsored the legislation, called its passage a “win for children all over America,” in a social media post Wednesday. It’s likely the last legislative achievement for the Georgia Republican, who is resigning from Congress in early January. Four Republicans voted against the measure: Reps. Gabe Evans of Colorado, Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania, Mike Kennedy of Utah and Mike Lawler of New York.Three Democrats voted with the GOP to back the bill: Reps. Henry Cuellar and Vicente Gonzalez of Texas and Don Davis of North Carolina.The House also passed a measure Thursday, 215-201, from Texas GOP Rep. Dan Crenshaw and Greene that aims to prohibit “Medicaid funding for gender transition procedures for minors.” Cuellar, Gonzalez and Davis also backed the GOP-led bill, along with fellow Democratic Rep. Marie Gluesenkamp Perez of Washington state. ‘Cruel and unconstitutional attacks’ Kelley Robinson, president of the Human Rights Campaign, an LGBTQ+ advocacy group, blasted the administration’s proposals, saying they “would put Donald Trump and RFK Jr. in those doctor’s offices, ripping health care decisions from the hands of families and putting it in the grips of the anti-LGBTQ+ fringe.”  Robinson also emphasized that the rules are “proposals, not binding law,” and called on community members, health care providers, administrators and allies to “be vocal in pushing back by sharing the ways these proposals would be devastating to their families and the healthcare community at large.” The American Civil Liberties Union also condemned the administration’s proposals and vowed to challenge the efforts in court. Chase Strangio, co-director of the ACLU’s LGBTQ & HIV Rights Project, dubbed the proposals “cruel and unconstitutional attacks on the rights of transgender youth and their families.” Strangio said the proposals would “force doctors to choose between their ethical obligations to their patients and the threat of losing federal funding” and “uproot families who have already fled state-level bans, leaving them with nowhere to turn for the care they need to survive and thrive.”",,,,2025-12-18 16:58:34.200973

(Photo courtesy of Washington Department of Ecology)The Trump administration has ordered Washington’s last coal-fired power station to continue burning coal, just weeks before it was scheduled to shut down and convert to natural gas fuel.
This has sparked yet another clash between the federal government and Washington state, where leaders are aiming to get coal power out of the electricity grid by year-end. Officials here aren’t ruling out the possibility of a lawsuit over the move.
Tuesday evening’s emergency order by the U.S. Department of Energy would keep TransAlta’s coal unit going in Centralia for 90 more days. The order comes amid Washington’s broader shift to use cleaner energy, such as solar and wind power, while reducing power from fossil fuels.
U.S. Secretary of Energy Chris Wright wrote in the order that, “the emergency conditions resulting from increasing demand and accelerated retirement of generation facilities will continue in the near term and are also likely to continue in subsequent years.”
The Canada-based TransAlta and then-Gov. Christine Gregoire’s administration negotiated the Centralia plant’s end-of-year shutdown schedule more than a dozen years ago. The Washington state Legislature passed that negotiated agreement into state law.
This week’s federal order throws a wrench in that plan and raises questions about what exactly will happen in the near future at the plant.
A statement by TransAlta said the company is evaluating the directive and will work with the state and federal governments.
“The coal-to-gas conversion project, announced on December 9, 2025, remains a priority for TransAlta,” the company added.
In an interview Wednesday, a senior state House Democrat who helped craft Washington’s clean-energy laws had choice words about the federal order. 
“I thought it was so transparently stupid that I hoped they’d have thought better of it,” said House Majority Leader Joe Fitzgibbon, D-West Seattle.
Washington’s Clean Energy Transformation Act, passed by the Legislature in 2019, requires utilities to stop providing coal power to Washington customers by the end of this year. 
Fitzgibbon, who helped craft Washington’s clean-energy laws, said he doubted utilities in Oregon and California would want to buy coal power from Centralia. He called Canadian-owned TransAlta the “obvious loser” under the federal order.
“They don’t have coal there, they’re using up their coal by the end of the year,” Fitzgibbon said. “So are they going to have to buy new coal and bring it in and store it in Centralia? They don’t have employees ready to run this plant.”
Fitzgibbon also raised the specter that the plant would have to burn coal that doesn’t even generate power just to satisfy the federal order.
“It’s completely unclear and I think those will be some of the issues that it will take a court to figure out,” he added.
‘No emergency here’
The office of Washington Attorney General Nick Brown is “still discussing our legal options in response to this action,” spokesperson Mike Faulk wrote in an email. 
In a joint statement Wednesday, Brown, along with Gov. Bob Ferguson and State Ecology Director Casey Sixkiller, blasted the federal order, saying: “Let’s be clear: there’s no emergency here.”
“The administration does not care about energy affordability and reliability for consumers,” the officials wrote in prepared remarks. “In fact, electricity prices have gone up nationwide over the first year of this administration. Instead of helping states diversify their energy economy, the administration wants to keep a dirty, dying energy source on life support.”
Ferguson and Brown are both Democrats and have sparred repeatedly with Republican President Donald Trump.
This week’s order in Washington comes after a similar Trump administration order in the spring to keep a coal plant burning in Michigan, according to news reports. That 90-day order was extended in August and again in November. 
In July, Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel filed a petition with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit to challenge the federal order, calling it “arbitrary and illegal.”
That legal challenge is still pending, a spokesperson for Nessel’s office said Thursday.
Environmental groups in Washington reacted swiftly to the TransAlta order. In a statement, Lauren McCloy of the NW Energy Coalition described the move as “federal overreach” and “incredibly unproductive.”
The NW Energy Coalition is a group of roughly 100 business, government, civic and environmental organizations working to advance affordable, equitable and clean energy policies.
“The closure of this plant has been planned for over a decade, and keeping it running beyond its useful and economic life is not the answer,” said McCloy in prepared remarks. “This order takes resources and focus away from addressing the real challenges we have.”
Feds point to utilities’ analysis
In his emergency federal order, Wright cited the same analysis used by Puget Sound Energy to justify TransAlta’s proposed conversion to burn natural gas.
That analysis, commissioned by Puget Sound Energy, Tacoma Power, Avista, Seattle City Light, and others, argues that Washington could get hit with an electricity crisis.
Released in September, the report contended that the move toward wind and solar has prompted the retirement of fossil fuels faster than they are being replaced by clean energy.
A spokesperson for Puget Sound Energy said the utility is reviewing the federal order.
On Thursday, state Senate Minority Leader John Braun, R-Centralia, said he thought the Trump administration had valid concerns about a power crisis.
But, “logistically, can you get more coal? Who would buy it? Those are questions nobody has the answer to,” said Braun, whose district includes the plant.
Braun said he didn’t think the federal order would derail the transition to natural gas.
“I don’t think it helps,” Braun said. “I don’t think it hurts, either.”",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/transalta-coal-plant-e1765321297646-1024x699.jpg,,,2025-12-18 16:58:34.200973

(Henry Redman | Wisconsin Examiner)A Wisconsin Senate committee held a public hearing Thursday on a bipartisan bill that would require the state Department of Natural Resources to notify county and tribal governments when local groundwater is found to exceed state standards. 
Throughout the hearing, the bill’s authors and residents of communities with water quality problems complained of incidents in which significant amounts of time passed before people learned their water was contaminated with harmful chemicals such as nitrates or PFAS. 
“Time really counts, hours, days, weeks, and in our case, even years,” said Lee Donahue, a resident of the town of Campbell on French Island near La Crosse, which has been dealing with PFAS contamination for years. “It’s been heart wrenching to know that my family and my friends and my neighbors have all been impacted by these toxic chemicals. I don’t wish anyone to have contamination in their water. And the sad part is we had no clue that PFAS was pouring from our faucets and that we were drinking that water for years and years and years before any notification was made.”
Initially authored by Rep. Jill Billings (D-La Crosse) and Sen. Jesse James (R-Thorp), more than 60 legislators of both parties have signed onto the bill as co-sponsors, signaling the legislation has enough support to be signed into law during a legislative session in which efforts to find compromise on environmental issues — including efforts to extend the Knowles-Nelson stewardship grant program and to create a method to spend $125 million that has been set aside for more than two years to remediate PFAS contamination — have been stuck in the partisan muck. 
Under the bill, if the DNR finds an exceedance of the state’s groundwater standards the department will have seven days to notify the local county or tribal health department as well as the county land and conservation department. 
For several years, Wisconsin policymakers have been unable to establish a state standard for the acceptable amount of PFAS in the state’s groundwater, hitting roadblocks at the state Natural Resources Board and in the Republican-controlled Legislature. The state does have established standards for the amount of PFAS in the state’s surface water and the drinking water provided by municipal water utilities. 
As the Legislature has tried and failed to pass a bill that would spend the $125 million in the PFAS trust fund, residents of communities affected by PFAS contamination have frequently said the policy change they’d most like to see is the establishment of a groundwater standard. 
The contaminant notification bill does not establish a groundwater standard for PFAS, however it requires the DNR to notify the county government if the groundwater is found to have PFAS levels higher than the existing state standards for PFAS in surface or drinking water. 
About one-third of Wisconsin residents get their water from private drinking wells. While the bill does not establish a groundwater standard and does not provide any assistance if the groundwater they use to shower, brush their teeth, make coffee or mix baby formula is contaminated, proponents said it does make sure residents have the information they need to make decisions about the source of their water. 
“If people have a right to clean water, then they have a right to know when their water is not clean,” said Michael Tiboris, the agriculture and water policy director at the River Alliance of Wisconsin. “And this bill is exactly the kind of action that we appreciate having legislators take a strong position on, giving families knowledge of the threats to their drinking water makes it possible for them to protect themselves.” 
None of the people or groups that testified at the hearing Thursday were in opposition to the bill, but a few industry groups expressed a handful of complaints and said they’d like to see amendments to the bill’s final version. 
The concerns of business groups centered around making sure that any notifications were made after test results have been verified and making sure that the notifications don’t instigate regulatory action from the government that it doesn’t have the authority to undertake. 
“It’s just not appropriate for the government to take any kind of action,” said Adam Jordahl, director of environmental and energy policy at Wisconsin Manufacturers and Commerce. “I know it’s not a direct regulatory action where we’re expecting an individual or business to do something or comply with something, but nevertheless, the issue of sort of holding people accountable to a regulatory PFAS standard that has not yet actually been promulgated into the administrative code. We find that to be very problematic and kind of a slippery slope going down in terms of holding people accountable or responsible to something that hasn’t gone through the full rulemaking process.”
Scott Suder, the president of the Wisconsin Paper Council, said he’s concerned that prematurely telling people their water is contaminated could create “reputational risks” for nearby businesses. 
“It creates unnecessary legal and reputational risk for industry, potentially because the notice is subject to public inspection and copying under [Wisconsin open records law],” Suder said. “All exceedance notifications would become public records, creating significant disclosure and some reputational risks, so even minor errors or omissions could trigger liabilities, and the visibility of exceedances may lead to public misunderstanding about actual risks. So it is a bit concerning for industry as well.”

(Photo illustration via Getty Images; logo courtesy of the Iowa Department of Inspections, Appeals and Licensing) A Cass County chiropractor who was criminally convicted of assaulting a patient has had his license reinstated by the Iowa Board of Chiropractic.
State records indicate chiropractor Chad Faaborg was arrested in June 2022 and charged with third-degree sexual abuse. Police alleged that on June 16, 2022, a female patient reported she had an appointment with Faaborg at his practice, Simply Chiropractic in Anita.
According to police, the woman reported that during her appointment, Faaborg “went under her clothing, fondled her, and performed a sex act on her without her permission.”

At the time the charges were imposed, Faaborg agreed to a license suspension that resulted in his refraining from practicing while his court case was pending.
After 14 continuances in the case were ordered by the court, Cass County prosecutors changed the charged offense to simple misdemeanor assault in the form of insulting or offensive conduct.
On Sept. 13, 2024, Cass County District Court Judge Eric Nelson found Faaborg guilty of the offense, ruling that Faaborg had touched the alleged victim “in an area of her body without permission,” and that “he intended his touch to be offensive or insulting to her.” Nelson fined Faaborg $350.
Although no plea agreement or amended trial information was filed with the clerk of court in the case, Nelson’s sentencing order stated that “the parties inform the court that upon conviction, the defendant has agreed to make a donation to Catholic Charities in the amount of $750.”
Faaborg said Thursday he was “falsely accused” of sexual assault by the patient, and that the reduced charge was negotiated by his attorney and Cass County Attorney Vanessa Strazdas. It was Strazdas, he said, who proposed that the agreed-upon charitable donation be routed to Catholic Charities.
“That was all part of our negotiation with the county attorney,” he said.
The Iowa Board of Chiropractic recently agreed to reactivate Faaborg’s license, subject to two years of monitoring. During that time, Faaborg will be required to have a female chaperone present for all examinations and consultations with female patients.

CT is using surplus funds to help people next year, but will Congress act? What to know,","COVID-era financial assistance for ObamaCare health plans, known as enhanced premium tax credits, are all but guaranteed to lapse at the end of the year, with Congress set to leave town this week without addressing them. 
After a failed vote last week to extend the subsidies for three years, Gov. Ned Lamont announced that Connecticut will foot the bill to maintain financial assistance for some Connecticut residents. However, there are residents who are set to lose some or all aid.
Here’s what to know about who could be impacted, Connecticut’s plans and the chances of the subsidies getting extended.
Who is going to be impacted? 
About 90% of Access Health CT enrollees — or 143,000 Connecticut residents — receive some sort of subsidy to help defray the cost of premiums. With the subsidies expiring, those residents were set to lose some or all of the financial assistance they receive. 
Access Health CT is the official state health insurance marketplace created to meet the requirements of the Affordable Care Act. 
The lapse would mean individual enrollees could see their premiums rise by an average of $2,380 per year for an individual and $10,000 annually for a family of four. Connecticut would have to spend $295 million per year to maintain the current level of financial assistance provided by the expiring federal subsidies.
What is Connecticut going to do?
Last week, Lamont pledged $70 million in state funding to keep premiums stable for the most financially vulnerable families set to get hit by the expiring tax credits, but hinted that more help might be on the way. On Wednesday, the governor increased the investment to nearly $115 million through June 2027. 
The plan includes $64.1 million to maintain CoveredCT through June 2027, according to a letter the governor penned to legislators informing them of the expenditures. CoveredCT currently uses federal subsidies to provide no-cost plans to low-income families that earn slightly too much to qualify for Medicaid. 
Another roughly $50.8 million will go toward replacing the subsidies entirely for Connecticut residents who aren’t in CoveredCT, but earn between 100% and 200% of the Federal Poverty Level. It will also cover half of the current financial assistance for people earning between 400% and 500% of FPL, who are set to lose all financial assistance once the federal subsidies expire. 
However, unlike the CoveredCT funding, the $50.8 million only covers subsidies through the end of 2026.
In addition to the $115 million in direct subsidy support to CT residents, the state will pay community health centers $5 million through June 2027 “to help promote access to primary and preventive care for those individuals with incomes below 100% of the FPL at risk of losing coverage due to elimination of all federal health plan subsidies,” according to the governor’s letter.
Anyone who already signed up for a plan and qualifies for state assistance will have their premiums adjusted, according to Access Health CEO James Michel. 
Due to recent outage issues with Access Health CT’s website, the agency has extended the enrollment deadline for plans beginning in the new year to Dec. 20, Michel confirmed.  
The funding for subsidy replacement will come from $500 million in state reserves designated during last month’s special session, which was intended to potentially backfill federal cuts to nutrition, health care, heating assistance and other human service programs until the next General Assembly session starts Feb. 4. 
What’s going on with Congress right now?
The imminent expiration set off a last-minute scramble on Capitol Hill to see if the House would take it up. Democrats’ three-year extension failed to get through the Senate last week. 
House Republicans ultimately put a bill on the floor that would implement various health care reforms but didn’t include any extension of the subsidies. The bill passed along party lines on Wednesday, but is likely to get blocked when it reaches the Republican-controlled Senate. 
Republicans have opposed the Affordable Care Act since its passage in 2010, but they have struggled to unify around a replacement plan. Most Republicans view the tax credits as a costly measure that was supposed to be temporary when it was created in a pandemic relief bill. 
House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., has been resistant to putting a subsidies extension on the floor. That rankled a bloc of moderate Republicans, who came up short in their push for a vote after tense negotiations with Johnson. 
“Many of them did want to vote on this Obamacare, COVID-era subsidy the Democrats created. We looked for a way to try to allow for that pressure release valve and it just was not to be,” Johnson said Tuesday. 
The only other avenue available is through a procedural tool called a discharge petition. If lawmakers can collect 218 signatures, it forces a vote on the House floor. 
There are two bipartisan petitions that extend the subsidies, but for a shorter timeframe than sought by Democrats and with changes to eligibility. U.S. Rep. Joe Courtney, D-2nd District, is the only member of Connecticut’s delegation to sign onto both. But the two measures are short of the needed signatures. 
Is there any chance the subsidies will get extended?
Democrats’ petition for a three-year extension was signed by everyone in their party, meaning they only needed four Republicans to join. On Wednesday, they secured the necessary signatures from the Republicans to force a vote to renew the tax credits. 
This leaves at least one avenue through which the subsidies could get extended in January. But the motion won’t get a vote until the new year based on House rules. And if it reaches the Senate, a three-year extension is expected to get blocked again.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/AHCT-storefront1-spanish-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-12-18 15:57:34.524879

Free.,"Trump signs order to loosen federal restrictions on marijuana, but it’s still illegal",Jacob Fischler,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-signs-order-loosen-federal-restrictions-marijuana-its-still-illegal,,"President Donald Trump signed an executive order Thursday to loosen federal restrictions on marijuana, which Trump said reflected the drug’s potential medical benefits while discouraging recreational use.The order moves cannabis from Schedule I to Schedule III on the Federal Drug Administration’s list of controlled substances. Schedule I, the most restrictive category under federal law, indicates a high likelihood of abuse and no accepted medical value. Trump said the move reflected that cannabis could have medicinal value, even if abuse was still possible.The order “doesn't legalize marijuana in any way, shape or form and in no way sanctions its use as a recreational drug,” Trump said. “Just as the prescription painkillers may have legitimate uses, but can also do irreversible damage … it's never safe to use powerful controlled substances in recreational matters.”Still, the order marks a major step in the decades-long liberalization of cannabis policy. Since 2012, when Washington and Colorado voters legalized personal marijuana use, 22 other states have legalized at least some form of recreational use. Only 10 states still restrict both medicinal and recreational use.President Joe Biden started the process for rescheduling the drug last year.Medical angleA group of administration officials and medical doctors flanked Trump during the Oval Office signing, with some speaking to the potential medical benefits of marijuana, including as an alternative to highly addictive opioid painkillers.“The facts compel the federal government to recognize that marijuana can be legitimate in terms of medical applications when carefully administered,” Trump said.Researching the potential benefits of marijuana is nearly impossible because of the tight restrictions on Schedule I substances, advocates have argued.Removing cannabis from Schedule I would help ease those restrictions, Trump said. “This reclassification order will make it far easier to conduct marijuana-related medical research, allowing us to study benefits, potential dangers and future treatments,” he said. “It's going to have a tremendously positive impact.”In addition to researchers, the split between federal law and the legal landscape in many states has created challenges for the industry, users and law enforcement, among others.For example, the unusual position of state-legal businesses in a federally banned industry means they cannot use certain tax provisions, access some banking instruments or transport their product across state lines.In a lengthy statement, Paul Armentano, the deputy director of leading marijuana legalization organization National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws, offered qualified praise for the move, saying it “validates the experience” of patients who have used marijuana to treat chronic pain and other conditions. “This directive certainly marks a long overdue change in direction,” Armentano said. “But while such a move potentially provides some benefits to patients, and veterans especially, it still falls well short of the changes necessary to bring federal marijuana policy into the 21st century. Specifically, rescheduling fails to harmonize federal marijuana policy with the cannabis laws of most states.”The reclassification could provide tax relief to many marijuana businesses, he added.GOP senators opposed moveMany Republicans in Congress remain opposed to legalizing marijuana.In a letter dated Wednesday, 24 Senate Republicans urged Trump not to reclassify marijuana, which they said had a high likelihood of abuse and no medical value.Allowing marijuana businesses to take advantage of federal tax deductions would give them a tax break of as much as $2.3 billion, allowing them to increase marketing efforts and expand into additional states, the lawmakers wrote. The benefits of economic growth would be outweighed by the costs of accidents, “not to mention the moral costs of marijuana advertising that could reach kids,” they wrote.“In light of the documented dangers of marijuana, facilitating the growth of the marijuana industry is at odds with growing our economy and encouraging healthy lifestyles for Americans,” the GOP senators wrote. “We urge you to continue your strong leadership of our country and our economy, and to turn away from marijuana rescheduling.”North Carolina’s Tedd Budd led the letter, which was also signed by John Barrasso and Cynthia Lummis of Wyoming, Tom Cotton of Arkansas, Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia, James Lankford of Oklahoma, Roger Marshall of Kansas, Pete Ricketts of Nebraska, Tommy Tuberville of Alabama, John Cornyn of Texas, Marsha Blackburn and Bill Hagerty of Tennessee, Jim Banks of Indiana, Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, Mike Crapo and Jim Risch of Idaho, Rick Scott of Florida, Kevin Cramer of North Dakota, Cindy Hyde-Smith of Mississippi, Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, Dave McCormick of Pennsylvania and Mitch McConnell of Kentucky.",,,,2025-12-18 15:57:34.524879

Kennedy Jr. after Kennedy's confirmation hearing on Jan. 30, 2025. (Photo by Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images)A concerning trend is emerging this year: access to safe, effective vaccines is being challenged as vaccine skeptics assume positions of authority. Their growing influence in health leadership places them in roles where they can shape policy at the highest levels of government, with far-reaching consequences for families across the country.
With Robert F. Kennedy Jr. appointed as secretary of Health and Human Services, and former Louisiana Surgeon General Ralph Abraham named as the deputy director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, individuals who have questioned vaccines now hold significant influence over national health policy. This shift in leadership is likely to shape public health in Louisiana and across the country.
We are already seeing the impacts of growing vaccine misinformation. Louisiana is facing its worst whooping cough outbreak in 35 years, with reports of delayed action by the Louisiana Department of Health hindering an effective public health response. Meanwhile, The United States is experiencing its largest measles outbreak in two decades — nearly 2,000 reported cases and the tragic deaths of at least two children. These illnesses could be prevented with more widespread vaccination coverage.
U.S. Sen. Bill Cassidy, a physician who spent decades treating patients and recommending vaccines, understands the importance of evidence-based prevention. As the chair of the Senate Health Committee, he has the authority — and responsibility — to exercise congressional oversight of the CDC’s Advisory Council on Immunization Practices and Secretary Kennedy, bringing transparency to the sweeping changes that threaten vaccine access. Cassidy has spoken out against vaccine rollbacks without scientific evidence. However, we need him to do more.
Recently, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices voted to end its recommendation for the hepatitis B birth dose and Acting CDC Director Jim O’Neill endorsed the change. This decision increases health risks for our children and create dangerous confusion for parents and providers.
The birth dose of the hepatitis B vaccine:

reduced acute hepatitis B infections in children under 19 by 99%
prevented an estimated 500,000 childhood infections
prevented over 90,000 hepatitis B-related childhood deaths

The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices has historically been nonpartisan, grounding its recommendations in the best scientific evidence, rather than ideology. The most recent vote and the subsequent policy changes, however, depart from scientific evidence and weakens long-standing protections for infants and children.
These changes do not make America healthier. They create barriers for parents, who want nothing more than to keep their children safe and healthy. Parents consistently support common-sense policies guided by decades of rigorous research, and children deserve to attend school in places where they don’t risk death from a preventable illness.
This is not about politics. This is about parents’ ability to protect their children from preventable illnesses and death.Louisianans know too well the consequences when those in power fail to make clear recommendations based on the best science. We cannot afford to keep making the same mistakes.
Parents deserve the information and tools necessary to make the best decision for their families. We deserve clear, consistent guidance based on evidence. Louisiana deserves better.",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/gettyimages-2196806242-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-18 15:57:34.524879

Less than a week after an unprecedented atmospheric river brought catastrophic floodwaters to northwest Montana, continued extreme weather including high winds on Wednesday have slowed some recovery efforts and knocked out power to residents. 
“Libby, I mean, they’ve got, boy, you know, every single issue that weather could throw at them,” Trent Parker, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service told the Daily Montanan on Thursday. 
Flooding in Lincoln County last week compromised at least nine bridges, leading to 40-mile detours for some residents of Libby and Troy and increasing the risk of rock and landslides throughout the northwest. 
Gov. Greg Gianforte issued an executive order declaring a flooding disaster in northwestern Montana, allowing general fund money to be spent on disaster relief efforts. 
Nick Holloway, public information officer for the Western Montana Type 3 All Hazard Incident Management team that took command of the flood incident on Monday, said the state emergency declaration has helped open up resources and that state disaster personnel are on the ground working in tandem with the incident management team.
The Flathead Electric Co-op outage map on Dec. 18, 2025, showing more than 2,500 continued outages across Lincoln County.
“We’re here helping people — life safety is our primary focus, and incident stabilization is our secondary focus,” Holloway said. 
However, additional extreme weather this week, this time in the form of high winds across the state, have stressed recovery efforts. Statewide, more than 60,000 customers lost power, according to Northwestern Energy and Flathead Electric Coop, due to downed trees and powerlines. 
According to the FEC outage map, more than 3,000 customers in the Libby area and along Montana Highway 2 remain without power after more than 24 hours, even as crews have worked to restore power to thousands more customers throughout the region.  
“Normally with power outages in a county or jurisdiction, mutual aid could come in and help,” Holloway said. “That’s not helping here, because it’s a region-wide event. There’s no additional resources.”
On Tuesday, Gianforte and the state’s federal delegation also requested a presidential disaster declaration from President Donald Trump, and requested assistance from the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or FEMA. 
Holloway said there has been no update from the federal government yet, but if it comes through it would open up additional, needed resources. 
A spokesperson for the governor did not respond to a question about the federal ask on Thursday. 
With the wind event following extreme rain and flooding, the ground throughout Lincoln County is saturated with water, which Holloway said is slowing the repair process.
“It’s hard to get poles to stand straight in this kind of weather,” he said. “And we expect more trees to come down that were weakened during the worst of the wind but didn’t fall. They don’t need as heavy of a wind to come down now.”
The National Weather Service has issued a wind advisory for the Kootenai/Cabinet region from 11 p.m. Thursday through 8 a.m. Friday.
Emergency personnel urge all residents of the area to be careful parking cars near trees and going anywhere on foot, in case of further gusts that knock down trees. Residents are advised to stay at least 35 feet away from downed power lines and treat any power line as live. 
Holloway also said residents can haul debris to the Lincoln County landfill on Pope Creek, but no debris should be piled on roadways or streets. 
The Lincoln County Sheriff’s Office has issued an evacuation or stay-in-place order for residents on the west side and south end of Bull Lake due to debris accumulation against the Ross Creeks Cedars Bridge, which is closed to traffic.
Emergency mitigation work is currently underway on the bridge. 
The latest emergency information can be found at the Lincoln County flood information website.
 Health concerns 

Along with infrastructure damage, last week’s flooding has impacted Libby’s municipal water source, which comes from the Lower Flower Creek Diversion Structure. 
The Department of Natural Resources and Conservation has been coordinating inspection of the structure and done work to stabilize damaged areas on Dec. 14 and 15. 
The city has been under a boil water order since flooding began. The Red Cross has established an emergency shelter at the Memorial Center, 111 E. Lincoln Boulevard in Libby, and bottled water is available to residents who need it. 
There are two potential concerns with the drinking water, Holloway said, including whether organic or inorganic compounds are present. 
Organic compounds can be addressed through the boil order, but the presence of inorganics, including heavy metals, would make the water nonpottable. 
The Montana Department of Environmental Quality has been monitoring the situation and conducting testing. 
Water samples from the city were hand delivered to a testing laboratory in Kalispell on Monday and Tuesday. Results are expected by the end of the day on Thursday or Friday morning at the earliest, according to Holloway. 
Libby’s public water permit requires testing for heavy metals every nine years. Holloway said the city has met all state and federal safety standards in its previous two tests. 
Another public health risk being monitored is whether there have been any impacts to the Libby Asbestos Superfund site, Holloway said, and according to DEQ, there is a chance that some mine waste and vermiculite may have been exposed by the flooding.

Here's what to know about how to stay warm and help others.","As temperatures continue to drop across Connecticut, Bridgeport officials are warning residents to prepare for dangerously cold conditions and to look out for one another — especially people without stable housing.
Periods of extreme cold trigger a coordinated cold weather response involving city agencies, emergency management officials, shelters and outreach teams. The goal is to reduce the risk of cold-related injuries and deaths while connecting residents to warming spaces, shelter and support.
One of the key things to know is that extremely low temperatures and wind chills can cause frostbite and hypothermia within minutes, especially for those outdoors. The city urges residents to take precautions at home, check on vulnerable neighbors, and use available warming centers and shelter resources. 
People who see someone in need can call 211 to alert outreach teams. But there is more that can be done.
Here’s a look at how Bridgeport’s cold weather response works, where people can go to stay warm and how residents can help during periods of extreme cold.
What is Bridgeport’s cold weather response?
Bridgeport’s cold weather response is activated during periods of dangerously low temperatures and wind chills. 
During these periods, the city increases outreach to people experiencing homelessness, sharing information about shelter availability and transportation options. Outreach teams work to connect people to shelters such as Prospect House, the Bridgeport Rescue Mission, and Alpha Community Services.
Residents who see someone sleeping outside or in distress due to the cold are encouraged to call 211. Those calls help outreach workers locate people who may need immediate assistance. People can also go directly to the South End Community Center at 650 Park Ave., which serves as a central access point for support and case worker assistance.
Where can people go to stay warm during the day or overnight?
Bridgeport has several locations that can serve as warming spaces during cold weather, though hours and availability vary.
Overnight support and case managementThe South End Community Center is open 24 hours a day, seven days a week. The center offers limited overnight capacity and access to case worker support for people experiencing homelessness.
Senior centers (open weekdays only)

Black Rock Senior Center, 2676 Fairfield Ave., 9 a.m. to 3 p.m.
East Side Senior Center, 268 Putnam St., 9 a.m. to 3 p.m.
Eisenhower Senior Center, 307 Golden Hill St., 9 a.m. to 3 p.m.

Transportation hub

Greater Bridgeport Transit (GBT) Station, 710 Water St., Monday through Friday, 9 a.m. to 9 p.m.

Public librariesBridgeport Public Library branches also serve as indoor warming spaces during open hours:

Main Branch, 925 Broad St. (downtown)
Black Rock Branch, 2705 Fairfield Ave.
Newfield Branch, 755 Central Ave.
North Branch, 3455 Madison Ave.
Beardsley Branch, 2536 East Main St.

Hours vary by location and day, and libraries are closed on Sundays. The East Side Branch is temporarily closed for renovations.
What should residents do to stay safe during extreme cold?
City officials are urging residents to take precautions both inside and outside the home.
At home, residents should make sure heating devices are working properly and should never use a stove or oven to heat a living space, as doing so can create serious fire and carbon monoxide risks. Anyone using a generator should follow manufacturer instructions and never operate it indoors.
Residents are also advised to bring pets inside, watch for ice on pipes and walkways, and bundle up if going outdoors. Prolonged exposure to cold temperatures can be dangerous even for people who are otherwise healthy.
On the roads, drivers should allow extra travel time and be cautious during morning commutes, when icy conditions are more likely. The city also warns residents not to drive through flooded areas beneath viaducts or underpasses, which can be hard to see in winter weather.
Officials are also asking people to check in on elderly neighbors, family members, and others who may be more vulnerable to cold-related health risks.
How can residents help people experiencing homelessness during cold weather?
One of the most immediate ways to help is by calling 211 if you see someone who appears to be sleeping outside or struggling in the cold. Those calls go directly to outreach teams who can attempt to connect individuals with shelter and services.
Residents can also share information about warming centers and shelters with people who may not know where to go. Simply letting someone know that places like the South End Community Center are open around the clock can make a difference during extreme cold.
For people experiencing homelessness themselves, showing up at 650 Park Ave. can be a starting point for getting connected to shelter options, outreach workers and longer-term support.
What if residents lose power during the cold?
Cold weather can also strain utility systems. Residents who experience a loss of electricity should contact United Illuminating’s customer hotline at 800-722-5584, which operates 24 hours a day for emergency service.

(Photo by Jon Cherry/Getty Images)The U.S. Department of Justice has sent a confidential draft agreement to more than a dozen states that would require election officials to remove any alleged ineligible voters identified during a federal review of their voter rolls.
The agreement — called a memorandum of understanding, or MOU — would hand the federal government a major role in election administration, a responsibility that belongs to the states under the U.S. Constitution.
A Justice Department official identified 11 states that have expressed an interest in the agreement during a federal court hearing in December, according to a transcript reviewed by Stateline. Two additional states, Colorado and Wisconsin, have publicly rejected the memorandum of understanding and released copies of the proposal.
Trump wants states to feed voter info into powerful citizenship data program

The 11 states “all fall into the list of, they have expressed with us a willingness to comply based on the represented MOU that we have sent them,” Eric Neff, the acting chief of the Justice Department’s Voting Section, said at the hearing. He spoke at a Dec. 4 hearing in a federal lawsuit brought by the Justice Department against California, which has refused a demand for the state’s voter data.
Neff’s courtroom disclosure, which Stateline is the first to report, comes as the Justice Department has sued 18 states for unredacted copies of their voter rolls after demanding the data from most states in recent months. The unredacted lists include sensitive personal information, such as driver’s license and partial Social Security numbers.
The states Neff identified are led by Republicans — Alabama, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, South Carolina, South Dakota, Texas, Tennessee, Utah and Virginia.
The draft memorandum of understanding represents a new effort by the Trump administration to gain access to some states’ voter data without litigation.
The administration’s lawsuits mostly target Democratic states, where election officials refused initial requests for voter data and allege the demand is unlawful and risks the privacy of millions of voters. They have also voiced fears that the Trump administration could use the information to target its political enemies.
Neff said four states with Republican secretaries of state — Arkansas, Indiana, Kansas and Wyoming — have “complied voluntarily” with the Justice Department’s demand without memoranda of understanding.










What the DOJ is trying to do is something that should frighten everybody across the political spectrum.


– David Becker, executive director of the Center for Election Innovation & Research


The Justice Department says it needs voters’ detailed information to ensure ineligible people are kept off state voter rolls and that only citizens are voting.
Federal officials say they will follow federal privacy laws, but critics fear voter data is being shared with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, which operates a powerful citizenship verification tool known as SAVE. The Trump administration has previously confirmed the Justice Department plans to share voter data with Homeland Security.
“What the DOJ is trying to do is something that should frighten everybody across the political spectrum,” said David Becker, executive director of the nonpartisan Center for Election Innovation & Research. “They’re trying to use the power of the executive branch to bully states into turning over highly sensitive data: date of birth, Social Security number, driver’s license — the holy trinity of identity theft.”
Becker, who worked as a senior trial attorney in the Justice Department’s Voting Section during the Clinton and George W. Bush administrations, told reporters on Dec. 8 that several states received the memorandum. But Neff’s identification of 11 states wasn’t widely available until the judge in the California lawsuit on Tuesday ordered the transcript of the Dec. 4 hearing immediately posted to the lawsuit’s public docket, where Stateline accessed it.

The draft memorandum of understanding, which is labeled “confidential,” outlines the terms of the proposed agreement between each state and the Justice Department. After a state provides its voter roll, the federal department would agree to test, analyze and assess the information. The department would then notify states of “any voter list maintenance issues, insufficiencies, inadequacies, deficiencies, anomalies, or concerns” found.
Each state would agree to “clean” its voter roll within 45 days by removing any ineligible voters, according to the memorandum. States would then resubmit their voter data to the Justice Department for verification.
While the Justice Department has demanded states’ voter rolls since this summer, the memorandum of understanding offers the most detailed picture to date of how the Trump administration plans to use the data.
“It lays out in a way that we haven’t seen in any other context their plan for one of the things, I will say, that they plan to do, which is disturbing,” said Eileen O’Connor, a senior counsel and manager in the voting rights and election program at the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University, a progressive think tank.
O’Connor was a trial attorney in the Justice Department’s Voting Section during the Obama, first Trump and Biden administrations. “I think with each passing lawsuit, they are clearly trying to create a national database of every voter in the country,” she said.
The Justice Department didn’t answer questions from Stateline about how many states had been sent the memorandum and whether any had signed it.
Assistant U.S. Attorney General Harmeet Dhillon, who leads the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division, wrote in a statement to Stateline that the department has a statutory mandate to enforce federal voting rights laws. Ensuring the voting public’s confidence in election integrity is a top priority of the Trump administration, she wrote.
“Clean voter rolls and basic election safeguards are requisites for free, fair, and transparent elections,” Dhillon wrote.
Federal involvement in elections
The Justice Department memorandum, if implemented, would mark a significant departure from how election officials typically maintain voter rolls.
States, often in coordination with local election officials, check lists for changes in address, deaths and other reasons for ineligibility, such as a felony conviction. States typically perform this task with little to no federal involvement.
Some states participate in voluntary programs that allow election officials to share voter information with other states for the purposes of looking for voters who may have moved or who are registered in multiple locations. But those don’t include the federal government, which plays a limited role in election administration under the United States’ decentralized approach to elections.
Matt Crane, executive director of the Colorado County Clerks Association, said clerks continually look at death records and other sources of data to update voter lists. He said the United States’ localized election system is a strength that guards against election interference.
“The federal government has no role in list maintenance,” Crane said.
DOJ is sharing state voter roll lists with Homeland Security

But that has begun to change under the Trump administration, as President Donald Trump has made removing noncitizen voters a priority.
Earlier this year, Homeland Security overhauled the SAVE program into a tool that can scan millions of voter records against government databases for evidence of citizenship. The program was previously used for one-off searches to check whether noncitizens were eligible for government benefits.
Some Republican secretaries of state have agreed to upload their voter rolls into SAVE. Democratic secretaries of state object to using the program and say they are wary of what will happen to the voter information once it’s provided to the Trump administration, including its potential use by the Department of Homeland Security.
While SAVE can flag voters with potential eligibility issues, the onus now is still on state officials to investigate whether those voters are actually ineligible and decide whether to initiate a process to remove them from the rolls.
By contrast, the Justice Department memorandum would empower federal officials to take a more active role, allowing them to check the work of state election officials as they remove — or don’t remove — voters.
“We have a system that allows Americans to voice their opinions and to hold government accountable, and that is so fundamentally central to the way our system works,” Oregon Democratic Secretary of State Tobias Read, who has been sued by the Justice Department, said in an interview. “We should be focused on how to make that better, not on erecting artificial barriers and putting people’s privacy and confidence at risk for no reason.”
Republican interest
Some GOP election officials have welcomed the Trump administration’s interest and have accused the Biden administration of not doing enough to help states vet their voter rolls. In particular, they praise the overhaul of SAVE, which some GOP secretaries of state had requested before Trump took office.
Some secretaries have touted the removal of noncitizen voters after using SAVE. Wyoming Secretary of State Chuck Gray, a Republican, in November announced three voters identified as noncitizens had been removed from his state’s voter rolls. Gray has also provided the Justice Department with full access to Wyoming’s voter roll.
“The voter list maintenance that we have been conducting is extremely important for election integrity,” Gray said in a news release.
4 Republican states will help Homeland Security obtain driver’s license records

But as of early December, nearly all states hadn’t provided the Justice Department access to their unredacted voter rolls, with Neff identifying only four that had shared their lists. It also remains unclear whether any state has signed the memorandum of understanding. No state has told Stateline it signed the document.
Nebraska Secretary of State Robert Evnen, a Republican, has received a memorandum of understanding and plans to comply with the Justice Department request, pending the outcome of an ongoing lawsuit, Evnen spokesperson Rani Taborek-Potter wrote in an email to Stateline. A voting advocacy group has sued to block the release of the data.
In an interview with Kentucky Lantern, Kentucky Republican Secretary of State Michael Adams said that his office was “going back and forth a little bit” with the Justice Department over what federal law requires.
“We’ve not really figured out exactly where that line is of what-all they’re entitled to,” Adams said. “What’s not in dispute is they’re entitled to the vast majority of information — people’s names, addresses, birthdays — and we’ve given them all of that.”
Adams added that many state officials “are in the same boat of trying to figure out what exactly they need to do their job and what our obligations are legally.”
Utah Lt. Gov. Deidre Henderson, a Republican, confirmed in a statement to Stateline that her office received a proposed memorandum of understanding from the Justice Department. “We are in the process of reviewing the document with our attorneys and carefully considering our options,” Henderson wrote.
Rachael Dunn, a spokesperson for Missouri Republican Secretary of State Denny Hoskins, wrote in an email that the state hadn’t entered into an agreement with the Justice Department “at this time.”
DOJ ‘contractor’ could get voter data
The draft agreement would give the Justice Department wide authority to share the voter data of states that sign on.
The department would be authorized to share the data with “a contractor” who needs access “to perform duties related” to voter list maintenance verification, according to the draft agreement. The agreement doesn’t name any contractors or specify whether they would be inside or outside of government.
Two states have publicly rejected the draft agreement. Colorado Democratic Secretary of State Jena Griswold announced Dec. 11 she would refuse to sign the memorandum. The Justice Department sued Colorado the following day.
The Wisconsin Elections Commission also rejected the draft agreement that week. In a Dec. 11 letter to Neff, the Justice Department official, the commissioners wrote that state law prohibits them from releasing certain personally identifiable information, such as date of birth, Social Security numbers and driver’s license numbers.
“I don’t look at the action that we’re taking today to be commentary on the motive of the appropriateness of the Department of Justice’s request,” Commissioner Don Millis, a Republican appointee, said at a virtual commission meeting the same day. “The U.S. DOJ is simply asking the commission to do something that the commission is explicitly forbidden by Wisconsin law to do.”
The Justice Department so far hasn’t sued Wisconsin for its voter data.
Justin Levitt, who served as senior policy adviser for democracy and voting rights in the Biden White House and is now a law professor at Loyola Marymount University, told Stateline in an email that he expects no states to sign the agreement.
“It’s no surprise that both Colorado and Wisconsin said no — and I don’t think that’s a question of political leadership,” Levitt wrote. “It’s hard for me to imagine any Republican state with faith in its own list maintenance capacity agreeing to outsource that decision to the DOJ.”

(Photo by Joshua Haiar/South Dakota Searchlight)SIOUX FALLS — South Dakota’s State Economist Derek Johnson told the state Banking Commission on Wednesday that a sluggish farm economy, driven by lower soybean, corn and wheat prices, has been a major factor holding down recent state sales tax collections. 
Johnson, with the Bureau of Finance and Management, said sales tax collections tied to farm equipment fell more than 20% in fiscal year 2025 compared with the prior year. He said collections on farm equipment have continued to slide in the current 2026 fiscal year, down year-to-date by about 16%.
Johnson framed the impact of falling crop prices as outsized for an agriculture-dependent state. 
“We know that in an ag-state like South Dakota, it bleeds into so many parts of the economy,” he said. 
Johnson shared the news two weeks after Gov. Larry Rhoden said in his budget address that overall sales tax revenue declined in fiscal year 2025 for only the third time in 30 years, by 0.6%. Sales tax revenues for fiscal year 2026, which ends June 30, are up over 4% so far. 
Johnson said the most recent month’s tax collections on farm equipment were higher than the same month a year earlier. That’s the first year-over-year improvement in roughly two years.

(Photo by Florida Phoenix)The Florida Supreme Court on Thursday upheld the death sentence of a twice-condemned man, dismissing his constitutional concerns over a state law that allows just eight jurors to recommend death — the lowest threshold in the nation.
The state’s highest court in a 65-page opinion affirmed Michael James Jackson’s death sentence, which he’d received twice in 16 years for burying alive an elderly couple in 2005.
Although Jackson was one of 40 death row inmates resentenced when the state high court briefly found non-unanimous death recommendations unconstitutional, he remains the only one to be condemned again after lawmakers reversed course in 2023.
“In his initial brief, Jackson raises six issues (with some sub-issues) targeting the 2023 [law or its] application,” the opinion signed by six of the seven justices reads. “Each one fails.”
Jackson’s case falls amid a larger conversation in Florida spearheaded by Gov. Ron DeSantis and GOP lawmakers on expanding the death penalty. In 2025 alone, 19 inmates as of Thursday night will have been executed, shattering the state’s 1984 record of eight executions in one year.
Similarly, in the past few years, Florida has stretched the death penalty to include child rapists and human traffickers of children. It’s also allowed for fewer jurors to recommend death and increased potential execution methods.
Jurors death recommendations in Florida
The case centers on the state’s decades-long flip-flopping on how many jurors are needed to recommend the death penalty. For years, Florida allowed a simple 7-to-5 majority. Jackson, for example, was sentenced to death in 2007 on an 8-to-4 recommendation.
But in 2016, the state Supreme Court declared that unanimity was required for death recommendations, mirroring federal law and every other state except for Alabama (and now Florida). This led to the resentencing of dozens of death row inmates who’d been condemned by less-than-unanimous juries.
Jackson was on that list. So were Alan Wade and Tiffany Cole, his co-conspirators, although they both on resentencing drew life sentences instead of death.
Just four years later, in 2020, the state Supreme Court decided that the Florida Constitution does not require a unanimous recommendation of death. This prompted lawmakers in 2023 to lower the threshold for death recommendation from a unanimous jury to the 8-to-4 majority.
Florida is the only state to allow fewer than 10 jurors to recommend death. The only other state that doesn’t require a unanimous jury verdict is Alabama, with 10 jurors.
So, when Jackson had his resentencing trial delayed until just weeks after that 2023 law took effect, eight jurors recommended execution. And just like 16 years earlier, Jackson was sentenced to death by an 8-4 majority.
What did Jackson argue?
Jackson, now 43, argued a number of points, ranging from alleged improprieties during his initial trial to claiming that the 2023 law was unconstitutional, racist, indecent, and couldn’t apply to him.
Briefly, he also claimed that the law was improperly targeted at him. He pointed to legislative debate in which lawmakers acknowledged that only one pending capital case would be affected by the change, which was Jackson’s, and argued that this showed the statute was crafted to ensure it would apply at his resentencing.
Six justices rejected all of his claims, largely by pointing out that a non-unanimous jury is constitutional under the 2020 Florida Supreme Court case.
They also disagreed that Jackson’s resentencing order from 2017 prevented him from receiving the burden of a later statute, writing, “The 2017 order did no more than confirm that, under the decisional law at the time, Jackson was entitled to resentencing.”
Justice Jorge LaBarga, the sole moderate justice, concurred in a separate four-page opinion, writing that he wanted to respect precedent but emphasizing his opposition to the 2023 law.
“I write to underscore that the 8-4 threshold renders Florida the absolute outlier among states that impose the death penalty. Florida now has the lowest standard in the nation, requiring the fewest number of jurors to recommend the death penalty,” he wrote.
What happened in 2005?
In 2005, 61-year-olds Carol and Reggie Sumner allowed Jackson and Tiffany Cole to stay with them at their Jacksonville home, according to the case record. While there, Jackson noticed they were “frail and would be easy victims,” and he “informed [Alan] Wade of the Sumners’ financial position, which included $90,000 from the sale of their South Carolina home,” the opinion says.
They hatched a scheme, bringing in 18-year-old Bruce Nixon to help.
Days before the murders, Jackson, Wade, and Nixon dug “a six-foot-deep hole in a remote area of Georgia.” Then, on the evening of July 8, 2005, Wade and Nixon held the Sumners at “gunpoint” using a “toy gun” and bound them with duct tape.
Jackson then entered the home “and began searching for bank statements” and ATM cards. Wade and Nixon later “ordered the victims to climb into the trunk of the Sumners’ Lincoln Town Car.”
With the Sumners trapped, they drove to the Georgia gravesite, where the elderly couple was placed in the hole and buried alive.
Jackson later used their ATM card “several times,” and impersonated Reggie in phone calls with the bank and the Jacksonville Sheriff’s Office.
The four were arrested in South Carolina. Nixon, who testified that Jackson was in charge and who led authorities to the gravesite, was the only one not sentenced to death in 2007. Instead, he received a 45-year prison sentence.

(Photo by Christopher Shea/Rhode Island Current)Six days after the mass shooting at Brown University, questions hang heavy over a city gripped by grief and unease.
Who is responsible for the “unthinkable” act of violence that killed two students and wounded nine more people in the campus engineering building on Saturday afternoon? What motivated them? Where are they now?
Some answers will come when local, state and federal law enforcement make good on their pledge to find, arrest and convict the shooter. But other information that could help bring resolution and comfort to a grieving community will never be shared publicly, including the emergency phone calls made to first responders in the wake of the shooting.
Rhode Island is among a growing number of states that restrict release of 911 recordings or transcripts without consent of the caller or a judge’s order. The state law, passed in 1996 after a local journalist aired a 911 call in which the wife of a state prosecutor claimed her husband had beaten her, aims to protect people’s privacy during moments of extreme stress, trauma and vulnerability. 
But it also obscures key insight into the events behind emergencies — both personal and public —and how well first responders meet the calls for help.
Since the shooting on the East Side of Providence Saturday afternoon, public officials have repeatedly assured the public in daily press conferences that the response by Brown University and Providence police to the shooting was swift and vigorous. But without call records, transcripts, and, in the case of Brown University’s Department of Public Safety, access to any arrest reports or other written records of officer activities, there’s no proof.
“Over the coming days, months, weeks, years, there’s going to be a lot of scrutiny on how Brown and other police departments responded,” said John Marion, executive director for Common Cause Rhode Island.  “We’re not going to have a very good window into some of that information.”
It’s a problem that Marion, and other open government advocates with the ACCESS/RI have sought to remedy for years through legislation that would update the state’s open records law. Among the 48 changes proposed to the Access to Public Records Act in the 2025 legislative session, and prior years: making 911 calls public in response to records requests, providing there is “good cause shown.” The legislation also sought to compel private university police to make arrest records public.
The legislation has failed to advance in either chamber of the Rhode Island General Assembly, buried by objections from Gov. Dan McKee’s office and his department heads. 
Sen. Lou DiPalma, a Middletown Democrat and the bill’s leading sponsor for the last two years, said Wednesday that he intends to revive it, with no major changes, during the upcoming legislative session.

A call for change 
Could the tragedy still unfolding across Providence spur a change of heart toward public records reform this year?
Steven Brown, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Rhode Island, thinks it should.
“The terrible incident at Brown only amplifies the importance of these two parts of the proposed changes to the public records law,” Brown said in an interview Wednesday, referring to making 911 calls public as well as university police arrest records.
University police were first to respond to calls Saturday of a shooter in the Barus and Holley engineering building, with Providence police following suit soon after, Col. Oscar Perez, Providence Police chief, said during a press conference on Wednesday afternoon. Perez, and other state and federal investigators, have declined to share many details about their ongoing search for the shooter, including a potential relationship to the university, or any of the victims. 
If there were any calls reporting suspicious activity in the residential neighborhood embedded within the Ivy League campus, those will never have to be shared publicly.  Any previous arrests or run-ins between Brown campus police and the shooter can stay closeted too.
And, if Brown police end up finding and arresting the suspect, that report also doesn’t have to be released.
“It’s difficult to fathom,” Brown said. “We’re not talking about gaining access to confidential investigatory efforts. These are basic records.”










Over the coming days, months, weeks, years, there’s going to be a lot of scrutiny on how Brown and other police departments responded. We’re not going to have a very good window into some of that information.

McKee’s office did not respond to multiple inquiries for comment, nor did the Rhode Island State Police, which was among the dozen government agencies with written objections to the omnibus reform bill during the 2025 session.
A university spokesperson also did not respond to requests for comment.
Both the university and state police have objected to closing loopholes in the state public records laws, citing privacy concerns of officers and the public.
Brown noted that the provisions around 911 calls and transcripts still offer some privacy protections, exempting the audio and documents from being released to anyone except those involved or related to the people on the call, unless there is “good cause shown” — like a mass shooting at a university, for example.
The Rhode Island Attorney General’s office, which is playing an active role in the investigation of the shooting, has not waded into the debate over public records reform in recent years. 
But, in January, the AG’s office upheld Brown University’s right to keep its arrest records private in response to a dispute between the university and two local journalists. The eight-page opinion by Paul Meosky, special assistant attorney general, said the private police department is not subject to public records law because it is not a government body or public agency.

Unique power 
The Ivy League public safety officers differ from their counterparts at other higher education institutions across the state because they also have the power to seize, detain and arrest people. 
The ACLU sued the university on behalf of the two journalists denied access to university police arrests in June, citing the unique powers of the university’s public safety officers. The complaint remains pending in Providence County Superior Court, with a hearing on Brown’s motion to toss the complaint scheduled for March 2026, according to the public court docket.
“The wheels of justice move slowly,” Brown lamented regarding the ACLU’s court case.
So too, does the legislative process. Rhode Island’s public records law was last revised in 2012. 
Many of the proposed changes are meant to recognize the modern world, incorporating new data sources like police body-worn camera footage, text messages and traffic accident data into the law. 
Advocates have been reluctant to let go of any of the dozens of changes encompassed in the legislation, noting that attempts at compromise have failed to yield results. 
House Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi suggested that a slimmed-down, targeted set of public records act revisions might be the way to go.
“I am all about it, I support the general concept of it,” Shekarchi said in an interview on Wednesday. “Like any issue, the devil is in the details.”
Shekarchi continued, “There is a bill to be passed here. It’s about bringing people together.”
Shekarchi declined to discuss other potential legislative responses to the shooting. He said it was not the right time.

(Aaron Sanderford/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — A Nebraska state official responsible for overseeing state data security and privacy allegedly submitted duplicate travel reimbursement claims on two occasions for his own financial benefit, according to a new report from the state auditor.
Auditor Mike Foley this week made public his office’s review of reimbursements sought by the state’s “chief information security and privacy officer,” a man whose state employment has since ended.

Identified as Patrick Wright, he worked under the Department of Administrative Services’ Office of the Chief Information Officer. The state information office said it alerted Foley’s office and the Nebraska Attorney General’s Office in December, when it found alleged improprieties.
The Auditor’s Office issued a 24-page report, largely copies of reimbursement forms, and recommendations for improvement to Wright’s supervisors, who said Wright at first was placed on administrative leave and then resigned during the investigation.
Contacted by the Nebraska Examiner, Wright and his lawyer said they were reviewing the auditor’s report and would make a statement at a later date. 
Foley said his team did not reach out to Wright for comment or explanation, given that the Attorney General’s Office already was involved. The AG’s Office did not immediately respond for comment. 
The auditing team noted that Wright was employed by the state from July 2020 through this February, and was paid about $120,000 when he left.
Foley called the situation concerning. 
“That these allegations of financial impropriety are leveled at someone to whom the state’s data security and privacy was entrusted should give everyone pause,” Foley said. 
 ‘Misunderstanding’ 

According to the auditor’s report, Wright during his tenure and on two separate occasions submitted reimbursement requests to both the state and third-party organizations for the same expenses, using “identical documentation.”
Wright allegedly received about $500 of undue duplicative payments, Foley said. Those were related to an August 2024 work-related trip to Milwaukee. 
Foley said the overall amount of alleged undue reimbursements might have been higher, but that it appears Wright sought to rectify a double payment situation a few months later related to a Washington D.C. trip, after officials questioned “suspicious” reimbursement requests. 
Wright in January returned a $2,266 check to a third-party organization, explaining in an accompanying letter that there was a “misunderstanding” and the check related to the D.C. trip should be issued to the State of Nebraska rather than to him personally. The letter was included in the auditor’s report.
“In addition to giving rise to concerns regarding possible theft, forgery and even abuse of public records, the putative double-dealing by the former Security and Privacy Officer could implicate him in having violated Nebraska law forbidding use of public office or resources for unauthorized personal gain,” Foley said in a news release.
He said the auditing team’s findings were turned over to the Attorney General’s Office, the Nebraska State Patrol, the Nebraska Accountability and Disclosure Commission and the Lancaster County Attorney’s Office for review.
While employed by the state, Wright also served on the executive committee of the Center for Internet Security’s Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center. The auditor’s report notes that he currently directs Cyber Strong Nebraska, a nonprofit dedicated to enhancing cybersecurity awareness, education and resources within the state. 
 Recoup funds

Foley said the state information office, directed by Chief Information Officer Matthew McCarville under Administrative Services, cooperated and pledged to take safeguards against similar situations.
The information office’s response included in the auditor’s letter said the agency would try to recoup any funds determined to have been improperly paid and said it would cooperate with any further investigations. 
McCarville, in a statement to the Examiner, said his office is dedicated to being a good steward of taxpayer dollars and that prevention of fraud and misuse of public funds remains a top priority. 
He  said the review led the information office to amend internal policies and to enhance procedures for approving travel expense reimbursement forms.
“Our agency acted quickly to ensure that proper and immediate reporting occurred to the State Auditor and the Attorney General’s Office when this situation came to light,” said McCarville.

The Trump administration said Thursday that hospitals participating in Medicaid and Medicare would be prohibited from administering gender-affirming care to minors, among other proposed rule changes.

Theo Wells-Spackman is a Report for America corps member who reports for VTDigger.
Hospitals participating in Medicaid and Medicare would be prohibited from administering gender-affirming care to minors under one of several new proposed rules, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, said Thursday.
The announcement appears to clash with Vermont’s 2023 “shield laws”, which offer protections to providers and recipients of gender-affirming care, and establish that treatment as an essential part of full insurance coverage. 
In a press conference Thursday morning, Kennedy said his department’s move was grounded in an executive order signed by President Donald Trump earlier this year. One new rule will seek to cut off Medicaid funds for “sex-rejecting” practices including hormone therapy and surgical procedures, among other treatments, while another proposes to withhold both Medicaid and Medicare money entirely from hospitals that provide those services.

“This is not medicine — it is malpractice,” Kennedy said of such care. “These procedures fail to meet professionally-recognized standards.”
Many of the country’s leading professional medical associations — including the American Medical Association and the American Academy of Pediatrics — are supportive of gender affirming care for minors.
The University of Vermont Medical Center’s Transgender Youth Program is the primary place in Vermont for young people to access gender-affirming care.
“We want our patients to know that as of today, there is no change in how we provide care,” a spokesperson for the hospital network said by email on Thursday. “We remain committed to ensuring the availability of evidence-based gender-affirming care … Research consistently shows that this care improves health and well-being, and decisions should remain between patients and their providers.”
Vermont Health Commissioner Rick Hildebrant stressed the state’s commitment to providing gender-affirming care Thursday.
“Access to gender affirming care is the law in Vermont,” Hildebrant said in an emailed statement. “We will continue to support providers and work to preserve access to care for vulnerable Vermont communities, regardless of any potential federal changes.”
All of Vermont’s hospitals accept Medicaid patients. Indeed, each of the state’s hospitals relied on Medicare and Medicaid for more than two-thirds of inpatient care payments in 2022, according to an analysis by the American Hospital Association. 
Mehmet Oz, who heads the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, said the proposed rules would likely remain open for comment and deliberation for several months before they are finalized.
Advocates in Vermont expressed concern over Thursday’s developments.
“Vermont’s responsibility to provide access to affordable health care for all kids does not change based on federal Medicare and Medicaid rules,” said Monica Allard, a staff attorney at ACLU of Vermont, in a statement Thursday. 
“With these proposed rules, the Trump administration is trying to threaten health care access for everyone unless providers abandon trans youth,” Allard continued. “That’s not governance — it’s extortion.”
Kennedy said he expects legal pushback to the new rules.
“The number of lawsuits with my name on it right now is almost beyond counting,” he said, adding that he was confident of eventual success in such litigation.
This story will be updated.

Kennedy Center to be renamed the Trump-Kennedy Center, White House says",Ariana Figueroa,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/john-f-kennedy-center-be-renamed-trump-kennedy-center-white-house-says,,"WASHINGTON — The John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, a prestigious cultural hub in the nation’s capital, will be renamed the Trump-Kennedy Center, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt announced Thursday.The renaming comes after President Donald Trump named himself chair of the board in February in a major shake-up. He later fired the Kennedy Center president as well as board members appointed by President Joe Biden before appointing his own members.Leavitt said the board unanimously approved the name change. However, a federal statute appears to prohibit the renaming of portions of the center, which is considered a living memorial to Kennedy.“After December 2, 1983, no additional memorials or plaques in the nature of memorials shall be designated or installed in the public areas of the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts,” according to the U.S. code. Congress likely would need to change the law for the center to be renamed officially. The Kennedy Center was renamed in 1964 to honor President John F. Kennedy, who was assassinated.Leavitt said the renaming was “because of the unbelievable work President Trump has done over the last year in saving the building. Not only from the standpoint of its reconstruction, but also financially, and its reputation.”“Congratulations to President Donald J. Trump, and likewise, congratulations to President Kennedy, because this will be a truly great team long into the future!,” she wrote.Since the president’s takeover of the center, major artists and performers have canceled performances or boycotted performing. The artist Issa Rae, and the musical “Hamilton” will no longer perform at the center and dozens of cast members of “Les Misérables” refused to perform for Trump officials earlier this year.",,,,2025-12-18 14:58:33.678499

A House GOP proposal could take that nearly statewide. (Stock photo by Motortion/Getty Images)Twenty South Carolina sheriff’s departments have standing agreements to aid federal immigration officials. A House GOP proposal could take that to all but one of the state’s 46 counties.
A bill filed ahead of the legislative session that begins in January would require all law enforcement agencies that operate a jail to sign agreements with U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement under its 287(g) program — named for the section of a 1996 law that authorized it.
“Many are already doing this,” Rep. Travis Moore, the bill’s lead sponsor, told the SC Daily Gazette. “We’re just making it equal across the board.”
The Roebuck attorney was joined by 47 other state House Republicans who signed on to the proposal.
Participation in ICE agreements has skyrocketed both in South Carolina and nationwide under the Trump administration.
In addition to the 20 South Carolina counties, seven town police departments and two state agencies also have signed agreements with ICE. None of the towns with existing agreements have jails, so the proposed new requirement would not apply to them.


If the bill were to pass, four more city police departments — Anderson, Greer, Myrtle Beach and Rock Hill — would have to sign agreements because they operate their own jails, along with 25 other counties.
The Richland County Sheriff’s Department would be exempt because the county, not the department, runs the Alvin S. Glenn Detention Center.
Police and sheriff’s departments that do fall under the requirement would have to submit proof annually to the South Carolina Law Enforcement Division and the state attorney general’s office showing they had signed agreements or had attempted to enter into one.
Those that fail to do so could be subject to state oversight or even suspension. The state’s Law Enforcement Training Council has the authority to temporarily suspend the certification of every officer working for a department, functionally blocking the department’s operations.
The law also mandates immigration-specific SLED training for all police and sheriff’s departments with a signed ICE agreement.
“It’s a public safety thing for me,” Moore said.
As a member of South Carolina’s National Guard, Moore has worked security at the southern border. In that time, he was part of teams that stopped large groups of people being transported into the country illegally via rail cars and trucks. Encounters such as these have him concerned about the trafficking of both humans and drugs, especially fentanyl.
“I don’t think people appreciate how serious it is,” Moore said of the deadly drug.
Moore stressed the purpose of the proposed bill was to aid ICE in detaining people who had committed crimes while they were in the United States illegally.
“These are people who have been arrested for committing crimes,” he said. “This isn’t a go out and find people thing. These are people processed into the jail.”
Sheriffs and police chiefs can choose any of three types of ICE agreements to meet the bill’s requirements.
The first type of agreement trains officers to serve warrants on undocumented immigrants already in jail for something else — called the “warrant service officer” model. The second, the “jail enforcement model,” lets local agencies identify people in their jail subject to deportation, according to the program website.
However, officers operating under the third, so-called “task force model,” recently reinstated by the Trump Administration, can challenge a person’s immigration status during their normal police duties, whether that person is arrested for another crime or not.
The two state agencies participating, SLED and the Department of Public Safety, which operates the state Highway Patrol, have opted into this agreement. As have 13 of South Carolina’s local law enforcement departments.
During the first 11 months of the year, only two sheriff’s departments, Horry and York, reported using the agreement, according to monthly updates compiled by ICE. Both have jail enforcement agreements signed in 2020. The two departments detained people from Honduras, Mexico, Guatemala, Jamaica, the United Kingdom and El Salvador.
Those arrested stood accused of crimes including breaking into cars, petty theft, domestic violence, assault, drugs and weapons possession, sexual conduct with minors who ranged from age 8 to age 15, one person with a prior charge of distributing fentanyl and a drunken driving incident where a pedestrian was struck and killed.
Some SC officials want to give bonuses for law enforcement officers helping ICE

Most had entered the country illegally. But one person had overstayed a temporary work visa and another was a lawful permanent resident, according to the reports.
The counties and cities that have agreed to help out the federal government with immigration enforcement previously took on these extra responsibilities with no promise of funding for operating expenses or overtime pay for officers. And many jails in the state already face overcrowding and staffing shortages.
The proposed legislation does not call for any state money to help with costs.
But, the massive tax policy and spending bill that President Donald Trump signed into law July 4 included funding to reimburse law enforcement agencies for salaries and benefits of officers hired to carry out the agreements going forward. It also funded quarterly bonuses to agencies based on the number of immigrants they find who don’t have permission to be in the country.
Republican U.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham, chairman of the U.S. Senate Budget Committee, has said he wants to take that a step further, creating a national fund of $1 billion, which participating states, counties and cities could use to give officers bonuses. The amount of funding would depend on the type of 287(g) agreement the agencies entered into, he previously told the SC Daily Gazette.

At GiggyBites Bakery for Dogs in Chadds Ford, Pennsylvania, National Bake Cookies Day and the weeks leading up to the holidays are among the busiest times of the year. Owner Stephanie Rossino says the season brings a steady stream of dog lovers eager to treat their pets to something special.
“The holidays are always bustling here,” Rossino said. “People really enjoy buying special treats for their dogs, especially this time of year.”
GiggyBites is known for its oven-baked, all-natural dog treats, and during the holiday season, the bakery leans into festive favorites. Iced cookies decorated for the holidays are among the top sellers, with colorful designs that feel just as celebratory as the cookies lining human dessert tables.
For many customers, stopping by GiggyBites has become part of their own holiday routine. Pet parents browse displays of seasonal treats, ask about ingredients, and often pick up something extra “just because.” The experience mirrors the joy of visiting a traditional bakery, with the added delight of knowing the treats are made specifically with dogs in mind.
Beyond cookies, GiggyBites takes holiday indulgence a step further by offering full holiday meals for dogs. These seasonal dinners include a savory hot chicken pot pie with vegetables baked inside a biscuit, along with a seasonal muffin and a holiday cookie. The holiday meal package is priced at $18, and customers can reserve meals online before picking them up in store. GiggyBites
National Bake Cookies Day itself has grown into a lighthearted celebration of one of America’s favorite baked treats. Over time, it has evolved to reflect changing traditions and tastes, including the growing role pets play in family celebrations. At places like GiggyBites, that evolution is on full display.
The popularity of pet-focused holidays reflects a broader shift in how families celebrate. Dogs are no longer an afterthought during special occasions, but active participants in traditions large and small. From birthday cakes to holiday dinners, pet-centered offerings continue to grow as owners look for meaningful ways to include their animals in everyday moments.
Rossino founded GiggyBites with the goal of creating healthier, thoughtfully made treats for dogs, and the bakery has since become a destination for pet parents across the region. In addition to holiday goodies, GiggyBites offers dog birthday cakes, freeze-dried snacks, premium food brands, and curated gifts, making it a popular stop throughout the year.
For dog owners, National Bake Cookies Day is another reminder that celebrations do not stop at the dinner table. Including pets in seasonal traditions has become second nature for many families, whether that means a decorated cookie, a special meal, or hanging up a stocking for more treats to be delivered.
As cookie tins fill kitchens and holiday plans take shape, GiggyBites’ festive treats offer dogs a way to take part in the fun. After all, when cookies are involved, it makes sense that the dogs want in.",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/thumbnail_IMG_2327.jpg,,,2025-12-19 11:59:30.118531

(Photo by Dana DiFilippo/New Jersey Monitor)An Assembly panel advanced legislation Thursday to expand protections for imprisoned women in New Jersey, after brutality and sex abuse scandals drove Gov. Phil Murphy to order the troubled Edna Mahan Correctional Facility for Women closed and replaced.
The bill, known as the Incarcerated Women’s Protection Act, would enact “gender-responsive” policies from entry through release and reentry, and require the state Department of Corrections to mandate annual gender-specialized training for all correctional officers who supervise imprisoned women.
Bill sponsor Assemblywoman Yvonne Lopez (D-Middlesex) chairs the Assembly’s community development and women’s affairs committee, which heard the bill Thursday.
The bill would codify protections adopted since sexual misconduct problems drove federal authorities to intervene in 2021 and declare oversight, Lopez said. It also builds on a 2020 law she also sponsored, known as the Dignity Act, that set new protections for incarcerated parents and pregnant women, she added.

“The time spent inside of prison informs life after prison, and if we truly want individuals to return and succeed in society, we need to ensure their experience while incarcerated is free from abuse and marked by support from the very beginning,” Lopez said.
The bill also would establish a special victims unit to investigate allegations of sexual assault or misconduct and require investigators to get gender-informed and victim-centered training on how to best investigate such cases.
A division of women’s services would be created to develop policies, programs, and services addressing treatment for physical or sexual abuse, parenting, and child reunification. The bill also would require the department to offer parenting classes, doula services, and family reunification programs for pregnant inmates and counseling and reentry services for women scheduled for release within six months.
Edwin “Chino” Ortiz, who heads a returning citizens support group of Essex and Union counties, called the measure overdue and urged legislators to pass it.
“Because someone commits a crime does not mean that they lose their rights to be treated as a human being,” Ortiz said. “We have a moral obligation as citizens of this state, of this country, to protect those who are most vulnerable and who are supposed to be protected.”
Groups supporting the legislation included the American Civil Liberties Union of New Jersey, Salvation and Social Justice, and the state Office of the Corrections Ombudsperson.
The panel advanced the bill along party lines, with Assemblyman Al Barlas (R-Essex) voting no.
The bill, which has been stalled in the Assembly since it was introduced in September 2024, has a narrow window to make it to the governor’s desk, with the current legislative session set to end in less than a month. The bill’s Senate companion passed in committee but still awaits a full Senate vote.
Murphy in 2021 ordered that Edna Mahan be closed after more than a dozen correctional officers were arrested for brutally assaulting incarcerated women during a violent night of forced cell extractions.
While more than a dozen officers were arrested, a state judge dismissed their criminal indictment in October, citing deficiencies in the indictment and the state’s four-year delay in preparing the case for trial.
Construction on a new 420-bed, $310 million state prison for women began in October in Chesterfield, where the prison will relocate from Clinton.

Doctors and advocates have said joining such compacts would play a key role in addressing a statewide doctor shortage. According to research from the National Conference of State Legislatures, states that join the main compact for physicians, the Interstate Medical Licensure Compact, have experienced a 10% to 15% increase in licensed physicians.
The compacts enable doctors in member states to more easily move between states. Think New Mexico, a nonpartisan advocacy group, compares the compacts to driver’s licenses that allow people to drive freely across the country; the New Mexico Medical Board compares them to TSA pre-check, saying the compacts allow doctors to be “pre-cleared” to work here but still subject to a rigorous screening process. 
But unlike 43 states, including New Mexico’s five border states, New Mexico is neither a member of the Interstate Medical Licensure Compact, nor part of eight other major compacts for paramedics, audiologists, dentists and other specialties, according to Think New Mexico.
Las Cruces doctors push for legislation to stem New Mexico doctor shortage

The physician compact was one of six that died in the Senate Judiciary Committee earlier this year after receiving bipartisan approval in the House. One of the others, the compact for social workers, received endorsements from the state health and education departments, both of which said joining was likely to help the state address its mental health provider shortage. According to the compact website, 30 states, including Arizona, Colorado and Utah, are part of the Social Work Licensure Compact. 
Think New Mexico issued a statement Tuesday describing a “growing coalition” pushing the Legislature, namely Senate Democrats, to join the compacts, and listed 16 health care providers, three chambers of commerce, four gubernatorial candidates, labor unions, nonprofits and civic groups across the political spectrum like the Coalition of Conservatives in Action and Indivisible Albuquerque. 
“Joining the interstate health care worker compacts unites New Mexicans all across the political spectrum,” said Fred Nathan, Think New Mexico’s director, in a statement.
Wirth, in an emailed statement Wednesday afternoon to Source NM, said joining the compacts is a complex undertaking, requiring negotiations with each compact commission while also maintaining the state’s authority in a way that “continues to protect patients and those who serve them.”
At the end of the first special legislative session in October, Wirth committed to involving Republican state lawmakers in a working group that would draft legislation. In an emailed statement Wednesday afternoon, Wirth said he expects the Legislature to pass both the physician compact and one for social workers early in the session beginning Jan. 20. 
“I’m pleased to report that the bipartisan, bicameral group working on the Interstate Medical Licensure Compact and the Social Worker Compact are close to finalizing legislation that will allow New Mexico to join both compacts,” he said.
NM Senate Dems unlikely to move on medical compacts for special session

As for the remaining compacts that Think New Mexico’s coalition are pushing for, Wirth said several are “in the pipeline,” including for paramedics, physical therapists and psychologists. 
“Each needs to go through a deliberate vetting process, similar to what we are doing with the medical and social work compacts,” he said. “I support joining compacts when the work has been done upfront to ensure that the state will truly benefit from the results.”
According to Think New Mexico, the state lacks 2,510 Emergency Medical Technicians, 526 physical therapists, 281 physician assistants and 114 occupational therapists to meet national benchmarks. The state also lost 248 doctors between 2019 and 2024, an 8.1% decrease in the same period that the United States saw a roughly 7% increase in doctors nationwide.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Wirth_DP-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-18 14:58:33.678499

Gusts nearing 100 miles per hour battered the state, according to a National Weather Service report. Thousands across the state lost power, including more than 30,000 people in the Flathead Valley.
On Thursday morning, NorthWestern Energy’s outage map showed dozens of scattered outages across the state, including larger ones near Boulder and Clancy.
One day earlier, NorthWestern said 35,000 households had experienced outages, and crews were working as quickly as possible to safely restore services.
 More wind could be on the way — the National Weather Service has wind advisories in effect for western Montana, including the Missoula and Bitterroot valleys and wind watches in effect for west-central Montana. This includes locations in Cascade County, including the Little Belt and Highwood mountains, as well as eastern Toole and Liberty counties. Additionally, eastern Pondera County and eastern Teton County are also under a high-wind advisory through Friday morning.
The weather was well out of the norm, according to Trent Parker, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service based in Missoula.
“This is very unusual,” Parker said on Thursday, adding that strong wind is usually associated more with something like a thunderstorm, and that wasn’t the case.
“One of the key pieces is that we were so warm,” Parker said. “Usually this time of year, we’re able to lock in some colder air down to the lower valleys. And what that would do is it kind of puts a lid on top of us and prevents those really strong winds from mixing down towards the surface. Usually, if we have that cold air down the valleys, the wind kind of just rides on top of all those locations where we have a lot of people.”
Those strong winds came from the upper atmosphere, Parker said, with a low pressure system exacerbating their ferocity. Saturated ground is also an issue, he said — normally at this point in the year, the ground is frozen and trees would not have as much of an issue standing up to winds.
“That prevents the trees from really being cemented in the ground,” Parker said.
The highest wind gust recorded — 93 miles per hour — on Wednesday was in Park County, though the National Weather Service warned in the post not all recordings are considered official. Big Timber saw a gust of 88 miles per hour, while the Billings airport recorded wind speeds reaching 79 miles per hour. 
Firefighters in Billings said the wind event spawned more than 170 calls for service, including “multiple working structure fires,” according to a post from their union. In Missoula, the city said on Wednesday afternoon that it was responding to reports of downed trees and power lines.
Roads had to be closed in both Missoula and Helena because of the storm — including the usually busy intersection of Montana Avenue and Custer Avenue in the northern part of the Queen City. City officials also shut down Helena’s walking mall and warned pedestrians to take extreme caution.
In northern Montana, blizzard conditions brought travel in several counties to a standstill. It also led to a rare advisory.
“A Civil Emergency Message has been issued for Phillips, Valley, Roosevelt and McCone counties through 6 AM due to whiteout blizzard conditions,” a NWS bulletin sent shortly after 9:30 p.m. Wednesday reads. “Road closures include all of the City of Glasgow, US Highway 2 from Malta to Wolf Point and MT Highway 13 from Wolf Point to Circle.”
Highway 2 was reopened Thursday morning, according to a post from the Phillips County Sheriff’s Office. Law enforcement there reported multiple vehicles stuck “on all roads in Phillips County” on Wednesday evening.
“No travel is advised,” a social media post from the Phillips County Sheriff’s Department said. “If you feel the need to travel you better make sure you have supplies because we do not have the manpower to come rescue you.” 
According to its website, Phillips County has five dispatchers, five deputies, a sheriff, and an undersheriff.
Lincoln County, where flooding prompted an earlier emergency declaration from Gov. Greg Gianforte and request for federal assistance, also issued an advisory for its residents to not travel unless it was an emergency. 
Wheatland County also temporarily closed Highway 191 due to an incident involving a semi truck, though it was reopened late Wednesday night.
“Winds have been reported strong enough that patrol vehicles are unable to stay on the roadway,” Wheatland County Emergency management reported on Facebook on Wednesday.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/MISSOULANWE597900415_1331820015651591_635131538495968923_n-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-12-18 14:58:33.678499

(Photo by Jake Goldstein-Street/Washington State Standard)Across the Northwest, a record warm fall and lack of snowpack going into the winter is putting more drought pressure on Oregon, Idaho, Washington and western Montana.
Despite record rain in western Washington recently, and earlier this year in central and southern Oregon, the showers are filling up already overdrawn reservoirs in many areas, scientists said on Monday at an online drought and climate outlook meeting hosted by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
2021 heat dome left Rhode Island-sized damage in Oregon’s, Washington’s western forests

Snowpack in the region and in the Cascade Range, acting as a reservoir of its own for summer months when there’s little rain and many communities rely on snowmelt, is simply not piling up.
Snowpack in the Northwest is sitting at the lowest level for the region as a whole at this point in the winter since record keeping began in 2001, according to Jacob Genuise, a climatologist at the Washington State Climate Office.
“We’re seeing just really warm storms with a lot of rain and not a lot of snow,” Genuise said. “Given all this warm rain, it actually melted some of our snowpack, and we saw a decline.”
 Northwest had warmest season in more than 130 years of recordkeeping

The Northwest just experienced its sixth warmest August on record, the warmest September on record — about 6 degrees Fahrenheit above normal on average — and the second warmest November on record, according to NOAA data.
Taken together, August through November of this year was the record warmest on average across the Northwest in more than 130 years of record keeping. NASA scientists, using NOAA records of global average temperatures dating back to 1880, found that this November was the third-warmest November on Earth, behind only November of 2023 and 2024.
But in 2023 and 2024, a planet-warming El Niño weather pattern helped fuel record temperatures, according to the data. There was no El Niño event to drive temperatures this year.
Temperatures in the Northwest have been most abnormal across all of Idaho, eastern Washington and eastern Oregon, and in western Montana.
“It’s definitely not good,” Genuise said. “We’ve seen much more above normal years in the past few decades than we did in the past.”
 Rain, not snow

By the end of this summer, drought took hold of the Northwest, Genuise said, especially in parts of northern Idaho and southeast Washington. Snow melted too quickly in spring, creating drought as the summer went on, and abnormal heat also increased surface water evaporation in lakes and streams, lowering water levels that contributed to drought in parts of the region.
In the last month, most of western Oregon was at 50% of its normal level of precipitation for this time of year, according to Brad Pugh, a meteorologist at the National Weather Service’s Climate Prediction Center.
Only southern and central Oregon have been spared major drought impacts this year, but reservoirs that filled from heavy spring rains are also being quickly depleted, he said.
Everywhere north of Oregon is experiencing above average rainfall, Pugh said.
This will potentially help pull the Northwest out of a region-wide drought in the coming weeks or month, according to Pugh, but much of that will also depend on whether or not it gets cold enough for rain to turn into snow and snowpack.
The only area in the region getting roughly normal snowpack is western Montana, where temperatures have been just-cold-enough to turn rain to snow. All of Oregon and most of southern Washington are seeing “really, really deep snowpack deficits,” Genuise said.
If the snowpack is still bad in the spring, there could be ongoing drought issues in the year ahead, Genuise added.
“We could see this change, and this is likely to change as we see some wetter and cooler systems later in the month, but we’re definitely sitting well below normal as we talk here today,” he said.

(Photo by Doug Mills - Pool/Getty Images)President Donald Trump is headed to Rocky Mount Friday night for his third visit to North Carolina this year, and the first of the upcoming campaign season for the 2026 midterm elections. 
According to a White House advisory, the doors of the Rocky Mount Convention Center will open at 6:00 P.M. Friday. The president will likely speak after 9:00 P.M.  
Rocky Mount is located in the newly-redrawn 1st Congressional District, which is now more likely to elect a Republican candidate after decades of representation by Black Democrats. Republican state lawmakers redrew the district in October at Trump’s request.
Incumbent Rep. Don Davis, a Snow Hill Democrat, has said he will run for re-election in 2026 despite the redrawn map. 
Several Republicans have already filed for the March primary, including state Senator Bobby Hanig (R-Currituck) and Laurie Buckhout, the winner of the district’s 2024 GOP primary. Buckhout lost to Davis in 2024 by only a few thousand votes. She’s been working in the Trump administration for the past year. 
The Trump administration hasn’t yet said what the president will be speaking about. His address from the White House Wednesday evening largely focused on inflation and rising health care costs. 
But if history is any guide, the president could use the event to make endorsements in the 1st district primary as well as the U.S. Senate primary. 
Former national GOP chairman Michael Whatley is the best-known name in the Senate primary, and the one with the closest ties to Trump through his work with Trump and daughter-in-law Lara Trump at the RNC. Whatley broke the news of Trump’s event on social media earlier in the week.
However, several other candidates have filed to challenge Whatley for the nomination, including conservative activist Don Brown and Michele Morrow, the 2024 GOP nominee for state schools chief who lost to Democrat Mo Green.  
More candidates could still emerge before the president arrives. Candidate filing for 2026 ends Friday at noon.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/gettyimages-2251825336-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-18 14:58:33.678499

Alissa Furry’s lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Iowa, names as defendants Polk City; the city manager, Chelsea Huisman, and the city’s police chief, Jeremy Siepker.
According to the lawsuit, Furry’s performance reviews indicated she met or exceeded all expectations throughout her employment with the city as a state-licensed paramedic. In 2023, she received her first Lifesaving Award recognizing her work on a cardiac-arrest call, and in 2024, she was recognized with the Rookie of the Year Award and two additional Lifesaving Awards. In 2025, she was voted Medic of the Year by her peers and received a fourth Lifesaving Award.

The lawsuit alleges Furry never faced discipline from the city and that the city never raised any concerns about her job performance.
According to the lawsuit, Furry was off duty on Sept. 10, 2025, when she posted a message to her private Facebook account about that day’s shooting of Kirk.
The lawsuit alleges that in her post, Furry wrote: “Why I really don’t care that this guy died from gun violence. He was a bigoted prick, and according to his own words he died in an acceptable way. I have as much sympathy and empathy for him as that insurance CEO that was killed. I do care that two high school students were critically injured today due to gun violence at their school. Unfortunately, I’m seeing way more about this a–hole on my Facebook than I am the kids that were hurt.”
Furry’s post was in reference to Kirk’s public comments in April 2023 in which he said, “I think it’s worth it. I think it’s worth it to have a cost of, unfortunately, some gun deaths every single year so that we can have the Second Amendment to protect our other God-given rights.”
The lawsuit claims that a former coworker of Furry’s immediately contacted her and advised her to be cautious about what she posted on social media. Within four minutes of posting the comment, Furry deleted it, the lawsuit alleges.
Later, while off-duty at home, she posted another comment to her private Facebook account that stated: “Meanwhile, all I’m seeing is people extolling the virtues of the guy that said empathy is fake and condoned deaths from gun violence as long as we get to keep the second amendment. And yet people who are out of empathy to care about him are the bad ones.”
Minutes later, the lawsuit states, Furry shared another post that consisted of a quote attributed to the 19th-century Irish poet Oscar Wilde, which read, “Some men improve the world only by leaving it,” and which included the caption, “I can choose to ‘not celebrate,’ but also not be sad.”
According to the lawsuit, Siepker, the Polk City police chief, called Polk City Fire Chief Karla Hogrefe on Sept. 11, 2025, to discuss the Facebook posts and to share that he had received complaints from city police officers about the posts.
On Sept. 16, 2025, the fire chief allegedly called Furry and informed her that she was being placed on administrative leave due to her social media posts while indicating she did not agree with the city’s decision but that her hands were tied.
The lawsuit claims that on Sept. 22, 2025, Huisman, the city manager, completed an internal investigation of the matter and recommended Furry be fired. On Oct. 24, 2025, the city issued its final decision in the matter and terminated Furry’s employment.
The lawsuit alleges Furry was fired because Huisman and Siepker disagreed with Furry’s opinions and that it is a “clearly established law that a public employer may not terminate an employee for speech made as a private citizen on a matter of public concern absent evidence that the speech meaningfully impaired discipline, workplace harmony, or operational efficiency.”
According to the lawsuit, other Polk City employees, all of whom are men, made “numerous political posts on social media, including derogatory remarks about political figures and jokes violating city policies, but received no discipline.”
The lawsuit seeks unspecified damages for First Amendment retaliation and also seeks an order that reinstates Furry to her position as a city firefighter and paramedic. The city has yet to file a response to the lawsuit. The Iowa Capital Dispatch was unable to reach Huisman and Siepker for comment.
Earlier this year, state Rep. Taylor Collins, R-Mediapolis, and state Sen. Lynn Evans, R-Aurelia, signed a letter to the Iowa Board of Regents calling for the immediate firing of employees who, in their view, had “publicly celebrated” Kirk’s death.
Iowa House Speaker Pat Grassley, a Republican, took to Facebook to write that “teachers in Iowa (are) praising the assassination of Charlie Kirk.” Grassley wrote that he expected school districts to “investigate these posts and reprimand the posters appropriately,” adding that “if appropriate action is not taken, you can trust that the Iowa House Government Oversight Committee will address this issue and take action to root out this hate from our schools.”
In the days after Kirk’s death, a Creston school teacher, a state public defender, an Iowa State University employee, and an Oskaloosa school teacher were fired for comments they made in the aftermath of Kirk’s death.

Rank MI Vote, the grassroots organization pushing for a ballot initiative to establish ranked choice voting in Michigan, has paused its statewide efforts to get that measure on the 2026 ballot. 
Rank MI Vote Executive Director Pat Zabawa wrote in a statement that the pause is happening as the group “builds momentum toward an eventual statewide win for Ranked Choice Voting in Michigan.”
Bridge Michigan, who first reported the pause, reported that an email to volunteers from field directors Kate De Jong and Kate Grabowsky said that the organization would prepare for “a second launch in April 2027” in an effort to get the measure onto the 2028 ballot.

The measure would have needed over 446,000 signatures by June in order to be included on the ballot.
Republican House Speaker Matt Hall of Richland Township celebrated the decision to halt the campaign, calling it a “complete failure” and a “terrible proposal.” House Republicans passed a bill earlier this year that would ban all ranked choice voting in Michigan, which has been referred to the Committee on Elections and Ethics in the Senate.
“I said from the beginning that the people of Michigan strongly oppose ranked choice voting, and the news today shows exactly that,” Hall said in a press release. “We’re not going to allow out-of-state, left-wing radicals to come here and hijack our elections. Never going to happen.”
Ranked choice voting had been the target of conservative groups, including the Heritage Foundation, who said that among the group’s 2026 priorities was to end ranked choice voting completely.  
It had also been criticized by some organizations of election administrators, specifically the Michigan Association of County Clerks, who passed a resolution in October urging voters to reject the proposal. 
Zabawa added that the “work is just getting started, and we will continue our efforts to advocate for and win Ranked Choice Voting throughout the state as we enter the new year.”

(Courtesy of the Utah School and Institutional Trust Lands Administration) A Native American tribe alleges a top state lawmaker plotted with other officials to block it from buying a swath of mountain wilderness that is part of its ancestral land and popular with hunters.
The Ute Indian Tribe sued the Utah School and Institutional Trust Lands Administration and several state officials in 2023, saying the tribe’s bid of nearly $47 million was the highest “legitimate” bid for the Tabby Mountain lands spanning about 45 square miles in eastern Utah.
The tribe said in court filings it “was rejected only because of racial discrimination.” The trust land agency ultimately decided in 2019 not to sell the land to anyone.

An updated lawsuit filed in November names House Speaker Mike Schultz as a defendant, along with more than a dozen other current and former state officials. The suit alleges Schultz worked with fellow state lawmakers and officials at SITLA and the Utah Department of Natural Resources to keep the land in state hands and to pass a new law “in retaliation” against the tribe.
The lawsuit contends Schultz, while House majority leader in 2019, threatened a trust lands employee, telling him, “sell it to the Tribe and see what happens to you.” That employee, Tim Donaldson, went on to become director of the Utah Land Trusts Protection and Advocacy Office. 
In 2022, Donaldson filed a complaint alleging the sale process was rigged and was terminated from his job the following day, the lawsuit states. 
The 2024 state law allows the Department of Natural Resources preferential treatment in the sale of other large blocks of school trust land topping more than 5,000 acres. Its sponsor, Rep. Casey Snider, R-Paradise, is also a defendant in the suit.
Critics say bill prioritizes hunting access over money for schools

Reps. Schultz and Snider declined to comment on allegations in the ongoing lawsuit. 
“However, the narrative being presented is simply inaccurate,” they said in a joint statement on Wednesday. “We firmly believe all Utahns should continue to have access to enjoy Tabby Mountain and all our state has to offer.” 
The lawsuit outlines an alleged conspiracy for the Department of Natural Resources to outbid the tribe with a “sham” $50 million offer that the department couldn’t actually pay, then for SITLA to postpone the sale indefinitely, citing issues with an appraisal. 
In a statement, a spokesperson for the Utah Department of Natural Resources said “DNR’s bids were made in good faith, and the money pledged in those bids would have been paid to SITLA had the property been transferred to DNR.”
Kim Wells, DNR’s communications director, noted the agency has been dismissed from the suit. She said the planned purchase would have added the land to an existing wildlife management area.
“Preserving public access and maintaining habitat for wildlife have been and continue to be the singular goals of acquiring this property,” Wells added, saying the department has “worked cooperatively with the Tribe for many years.” 
Tabby Mountain was originally included in the Uintah and Ouray Reservation, but President Theodore Roosevelt later designated it as national forest land. The Indian Reorganization Act of 1934 restored mineral rights to the tribe, but not ownership of the land underneath.
The lawsuit alleges discrimination amounting to civil rights violations and seeks a judge’s order compelling the sale of the land to the tribe and tossing out the state law. The Ute tribe is also seeking punitive damages to be determined at trial.  
The School and Institutional Trust Administration, now the Trust Lands Administration, did not immediately return messages seeking comment. They have previously argued the claim of racial discrimination is unfounded and the agency has broad discretion in managing public trust lands.

Iowa Regional Utilities received $650,000 total in grants and loans to build the first-ever centralized sewer system in the unincorporated community of Green Mountain.
North Iowa Area Council of Governments and the Greater Des Moines Habitat for Humanity received grants of slightly less than $65,000 each to assist with improvements to low-income housing. 
Communities received a cumulative total of $192,400 in grants to upgrade public safety equipment.

Ensler was elected to Alabama State House of Representatives in 2022, defeating incumbent Republican Charlotte Meadows. The district had been held by Republicans since 2002, but redistricting made it more favorable to Democrats. Ensler’s victory marked the first Democratic flip of a seat in the Alabama Legislature since 2010. 
He announced this summer that he would not seek re-election for House District 74 to move back to his home state, New York, to be closer to family.

“My mind has not been at peace since I made the announcement that I would be moving back to NY,” Ensler said in a statement Thursday morning. “My heart is here in Alabama and with the people who have become my extended family.”
Ensler is the first Democrat to join the race for the second highest state office. Until Wednesday, six candidates were in the Republican primary for the office. Former Alabama quarterback A.J. McCarron dropped out of the race to “accept a new career opportunity in football.”
Current Secretary of State Wes Allen, Alabama Commissioner of Agriculture and Industries Rick Pate; businesswoman Nicole Wadsworth; former gubernatorial candidate Dean Odle and sheriff’s deputy Patrick Bishop are still in the GOP primary.
The lieutenant governor becomes governor if the office becomes vacant and has some appointment powers. The office once held powers equivalent to the Alabama House speaker, but Democrats who controlled the Legislature shifted those to the Senate president pro tem after a weeks-long standoff with Republican Lt. Gov. Steve Windom, a Republican, in 1999. The lieutenant governor now presides over the Senate and can vote in case of a tie, but has few powers otherwise.
In his first term in the Legislature, Ensler advocated for a statewide ban of Glock switches, devices that can turn semi-automatic firearms into automatic ones. A version of the bill sponsored by Sen. Will Barfoot, R-Pike Road, became law in the spring as part of Gov. Kay Ivey’s public safety package. The bill was the first firearm restriction legislation to pass the Alabama House of Representatives since 2010.
The last Democrat to be elected to the office was former Gov. Jim Folsom Jr. in 2006.
“I’ve been overwhelmed by how many people all over the state of varying political beliefs and backgrounds have strongly encouraged me to stay and continue to pursue public service — I will be sharing my specific plans tomorrow,” Ensler said in the statement.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Phillip-Ensler-Feb-15-2024-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-12-18 13:58:06.655119

(Photo by Tim Carpenter/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — The Kansas Board of Regents agreed to weigh feedback from professors, administrators and legislators before voting on systemwide faculty tenure and workload policies designed to bring accountability and transparency to academic personnel decisions at the state’s six public universities.
Since the Board of Regents released drafts of the policies in November, complaints surfaced that allowing the firing of university professors after two consecutive unsatisfactory annual evaluations was “overly rigid” and didn’t take into account “extenuating circumstances,” such as an employee’s personal crisis.
In addition, concern was expressed the workload policy conflicted with standards of the American Association of University Professors or with academic program accreditation guidelines.
Objections were raised about membership of post-tenure review committees and whether the university committee deciding to place a faculty member on a one-year improvement plan would be the same group that performed the follow-up evaluation. Another issue was that one year could be an unrealistic period of time for a faculty member to correct deficiencies in research productivity, officials said.
“We’re appreciative of that input because it is beneficial and helpful as we look at trying to stand up this policy,” said Board of Regents member Alysia Johnston, who has a background in community college administration.
She said the goal was implementation of umbrella policies applicable to the University of Kansas, Kansas State University, Wichita State University, Fort Hays State University, Pittsburg State University and Emporia State University.
The Board of Regents engaged in general discussion of the draft policies Wednesday and could take formal action on both in January.
During the past few years, members of the Legislature have taken greater interest in university workload and tenure decisions. In 2024, a Kansas House committee welcomed to the Capitol a tenured faculty member at Emporia State who recommended retroactive elimination of tenure at state universities. The idea was opposed by K-State president Richard Linton and KU chancellor Doug Girod.
 
Return on investment
Rusty Monhollon, vice president of academic affairs for the Board of Regents, said the systemwide tenure and workload policies were the result of persistent calls for greater transparency and accountability regarding faculty appointments.
“It’s my own sense that very few faculty would be opposed to greater accountability because the work they do is good. They are very productive and they would stand up under scrutiny,” he said.
Monhollon, a former executive director of the South Carolina Commission on Higher Education, said tenure was awarded to faculty following extensive vetting of each person’s teaching, research and service performance over a period of years. Tenure was mistakenly viewed by the public as a lifetime appointment, he said.
Academic freedom, a pivotal component of faculty tenure across the United States, was essential to success of colleges or universities, he said.
“Tenure is there to protect faculty to pursue research or to take on topics that are controversial,” Monhollon said. “If those protections aren’t in place for faculty, I think we lose that ability of faculty to take on difficult challenges, maybe pursue paths that are a bit unconventional, that many times bear the kind of results that really advance society and benefit all of us.”
Matt Crocker, a Manhattan businessman appointed to the Board of Regents in October, said changes to workload and tenure expectations at state universities should recognize the value in making certain taxpayers received proper return on public investments in higher education. He serves as CEO of SPS Companies, which includes Steel and Pipe Supply Co.
He said Monhollon’s comments about protecting academic freedom raised the question: “Protect them from whom?”
“If an individual’s not working in line with the mission of the university, I’m not sure that’s really something we want to protect,” Crocker said. “I don’t think we want to mix a lot of concepts together inadvertently as we look through these policies.”
 
Revised expectations
Under the proposed reforms, the Board of Regents would adopt academic workload expectations and require post-tenure review of faculty at research-centered KU, WSU and K-State and the regional universities in Pittsburg, Emporia and Hays. The core obligation of all faculty in the system would be teaching, research and service, but instruction of students would be the most significant factor in assessments.
Faculty at K-State, WSU and KU would be expected to have teaching loads ranging from 40% to 55%. The three regional universities would have teaching loads of 60% to 75%. Research expectations for tenured professors would be specific to each discipline.
The faculty would have personalized work plans that were revised annually. Tenured faculty would be reviewed by a university committee every five years. Proponents of reform say collection of data on faculty would serve to better identify professors who excelled and those who fell short. The process could replace subjective elements of faculty evaluations with tangible evidence of research, teaching and service.
Each university would retain control of post-tenure faculty reviews and the provisions of self-improvement programs for faculty. Individuals could be placed in one-year remediation programs. The policy would enable universities to dismiss faculty who failed the follow-up review.
The universities would submit to the Board of Regents annual reports on tenure that included information on tenure awards and denials, the number of faculty placed on improvement plans as well as faculty resignations and dismissals. Biennial reports prepared for the Board of Regents would document faculty credit hour production, graduation rates, publications and research funding.
Johnston, who chairs the Board of Regents’ academic affairs committee, said she anticipated reports on tenure and workload to prove state universities in Kansas maintained high expectations of tenured faculty.
“I hope, with greater transparency, the data will prove just that,” she said. “I believe it will show that this is a rigorous process.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Matt-Crocker-regents-nominee-1024x646.jpg,,,2025-12-18 13:58:06.655119

The appellate court’s decision overturned a decision in the Western District of Michigan, which denied injunctive relief to the Catholic groups and kept the state’s ban in place. 
“We hold, therefore, that HB 4616 is subject to the strictest of scrutiny, under the First Amendment, as a content- and viewpoint-discriminatory restriction upon speech,” Circuit Court Judge Raymond Kethledge wrote in his decision, joined by Judge Joan Larsen. “Indeed, as a viewpoint-based restriction on speech, under the Supreme Court’s precedents, HB 4616 might be unconstitutional per se.”
Lawsuit seeks to overturn Michigan’s ban on conversion therapy for minors

Kethledge was nominated to the federal bench by former President George W. Bush, while Larsen, who formerly served on the Michigan Supreme Court, was nominated by President Donald Trump during his first term. 
The law in question, House Bill 4616 of 2023, banned conversion therapy, which Gov. Gretchen Whitmer defined in a press release at the time as “Any intervention that attempts to change an individual’s sexual orientation or gender identity.”
In order to meet the strict scrutiny requirement, the government must show that the law is the “least restrictive means of achieving a compelling government interest” — which Kethledge said that the government had not yet met.
The sole liberal judge on the court, Judge Rachel Bloomekatz, dissented, writing that “Not all words receive the same First Amendment protection, as is evident from the law’s long tradition of subjecting speech that administers a medical treatment to lesser First Amendment scrutiny.” 
She added that the medical consensus around conversion therapy is that it is harmful and should not be done, and that it was created as an idea when both homosexuality and gender identity were considered mental illnesses. 
Bloomekatz was nominated to the federal bench by former President Joe Biden.
Federal judge denies request to ax Michigan’s ban on conversion therapy

The American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry — in alignment with a number of other medical groups — has said that conversion therapies “lack scientific credibility and clinical utility” and that “there is evidence that such interventions are harmful.” As such, the group states that these kinds of attempted treatments should not be part of any behavioral health treatment for children or teens. 
Over half of U.S. states, including some deep red states, have conversion therapy bans in place, but the question of their constitutionality is set to be decided by the U.S. Supreme Court in a case contesting a similar ban in Colorado. If the Supreme Court rules against Colorado, Michigan’s ban would all but certainly be overturned as well, regardless of the outcome of this case.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/img_7664-2-scaled-e1691081297929-1024x7681691185680-1.jpeg,,,2025-12-18 13:58:06.655119

Wood4Good is entering an exciting new phase of growth as we expand our free firewood program into new regions across Vermont. After another record-setting year serving families in need, we are taking intentional steps to ensure that no Vermonter is left out in the cold—no matter where they live.
In the coming year, Wood4Good will establish new processing and distribution locations in Rochester, Burke, and Rutland County. These sites were chosen to help us reach more rural and underserved communities where access to affordable heating support is limited and winter can be especially challenging. Expanding into these regions requires new equipment, storage, transportation, and local infrastructure.
This growth is only possible with the support of both volunteers and donors. We need volunteers to help process, stack, and distribute firewood, and we rely on donations to cover operating costs such as fuel, equipment maintenance, safety gear, and transportation. Every hour volunteered and every dollar donated directly helps keep a family warm.
Firewood from these new locations will be available starting next winter, and the work to make that possible begins now. With continued community support—through time, resources, and financial contributions—we can build a stronger, warmer Vermont and ensure that no neighbor has to choose between food and heat.

Centre students and students from nearby schools observed the proceedings. (Administrative Office of the Courts)Nearly a year after it upheld a law that would have opened a path for the General Assembly to impose laws on a single Kentucky locale or entity, the Kentucky Supreme Court has reversed itself and declared the law unconstitutional. 
In a 4-3 ruling issued Thursday morning, the high court overturned a 2022 law that would at present only apply to Jefferson County Public Schools based on certain specific criteria spelled out in the legislation.
The 2022 law passed by the legislature’s Republican supermajority would have shifted power from the elected school board to the appointed superintendent. The attorney for the school board, David Tachau, argued that if the court’s original ruling stood, it could pave the way for lawmakers to widely use “special legislation,” or narrow state legislation that impacts a county or city and is prohibited under the Kentucky Constitution. 
Matthew Kuhn, solicitor general in the state attorney general’s office, argued declaring the law unconstitutional could have broad implications, such as undoing the laws that allow merged city-county governments in Lexington and Louisville. 
Before Justice Pamela Goodwine joined the court this year, the Supreme Court narrowly ruled last December to allow the law to stand. In April, the court agreed to rehear the case at the school board’s request. Oral arguments were held again in August. 
Justice Angela McCormick Bisig wrote in the majority opinion that justices were not saying “that the General Assembly may never enact legislation addressed to only one particular type of county or form of county government, but rather only that it cannot do so unreasonably.” She was joined by Justices Michelle Keller, Kelly Thompson and Goodwine. 
In the majority opinion, Bisig said the ruling is not a commentary on the legislature’s policy. “Oour limited duty is solely to consider whether the statute complies with or violates the Kentucky Constitution.” By her analysis, the law is not in line with the state Constitution. 
“Today we remain both steadfast in our strict observance of the separation of powers and mindful of our duty of judicial modesty to respect the acts of the General Assembly and afford them the presumption of constitutionality they deserve,” Bisig wrote. “Nonetheless, we also cannot allow this modesty to blind us to our solemn obligation to safeguard the rights of the citizens of this Commonwealth to government in conformity with the limitations set forth in our Constitution.”

Bisig also defended the court’s authority to rehear the case, knowing that it would “be easy fodder for those unhappy with today’s decision to argue it is due to nothing more than a change in the composition of this Court.”
“The present case involves allegations of unreasonable disparate treatment of the largest school district in the Commonwealth,” she wrote. “It is a matter of statewide interest as it relates not only to a reduction of the Jefferson County Board of Education’s powers, but also a denial to every other public school superintendent in the Commonwealth of extra powers afforded to the Jefferson County superintendent. It is thus a matter of significant concern to all citizens of the Commonwealth, as it fundamentally affects the governance of public schools and thus the education of Kentucky’s children.” 
In the dissenting opinion, Justice Shea Nickell criticized the decisions to rehear the case, saying the new court “has taken result oriented decision-making and disregard of well-established procedural rules to a new level of ‘judicial fog.’” He wrote that the school board had ample opportunity to make its case during the original proceedings and the previous court duly applied the law. Chief Justice Debra Lambert and Deputy Chief Justice Robert Conley joined Nickell’s opinion. 
Nickell wrote that some may chalk the new decision up to “glib political maxims, such as ‘elections have consequences.’”
“However, such excuses conveniently ignore that, within our government’s three-branched framework, stated broadly, legislative bodies are elected to enact laws aimed at pursuing chosen public policy goals and executive officers are elected to execute and enforce enacted laws to administer and achieve adopted public policy objectives, while judicial courts — however chosen — are restricted to interpreting and administering enacted laws and determining their constitutional legitimacy absent review concerning the wisdom or correctness of underlying public policy,” Nickell wrote. “As a result, the American legal tradition has long recognized that legislators and executive officers are ultimately accountable to the people while judges and justices are ultimately accountable to the law.”
Justices, particularly Goodwine, faced new pressure once they signaled the case would be heard again this year. Goodwine’s campaign for Supreme Court received support from Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear and his political action committee. She was elected in November 2024. 
In October, a Louisville attorney and GOP official, Jack Richardson, filed a petition with the clerk of the Kentucky House calling for Goodwine’s impeachment for not recusing herself from the case. According to a report from Louisville Public Media, Richardson said it was improper for Goodwine to rule on the case after an independent political action committee heavily funded by the Louisville teachers’ union backed ads to help elect her in 2024. 
A high ranking member of House GOP leadership and Louisville lawmaker, Majority Whip Rep. Jason Nemes, wrote an op-ed for the Louisville Courier Journal in August saying that the court’s ruling would “not only determine the future of Jefferson County’s schools but could also unravel critical local policies that benefit urban, suburban and rural communities.”
Last month, when Lambert appeared before a legislative committee to make budget requests of the General Assembly, Nemes emphasized how different JCPS is from other Kentucky school districts as it is the largest school district in the state. Nemes added that “anybody who would say that we must treat JCPS the same as we treat Robertson County, which has 3,000 people in the entire county, I don’t think is understanding the real world.” 
Goodwine and Conley were present at the meeting, seated in the crowd. 
Reacting to the Thursday decision, Republican Attorney General Russell Coleman said in a statement he was “stunned that our Supreme Court reversed itself based only a new justice joining the Court.”
“This decision is devastating for JCPS students and leaves them trapped in a failing system while sabotaging the General Assembly’s rescue mission,” Coleman added.

Phaneuf and Jenna Carlesso,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/12/18/ct-snap-program-lamont-budget-chair/,The proposed state-funded SNAP program would be for those expected to lose federal benefits by March 31. Gov. Ned Lamont isn't on board.,"A leader on the General Assembly’s budget panel pledged Thursday to propose a state-funded nutrition benefit for the tens of thousands of residents expected to lose federal SNAP assistance by March 31.
Sen. Cathy Osten, D-Sprague, co-chairwoman of the Appropriations Committee, said she would introduce a bill when the regular legislative session opens Feb. 4, and would urge Gov. Ned Lamont’s administration to get the program running no later than July 1.
Osten praised Lamont for recommending $24.6 million in emergency aid to food banks and pantries over the next 18 months but said that won’t be sufficient to protect some of Connecticut’s vulnerable residents.
Ensuring no residents go hungry is a fundamental responsibility of society, Osten said.
“We have Connecticut residents who are not getting the assistance they need,” she added. “I’m not willing to not try to figure out a way to [help] people eat.”
State officials estimate about 36,000 immigrants, young adults, veterans, and people experiencing homelessness are at risk of losing federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits because of new work requirements and other changes ordered by Congress and President Donald Trump.
The at-risk individuals represent about one-tenth of Connecticut’s entire SNAP population, and that larger group receives about $72 million per month in benefits.
Osten said she believes Connecticut easily could handle the cost of assisting the smaller, at-risk group. State budget surpluses have been huge, averaging more than $1.8 billion or 8% to 9% of the General Fund, since aggressive budget caps were imposed in 2017.
Connecticut operated a purely state-funded food stamp program from the late 1990s through 2018 to aid residents that Congress disqualified from federal assistance while reforming welfare in 1996.
And Osten isn’t alone in pushing for a return to state-funded nutrition assistance.
The United Way, New Haven Legal Assistance and 15 other nonprofits, labor and business organizations and policy groups wrote Lamont and legislative leaders on Dec. 8, asking them to create such a program.
But Lamont, a fiscally moderate Democrat, has traditionally been wary of using state funds to supplement programs normally funded by the federal government.
When asked Thursday about the prospect of ongoing state spending on food stamps, Lamont said, “I think we have a better alternative [with] what we’re doing in terms of the food banks and Foodshare.”
The governor said these pantries “will be able to notice folks who maybe are losing their SNAP benefits, show them where you can get the, you know, food on a ready basis.”
To further control costs, Osten said her proposal would include expanding job-coaching services to help as many at-risk residents as possible find work.
But some of at-risk group involves people with mental illness or severe autism, and many businesses won’t employ these residents, she said.
Osten added she believes it shouldn’t take the Lamont administration that long to create a new state-funded nutrition benefit to replace federal SNAP assistance.
Leaders of Connecticut’s food assistance nonprofits — while praising Lamont for earmarking emergency funding for their network — say it only can replace a fraction of the assistance households cut off from SNAP benefits have lost.
“We’re intended to be a supplement,” said Jason Jakubowski, president and CEO of Foodshare. “There is not enough food at our food bank, or every food bank in the country put together, to make up for the number of meals that SNAP provides.”
And Sara Parker McKernan, a policy advocate for New Haven Legal Assistance, said food pantries are best suited to handle short-term food emergencies in households.
“If you go into a food pantry, you’re going to have a limited amount and a limited selection of what you can get,” she said. “To make that even harder, not everybody has access to food pantries because they’re open at odd times. People have to work. They have to pick up their kids. They might not have transportation.”
For example, Eastford, a small, rural community in Windham County, operates a food pantry out of the Town Office Building, but it’s open only from 8 a.m. to 10 a.m. — and only on the first Monday of each month, according to the town’s website.
“It can be very difficult to get to a food pantry to pick up things,” McKernan added. “Having your own ability to pay for food, which you get when you have food stamps — that autonomy is key for people. We need to have a state-funded food assistance program so people can make those choices for themselves.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/2025_0523_SR_OstenWalker_015-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-18 13:58:06.655119

(Photo by Tess Vrbin/Arkansas Advocate)Violet White’s experience in the Arkansas Department of Corrections taught her what helps — and what doesn’t help — formerly incarcerated people try to get their lives back on track.
At one point in her 17 years as an agency employee, White worked on a grant-funded program to help people acclimate to life outside prison. Having only about 30 cases meant she could spend enough time with people to get to know their wants and needs, which helps prevent them from reoffending, she said.

Third in a series on Arkansas’ crowded prisons

“You know their mom. You know their brother. You know where they live, where they work. You know all these things, and you can actually use your tools and the things that you have to try to help them do better,” said White, who left the corrections department in 2024. “But when you have 200 people, or even 150 people, which is not abnormal … you get 10 to 15 minutes with them to come in [and say], ‘Hey, how are you doing? Are you still working? Where are you living? Alright, see you in a month.’”
High caseloads are just one part of Arkansas’ uphill battle against recidivism, according to White, state officials and the findings of a legislative task force. The DOC applies the term recidivism to inmates who violate the terms of their release or are convicted of new crimes within three years of leaving prison.
It contributes to Arkansas’ rising prison population. 
As of December, roughly 72,000 formerly incarcerated people were on parole, probation or another form of supervision, meaning about 71% of the 93,000 Arkansans under the Department of Corrections’ control were out of prison, spokesperson Rand Champion said.
That represents an increase in the number of incarcerated Arkansans and a decrease in the number under supervision in nearly a year and a half. The final report from the Legislative Recidivism Reduction Task Force presented to lawmakers a year ago said that 90,700 Arkansans were under correctional control as of July 2024, of whom more than 75% were out of prison. The task force was created by the Protect Arkansas Act of 2023 and disbanded after its final report.
Furthermore, almost half of closed supervision cases from 2014 to 2023 involved revoking former inmates’ parole and returning them to prison, or giving them new sentences, the report states.

What is the Protect Arkansas Act?

 

A significant contributor to recidivism is “inconsistent adherence to evidence-based practices for programming provided both in house and by community partners,” according to the report. Examples of programming for current and former inmates include job training, mental health care and substance use disorder counseling.
The Department of Corrections has not consistently monitored whether its programming for current and former inmates is effective, White said.
“We really never did any research to see if [programs] worked for our population, and that’s just not good business practice,” she said.
White worked as a parole officer in Pulaski County for several years. Her final job before leaving the corrections department in 2024 was in probation management.
The department adopted the Ohio Risk Assessment System in 2011 but stopped using it in 2014, White and Champion both said. ORAS evaluates the likelihood of reoffending and what people need to help prevent it.
ORAS is widely accepted as an effective correctional tool. White said the information it yields is detailed and valuable, especially since the department’s previous assessment was “very basic,” but the department “just didn’t have the staff” for a program that “takes a good hour to an hour and 45 minutes” per inmate.
The Arkansas Board of Corrections approved a contract with the University of Cincinnati Corrections Institute to resume using ORAS in 2024. The recidivism task force report says ORAS “cannot achieve its intended impact” in Arkansas without “more officer training and resources.”
“Many officers know best practices and wish to implement them but are hindered by short office visits and lack of cognitive tools,” the report states.

 Caseloads and staff turnover

The Department of Corrections has 426 supervision officers with active caseloads, Champion said on Dec. 3.
That’s a decrease of 31 officers in only a month, since a quarterly report from the department released Nov. 3 stated there were 457 filled caseworker positions.
Asked about the average number of cases each officer handles, Champion said it “varies depending on a variety of factors.”
Department officials told lawmakers in 2024 that the average caseload per officer was about 100 and that the ideal caseload would be 50-80, the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette reported.
The demands on supervision officers have been a concern for state Sen. Clarke Tucker, D-Little Rock, who has sponsored multiple laws aimed at reducing recidivism over his years in the Legislature. He shared a similar perspective to White in an August interview, saying that officers’ caseloads “are completely untenable” and too heavy for them to “provide meaningful supervision.”

Ex G ACC Caseloads QUARTERLY _36_1069260940397469521 
The corrections department has also seen high levels of staff turnover. White said having to rebuild from scratch inmates’ relationships with correctional officers hinders the department’s efforts to meet offenders’ needs and help them avoid reoffending.
“[For] some offenders that really want to do well, it just creates instability for them,” White said. “And [for] offenders that don’t want to do well, it creates an opportunity for them to manipulate.”
A new state employee pay plan, effective as of this summer, gave five-figure raises to the starting and average salaries for several hard-to-fill jobs, including corrections officers. Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders and other state officials have said they hope the pay plan will increase recruitment and retention in those positions.
Besides caseworker continuity, another major need for both inmates and people under supervision is more effective mental health care and substance use disorder treatment, White said.
The Legislative Recidivism Reduction Task Force’s 2024 report said there is a “higher probability of recidivism for people with behavioral health referrals.”
“Individuals successfully released from supervision were less likely to have received substance use or mental health referrals than those who received a revocation or a new sentence,” according to the report.
The ideal post-incarceration outcome is for people to get steady jobs, be able to support themselves, take mental health medication if necessary and remain sober from substances if necessary, White said.
Those goals become a “hard sell” for people with untreated mental and behavioral health needs and if employment is hard to come by, White said. She also said former inmates would be less likely to reoffend if they were paid living wages at their post-incarceration jobs.
“It’s really hard to convince [people] to go flip burgers for $10 an hour when they can go sling dope on a corner and make a couple thousand,” White said.

 New policies

Sanders signed three new laws this year spawned from the recidivism task force’s recommendations. All three laws received bipartisan support from lawmakers and went into effect in August.
The identical Act 769 and Act 694 require a “validated risk and needs assessment,” or a standardized evaluation process that quantifies an inmate’s risk of recidivism, for each inmate brought into state custody.
It also requires assigning inmates to “a program or meaningful activity that corresponds with the inmate’s risk of recidivism in accordance with the inmate’s needs such that the higher the inmate’s risk of recidivism, the more programs or meaningful activities the inmate will be assigned.”
A study of the corrections department’s “social and organizational climate,” released in October, stated that inmates “want to use their time in prison productively to focus on personal growth” but “feel stuck and need access to positive programming and reentry programming that will enhance their chances of being approved for parole.”
White agreed, saying recent programming for inmates lacks variety and capacity.
“Prison’s the perfect opportunity for that because they’re a captive audience,” she said. “Once they hit the streets, they’ve got a lot of distractions.”










Many officers know best practices and wish to implement them but are hindered by short office visits and lack of cognitive tools.


– Legislative Recidivism Reduction Task Force final report, December 2024


Act 670, sponsored by Tucker, requires inmates’ post-release reentry plans to continue the constructive activities assigned while incarcerated, “including without limitation continued employment and continued participation in mental health treatment or substance abuse treatment, or both.” The law also requires the creation of an oversight body for evidence-based correctional practices.
The Department of Corrections “was already implementing many of those aspects and had a team in place to prioritize programming aimed at reducing recidivism” before Act 670 became law, Champion said.
“This Act codified much of the work that was already being done by existing staff since 2021,” he said, adding that the department’s existing Quality Improvement and Program Evaluation team fulfills the oversight body requirement.
Another requirement in Act 670 is for corrections officials to find ways to maximize the use of “nontraditional correctional facilities.”
The state has six residential community corrections centers, and Champion said the department has been working to “streamline intake” at those facilities.
As of last year, community corrections centers “are already implementing many evidence-based practices and seeing good results, but the potential to have a greater impact is hindered by capacity limitations,” according to the task force report.
Arkansas governor’s recidivism reduction program to launch at Little Rock facility

Limited capacity for state facilities to house inmates is one reason Sanders has proposed building a new 3,000-bed prison in Franklin County. The plan has met pushback from nearby residents and state lawmakers.
In August, the Board of Corrections unanimously approved a request from Sanders to reallocate 100 beds at the Central Arkansas Community Corrections Center in Little Rock for a recidivism reduction pilot program.
The program helps inmates within six months of release find stable housing, work and opportunities for community integration and engagement, Sanders’ chief legal adviser, Cortney Kennedy, told the board. The program will also involve community and faith organizations and the private sector.

(AP Photo/Vasha Hunt)
On Saturday afternoon, Ole Miss will become the first Mississippi team – ever – to compete in the NCAA FBS College Football Playoffs. 
We’ve got the Rebels vs. the Tulane Green Wave, 2:30 p.m., at Vaught-Hemingway Stadium. I’s time to put aside all the game’s peripheral aspects, of which there are so many. It’s time, finally, to forget Lane Kiffin and his messy exit from Oxford. It’s time to put aside the transfer portal – who’s staying and who’s leaving – at least until the new year. It’s time to stop talking about the movement of assistant coaches, too. It’s time, as coaches say, to spot the football.
Rick Cleveland
It’s time to see which team, Tulane or Ole Miss, will advance to play Georgia in the Sugar Bowl.
Ole Miss, which comes in with an 11-1 record, is a 17-point favorite to win handily over Tulane, the American Athletic Conference champion that comes in at 11-2.
That point spread, it would seem, is based primarily on the fact that, when the same two teams played on the same field 12 weeks ago, Ole Miss smashed Tulane 45-10. That game was every bit as one-sided as the score would indicate. The Sept. 20 game wasn’t a case of Ole Miss capitalizing on Tulane turnovers or making several big plays in the kicking game. It was no fluke. The turnovers were even. Tulane threw an interception; Ole Miss lost a fumble. The Rebels nearly doubled the Green Wave in yardage. Indeed, Ole Miss punted only once. The Rebels won nearly all the big downs. Tulane converted just six of 15 third downs and zero of three fourth downs. 
“We played rotten, they played good,” Tulane coach Jon Sumrall said earlier in the week. “They are clearly a big-time team, but I want us to play like a better version of ourselves. I think we’re a better team, but we gotta go prove it.”
There were some extenuating circumstances the average fan probably did not realize at the time. For one, Tulane quarterback Jake Retzlaff, a transfer from Brigham Young University, was making only his fourth start after arriving at Tulane in July. For whatever reason – and the Ole Miss defense was a big part of it – Retzlaff played the worst game he would play all season. The numbers were ugly: He completed only five of 17 passes for 56 yards. He did run eight times for 51 yards, but that was more rushing yardage than any of his running backs.
One reason for that is that redshirt freshman running back Jamauri McClure carried the ball only three times for Green Wave in that earlier game. Since then, he has emerged as Tulane’s best back. He ran for 94 yards on just 10 carries against Florida on Nov. 15, for 122 yards on 17 carries against Temple on Nov. 22 and for 121 yards on 22 carries against North Texas in the AAC championship game on Dec. 5. McClure averaged nearly seven yards per carry.
No doubt, his emergence has greatly enhanced Retzlaff’s play, which has been remarkably better than what he showed back on Sept. 20. Retzlaff has thrown for 2,862 yards and 14 touchdowns (vs. six interceptions). Perhaps more impressively, he has run for 610 yards and and 16 touchdowns. He really is a dual threat.
An even bigger reason for Tulane’s offensive woes in the earlier meeting was a key injury in the offensive line. Left tackle Derrick Graham, a fifth-year senior and a transfer from Texas A&M, did not play against Ole Miss because of an ankle injury. That caused a wholesale shuffling of the offensive line with guard Shadre Hurst moving out to tackle, and a back-up guard moving into the lineup. Any coach at any level of football can tell you how disruptive an injury to a key offensive lineman can be. It changes what you can do on offense. Against Ole Miss, Tulane could not do much of anything.
Pete Golding summed it up this way: “This is not Week 4 Tulane,” he said. “They are playing at a much higher level.”
High enough to make up for a five-touchdown deficit in the earlier game?
“We’re playing a conference champion that beat the ACC champion,” Golding said.
Still, if Ole Miss is focused and ready to play – despite all the peripheral distractions – the Rebels are surely the more talented team. But keep in mind, every week in college football, 17-point underdogs – and even higher – win football games.

,DC,2025-12-18 17:47:16+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,Judges hear case on requiring immigrants without legal status to register and carry documents,Ariana Figueroa,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/judges-hear-case-requiring-immigrants-without-legal-status-register-and-carry-documents,,"WASHINGTON — A panel of appellate judges seemed skeptical during Thursday oral arguments that the Trump administration erred in relying on a decades-old statute to require millions of noncitizens to register with the federal government and carry documentation.But they did take issue with the paperwork required of immigrants without legal status as well as the consequences for those who fail to register, and questioned if the practice violated due process and self-incrimination rights.In February, Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem announced the agency would enforce a rule under the Immigration and Nationality Act that requires all immigrants in the country without legal status to register with the agency or risk fines or potential jail time.  A federal court in April sided with the Trump administration, allowing the registration requirement to go through.The suit, brought by immigration rights advocates, does not challenge the statute from 1940 requiring those without legal status to register, but instead the process used by DHS in rolling out the policy without a proper notice and comment period. The suit also challenges a penalty for not filling out paperwork, as the form is only in English and can only be accessed with an internet connection.Administration positionArguing on behalf of the Trump administration, Kartik N. Venguswamy from the U.S. Attorney's Office said a notice and comment period is not needed because the form is just procedural and a new rule is not created. He added that the rule does not cause irreparable harm, because any harm is from outside forces, such as immigration enforcement or deportation that could follow registration with the federal government.  Judges Patricia A. Millett, Gregory G. Katsas and J. Michelle Childs heard the case in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. Former President Barack Obama nominated Millett; President Donald Trump nominated Katsas in his first term; and former President Joe Biden nominated Childs.The judges raised concerns with the form itself, including one question that requires the noncitizen to report any crimes they have committed, regardless of whether they were charged or convicted. That wades into violation of the 5th Amendment’s protections against self incrimination, one judge said.“That's asking you to confess to things that no government authority is aware of,” Millett said of the final rule. “And it’s a big step toward the 5th Amendment.”The Migration Policy Institute, a non-partisan immigration think tank, estimated that between 2.2 million and 3.2 million immigrants will have to register. The registration requirement could be a powerful tool in the Trump administration’s efforts to carry out mass deportations.Rule has gone unenforcedMichelle Lapointe, arguing on behalf of the Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights, said the federal government has not enforced the rule for nearly 80 years. The registration requirement is authorized under a wartime act known as the Alien Registration Act of 1940 that was first used in World War II. It was rarely used after that, but briefly in the aftermath of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. During that time, any noncitizen males older than 16 who hailed from 25 countries with a Muslim majority had to register with the federal government. But the program led to no terrorism convictions and was eventually dissolved in 2016.Lapointe said because the rule would apply to as many as 3 million immigrants without legal status, a notice and comment period must occur. Under the rule, immigrants 14 and older who are required to register will need to carry registration documents at all times or risk potential prison terms or fines of up to $5,000.“It is solely for the process of deportation,” Lapointe said.As the Trump administration continues with its immigration crackdown, federal immigration officials could carry out their plans for mass deportations by having easy access to records of immigrants unlawfully in the country.But Childs seemed skeptical that the federal government couldn't use the statute, because it’s on the books.Katsas also said the rule is not new — the government has just decided not to enforce it since 1940.“It seems like a more fair account” that the government is ending a long policy of not enforcing a rule that, on its face, “covers all aliens,” he said.But Katsas said the “rule does expand the category of information and that’s new.”That category of information includes the requirement to detail to the federal government any crime the individual has committed, which Lapointe argued would violate 5th Amendment rights. Registration form debatedChilds and Millett questioned the roll-out of the form, the fact that it’s only accessible online and in English, and the penalty for not registering with the federal government.“These are forms regulating a community … where English is not their native language,” Millett said. Venguswamy said the forms were in English because “English is the language of the United States government at this point.” Earlier this year, Trump signed an executive order directing federal agencies to adopt English as the official language, including paperwork.  Millett asked Venguswamy if it’s the government’s position that an immigrant who doesn’t understand English will not be charged or issued a penalty for failing to register. “I'm not in a position to speak to whether or not that is the position the government will take,” Venguswamy said. Millett then asked why a proper notice and comment period is not needed for a new process, even if it’s not creating a new statute. She gave Venguswamy an example of the IRS not changing the tax code, but issuing a new tax form for taxpayers to fill out.“We're gonna issue new tax forms, for everyone to fill out their taxes, we’re not creating tax obligations, just new forms in Ancient Biblical Greek,” Millett said. She asked Venguswamy if a proper notice and comment period would be needed for those new tax forms.He said it would not, because it's a change in procedure, not a change to the rule.“Wow,” Millett said. “We can all be criminally prosecuted for not filling out our taxes unless we can find the five people in the United States who know how to speak Ancient Biblical Greek.”",,,,2025-12-18 12:57:49.530440

Weaver presented a number of budget cuts mandated by lawmakers. (Photo by William Skipworth/New Hampshire Bulletin)In late June, when the New Hampshire Legislature passed its two-year budget, it imposed a roughly $51 million cut to the Department of Health and Human Services. This week, the department told the Executive Council it would reduce several of its contracts by millions of dollars.
The “back-of-the-budget cut” mandated by the Legislature gave officials within the department the latitude to decide where operational cuts would be made.
On Wednesday, Health and Human Services Commissioner Lori Weaver received approval from the Executive Council to move forward with shrinking seven contracts in the first round of cuts.

The department is reducing its contract with NFI North in Contoocook, which provides mental health services to New Hampshire residents with serious or persistent mental illness, by $1 million from roughly $20.9 million to $19.9 million. NFI North will eliminate one personal care assistant, one licensed nursing aide, and two registered nurses from its staff as part of this contract amendment.
The department is also reducing its contract with Community Action Partnership of Strafford County, Granite VNA in Conway and Laconia, the Family Resource Center in Gorham, Waypoint in Manchester, TLC Family Resource Center in Claremont, and VNA at HCS in Keene by $2 million, collectively. The organizations provide home visits from nurses to pregnant women and families with young children that may be at risk for domestic abuse or other harms.
Relatedly, the department is cutting its contracts with Waypoint in Manchester and the Family Resource Center in Gorham by a combined $575,000. The contracts are meant to support programs attempting to intervene and assist families at risk of state intervention (via the Division for Children, Youth, and Families, New Hampshire’s child protective services agency) to prevent that outcome.
It also cut its contract with the University of New Hampshire to provide training for DCYF employees by $575,000.
It is also reducing its contract with Tri-County Community Action Program, which runs a cold-weather homeless shelter in Berlin using state funds, by $100,000. Health and Human Services reported that the organization plans to deal with this cut by centralizing its cold-weather shelter into its other emergency shelter and having one employee manage them both.
It also cut $80,000 from Granite Pathways’ Strength to Succeed program, a substance use disorder program in Manchester.
Finally, the department has also reduced the number of services it’s purchasing from the Tilton-based dentist who treats residents at the Sununu Youth Services Center, a juvenile detention facility in Manchester, by $24,000 over the months since the cut was implemented.

The first round of cuts add up to roughly $4.3 million. Several more rounds will be necessary for the department to meet its mandate of $51 million.
Weaver told councilors all of the contracts were underutilized. She said the state had used fewer services than were included in the contracts and that the reductions placed the department in line with the number of services the vendors actually provided. She said no families would lose services.
“We’ll still continue to serve families,” Weaver said during the meeting. “We just can’t expand beyond and keep going. We’re going to have a limit with how far we can go, but no existing family would be getting any cuts.”
Weaver declined to elaborate immediately after the meeting and did not respond to emailed questions.
“I certainly appreciate the difficult circumstances that you are in of having to make major cuts to programs and that you’re doing it in a very mindful and thoughtful way to mitigate as much harm as possible,” Executive Councilor Karen Liot Hill, the council’s sole Democrat, said during the meeting. “But at some point, people are going to be harmed by these budget cuts.”
Gov. Kelly Ayotte, however, refuted that, pointing to Weaver’s testimony: “I think I just heard that no family is going to be harmed here or not served.”
Left-leaning advocacy groups in New Hampshire were quick to condemn the cuts.
“Instead of lowering costs, New Hampshire conservatives want to take dental care away from kids and let people in Grafton and Coos Counties freeze to death,” Lucas Meyer, founder of Our Economy Our Future, said in a statement arguing the cuts were meant to create space in the budget for recent tax cuts. “Instead of representing working families, they’re prioritizing tax cuts to a handful of out-of-state corporate CEOs who back their campaigns, rig the economy, and drive up property taxes for the rest of us.”
Christina Warriner Hamilton, New Hampshire state director for Reproductive Equity Now, said in a statement that the cuts “would be devastating for New Hampshire families” and “undo bipartisan progress and deny families the care they deserve.”",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/weaverexeccoun-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-12-18 12:57:49.530440

We are creatures of memory and perception, a Frankenstein’s monster of scar tissue and wounds that won’t heal, who may strive toward altruism but remain earthly chained by desires defined, mostly, by experience. 
Community has long been a defense against pure self interest, but the walls are crumbling.
Individual disconnection enables large cruelties — and this country is more disconnected than it is divided. In such a place, there is nothing small about small kindnesses. Each is an act of rebellion against the prevailing cold. Not every rebel is a saint, but there has never been a saint who wasn’t first a rebel.
There are countless state and national policies in action whose feasibility relies on widespread public disconnection. The brutal immigrant detention and deportation program is the most obvious, where migrants are narratively stripped of their humanity so politicians can sell clear barbarism as statecraft. Anti-transgender legislation functions in the same way. Too much would be revealed if a lawmaker cited “a hatred born of disconnection” as the reason to persecute transgender people through statute, so the politicians instead construct an illusory identity as a protector of girls and women. 
These are the lazy lies people embrace to absolve themselves of culpability in large cruelties, and it is a political epidemic. Even community issues that should be resistant to polarization, like the clear public good of public education, are susceptible to the politics of disconnection. 
I don’t have any issues at all with the parents of the roughly 10,500 New Hampshire students now benefitting from the state’s education freedom accounts program. If a voucher means the difference between struggling and thriving for even one family, I’m grateful EFAs exist. Less suffering is always better.
My contradiction is this: The architecture of the program seems to be bad for New Hampshire in every other way.
In a draft report issued this week by the Republican-majority Education Freedom Savings Account Oversight Committee, after a year of not meeting, the authors said: “After five years of growth and success, it is obvious that opponents of school choice will never accept the value of giving New Hampshire parents discretion to use state education funds in the manner they believe would best benefit their children.”
But it’s the disconnection at the heart of the voucher program that I can’t accept.
First, while many of the families currently benefiting from EFAs may now be content, that’s not the case for most of the politicians championing the program. I’m not sure what a fully built-out voucher system is supposed to look like, but I imagine something of a splintering of public education followed by major corporate consolidation of the fragments. And that’s really easy to imagine, too, because it’s what always happens. It’s also a big part of why, as The Guardian reported last week, we live in a world where “fewer than 60,000 people — 0.001% of the world’s population — control three times as much wealth as the entire bottom half of humanity.” This movie plays on a loop.
Second, the EFA program does nothing (despite EFA supporters’ fantastical math) to address the fundamental problem — overreliance on local property taxes to pay for public education.
Third, the very existence of the voucher program means New Hampshire no longer views public education as a core public responsibility. If you tell families the money paid into an education fund for all kids actually belongs to them, how does that strengthen the bonds of community? How does the EFA program build on the idea of a shared responsibility, whether you have school-age children or not, to educate the next generation? Well, it doesn’t. It just promotes self interest and furthers disconnection.
Perhaps worst of all, voucher proponents often employ the same tactics that are used to sway public opinion against immigrants and transgender people. It’s not enough to advocate for what they call school choice, they must simultaneously trash public schools and the people who work in them as if they were an outside threat. As if the schools weren’t built by us, for us. 
What young person coming of age in this environment would choose to become a teacher amid the harassment whipped up by lawmakers who are incapable of looking beyond their immediate desire to dismantle public education? That is how shortsighted spin creates lasting harm.
I don’t expect an end any time soon to large cruelties or the politics of disconnection that enable them. Nothing is easier for a politician than pitting “us” against “other,” and ease alone explains the prevalence of the technique.
The American people can, however, become more alert to the many ways policy contributes to disconnection, in all its forms, while at the same time committing fully to the reign of small kindnesses.

(Photo by Casey Smith/Indiana Capital Chronicle)The Indiana State Ethics Commission on Thursday approved a settlement requiring former Public Safety Secretary Jennifer-Ruth Green to pay a $10,000 civil fine, closing the ethics case against her — but potential criminal charges remain under review by the Marion County Prosecutor’s Office.
The bipartisan, five-member commission voted unanimously to accept the agreement during its public meeting, adopting findings that Green violated Indiana’s political activity and misuse of state property rules. 
Approval of the settlement ends the ethics commission’s jurisdiction over the case.

But officials confirmed during Thursday’s meeting that the Indiana Office of Inspector General has already referred the matter for criminal review, and that process remains ongoing.
Elaine Vullmahn, chief counsel for enforcement at the inspector general’s office, pointed commissioners to a section within Indiana Code that mandates the OIG to forward evidence of potential criminal activity to the appropriate prosecuting attorney.
Findings in Green’s case were sent to the Marion County Prosecutor’s Office for grand jury screening on Oct. 30.
Vullmahn said the referral included investigative records concerning potential violations of Indiana’s statutes related to ghost employment, retaliation and official misconduct, adding that the prosecutor’s office “will be reviewing the investigative materials and render a decision at the conclusion of their review.”
It remains unclear if or when Green — who is also an Indiana congressional candidate — could face criminal charges, however. The Marion County Prosecutor’s Office did not immediately respond to the Indiana Capital Chronicle’s request for comment Thursday.
Green’s attorney, Jennifer Lukemeyer, declined to comment on possible criminal charges but said after the meeting that the commission’s decision “is a total victory for Jennifer-Ruth Green.”
Green’s congressional campaign echoed that characterization in a lengthy statement released after the meeting, calling the settlement a “major legal victory” and sharply criticizing the OIG.
The Committee to Elect Jennifer-Ruth Green said the inspector general “attempted to throw the kitchen sink at her based on a politically motivated sham of an investigation,” and alleged the office “completely caved for a settlement to save face with the ethics commission.”
Details from the ethics settlement
Green admitted in the settlement that she violated Indiana’s political activity rule when she had state employees generate content and proofread posts for her “Elect Jennifer-Ruth Green” Facebook account.
She also admitted to violating the misuse of state property rule by using — and directing a state employee to use — her assigned state vehicle, a 2024 Chevrolet Suburban, for personal tasks.

With approval of the agreement, Green waived her right to a public hearing.
The former state official is required to pay the $10,000 fine within 60 days of the commission’s approval. But the settlement explicitly bars the commission from imposing any additional sanctions.
Under the state ethics law, commissioners could have imposed a higher penalty, like more serious fines or a ban on future state employment.
Vullmahn told commissioners that state law allows fines of up to three times the benefit received for ethics violations. Investigators calculated that state employees spent time worth about $1,300 creating and posting political content for Green, and that she logged roughly 7,000 personal miles on her state-issued vehicle — a combined benefit of about $5,000.
“The $10,000 fine represents approximately two times the total personal benefit received,” Vullmahn said, calling it “a fair, appropriate and proportionate response.”
One commissioner asked whether the inspector general considered barring Green from future state employment as part of the settlement.
Vullmahn said that option was considered but deemed unlikely to be relevant, given that Green had been an appointed official and that “any basic background check would find this information.”
Green absent from ethics meeting
Green abruptly resigned from her cabinet post in early September, but the inspector general had been investigating her conduct months earlier, including concerns about her use of state employees and state property for political and personal purposes.
A remediation agreement signed earlier in the summer — and later obtained by the Capital Chronicle — showed state officials had attempted to address those concerns internally before Green ultimately stepped down.
The document outlined allegations that Green directed state employees to draft and edit political content during work hours; used a state-issued vehicle for personal and political travel; and held campaign-related meetings in state facilities.
It also raised concerns about possible retaliation against employees who cooperated with the inspector general’s investigation, warning that substantiated violations could result in further discipline, including termination.
Story continues below.
JRG Settlement
 
The remediation agreement warned that if additional violations were substantiated, Green could face further discipline, including termination.
The inspector general filed a formal ethics complaint after Green’s resignation and originally alleged additional violations, including retaliation against an individual who provided information to investigators. Under the settlement, though, Green admitted to only two of the four alleged ethics violations.
Vullmahn cited aggravating factors considered by the OIG, including Green’s senior leadership role, the pattern and duration of her misconduct and the impact on public trust.
“As secretary of public safety … Green held one of the highest leadership roles in state government,” she said. “These positions carried significant responsibility overseeing the agencies tasked with law enforcement, emergency response and safety policy for Indiana families.”
Vullmahn said the inspector general weighed mitigating factors, too, including Green’s cooperation with investigators, acceptance of responsibility and her voluntary resignation.
Green was not present at Thursday’s meeting, but Lukemeyer, her attorney, told commissioners that further review of evidence revealed “evidentiary challenges” to portions of the original complaint and said the settlement reflected that reassessment.
Green also submitted a personal statement to the commission, which Lukemeyer read aloud.
“As a leader, I know that I am responsible for what happens within the domain over which I led,” Green’s statement said. “The violations of the ethics code are aberrant behavior for me. The violations were mistakes … not made with any malicious intent or for gain.”










The violations were mistakes … not made with any malicious intent or for gain.


– Former Indiana Public Safety Secretary Jennifer-Ruth Green


In its post-meeting statement, Green’s campaign said her legal team presented “affidavits, recordings, text messages, emails, and phone records” that it said undermined the inspector general’s allegations and prompted the move to settle.
The campaign described the admitted violations as “minor” and said Green’s use of her personal Facebook page and the state vehicle had been “explicitly approved” by her government attorney. Green’s campaign said the OIG “never bothered” to interview that attorney “during its sham investigation.”
The statement further accused the inspector general of attempting to “smear” Green — portraying her as “immoral,” “deviant,” and as a criminal — and framed the investigation as politically motivated.
“Jennifer-Ruth accepted this settlement and responsibility for minor violations because she has integrity, and she recognized that justice and fairness were unlikely in an environment where pursuing full vindication would require a prolonged legal battle costing hundreds of thousands of dollars, against vindictive actors wielding unlimited taxpayer-funded resources to attack her reputation, character, and career,” the statement said. “She walks away with her integrity fully intact and immense pride in the work she performed across Indiana alongside dedicated public servants.”
“The people of Indiana now face a clear choice: believe a decorated combat veteran who has devoted her life to service or believe political hacks and faceless bureaucrats motivated by petty grievances and personal career advancement,” the statement continued. “This episode should serve as a warning to every Hoosier. If powerful government actors are willing to weaponize the state of Indiana against Jennifer-Ruth Green — just as the federal government was weaponized against President Trump — they are more than capable of doing the same if they seek to destroy you.”
Green’s resignation marked the first departure of a cabinet-level official in Gov. Mike Braun’s administration.
Following her appointment in January, Green’s responsibilities included oversight of the Indiana Department of Homeland Security, the Department of Correction, the Criminal Justice Institute and the Parole Board.
Despite the pending ethics charges, Green announced in October that she will run again for Indiana’s 1st Congressional District. She first challenged Democratic U.S. Rep. Frank Mrvan in 2022 but was defeated.

After Beacon, a chain of hospitals based out of northern Indiana, bought four Ascension Borgess hospitals in southwest Michigan in July, nurses at Beacon Kalamazoo hospital say that the new health insurance offered to them is not meeting their needs. 
“Beacon has really let us down with the ability to care for ourselves as nurses,” said Lori Batzloff, the president of the local nurses union. 
There are three major issues at hand, Batzloff explained — an end to Medigap insurance reimbursements for retired nurses, an end to short-term disability insurance and limited in-network health care providers in the Kalamazoo area. 
Medigap insurance is private health care that Medicare recipients can buy to supplement the gaps in that Medicare insurance — and up until August, the cost of that supplemental insurance was covered by Ascension for retired nurses. 
Linn Crutcher is one of those nurses, having worked at Ascension Borgess for 38 years until she retired in 2016. 
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
When she received a letter in August saying that Ascension was ending its Medigap coverage, she assumed that Beacon was assuming that responsibility — until a few weeks ago, when she received a message from a colleague that Beacon would not be reimbursing for Medigap. 
“It was just a punch in the gut that I was not expecting at all,” she said. 
Without that reimbursement, and as the premiums for her Medigap insurance itself are increasing, Crutcher will have to pay around $2,700 annually out of pocket to have adequate health care.
“That will be a liability for me, and that, by coincidence, is almost exactly what I receive in a social security check, every month,” she said. “So in reality, I will be missing one social security check every year. One entire social security check will go to pay for my Medigap insurance. That’s not manageable for me.”
Heidi Prescott, a spokesperson for Beacon Health System, wrote in a statement that Beacon did not assume Medigap reimbursement benefits as a part of the acquisition of the hospital. 
“Former Ascension associates who previously received Medigap reimbursement benefits have been directed to contact Ascension,” Beacon’s statement read. “Under the terms of the agreement executed at closing in July 2025, all obligations related to Medigap remained with Ascension.”
Ascension did not respond to requests for comment. 
Beacon added, “We recognize and appreciate the decades of service provided by our retired nurses, understand the concerns raised in recent reports and acknowledge that after an acquisition, benefit transitions can be difficult to navigate.”
But Crutcher is not convinced. 
“Corporations are treating nurses as a liability. We’re an expense to them,” she said. “Of course, they couldn’t survive without us.”
The issues with health care under Beacon are not limited to retired nurses, Batzloff said. 
Losing short-term disability insurance, she said, would cost her over $200 per month if she were to pay for it herself.
And beyond the loss of short-term disability insurance, “the actual health care coverage itself is woefully inadequate, especially among dental providers,” she said. 
Emily Fredericksen, who has worked as a nurse at the hospital for 27 years, explained that for her whole family, limited coverage had been a repeated issue, but especially for her 20 year-old son. He has gone through serious bouts of mental health issues, but has a long-standing history with his current therapist and has improved significantly. 
But that therapist does not participate in the new insurance under Beacon. “We’ve been paying out of pocket, which is to the tune of about $200 for a visit,” Fredericksen said. 
And when he needed an emergency root canal in August, Fredericksen had to pay $600 just to get in the door at an endodontist, because the only in-network provider in the area had limited hours.
“This was something I expressed, being very frustrated with Beacon’s HR, because she argued with me and said that this was restorative care,” she said. “I am a former critical care nurse, and I know how bad dental infections can go very quickly.”
“While I am lucky enough to work part time in my role, and I’m married and I have another income that comes in, not everybody can afford $600 out of pocket to be seen,” she continued. “And what happens then is people don’t go to the doctor, and then things get bad.”
Batzloff said that she believes the root of the problem is that the new health insurance provider — part of the Aetna network — is based out of Indiana, which is also Beacon’s home. 
“So they think this is a great plan, and it probably is, if you live in that area and you have multiple in-network providers to choose from,” she said. “The problem is Beacon bought facilities far north of Indiana, here in Kalamazoo County and the surrounding areas.”
Batzloff added that nurses in the union reached out to Beacon to discuss changing health care coverage prior to the sale, but that the hospital failed to meet with them. 
“We’re getting to the final straw. To be honest, we feel we’ve been very patient. We repeatedly asked for discussions prior to the purchase of the hospital last July,” she said. “And I feel like Beacon could have gotten in front of this before it became this big mess.”
“I hope that they’re listening,” Fredericksen said. “I hope that they understand the hardships of not giving quality health care to your employees that are in the health care industry.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_2385-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-12-18 12:57:49.530440

(Photo by Markus Schmidt/Virginia Mercury)Less than a month before she takes the oath of office, Gov.-elect Abigail Spanberger on Thursday rolled out a comprehensive legislative blueprint she said will lower costs for Virginia families — from prescription drugs to utility bills to housing — in a session she framed as a turning point for the commonwealth’s economic health.
Spanberger’s Affordable Virginia Agenda, announced one day after outgoing Gov. Glenn Youngkin introduced his final biennial budget proposal to the General Assembly, outlines a suite of legislative proposals aimed at reducing consumer costs across three major categories: health care, energy and housing.

The plan comes against a backdrop of rising living expenses that many voters cited as their top concern during the 2025 elections, when Democrats swept all statewide races and increased their majority in the House of Delegates by 13 seats.
“Today, I am proud to unveil the beginning, the first step of these efforts, our agenda, to build a more affordable Virginia,” Spanberger said at a news conference in the state Capitol. “We cannot accept the status quo when it comes to the high cost of living. It is hurting the financial security of our economy, our communities, and our neighbors.” 
Spanberger — the first woman to be elected governor in Virginia — rallied Democratic leaders behind her push but emphasized her willingness to work with Republicans where possible. 
She said affordability is not merely a household concern but “essential” to Virginia’s economic competitiveness, a message she says resonated with voters from the Eastern Shore to Southwest Virginia.
 Health care: scrubbing costs, curbing middlemen

At the heart of Spanberger’s agenda is a multifaceted health care package designed to tackle out-of-pocket costs and limit insurance practices she says have siphoned money from patients and providers. Much of her plan echoes the health care priorities she outlined on the campaign trail earlier this year.

A centerpiece of the plan would restrict the role of pharmacy benefit managers, or PBMs, which Spanberger’s plan describes as predatory middlemen that can inflate drug prices. A bill that created a sole PBM for the state’s Medicaid program was signed into law by Youngkin in May, setting the stage for further reforms in the coming legislative session. 
The proposed 2026 bill would prevent PBMs from steering patients to affiliated pharmacies, require that drug rebates be passed through to health plans or patients, ban misleading statements, prohibit retroactive payment clawbacks and establish reimbursement standards for independent and community pharmacies.
“No Virginian should have to choose between paying their healthcare and putting food on the table,” Spanberger said, emphasizing the need to hold PBMs accountable for driving up drug costs.

Another proposal would limit prior authorization requirements, which often require insurer approval before patients receive medications or treatments. Spanberger argued that excessive prior authorizations delay care, can lead to complications and ultimately raise costs for patients and the system alike.
House Majority Leader Charniele Herring, D-Alexandria, said Spanberger’s health care proposals address real problems that families hear about every day.
“We need common sense answers to real issues of affordability that these families hear in the commonwealth,” Herring said. She cited lowering prescription drug costs, reforming prior authorization processes and expanding access to health care as critical steps forward. “It’s a brand new day for the commonwealth,” she added.
Spanberger’s agenda also calls for investing in the health care workforce, including a proposal to transfer management of health incentive programs from the Virginia Department of Health to the Virginia Health Workforce Development Authority, which she says will help ensure patients have access to both routine and complex care.
In addition, her plan would stabilize the Affordable Care Act marketplace through targeted premium assistance, establishing a pilot program for individuals most likely to drop coverage due to federal premium increases — a concern echoed by health policy analysts across the country. 
Another measure, House Bill 1639, sponsored by Del. Patrick Hope, D-Arlington, earlier this year but vetoed by Youngkin, would remove the sunset on a law banning extra insurance premium charges for tobacco users.
Senate Democratic Caucus Chair Mamie Locke, D-Hampton, said rising costs have forced difficult decisions for many families this holiday season, including choosing between heat and housing or prescriptions and groceries. 
Locke said the time for posturing is over.  ”Gov.-elect Spanberger is ready to govern, and so are we,” she said. “The people are watching, and they are counting on us to deliver.”
 Energy: efficiency, forecasting and storage

Spanberger also made stabilizing energy costs a priority, highlighting widespread concerns about utility bills in the midst of growing peak demand driven in part by data centers and other high-load infrastructure across the state.
Starting in January, she said, lawmakers will pursue expanded energy storage to help lower peak power prices by allowing stored energy to be used during periods of high demand. A revived 2025 proposal would raise energy storage capacity targets for Dominion Energy and Appalachian Power subject to approval by the State Corporation Commission.
“We will make expanded energy storage a top priority,” Spanberger said, “and we will improve energy efficiency across our commonwealth.”
The agenda also calls for expanding programs to reduce heating and energy costs for low-income Virginians and establishing a weatherization and energy efficiency task force within the Department of Housing and Community Development.

Small solar systems, such as balcony-mounted panels, would be exempted from typical utility approval requirements under her plan, facilitating wider adoption.
The agenda further advocates for improving utility demand forecasting to avoid overestimations that can lead to unnecessary infrastructure investments and higher rates for consumers.
Herring praised the plan’s emphasis on solar and renewable energy, saying it reflects a commitment to using technology to reduce costs and ensure a strong, resilient grid.
 Housing: boosting supply, strengthening protections

Addressing the ongoing housing affordability crisis, Spanberger further seeks a combination of tenant protections and measures to expand the supply of affordable housing across the commonwealth.
Her proposals include extending the grace period before landlords can file eviction proceedings, authorizing localities to adopt affordable housing dwelling unit programs and giving local governments a right of first refusal to preserve existing affordable housing stock.
Spanberger’s plan also calls for creating a revolving loan fund for mixed-income developments, expanding the Virginia Eviction Reduction Program, and using the commonwealth’s bonding authority to support affordable housing projects.
“It doesn’t matter, either in Northern Virginia or Southside Virginia,” Spanberger said, “starting in January, we will give every locality the option to increase the supply of affordable housing in their community.”
 Balancing affordability and fiscal stability

When Youngkin delivered his budget proposal Wednesday, he stressed a thriving economy and cautioned against policies he said could jeopardize Virginia’s business environment. The outgoing governor’s plan continues tax cuts and boosts spending on education, public safety, and Medicaid, though analysts have noted potential strains ahead due to federal shifts and slower revenue growth.
While Youngkin’s budget warns of anti-business policies, Spanberger underscored concerns about rising costs for families and the need to safeguard Virginia’s fiscal health.
She reiterated her support for maintaining the state’s AAA bond rating and fulfilling the constitutional requirement to balance the budget. Spanberger acknowledged that growth projections for the coming years are weaker than in the recent past and that lawmakers must navigate “real fiscal challenges” in crafting the next biennial budget.
“That is why many of these efforts to lower costs for Virginians either don’t utilize general fund dollars or are cost-neutral,” she said, noting that her team hopes to plan for worse economic scenarios than might materialize.
Spanberger’s pitch drew broad support from Democratic legislative leaders, who characterized the agenda as a direct response to voter concerns about everyday costs — and a mandate to act. 
House Speaker Don Scott, D-Portsmouth, said voters didn’t send Democrats to Richmond to admire architecture but to deliver results.
“They sent us here to do a job, they want us to lower costs,” Scott said, taking aim at federal economic policies and asserting that Spanberger’s focus aligns with constituent priorities.
Senate President Pro Tempore Louise Lucas, D-Portsmouth, emphasized fiscal responsibility and stability, noting that Senate budget negotiators strive to protect taxpayers while investing in communities and ensuring prosperity.
Spanberger said her agenda represents a starting point from which lawmakers and stakeholders will build over the coming legislative session. She also expressed optimism about bipartisan cooperation, saying conversations with House and Senate leaders indicate a shared willingness to act on affordability.
“We will work to make everyday life more affordable for Virginians,” she said.

(Kansas Reflector screen capture of Prairie Band Potawatomi Nation YouTube channel)TOPEKA — A Kansas tribe terminated its involvement in a federal contract to design large-scale migrant detention centers, a tribal leader announced Wednesday.
In a recorded address, chairman of the Prairie Band Potawatomi Nation Tribal Council Joseph Rupnick said the Nation and its subsidiaries have fully separated from a contract with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. 
The contract was a source of scrutiny for the tribe, and Rupnick’s announcement came less than a week after he expressed his heartbreak, drawing parallels between immigrant detention and America’s history of forced removal of Native Americans. Some members of the Tribe’s leadership were part of the company that contracted with ICE, KBP Services, and were subsequently fired for their involvement. The company was a subsidiary of the tribe’s business arm, Prairie Band LLC. 
“I’m very happy to share that our Nation has successfully exited all third-party related interests affiliated with ICE,” Rupnick said in the address. “As a result, Prairie Band, LLC is no longer a direct or indirect owner or participant in, or otherwise affiliated with, any ICE-related projects, contracts or operations.”
A spokesperson for the Tribe did not immediately respond to questions from Kansas Reflector.
A federal database showed the $30 million contract between the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and KPB Services, an affiliate of the tribe, was still active as of Thursday morning.

(Photo by Brooklyn Draisey/Iowa Capital Dispatch)Des Moines University is gearing up to offer residency programming in partnership with area hospitals and clinics, having received initial approval from the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education to become a “sponsoring institution.”
The private medical university announced this month it is developing its first residency program, which it hopes to launch in 2027, said Jennifer Beaty, DMU associate dean for graduate medical education. The one-year program will be housed at the university’s osteopathic manual medicine clinic and focus on osteopathic neuromusculoskeletal medicine, with just one or two residents to start.
While the majority of the program can be handled on campus or at its clinics, Beaty said there are hospital medicine components that a partnership is required to fulfill.

“Des Moines University doesn’t have a hospital. We aren’t capable of starting our own program completely independently,” Beaty said. “We need to partner with hospital systems and clinics around the state so that we can help provide, with our partners, excellent educational experience and residency programs.”
As an “osteopathic medical institution” teaching “osteopathic principles,” Beaty said this area of study was a good choice for the university’s first program. DMU is currently in the process of applying to sponsor this specific program, as earning the “sponsoring institution” title was just the first step. In order to qualify for the residency, students will need to have already completed a primary care residency.
While the residency will allow DMU graduates and those from other medical universities to apply for the program, Beaty said DMU’s expansion of offerings will help those at the university who are worried about where they’ll have to go to complete their education and training. This could also help keep students in the state for longer, furthering the chances of them staying permanently.
David Connett, dean of the DMU college of osteopathic medicine, said in a news release this step will lead to the university “strengthening the state’s physician workforce while expanding high-quality clinical training opportunities for our students.”
“This designation will enable DMU to develop innovative, mission-aligned GME programs within our own clinical system and in partnership with hospitals and community sites statewide,” Connett said in the release. “Ultimately, it allows us to help meet Iowa’s growing need for physicians, retain more of our graduates locally, and ensure patients throughout the state benefit from exceptional, osteopathically-informed medical education and care.”
DMU is currently in the process of engaging with Iowa health systems and clinics to identify potential partnerships, Beaty said, with a focus on rural areas for future programs.
Beaty said developing residency programs with partners across the state was Connett’s vision, one he brought with him and started working on as soon as he joined the university 18 months ago.
State attention on medical education has been high, Beaty said, with Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds signing into law proposals to expand rural access to medical care and physician training programs. The state of Iowa graduates more medical students annually than there are residency positions available, and DMU wants to ensure it is entering smart partnerships to create high-quality programs.
“We don’t want to just open a program to open a program and say we did it. We want to make sure the need is truly there,” Beaty said. “We believe it is, but we want to make sure it’s truly there, and that the support in the communities it’s going to take place in is strong, so that the program can be successful.”

The three-year contract was ratified by an overwhelming vote of 483-3, according to a news release from the university system Wednesday. It comes after roughly 900 part-time graduate student workers began bargaining with the university in 2023. The contract includes pay increases, tuition discounts and insurance benefits for the students, most of whom are research and teaching assistants at UMaine. 
“When weeks dragged into months and then into years, there were those who doubted they could do it, but they proved that workers can wield tremendous power when they band together in a union and refuse to give up the fight for fair wages, quality health care and a collective voice in the workplace,” said Maine AFL-CIO President Cynthia Phinney, in a statement.
UMaine grad students hoping to secure higher pay, more transparency in first contract

Workers from several industries have rallied around the student union, which is affiliated with the United Auto Workers. In August, a paper worker, an ironworker and a nurse spoke out in support of finalizing a contract for the graduate workers at a rally in Orono.
The system’s board of trustees is expected to give final approval of the contact at its Jan. 26 meeting in Orono. It would take effect immediately after that vote; however, pay and benefit provisions would start July 1, with the start of the next fiscal year. 
“This agreement achieves the right balance — recognizing that graduate student workers deserve fair compensation and working conditions that reflect their essential role in our education and research mission, while also upholding our responsibility to keep Maine’s public universities affordable for students and taxpayers,” said university Chancellor Dannel Malloy and President Joan Ferrini-Mundy in a joint statement. 
The new union contract provides a one-time $750 ratification bonus, as well as stipend increases of $3,000 to $5,000, along with guaranteed annual stipend increases. 
For example, master’s students covered by the union who work 20 hours per week will see their nine-month stipend increase from $17,000 to $21,000. Doctoral students will jump from $20,000 to $23,500.
Students will also be eligible for university-funded health insurance under the new agreement. UMaine will pay 65% of premium costs in the first two years of the contract and 85% in the third year. It will also pay 50% of the premium cost for dental insurance plans. 
The university system will also waive nine credit hours of tuition per fall and spring semester — which comes to more than $10,000 annually — for most graduate student-workers.",https://mainemorningstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_0808-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-12-18 10:58:12.698690

“The president is calling on our nation’s business leaders and philanthropic organizations to help us make America great again by securing the financial future of America’s children,” Bessent said in an address.
The billionaire hedge fund founder Ray Dalio, along with his wife Barbara, announced they would commit $250 to 300,000 children under 10 in Connecticut who live in ZIP codes where the median income is less than $150,000. Dalio founded the investment firm Bridgewater Associates and lives in Connecticut.
“I have been fortunate to live the American Dream. At an early age I was exposed to the stock market, and it changed my life,” Ray Dalio said in a statement, adding that he sees the accounts as putting children on a path toward financial independence.
The Dalios commitment, which will total at least $75 million, follows the $6.25 billion pledge from billionaires Michael and Susan Dell earlier in December. The Dells promised to invest $250 in the accounts of 25 million children 10 and under who live in ZIP codes across the country that also have that median income.
The new investment accounts were created as part of President Donald Trump’s tax and spending legislation, passed over the summer. Under the new law, the U.S. Department of the Treasury will deposit $1,000 into the investment accounts of children born during Trump’s second term.
The Treasury has not yet launched the new accounts.
“Starting on July 4th, our nation’s 250th anniversary, parents, family members, employers and friends will be able to contribute up to $5,000 to each Trump Account each year,” Bessent said Wednesday.
Brad Gerstner, a venture capitalist, who championed the accounts, said the Treasury will create an account for every child in the U.S. who has a Social Security number but private companies will eventually administer the accounts. Parents or guardians will have to claim the accounts on behalf of their children. For children born before Trump came to office and who don’t qualify for the funds from the Dells and the Dalios, their families can open and fund their own Trump Account if they choose.

Money in the accounts must be invested in an index fund that tracks the overall stock market. When the children turn 18, they can withdraw the funds to put toward their education, to buy a home or to start a business.
Bessent said employers, family members and philanthropists can put funds into the accounts and that the administration hopes states will also eventually set up programs to invest in the accounts. Companies including Visa and BlackRock have also pledged to contribute in some way to the accounts of their employees’ children.
Jane Waldfogel, a professor at the Columbia University School of Social Work, said ideally, governments would provide benefits that help families with children afford immediate expenses and programs like the Trump Accounts that help families save for a child’s future.
“The problem that many scholars have tried to address and many politicians have tried to address with these child savings accounts is that low-income families and even middle-income families struggle to put aside money and save money for their children’s future,” said Waldfogel, who recently published a book about child benefits.
Without regular government contributions targeted toward poorer families, Waldfogel does not expect the accounts to decrease economic inequality as affluent families will take advantage of them but other families will not.
Steven Durlauf, a professor at the University of Chicago’s Harris School of Public Policy, said he expects the accounts to make a very modest contribution toward the resources of young adults. His research has examined what factors impact the success of children and he said improving early childhood education and rectifying racial and economic segregation at schools and in neighborhoods would do more to give children the skills and opportunities they need to be productive.
Durlauf also said as much as the philanthropy of the affluent is admirable, he thinks it should remain out of politics and controversies.
“This is integrating the wealthy into the support of particular government programs that are associated with particular political figures,” he said. “And that strikes me as extraordinarily dangerous.”
The Dalios have granted tens of millions to Connecticut public schools over the years, though a $100 million initiative launched in 2019 that would have involved matching public funds fell apart after state lawmakers raised questions over transparency. Altogether, the Dalios say they’ve given $7 billion through their philanthropy, which has focused on education, support for economic advancement and ocean research and education.

The Missouri Department of Public Safety has been negotiating with Mighty Good Solutions DBA Stercus Bioanalytics, and the Missouri-based company is now the contractor on a $7 million statewide project.
The project is planned to test the wastewater of 12 schools around Missouri for drug use and was touted by Gov. Mike Kehoe in January.
“In an effort to identify areas of high fentanyl use in schools across the state, we are including $4 million in investment for fentanyl testing in wastewater systems at schools,” Kehoe said during his first State of the State address in January.
An additional $3 million was allocated to the project to fund wastewater testing involving law enforcement efforts. The project was then moved from the Missouri Department of Health and Human services to the Department of Public Safety, Mike O’Connell, public safety communications director, said in an email.
“I believe that at that point, the decision was made to move the whole program to DPS,” O’Connell said.
Last month, Missouri school superintendents received emails asking them to notify the agency if they are interested in enrolling in the wastewater test program, O’Connell said.
In the email sent to superintendents and obtained by the Missourian, the program is said to include ongoing weekly testing that will provide insights into short- and long-term trends.
“Through the collection of one small wastewater sample per week, schools will receive near real-time insights into local substance misuse trends at no cost and with no additional responsibilities for your staff,” said Mark James, director of the Department of Public Safety in the email.
The project dates are not yet set, but the email asks that superintendents request inclusion in the program by this week, adding that the data from the testing may be used to shape initiatives that attempt to counteract drug use.
Opioid overdose is the leading cause of death for those aged 18 to 44 in Missouri, according to the Health and Human Services website.
The project had received $2 million in funding from former Gov. Mike Parson in his 2025 budget. No wastewater testing in schools has taken place yet.
The company in charge of testing, Mighty Good Solutions, says on their website, “By analyzing wastewater for specific biomarkers, we provide governments with powerful tools to detect narcotics prevalence, understand usage patterns, and identify trends — all through anonymous, macro-level data.”
Plans for testing don’t give specific details on how the Department of Public Safety will use the data to help combat opioid usage. Other states have been in conversations with the same company, and Mississippi lawmakers are currently considering them for wastewater testing.

(Photo by Yereth Rosen/Alaska Beacon)The Covid-19 pandemic was an overwhelming event in Alaska, and a new state report describes how Indigenous residents, the elderly and Asian people and Pacific Islanders suffered the most as the state’s experience with the disease transitioned through different phases.
From the time the first Alaska case was detected on March 12, 2020, to the end of the declared public health emergency in May of 2023, there were seven distinct periods of the pandemic in the state, according to the report, which was released as a bulletin from the Alaska Division of Public Health’s epidemiology section.
State epidemiologists have classified the seven periods as eras, distinguished by different types of non-pharmaceutical interventions — defined as public health measures to limit the community spread, such as school closures – the availability of vaccines, the variants of the virus that dominated, the availability of antiviral medicines and other factors.
Of the seven eras, the most serious was the fourth, which was dominated by the Delta variant of the virus. That era started in July of 2021 and ran through the end of that year. During that period, 2,021 Alaskans were hospitalized with the disease and 719 died from it, according to the report. Nearly half of Alaska’s COVID-19 deaths occurred then and COVID-19 was the state’s leading cause of death during the period, the report said. Over that entire year, COVID-19 ranked as the third leading cause of death in Alaska, behind cancer and heart disease.
The Delta variant era also proved to be the most dangerous for younger Alaskans, with nearly two-thirds of the deaths among those under 55 years of age.
The Delta variant emerged after the start of vaccinations and Alaskans who had been fully vaccinated were better protected against the disease, the report said. Earlier research by state epidemiologists found that unvaccinated Alaskans with COVID-19 were 4.49 times more likely to die than were Alaskans who had received their full vaccine doses, as recommended by health officials.

	The second era, from June to December of 2020, ranked as the second most dangerous, with 968 hospitalization and 291 deaths. And two eras, spanning the period from January to October of 2022, were characterized by Omicron subvariants, and resulted in high case numbers but lower severity, with lower death rates and hospitalization rates.
Alaska Natives and American Indians consistently had the highest rates of death and hospitalization during the entire pandemic, reflecting some longstanding health disparities, the report said.
In some parts of rural Alaska, lack of adequate water and sanitation service was a key factor in those disparities, earlier research found.
There were some sharp geographic differences in vaccination patterns, the report showed. Vaccination rates were highest in Southeast Alaska, Anchorage and Southwest Alaska; they were lowest in the Matanuska-Susitna Borough and in the Gulf Coast region.
The epidemiologist team that compiled the report said there are lessons from Alaska’s COVID-19 experience that should be useful for the next pandemic.
The most important of those lessons, the team said in a written statement, “is that early, well-coordinated, and community-centered public health measures are crucial.”
That means ensuring that communities have timely access to prevention and response tools and that local leaders are involved in the effort, the statement said.
Another respiratory illness, though of a nature yet to be determined, is considered the likeliest cause of the next pandemic, the statement said.
“While it is impossible to predict the exact cause of a future pandemic, global health experts consistently point to respiratory viruses such as new influenza strains or emerging coronaviruses as the most likely sources, making continued readiness in this area especially important,” the statement said.
Although the public health emergency is over, COVID-19 has not disappeared. The virus continues to circulate in the population. In 2024, it was the cause of 58 Alaska deaths, according to state records.
Age-adjusted COVID-19 death rates among Alaska residents are broken down by race and pandemic era, from March 2020 to May 2023. Beyond the first era, when the virus was new to Alaska and case numbers, hospitalizations and deaths were few, Alaska Native and American Indians consistently had the highest mortality rates.

After moving to the nation’s fourth-largest city in 2021, Jackson native Elizabeth Evans said she’s had an easier time meeting new people because of Houston’s offerings – popular concert tours, Texans NFL games, fitness-driven outdoor functions, Jazzy Sundays in the park. Many of these new Houston friends hail from Jackson State University.

Evans, 33, is among the thousands of Jacksonians who have left home for other states. A majority of these expats from Hinds County, where Jackson is located, remained in the South – hundreds in Georgia, Tennessee and Louisiana in the last few years.
But from 2017 to 2022, the county saw a whopping 5,500 of its residents move to Texas, according to Internal Revenue Service data analyzed by researcher Jake McGraw at Rethink Mississippi.
“Dallas and Houston are the two biggest recipient locations of people moving out of Mississippi, but very few make the move back east from those places,” McGraw told Mississippi Today.
Evans had never lived outside Mississippi’s capital city, but she’d gotten a remote job in communications for a nonprofit organization and realized she could work from anywhere. 
“I’m a Southern girl to the core, and I didn’t want to immediately leave the South,” Evans said. 
Since 2020, Jackson’s population has declined 8%, by more than 12,000 people, according to the Census Bureau. To be sure, when people leave Hinds County, the two most common destinations are adjoining Madison and Rankin counties, McGraw said, but when they leave the state entirely, Texas is by far the most popular landing spot.
Though Texas is politically similar to Mississippi – Republican state leaders, a six-week abortion ban and growing anti-immigrant sentiment – Evans said she feels like the issues she cares about are amplified in Houston. She has found a community that believes in what she values, such as reproductive justice and voting access. Part of her political awareness began because she grew up in Jackson, a city that she said is plagued with issues of racial inequity and environmental challenges. 
“It’s easier to distract yourself from those things when you are in other places, but I think here (in Jackson), being so deeply connected to people and the landscape of the city, it will certainly radicalize you,” Evans said. 
More than 200 miles away in Dallas, another Jackson native is advancing in a marketing career. Bianca Tatum said Texas has offered her an opportunity to be ambitious with work that Mississippi didn’t. The Mississippi State University graduate lived in Illinois and Alabama before making the journey to Houston, then Dallas.
“Dallas and Houston, I feel like, are safe for Mississippians,” said Tatum, 32. “It’s not so far that you won’t know anybody or you’ll get a culture shock, because Houston and Dallas are a lot like Jackson.”
The similarities are simple – tight-knit neighborhoods, good food and a close circle of friends. But that wasn’t enough to offset the lack of recreation and low salaries for Tatum to justify staying in Mississippi. 
“I think they need to make it more desirable for young people to be there,” she said. “Give us more things to do. Give us more money.”
Tatum said moving around the country opened up her worldview. She’s proud of being from Mississippi, but she said the change of scenery pushed her out of her comfort zone. 
“I’m just grateful that I’ve had the opportunity to develop myself in other ways before taking the route of getting into a serious relationship or becoming a mom,” Tatum said. “I don’t think I would have had the opportunity to meet more of myself before making these big life decisions.” 
The issue of brain drain isn’t new for Jackson. Since the 1980s, when its population crested over 200,000, the number of residents has declined – sometimes slowly, sometimes rapidly. 
Jackson native Charles Miller moved back to his hometown with his wife after graduating law school in 1979. Even at the height of Jackson’s population, the capital city made them restless. They moved to Fort Worth, Texas, in 1982 after Miller found work as an in-house attorney for an energy company.
“I was frustrated,” said Miller, 71. “Everything seemed a little bit slower after my time at Vanderbilt and at Emory. My internal clock had changed. I wasn’t happy in Jackson.”
Since making the journey west, Miller has raised a family, taught business classes at a university and retired. For a brief period, he said he considered moving back to Mississippi. 
“I could not go back to Jackson now. I realized that about 15, 20 years ago,” Miller said. “I go back to visit, but for no other reason. Texas is where I am and who I am.”
Sondra Collins, senior economist with Mississippi’s University Research Center, said in order to combat brain drain, the state has to find ways to attract more young people and prioritize jobs that compensate employees fairly. Mississippi has fewer positions available for people with bachelor’s degrees, Collins said, which means some with a degree may end up taking a pay cut just to remain employed in the state.
“Having a population that doesn’t have as many people with bachelor’s degrees, even some skilled certificates, tends to mean that the jobs that are in the state are going to be jobs that are for people without a bachelor’s degree, without certificates, and those jobs tend to be lower-paid than jobs that require more,” Collins said. 
Data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics show the private average hourly income in Mississippi is $28.10, compared to $34.28 in Texas, which adds up to thousands of dollars per year in earned income potentially left on the table for those remaining in Mississippi 
Collins said while other states also experience brain drain, their populations are replaced by people moving in. For people looking for larger city life, Mississippi doesn’t get consideration.
“We have to land some of those young people from other states who are wanting to explore,” Collins said. “We want them to come explore here in Mississippi. That has to be a bit of a priority.”
Jackson native Adam Luckett moved to San Antonio right after he graduated from the University of Mississippi with his degree in chemical engineering. He and his wife Tera Eichelberger love their neighborhood and its offerings – authentic Hispanic and Asian food, and a diverse community. But they also miss the familiarity of Jackson.
“There was more of a community in Jackson,” Luckett, 31, said. “You feel a lot more connected to the people around you, even if you don’t know them, if it’s a smaller town.”
Eichelberger, 34, said in order to move back to Jackson, she’d like to see more jobs created in the tech field. The city would also need to invest in public transportation and infrastructure. Jackson has long struggled with its water system, from a city-wide outage due to a winter storm in 2021 that left residents without running water, to a federal receivership that led to the system being controlled by a private utility, JXN Water.
“The water situation is something you really can’t stress enough,” Eichelberger said. 
While they’ve grown in their careers since moving, they both agree they would be able to see themselves in Jackson long-term if there were opportunities to earn more money. 
“Your life isn’t going to magically get better because you move to a larger city,” Luckett said.

Since 2010, Mississippi has lost 80,000 more people than it has gained, according to the Census Bureau. Justin Ransburg, who went to college in Texas, is one Jackson native who made the decision to return home. What he anticipated to be a few-month stint ended up capturing his 20s.
“ I’ve always said that I wanted to move outside of Mississippi to see what else is out in the world,” Ransburg said. 
The visual artist and comics teacher attended Texas Southern University, a historically Black university in Houston. He’d only planned to return to Mississippi for six months after graduating in 2012, he said, but once he was home, he didn’t want to leave. He became a part of the local art scene and worked at various galleries. But most importantly to him, he was able to take part in his nieces’ and nephews’ lives.

“When I actually did come back, a lot of the things that I was looking for that I found in Houston, I found here in Mississippi,” Ransburg said. 
Ransburg said he was searching for more opportunities to create art, try out coffee shops and restaurants and attend events where he could meet like-minded creatives. He found that in the Fondren and Midtown districts, and at one point, he and a friend created a group called the Jackson Drawing Club.
“ I’ve been able to meet people that I wouldn’t have in Houston,” he said. “ As a person, it showed me things that I value more than I realize, and how to care for those things to make sure that they last a long time and also what to let go of.”

In 2022 Gov. Gavin Newsom floated a new concept to get seriously mentally ill individuals the help they need, and get them off the street. Many Californians, especially family members of people that need extra help, felt buoyed by this promise. 
Newsom’s idea became CARE Court, and it rolled out to a few counties at first, and the whole state by the end of 2024. CalMatters reporters Marisa Kendall, Jocelyn Wiener, Yue Stella Yu and Erica Yee spent much of the past year investigating how the program has done. 
While CARE Court has helped some people, many of the families and individuals interviewed for these four stories expressed frustration at the limits of the program versus what they felt was promised. 

Ronda Deplazes, a mother who is fighting for her son to be released from CARE Court: “We get so pumped up with hope. I think the frustration and disappointment is more than a person can bear. That’s the truth of it. That is the bottom line.”

A sales tax to prevent the next wildfire?

Could raising Los Angeles County’s sales tax help residents avoid the next great wildfire?
Two nonprofits are pushing that idea in a report released today detailing what policymakers, public agencies and other stakeholders could do to lessen wildfire risks and help communities still struggling after January’s L.A.-area wildfires.
One suggestion from Climate Resolve and Resilient Cities Catalyst is raising L.A. County’s 9.75% sales tax to create a “Los Angeles County Resilience District,” which would fund projects related to protecting residents from wildfires, earthquakes and other natural disasters. 

The report: “Preparedness saves money. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce reports that every dollar invested in disaster prevention saves $13 in avoided damages, cleanup, and lost economic activity. … A quarter-cent sales tax in Los Angeles County would yield $600 million per year, funding important mitigation measures.”

But raising taxes and creating the district would be a tall order, requiring approval from the state Legislature and voters through a 2028 ballot measure — an effort the nonprofits anticipate would cost about $5 million to carry out.



1 in 5 CA households food insecure, says PPIC

On Wednesday members of the state Assembly’s human services committee and a select Assembly committee on CalFresh and nutrition, convened in Alameda to discuss food insecurity and how recent federal action has affected food programs.
During the hearing, Tess Thorman, a researcher at the Public Policy Institute of California, gave testimony detailing the prevalence of food insecurity in the state and some of the challenges facing CalFresh, the state’s version of the federal SNAP food benefit program.
Using data from the annual U.S. Department of Agriculture’s food insecurity survey, PPIC determined that 23% of California households in 2023 experienced some type of food insecurity. Households with children, as well as Latino and Black households, were more likely to experience food insecurity.
Federal policy changes under President Donald Trump are also anticipated to worsen the situation: New work requirements for CalFresh enrollees could mean as many as 620,000 Californians losing benefits, according to Thorman. In September the USDA also said it would stop conducting the food insecurity survey, after a 30-year run, which would make it more difficult for policymakers to understand and combat hunger.

Most cities and towns, the state housing office regularly emphasizes, have gotten on board and submitted plans to zone for a district of multifamily housing near MBTA service areas, as called for in the 2021 law. But a group of holdouts is banking on the very court that declared the legislation mandatory  – and enforceable – in January to rule that the mandate is illegal without dedicated funding included in the law. 
Marshfield was one of a bundle of towns that wanted a Plymouth County Superior Court judge to declare they cannot be forced to rezone and bear the potential burden of more density. Lawmakers are not permitted to hand down “unfunded mandates” that create financial obligations on cities and towns without a way to pay for them. 
But Superior Court Judge Mark Gildea dismissed suits brought by Duxbury, Hanson, Holden, Marshfield, Middleton, Wenham, Weston, and Wrentham, plus taxpayers in Hamilton. Gildea said the towns’ anticipated possible costs were “indirect,” nonspecific, and therefore not in need of dedicated funding from the state. Beyond that, he wrote, there are already available grants for infrastructure needs and the process.   
Marshfield appealed to the Supreme Judicial Court, which agreed to take the case directly to consider the unfunded mandate question. The town argues that Gildea should not have agreed to dismiss the case, asserting that they did describe all the elements of an unfunded mandate in their complaint.  
“In addition to suffering a irreparable loss of awarded grant funds in enumerated grant programs, it is/was foreclosed from all other discretionary grant funds not mentioned in the statute,” the town argues in its brief. Plus, the town says, there were costs associated with evaluating and drafting the zoning bylaws and presenting them to the Town Meeting, and they expect to have additional costs based on the rezoning.   
The Healey administration has provided nearly $8 million worth of technical assistance and grants to more than 150 MBTA Communities to support the implementation of this law, the housing office said.   
“The MBTA Communities Act is one of many tools that Massachusetts is using to increase the production of reasonably-priced housing and lower costs for everyone,”  Executive Office of Housing and Livable Communities Secretary Ed Augustus said in a statement, noting that 6,000 new housing units are already in the pipeline in the communities. “We continue to work with the remaining communities to support them in passing zoning that meets their needs, as well as moving forward on many other initiatives to make housing more affordable,” he said.    
Marshfield is using the SJC’s own conclusion earlier this year as the basis for the town’s grievance. Writing for a unanimous court on a suit brought by Attorney General Andrea Campbell against the town of Milton, which was resisting compliance with the new statute, Chief Justice Kimberly Budd stated plainly that the MBTA Communities law is not a suggestion. 
Because the law itself says cities and towns “shall” zone for multifamily housing, “it is clear that the Legislature intended to require MBTA communities to comply with the act,” she wrote in a footnote. To enforce it, the court concluded, the attorney general’s office can wield the sweeping powers of her office and penalties for noncompliance are not limited to losing four state funding sources listed in the initial legislation. 
The high court spent much of its energy in oral arguments and its ruling on the consequences for recalcitrant municipalities, appearing piqued at some points that the cities or towns might simply decide to take a financial hit to avoid rezoning. 
“If we were to adopt the town’s interpretation, the only consequence to an MBTA community for failing to comply with the act would be the loss of certain funding opportunities,” Budd wrote in the Milton ruling. “Thus, those communities, like the town in this case, which choose to forgo the identified funding programs, would be free to ignore the legislative decision to require towns benefiting from MBTA services to permit their fair share of multifamily housing near their local MBTA stations and terminals.”  
This, she said, would “thwart the Legislature’s purpose by converting a legislative mandate into a matter of fiscal choice.” 
Either enthusiastically or through gritted teeth, 92 percent of all MBTA Communities have passed new zoning so far, according to the state housing office.  
Three communities facing a December 31 deadline have not yet adopted new zoning, and 10 municipalities did not meet a July deadline and have yet to adopt MBTA Communities zoning. Marshfield is not among them, having passed compliant zoning in October as a precaution. 
The housing office and Marshfield are scheduled to file additional briefs in January, and the court could hear the case as early as February. 
“We appreciate the 164 communities, including Marshfield, that have put zoning in place to comply with the law,” Campbell said in a statement, “and given the urgency of addressing the housing shortage, we look forward to the SJC taking up this most recent challenge early next year to clarify, once and for all, that every community must comply with the law.”",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Worcester_Housing_Triple_Three_Decker.png?fit=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-12-18 08:57:25.566536

Gavin Newsom's CARE Court changed the way California treats people with severe mental illness. We spoke with dozens of participants to learn how it's working.,"In summary
Gov. Gavin Newsom’s CARE Court changed the way California treats people with severe mental illness. We spoke with dozens of participants to learn how it’s working.


Gov. Gavin Newsom two years ago launched a new program called CARE Court that gave hope to families struggling with severe mental illness.
It promised to provide treatment and housing through court-supervised plans that would keep difficult-to-help individuals on track. 
We spent much of the past year talking with dozens of people who’ve interacted with CARE Court as participants, petitioners and as employees trying to fulfill the program’s goals.
Here’s a sampling of their experiences.

‘I felt so defeated’
Last summer, June Dudas was in church when she got a text message from her 84-year-old aunt: “He’s here.” 
Dudas called back, and, in a whisper, her aunt said she’d locked herself in the bathroom to hide from her son, Ed, who was outside her San Diego home. It was an all-too familiar situation. Over the years, Dudas had helped her aunt fortify her fence, install multiple security cameras and file restraining orders. It was an effort to protect her from a man who, when not gripped by psychosis, was a “gentle giant” who loved animals and made jewelry out of gemstones – but, when at the mercy of his delusions, could turn violent. 
This time, Dudas told her aunt, she had a new solution. She had just learned about CARE Court, which she’d heard could compel people into treatment. Dudas’ aunt quickly submitted a CARE Court petition on her son’s behalf. 
But when the CARE Court team offered Ed help, he refused, according to Dudas. Saying there was nothing more they could do, a judge dismissed his case.
“I felt so defeated for my cousin,” Dudas said. “It’s like, ‘OK, Eddy, they’re saying that when you’re well enough to understand how sick you are, then they’re ready to help you, but until then you’re on your own, buddy, and there’s nothing they’re going to do for you.’ And it just struck me as very callous.”
Dudas’ aunt tried again with a second petition in October. That one was dismissed as well. 
Now, Ed is in jail for violating his mother’s restraining order. Dudas worries that when he gets out, which likely will be early next year, her family will be back where they started: With her and her aunt living in fear, and Ed still not getting the help he needs.

‘Life’s treating me pretty good’
When outreach workers found J.M. in February, he was sleeping on some blankets under an awning in Oakland. He didn’t have a tent, despite the winter cold, and he couldn’t walk due to a foot injury. He wore multiple pairs of pants and socks in an effort to compress his foot and relieve the pain and swelling.
J.M., who had been homeless for several years, asked CalMatters to refer to him using his initials, to protect his privacy.
At first, the county sent J.M. to a psychiatric hospital on a temporary hold. He received treatment for his foot and for his mental health, but said it was frustrating to have no choice in the matter. He found the facility depressing and didn’t like the food.
When he was discharged, CARE Court got him a room in a hotel in downtown Oakland that was converted into temporary housing for clients who need mental health services. 
Now, J.M. regularly walks the half mile from the hotel to the waterfront at Jack London Square, where he sits and watches the water. 
He wants to go back to school and get his GED diploma. He dropped out of high school in ninth grade, and he’d like to find a tutor to help him with his reading, spelling and vocabulary – areas he’s always struggled with. He’s looking for work, and trying to quit smoking cigarettes.
“It’s been pretty good,” J.M. said. “Life’s treating me pretty good.”

‘They were so caring’
CARE Court has been a lifeline for 64-year-old Mary Peters of Riverside. Until then, Peters was navigating her younger sister’s mental illness all on her own. 
In addition to her sister, Peters was helping to take care of their father, who had dementia. Meanwhile, her sister bounced in and out of the hospital and homelessness. Sometimes, Peters didn’t know where she was or how to find her. Even if she suspected her sister was hospitalized, hospital staff often wouldn’t give her any information, citing patient privacy. 
Peters filed a CARE Court petition on her sister’s behalf in October 2023, and all of that changed. Suddenly, she had people to help her. The CARE Court team tracked down her sister when Peters’ couldn’t, and got her into a sober living facility. When her sister didn’t like that facility, they helped her move somewhere else, Peters said. 
“Without the CARE team, it would have been impossible for me to do this,” Peters said. “There were times when I wanted to give up. There were days when you just kind of throw your hands up, if someone is feeling so hopeless and you’re doing everything you can to try to help.”
Peters’ sister graduated from CARE Court earlier this year, in a small courtroom celebration with cupcakes. Now, she lives in her own apartment in Riverside.
Her sister still has her ups and downs, but she seems more clearheaded now, she reconnected with her two adult sons, and she feels less hopeless, Peters said. And she credits CARE Court.
“They were so patient,” Peters said. “They were so caring.”

‘My sister that I used to know …’
Antonio Hernandez first learned about CARE Court when he saw a flyer that his older sister brought home after being discharged from a treatment facility.
“I was so excited about this CARE Court,” he said. “Oh my gosh, that’s exactly what we need.”
His sister, who has schizophrenia, was stable then, taking medication and talking about getting a job. 
Hernandez filed a petition for his sister to enter CARE Court in Kern County. The county’s CARE Court process was rife with delays and extensions, her brother said. In the meantime, he said, his sister was left in limbo and began decompensating.
Eventually, she was evicted from a Bakersfield room and board and transferred to a sober living home, he said. Six months after he first petitioned, he said, his sister signed the CARE agreement. That same day, she was kicked out of the sober living facility, too.
She became homeless, camping in the park and talking to herself, he said. She stopped taking her medication.
“You have to be at your worst for them to help,” he said. “It kind of makes no sense. They expect you to be at your worst to be accepted. At the same time, they expect autonomy from patients to make their own decisions when they’re at their worst.”
He worries about the irreversible damage being done to his sister’s brain.
“My sister that I used to know, I’ll no longer get to have that sister anymore because of their failure, their negligence, and their inability to follow through with what the law states,” he said.

A life-changing program
C.M., 55, was on the verge of homelessness when CARE Court stepped in last January. 
In her 40s, she’d started experiencing bouts of psychosis when she was under extreme stress, with terrifying symptoms that included hearing cruel voices or feeling like her body was being shocked with electricity. 
In her 50s, she lost her construction management job because of one of those episodes, and struggled to pay the rent on her San Leandro apartment. Her disability benefits were about $1,600 a month, but her rent was $1,750. She drove for Lyft to try to close the gap, but then her Lyft app started glitching, she said. She knew she couldn’t pay her bills, and the stress sent her spiralling into another episode of psychosis. 
In January 2025, one of the EMTs on San Leandro’s mental health crisis response team saw that she needed help, and filed a CARE Court petition on her behalf.
Now, C.M. has her own room on the first floor of an old Victorian house in West Oakland, with a window overlooking a yard and a giant agave plant. She’s taped photos of her two adult sons as little boys to one of the walls, next to a printed-out list titled “coping skills.”
“I literally didn’t spend any time on the streets after I got evicted, because of CARE Court,” said C.M., who asked to be referred to by her initials out of fear that being associated with schizophrenia would hurt her chances of getting a job.
She can live there rent-free while her caseworkers help her find permanent housing. That stability is important for anyone, but it’s particularly life-changing for C.M., as financial stress and the fear of homelessness are psychological triggers that can launch her back into psychosis.
Now, C.M. is looking toward the future. She’s starting school for construction management next year, and hopes to find another job in the industry. But there’s some uncertainty there as well. C.M. is set to graduate from CARE Court in April, and as that date fast approaches, she’s still not sure where her next housing placement will be.

‘This is what families have to endure’
At first, Anita Fisher was an enthusiastic advocate for CARE Court. She met with Gov. Newsom to discuss it. She appeared on 60 Minutes talking about how the program was a promising tool to help people with serious mental illness.
At the time, her own son, who is diagnosed with schizophrenia, was doing well. 
Some of her last words in the 60 Minutes interview? 
“I hope he will never have to use it.”
Then her son stopped his medication and ended up in a mental health crisis.
Fisher’s petition for CARE Court in San Diego County was accepted. But, soon, her son was arrested. Then he was discharged to the streets. At one point, he went missing.
“Can you imagine having to wonder if your son is alive or dead for three weeks?” she said. “This is what families have to endure.”
Her son, who she describes as a sweet, docile man, had been an Army medic with an impeccable record until his illness popped up at the age of 21. Now he kept going to jail.
Two years after she first petitioned CARE Court to get him help, she has nothing positive to say about the program she once lauded.
“I look at it as a total failure,” she said.

(Joe Raedle/Newsmakers)A new report found that Alabama put more people to death in 2025 than all but one other state.
The annual report from the Death Penalty Information Center, published Monday, also noted that states which impose capital punishment are intensifying efforts to expand its use even as public support for it continues to decline.
“The data are really interesting this year in that they show two, very different trends,” said Robin Maher, executive director of the Death Penalty Information Center, a national nonprofit that is focused on capital punishment. “On the one hand we have public support for the death penalty continuing to drop. We have opposition to the death penalty continuing to grow.”

The report said there were 48 executions in the nation this year. That was almost double those in 2024, but they were concentrated in a handful of conservative states.
Florida carried out 19 executions in 2025, roughly 40% of the total. The next three states — Alabama, South Carolina and Texas — conducted five executions each.
“If you took Florida out of the equation, we would have a total for executions this year that would not look very different from other years,” Maher said.
Where death sentences are handed down in Alabama

Alabama put Demetrius Frazier to death in February, James Osgood in April, Gregory Hunt in June, Geoffrey West in September and Anthony Boyd in October. Those were in addition to the six executions that the state carried out 2024, when it led the nation in executions.
Of the people who were executed during the year, more than 83% had some type of documented vulnerability. Twenty-eight had a serious mental illness while 26 had an intellectual disability. Twenty-nine experienced significant childhood traumas. A total of at least 40 prisoners executed this year had one or more of those factors.
The country also executed an unusually high number of veterans, 10, for the year, with Florida executing seven of them.
“In many of these cases, jurors did not hear meaningful evidence about how the defendants’ military service had affected them,” the report states. Several were executed for crimes they committed while younger than 21 years old.
The organization warned that some of the figures in the report are preliminary because, even with days left in the year, one sentence hearing and three executions remain pending before the end of 2025.
As the number of executions spiked, legislatures throughout the country were intensifying efforts to expand the application of capital punishment.
Idaho enacted into law a bill that made aggravated lewd conduct with a minor child age 12 or younger eligible for the death penalty.
In Alabama, Rep. Matt Simpson, R-Daphne, prefiled a bill to make it a capital offense if a person commits murder while “the defendant knowingly creates a great risk to multiple persons.”
Nationwide, support for the death penalty remains far below its peak in the 1990s. In October, a poll published by Gallup indicated that 52% supported the death penalty. That figure is lower than the 80% of people who approved the death penalty in 1994, the peak of support for capital punishment. In parallel, those who oppose capital punishment continue to increase, from 16% in the 1990s to about 40% in recent years.
New death sentences continue to decline from its peak as well, going from 315 at its peak in 1996 to 22 this year, and imposed in a handful of counties throughout the country. More than half of juries in capital cases (56%) opted to recommend life in prison instead of the death penalty.
“It does suggest to me that they are out of touch with the way that the American public feels about the death penalty,” Maher said.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/death-chamber.jpeg,,,2025-12-18 08:57:25.566536
,California,2025-12-18 13:01:00+00:00,CalMatters,Newsom’s $18 billion budget gap has roots in pandemic aid ending,Dan Walters,,,,,https://calmatters.org/commentary/2025/12/newsom-deficit-budget-local-schools/,"During the pandemic, federal money flooded into state and local coffers. Once that funding ended, government spending didn't adjust downward.","When Gov. Gavin Newsom unveils his first draft of the state’s 2026-27 budget next month, he’ll reveal whether he intends to deal squarely with its chronic, multi-billion-dollar deficit or punt the shortfall to his successor.
Legislative Analyst Gabe Petek, the Legislature’s independent fiscal advisor, estimates the state faces an $18 billion gap between projected spending and likely revenues next year and, if left unaddressed, the deficit will grow to $35 billion a year.
Meanwhile, Petek says, the state has rung up $21.6 billion in off-the-books debt to cover deficits in recent fiscal years.
Petek and others have warned about the possibility of a serious recession afflicting the national economy which would exacerbate the budget’s imbalance and strain California’s emergency reserves, which have already been tapped to cover shortfalls.
Even without a recession, California’s economy is, in Petek’s words, “sluggish.” Jobs are shrinking, and at 5.6% of the labor force, California’s unemployment rate remains the highest of any state.
The recent history of papering over deficits with gimmicks and borrowed money is not an encouraging signal of a forthright approach. However, perhaps Newsom will opt to balance California’s books before embarking on a near-certain presidential campaign.
Unfortunately, the state is not alone in being plagued by yawning gaps between income and outgo. Throughout California, school districts, cities, counties and other units of local government are facing deficits rooted in the same dynamics that led to red ink in state finances — immense injections of federal relief funds during the COVID-19 pandemic.
It’s been estimated that the feds pumped as much as $600 billion into California through state and local governments to counteract the pandemic’s economic impacts, not counting many other billions that businesses and individuals received directly.
The federal aid gave officials cash to spend with few safeguards and fueled a short-lived jolt of taxes, particularly income taxes.
The Newsom administration interpreted the windfall as a permanent increase in revenue that led the governor to declare, in 2022, a $97.5 billion surplus. He and the Legislature immediately ramped up spending. But the surplus never materialized, and eventually the administration acknowledged that it had over-estimated revenues by $165 billion four years.
By then, however, the additional spending, especially for an expansion of medical care, was lodged in state law, and the state was left with what is termed a “structural deficit” in the $20 billion range.
Meanwhile, local governments and school districts were using their pandemic aid to satisfy the demands by employee unions for salary increases, which often could not be covered once the federal aid vanished. Inflation in living costs ratcheted up union salary demands even further.
A new report by the Fiscal Crisis & Management Assistance Team, which monitors California school district finances, examined the chronically troubled Sacramento City Unified School District and described how federal aid led to its financial quicksand.
The report catalogued the district’s history of overspending revenues and said, “This (federal) funding masked the district’s existing structural deficit, delaying the necessary actions to be taken to address it.”
Even after the federal aid stopped, the district continued to sign union contracts calling for raises that it could not afford. And it failed to implement the cost-saving steps it had pledged to balance its budget, the analysis found.
The budget problems in other school districts — Oakland Unified is a notorious example — and in local governments such as the City of Los Angeles have a similar ring. School trustees and city council members, elected with union support, squandered federal aid. Then they approved unsustainable contracts and blamed the resulting deficits on insufficient revenue.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/082125_Redistricting-Newsom_MG_CM_18.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-12-18 08:57:25.566536

(Photo: Jeniffer Solis/Nevada Current)In the next few weeks, the public will get their first look at a critical document two and a half years in the making that will define how the Colorado River is managed for the next decade.
The Bureau of Reclamation – which manages water in the West under the Interior Department – is on track to release a draft environmental review by early January with a range of options to replace the river’s operating rules, which are set to expire at the end of 2026.
Several elements of the draft were shared during the annual Colorado River Water Users Association’s conference in Las Vegas at Caesars Palace Wednesday.
Negotiations between federal officials and the seven western states that rely on the Colorado River have largely remained behind closed doors since 2023, but any new operating rules will be required to go through a public environmental review process before a final decision can be made.
Interior Department Assistant Secretary for Water and Science, Andrea Travnicek, said the agency is committed to meeting the self-imposed January deadline in order to finalize new rules before the current ones expire.
“The Department of the Interior recognizes a shrinking timeline is in front of us in order to operate under a new potential agreement,” Travnicek said.
In an unusual move, federal water officials said the draft will not identify which set of operating guidelines the federal government would prefer, which is typically included in environmental reviews. 
“We will not be identifying a preferred alternative, but we anticipate the identification of that between the draft and the final,” said Bureau of Reclamation’s senior water resource program manager, Carly Jerla.
Instead, the draft environmental review will list a broad range of possible alternatives designed to enable states to continue working towards a seven-state consensus agreement on how to share the river’s shrinking water supply. 
“We want to continue to facilitate, but not dictate these operations. The goal here is to inform decision makers and encourage parties to adopt agreements that put consultation and negotiation first,” Jerla continued.
Lower Basin states — California, Arizona, and Nevada — and Upper Basin states — Colorado, Wyoming, Utah and New Mexico — have been at an impasse for months over how to manage the Colorado River’s shrinking water supplies.
Last month, the states missed a federally-imposed deadline to submit a preliminary seven-state consensus plan that could replace the river’s operating guidelines after days of intense closed-door negotiations.
States’ last chance to share a final consensus-based plan will be mid-February 2026 in order to reach a final agreement in the summer  with implementation of the new guidelines beginning in October 2026.
The Bureau of Reclamation’s Acting Commissioner Scott Cameron said he and other federal officials have intensified efforts to bring states to a consensus, flying out West every other week since early April to meet with the seven states’ river negotiators.
“There are a number of issues from decades past that some people are having some difficulty getting past,” Cameron said, adding that states must “be willing to set aside previous perceived inequities and unfairness.”
One of the biggest disagreements between the Upper and Lower Basin states is over which faction should have to cut back on their water use, and by how much.
Lower Basin states want all seven Colorado River states to share mandatory water cuts during dry years under the new guidelines. The Upper Basin, which is not subject to mandatory cuts under current guidelines, say they already use much less water than downstream states and should not face additional cuts.
Despite states missing past deadlines, Cameron said he was “cautiously optimistic” states will reach a consensus deal by the February deadline.
“It’s not unusual in the negotiating process that tougher decisions get made the closer you get to the deadline. And frankly, there are tough decisions that have to be made,” Cameron said.
On Tuesday, California’s biggest water districts said they were willing to “set aside many of their legal positions” in order to reach a seven-state agreement.
The Bureau of Reclamation provided a broad overview of the components that will be included in draft’s range of options, including guidelines to reduce water deliveries from Lake Mead during shortages, coordinated reservoir operations for Lake Mead and Lake Powell, and storage and delivery mechanisms for conserved water.
Jerla, Reclamation’s senior water resource program manager, said the draft alternatives will include some components previously proposed by states.
She said the agency has adopted a number of temporary operational agreements since 2008 to address changing conditions on the river. Those agreements have served as test runs for a long term agreement and emphasized the need for more flexibility when managing the river from year-to-year.
“We want to preserve ourselves the flexibility to come back to the table, to do reviews, to make consensus adjustments if needed,” Jerla said.
That flexibility to operations will likely be needed again this year due to a less-than-average upcoming snow season, that combined with a dry spring or early summer in 2026, could create conditions for another low runoff year.
“We’re monitoring the forecast, and we’re seeing not a great start to water year 2026. It’s still early in the year, but the way things are setting up it isn’t looking good,” Jerla said.
The two biggest reservoirs in the country, Lake Powell and Lake Mead, are currently at a fraction of their full capacity. Lake Mead is at 32% capacity, while Lake Powell is at 28%. 
Additionally, water inflow into the reservoirs in 2026 are projected to most likely be 75% of the average, according to the federal agency. The minimum probable inflow forecast for 2026 is 44% of average, indicating a potentially very dry year.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/DSC08945-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-18 08:57:25.566536

Phaneuf and Jenna Carlesso,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/12/18/lamont-aid-food-pantries-planned-parenthood/,"Lamont announces $168 million to offset federal cuts to nutrition assistance, reproductive health services and health insurance.","Gov. Ned Lamont announced more than $41 million Thursday to aid residents losing nutrition assistance and offset vanishing federal funding for reproductive health services.
The governor also expanded his own recent commitments to fight homelessness and provide relief for thousands losing federal assistance for health insurance.
“It is a shame that the federal government is cutting back on these services that provide a safety net for those who are most in need and which ultimately support the health and safety of our entire country,” Lamont said. “These are services that must continue to be supported, and here in Connecticut we will stand behind them.”
The Democratic governor now has committed nearly $168 million from a special $500 million reserve the General Assembly established last month to blunt the worst of federal human service cutbacks ordered in July by President Trump and Congress.
Lamont notified the legislature’s six highest-ranking leaders of his proposals by letter early Thursday. The Democratic-controlled panel, which has authority to block the initiatives but cannot modify them, is expected to endorse the full plan.
A big investment in Connecticut’s food banks and pantries
One of Lamont’s largest proposals would allocate $24.6 million over the next 18 months for food pantries — which provide free and discounted groceries to low-income households, and the food bank services that help stock these facilities.
Legislators, advocates for nutrition assistance and others have pressed the governor particularly to aid about 36,000 immigrants, young adults, veterans and people experiencing homelessness at risk of losing Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits between Dec. 1 and March 31 because of new work requirements and other changes Congress ordered in July.
Jason Jakubowski, president and CEO of Foodshare, said his organization will use the funds to help more people access food, but pantries won’t be able to offset all lost SNAP benefits.
“Additional appropriations are always appreciated,” he said. “That amount, over 18 months, will help. It’s definitely not going to solve the problem created by the One Big Beautiful Bill Act.
 “SNAP is the first line of defense against hunger in this country, period. We’re intended to be a supplement,” he added. “There is not enough food at our food bank, or every food bank in the country put together, to make up for the number of meals that SNAP provides.”
With as many as 36,000 residents having lost or at risk of losing SNAP benefits in the coming months, “It doesn’t take a rocket scientist to figure out that lines at our mobile trucks and our local pantries are going to increase,” Jakubowski added. “By how much? I don’t know, but they’re definitely going to increase.”
To further help households in need find local nutrition assistance, Lamont also committed $4.7 million from the reserve to the state’s 2-1-1 information line service and to the network of regional, nonprofit community action agencies, which steer hundreds of thousands in need toward a wide array of social services.
“This is a really positive start on how to better support those families,” said Lisa Tepper Bates, president and CEO of the United Way in Connecticut, which runs the 2-1-1 service and operates a major food bank serving pantries in southeastern Connecticut.
The 2-1-1 service, which hasn’t received a funding increase for its main referral program in 15 years, has seen inquiries surge dramatically since the federal government shutdown in October and early November stalled federal funding for SNAP and other programs.
Though the state shares a portion of SNAP’s administrative costs, benefits are funded entirely by the federal government.
But the United Way, New Haven Legal Assistance and 15 other nonprofits, labor and business organizations and policy groups recently urged state officials to create a state-funded nutrition assistance benefit for those displaced by last summer’s congressional changes.
“What we really need is to give people a choice in what they’re eating and what they’re going to be spending money on so they can feed their families in the way they need to,” said Sara Parker McKernan, policy advocate for New Haven Legal Assistance.
“Having your own ability to pay for food, which you get when you have food stamps — that autonomy is key for people. We need to have a state-funded food assistance program so people can make those choices for themselves.”
The governor’s plan also includes $1.5 million for the state Department of Social Services to help residents comply with work requirements and other new eligibility rules and thereby preserve their SNAP benefits.
More funding to fight homelessness, blunt premium hikes
Lamont also stepped up his own recent proposals to assist households facing steep hikes in health insurance costs and individuals and families facing homelessness.
The governor last week proposed $70 million to assist tens of thousands of households that are losing the enhanced federal tax credits and subsidies that help them purchase health insurance on the state’s exchange.
Lamont now wants to invest almost $120 million through June 2027.
That includes $50.8 million to replace lost subsidies and another $64.1 million to temper expiring tax credits and to reimburse some carriers facing increased claims for healthcare services.
The governor also would channel $5 million to Connecticut’s federally qualified health centers to reflect increased demand for services there, particularly from patients with incomes less than 100% of the Federal Poverty Level. For a family of four, the current FPL is less than $32,150 annually.
Lamont also wants to upgrade a plan he announced just three days ago to commit $5.2 million to counter shrinking federal support for programs to combat homelessness.
But the plan the governor sent Thursday to legislative leaders would instead dedicate $6.9 million for grants to organizations fighting homelessness and to maintain previously federally funded vouchers for supportive housing.
Aid for Planned Parenthood could spark partisan debate
A final element of the governor’s proposal likely will spark objections from some Republicans in the Democratic-controlled General Assembly.
The governor would send $10.4 million to Planned Parenthood of Southern New England to offset shrinking federal reimbursements and family grants frozen by the Trump administration.
These and other proposals in the $168 million in funding commitments Lamont recommended would be drawn from $500 million — one-fifth of last fiscal year’s $2.5 billion surplus — that state legislators set aside during last month’s special session.
Most of that surplus is being used to shrink Connecticut’s hefty pension debt and to build reserves, two efforts that generally enjoy bipartisan support.
But when the $500 million reserve was established, many minority Republicans argued Connecticut shouldn’t spend local dollars to temper or reverse ongoing federal cutbacks.
Many Republicans here also have objected over the years to sending state dollars to Planned Parenthood, arguing Connecticut shouldn’t invest public dollars in an organization that provides abortion services.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/2025_1105_SR_SNAPFoodPantries_047-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-18 08:57:25.566536

(Will McLelland for Alabama Reflector)A board overseeing a program allowing taxpayers to make donations to support rural hospitals Wednesday discussed how two third-party entities would fit into the program. 
In addition to 50 rural hospitals that donors can direct donations to, the Alabama Health Research and Education Foundation (AlaHA) and the Alabama Rural Hospital Foundation are also eligible to receive donations. 
Rob Pearson, chair of the board, said in an interview after the Wednesday meeting that the third parties must direct those donations to eligible rural hospitals.

“They’ll have to report the money they received and how much they sent each hospital, so there’ll be some accountability for that,” Pearson said. 
Pearson said the legislation creating the program allowed the Alabama Rural Hospital Foundation will have its own allocation system. AlaHA must distribute its donations using a need-based tiered system. 
The board approved that system for other undesignated donations earlier this month.
Cameran Clark, a board member representing the Alabama Department of Revenue, said a donor can choose any eligible hospital or a third party.
“They’d still be listed, but they would not be able to be selected,” Clark said of hospitals once they receive the maximum donations.
Starting in January, Alabama taxpayers will be able to make donations to help rural hospitals, which officials say are the backbone of the state’s health care system.
The Rural Hospital Investment Program Board was created through legislation that passed this spring. It created a dollar-for-dollar tax incentive program for individuals and businesses that donate to rural hospitals. It has an annual statewide cap of $20 million for 2026, $25 million for 2027 and $30 million for 2028 and beyond. It requires a 10% match from local communities.
According to the University of North Carolina’s Sheps Center, nine rural hospitals have closed in Alabama since 2009. Only 30% of the state’s rural hospitals have labor and delivery units, leaving many expectant parents to drive long distances for care. 
Many of Alabama’s existing hospitals are struggling. The state’s hospitals have long pushed for Medicaid expansion, saying it would provide needed funding to keep doors open. 
While Alabama Republican House leaders have signaled openness to a public-private hybrid approach to expansion, the Senate has been hostile, and removed a provision from a 2024 gambling bill that could have provided money for the program.  
Board members and hospital officials have said the program will help, but would not save a hospital in danger of closing.
Pearson, who lives in west Alabama, said that investing in rural hospitals will improve the quality of life of the communities the hospitals are in.
“Rural health care is on the front lines of quality of life. Quality life means workforce availability, and it impacts your workforce participation,” Pearson said. “It’ll show up in the workforce participation rates and in the total economics of the state, and in longevity in health benefits.”
The program is one of two additional funding sources for rural hospitals in the state. Alabama’s rural hospitals will also be receiving funding from the federal Rural Health Transformation Program, part of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) that was signed into law this summer. It distributes $50 billion in grants to the states over five years for rural health care. 
According to a brief from KFF, a national health policy research organization, the fund could offset just over a third (37%) of the estimated federal Medicaid spending cuts in rural areas, which are projected to be $137 billion over ten years.
Gov. Kay Ivey announced in November that the state submitted its application for the federal program and expected to hear back by the end of the year. A message seeking comment from Ivey’s office was left Wednesday afternoon.
Pearson said the two programs will serve different purposes for rural hospitals in the state. Where the state program will help hospitals offset operation costs to keep them open, the federal program aims to make rural hospitals a more sustainable model.
“By the end of January, these hospitals are gonna have cash in their hand,” Pearson said. “That’s exciting for every rural hospital in Alabama.”",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/VaughanRegionalMedicalCenter_McLelland12870-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-18 08:57:25.566536

The move is especially welcome for Democrats who said that the cuts — part of broader attacks from President Donald Trump on climate programs and clean energy funding — would slash projects boosting the electric grid, threaten thousands of manufacturing and construction jobs, and send Americans’ energy costs soaring.
The government’s lawyers confirmed in a court filing this week — in response to a lawsuit by several clean energy groups and the city of St. Paul over the canceled funding — that the selection of grants in fact, “was influenced by whether a grantee’s address was located in a State that tends to elect … Democratic candidates in state and national elections (so-called “Blue States”).”
That contradicts the Energy Department’s earlier assertion that partisanship was not part of the cuts.
Sarah Nelson, acting inspector general for the Energy Department, said in a letter to members of Congress on Wednesday that the audit of the canceled funds will review “whether those cancellations were in accordance with established criteria.”
“This work will help ensure that these activities are conducted consistently with applicable laws, regulations, and Departmental policies and procedures,” Nelson added.
The Department of Energy did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
In October, the Energy Department announced that 321 funding awards across 223 projects were terminated, saying that after review, they “did not adequately advance the nation’s energy needs, were not economically viable, and would not provide a positive return on investment of taxpayer dollars.”
At the time, White House budget director Russell Vought said awards across California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Vermont and Washington state would be cut. All 16 targeted states supported Harris, but Energy Secretary Chris Wright initially said the cuts were “business decisions on whether it’s a good use of the taxpayer money or not.”
More than two dozen Democratic members of Congress from California, led by California Sens. Adam Schiff and Alex Padilla and Congresswoman Zoe Lofgren, wrote a letter to the acting inspector general in late October requesting a formal investigation into the canceled funding, saying that the cuts “based on partisan criteria suggests significant unlawful bias.”
The letter said because the project funding came from the bipartisan infrastructure law, passed by Congress under former President Joe Biden, that the Department does not have the authority to terminate awards and that the decisions are “unlawful and will cause harm to Americans.”
Schiff said in a statement he was pleased to see the investigation into what he called “clear political targeting … intended to punish blue states.”
The cuts, which hit California the hardest, include more than $1 billion for a hydrogen hub there.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/AP25328778661930-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-18 14:58:33.678499

(Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)As the Michigan House Judiciary Committee debated overturning the state’s red flag law, gun rights advocates aired their grievances with the law and how they considered it to violate constitutional rights. 
The main point that proponents of the three-bill package made was that the Extreme Risk Protection Order Act, passed in 2023, specifically provisions for ex parte orders that are able to be issued if there is clear and convincing evidence that a person will harm themselves or others with a gun, insisting it violates due process rights by removing the gun without a prior hearing. 
The legislation, introduced by Rep. James DeSana (R-Carleton), has a near-zero chance of passage through the Democratic-controlled Michigan Senate, much less past Gov. Gretchen Whitmer.
Regardless, DeSana said his intent in bringing the bills forward went beyond adherence to the Second Amendment.
“Another constitutionally protected right is the right to due process, and I cannot think of any more important right than the right to your day in court and the right to face your accuser and the right to tell your story, which has been denied our gun owners in the state of Michigan,” DeSana said.

Rep. Kelly Breen (D-Novi), who had chaired the House Judiciary Committee during the passage of the Extreme Risk Protection Order Act, repeatedly pushed back against DeSana and others testifying in favor of the bill. She argued that, because of the option to have an appeal hearing on an Extreme Risk Protection Order, due process was not being violated and people were being given their day in court. 
Representatives from multiple gun-rights organizations, including the National Rifle Association, testified in favor of repealing the red flag law, with Tom Lambert of Michigan Open Carry saying the law was an overreach in its ability to temporarily take away a person’s guns. 
“Contrary to the claim of its proponents, this law has not made us safer, but what it has done is allowed for countless legally owned firearms to be confiscated from otherwise law-abiding citizens without due process,” said Brenden Boudreau, the executive director of Great Lakes Gun Rights. “Red flag laws are a failure. They’re an abomination to the rights we have as citizens of this constitutional republic.”
However, two of those testifying advocated for the continued need for a red flag law and the usefulness of Michigan’s current statute. 
“The state of Michigan, and the country, for that matter, is in a mental health crisis,” Aaron Huguhey, a deputy chief with the Southfield Police Department said. “And so the passing of the ERPO law has been an effective tool for law enforcement agencies such as the Southfield Police Department to effectively remove firearms in those situations.”
He added that Southfield had seen 10 cases between 2024 and 2025 in which the Extreme Risk Protection Orders were issued. 
Nearly 300 gun confiscation orders were granted in Michigan’s first year of “red flag” laws

Kelly Dillaha, the Director of Red, Wine and Blue and a member of End Gun Violence Michigan, said families in Michigan can use the law to help prevent a crisis from turning into a tragedy. 
“Law enforcement is using the tool responsibly and effectively, as we just heard, and we are all safer because of it,” Dillaha said.
The debate came just days after a deadly shooting at Brown University in Rhode Island, and Rep. Helena Scott (D-Detroit) suggested that a repeal of this law would be “a proverbial slap in the face” to those who had lost loved ones in similar tragedies in Michigan, including mass shootings at Oxford High School and Michigan State University. 
“Incredibly, gun extremists have decided to attempt to weaken our gun laws just days after the school shooting at Brown University. School shootings are now so common that at least three Brown students had survived a previous school shooting, including MSU,” End Gun Violence Michigan said in a statement after the hearing, adding that repealing this law would cause more murders and suicides in the state.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/flag-gun.jpg,,,2025-12-18 07:59:04.490415

Vermont's experience integrating 650 allies who risked their lives for America contradicts harmful rhetoric painting them as security risks and economic drains
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Molly Gray: What Washington gets wrong about Afghan refugees.","This commentary is by Molly Gray. She has served as the Executive Director of the Vermont Afghan Alliance since April 2023. Previously, she served as Lt. Governor of Vermont from 2021 to 2023.



I was a senior in high school when 9/11 happened in 2001. I will never forget where I was or how the day unfolded. I wasn’t yet 18, but my entire adult life would be shaped by that event. Soon after, the U.S. invaded Afghanistan, and then Iraq. U.S. involvement in Afghanistan would last 21 years, and at one point Vermont would have the highest per-capita population of servicemembers serving in Afghanistan and Iraq in the nation. 
Yet as harmful rhetoric from Washington portrays Afghan allies as security risks and economic burdens, Vermont’s experience tells a strikingly different story. Over the past three years, some 650 Afghan allies who risked their lives supporting U.S. missions have settled across our state, filling critical workforce gaps, revitalizing rural communities and contributing far more in taxes than they’ve received in resettlement support.
Over the last three years as the Executive Director of the Vermont Afghan Alliance, I’ve met countless veterans, former aid workers, lawyers, contractors and others who worked in Afghanistan. U.S. efforts focused on everything from counterterrorism and the rule of law to education and agriculture.
During the chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan in August 2021, the U.S. evacuated an estimated 125,000 Afghan allies. That was only a fraction of those who had worked with the U.S. government over two decades. An estimated 145,000 Afghans eligible for Special Immigrant Visas (SIVs) were left behind, along with countless wives and children. Many men evacuated in 2021 were told to leave their families behind with the promise of reunification within a year, yet separation continues. 
The Vermont Afghan Alliance began in 2022 as a scrappy, GoFundMe-funded, volunteer-led effort to help newly arriving Afghans learn to drive and obtain a license. In Vermont, we all know that without a car, employment options shrink quickly. Today, Afghan allies live in more than a dozen towns—from St. Albans to Bennington and Rutland to Hartford—well beyond traditional resettlement hubs like Burlington. 
In 2023, I joined the Alliance as an “interim” executive director to help grow and professionalize the organization. While I never worked in Afghanistan, I spent much of my twenties with the International Committee of the Red Cross, promoting U.S. compliance with the Geneva Conventions in Afghanistan, Iraq and at Guantánamo. My brother served in Iraq, and like so many of my generation, my adult life has been shaped by the so-called “Global War on Terror.”
I felt a deep responsibility to a community that had risked so much in support of U.S. missions abroad. I also felt a strong sense of Vermont’s hospitality—that if you welcome someone into your home, at a minimum you provide food, shelter and safety. Finally, as someone long concerned about our demographics, the truth is simple: we are not going to birth our way out of our workforce crisis. The solution lies in welcoming people—and their talents—from across the country and the world.
Since 2023, the Alliance, together with community partners, has welcomed and served Afghan allies statewide with employment, driving lessons, housing assistance, immigration legal services, civic education, health programming and more. We’ve partnered with dozens of employers across northern Vermont eager to hire Afghan allies and willing to make small workplace adjustments. Through our driving program alone, more than 60 individuals have passed the Vermont road test. From manufacturing to healthcare, education to commercial truck driving, Afghan allies are filling high-demand jobs, strengthening our rural economy and enriching our communities.
A recent USCRI policy report found that Afghan allies nationwide have contributed an estimated $1.79 billion in local, state and federal taxes, including contributions to Medicare and Social Security. Contrary to harmful rhetoric, Afghan allies are not a “drain” on the system. Their contributions far outweigh the short-term support provided during resettlement.
A damaging narrative suggesting Afghan allies are “unvetted” or pose a security risk to this country is circulating from Washington. In reality, those fleeing the Taliban are among the most thoroughly vetted individuals in this country—they were screened during employment with the U.S. government, during immigration processing and again with every status adjustment.
Afghan allies are our neighbors, friends and colleagues. At the Alliance, the majority of staff and board members are Afghan allies themselves—thoughtful, courageous, emerging leaders raised in an Afghanistan backed by the U.S. They understand, as deeply as we do, the hope and possibility that come with a free and democratic society. I’ve been inspired daily by what these young leaders have achieved for Vermont and the talents they’ve already contributed to our state. 
As I prepare to transition from the Alliance and pass the torch to new leadership, I’m struck by what Vermont has accomplished. We’ve shown what’s possible when communities pool resources and talents around a common purpose. The infrastructure we’ve built – from volunteer networks to employer partnerships – proves that welcoming refugees isn’t just the right thing to do, it’s an investment in our state’s future. The path forward is clear: continue expanding housing solutions, strengthening workforce connections, and ensuring every Vermont community has the tools to welcome new neighbors. The work ahead is significant, but so is Vermont’s capacity to lead by example.

Ron DeSantis’s eighth and final legislative budget makes another run at redirecting cancer funding in Florida, including jettisoning a requirement that funds be awarded only to peer-reviewed projects and empowering an eight-member “collaborative” to direct how the state spends hundreds of millions of dollars on cancer care and research.
The push by the governor is likely to spark another largely behind-the-scenes battle among those who rely on the state money to help with their research programs.
Specifically, DeSantis’s proposed budget eliminates a decade-old law that spells out how $127 million should be distributed to four National Cancer Institute (NCI)-designated facilities: Moffitt Cancer Center; University of Florida Health Cancer Center; Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center; University of Miami Miller School of Medicine; and Mayo Clinic Comprehensive Cancer Center.
Instead, the governor’s budget would empower the Cancer Connect Collaborative to distribute the money to all cancer providers, with a requirement that at least 60% continues to be spent on the four NCI facilities. NCI is the federal government’s principal agency for cancer research and training. There are 72 NCI-designated facilities nationwide.
The collaborative, established in law in 2024, is a group of eight people — three appointed by the governor, two by the Senate president, and two by the speaker of the House.
Lobbyists representing the four NCI facilities did not immediately respond to Florida Phoenix’s request for comment on the proposal. But representatives of the four facilities testified against a similar plan in a House Health Care Budget Subcommittee earlier this year.
John Cleveland, Moffitt’s executive vice president, director, and scientific officer, told members of the House House Health Care Budget Subcommittee in February that NCI facilities have recruited 980 premier investigators since the Legislature created the program in 2014 and has helped changed cancer care in Florida.
“Florida used to be a state where you flew to New York City or Boston to get your (cancer) care. No longer,” Cleveland said. “So, now they actually want to stay in the state. And I think that’s super important — we have to support our citizens. Having them get on a plane to get their care up in other states is just ridiculous.”

Florida has the second highest cancer burden in the nation. Between 2021 and 2023, the total number of cancer deaths in Florida was 140,955, according to the Florida Department of Health (DOH).
Former Gov. Rick Scott championed the NCI program, which was passed by the Legislature in 2014. Lawmakers pumped an additional $37million into the program in 2022 and renamed it the Casey DeSantis Research Funds.
 Cancer innovation and incubator funds

The DeSantis administration first tried to steer funding away from NCI facilities to additional providers during the 2024 session and again in 2025.
The DOH issued a long-range report in 2024 noting that restricting the funding to NCI facilities “limits funding accessibility for other cancer facilities and research institutions across Florida, including those in rural or underserved areas.”
Another legislative tussle in the works over Florida cancer research funding

Although the Legislature refused to go along with the changes, lawmakers did agree to create and fund two new cancer grant programs: the Cancer Innovation Fund in 2024 and the Cancer Incubator in 2025.
There is $60 million available in Cancer Innovation Fund and $30 million in the Cancer Incubator program, which is directed toward research at children’s specialty hospitals
The cancer collaborative oversees both grant programs and is charged with making recommendations to the DOH, which awards the grants.
DeSantis awards $30 million in cancer research funds to four pediatric hospitals

The governor announced in November that four pediatric hospitals were each receiving $7.5 million grants: Nicklaus Children’s Hospital in Miami; John’s Hopkins All Children’s Hospital in Tampa; Wolfson Children’s Hospital in Jacksonville; and Nemours Children’s Hospital in Orlando.
Statutes require that proposals for both the Innovation Fund and the Cancer Incubator program are “appropriate and are evaluated fairly on the basis of scientific merit.” To that end, the law requires the DOH to appoint peer review panels of independent, scientifically qualified individuals to review and score the merit of each proposal.
DeSantis’s proposed budget eliminates the requirement that grants for either fund be peer reviewed.

Barbershop owners say colleague had taken steps to work legally in the U.S. and his partner is due to give birth any day.
The post Cheyenne couple seeks support for family after barber taken into ICE custody appeared first on WyoFile .","Carlos Montes was driving with his family on South Greeley Highway on Nov. 26 when a Laramie County Sheriff’s deputy pulled him over for what first appeared like a routine traffic stop. 
Instead, the deputy took Montes into custody as his pregnant partner and 5-year-old son watched helplessly, his friends say.
For three weeks, his family and friends were desperate to find answers, including where the expectant father was being held. They say they were met with silence, conflicting reports and overall confusion when dealing with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

Montes is a barber at Drew’s Barbershop in Cheyenne, according to husband and wife shop owners Drew Weston and Andrea Shipley. The couple is leading the effort to help his family navigate an increasingly difficult situation. 
They maintain he was wrongly detained by immigration officials despite trying to methodically follow the process to work legally in the U.S. Once he was taken by ICE, his friends and family describe how a distressing process left them in the dark about his whereabouts and well-being while putting up barriers to even simple steps like sending money to him to pay for phone calls. 
Originally from Nicaragua, Montes and his partner had been living in Cheyenne since 2023, Shipley said. (His partner did not want to comment for this story.) As a licensed barber, he started working at Drew’s Barbershop in April of this year and had already gone through the proper immigration and licensing process, she said. 
“Carlos has a naturalization number, and all of those things were approved through the state of Wyoming with the Attorney General’s office,” she said. “He’s worked at four different shops in town; he’s well known.”
After Montes disappeared into ICE custody last month, the couple encountered an immigration process that has been confusing and hard to navigate, Shipley said. “Communication can be really difficult.” 
“If you are not an attorney, it can be really difficult for families to talk to ICE.” Attorney Elisabeth Trefonas
That’s left the couple trying to piece together what happened to the barber. Weston theorized that some piece of paperwork might have been lost or missed in the long process. There’s also a chance that Montes entered the United States when migrants from Nicaragua were offered temporary protected status. The Trump administration terminated that status for Nicaraguans in September.
“I know that he has done so much paperwork to even be here and get his license, that he’s a guy who will do what he needs to do the legal way,” Weston said, “so for this to pop up and then to be treated like this, oh my God.”
After numerous requests for comment, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement responded to Oil City News on Dec. 9 with an email stating: “Carlos Fausto Montes Calderon is an illegal alien from Nicaragua. He was ordered removed by an immigration judge June 6, 2024. He was arrested by ICE Denver Nov. 26, 2025 and removed to Nicaragua on Dec. 4.” 
That was information Montes’ distraught family and friends said they were unable to get from ICE. Then on Monday, after weeks of silence, the family finally heard from Montes. He had been deported back to Nicaragua and was able to connect with family there. 
“If you are not an attorney, it can be really difficult for families to talk to ICE,” said Jackson-based immigration attorney Elisabeth Trefonas.
Although Trefonas isn’t representing Montes, she told Oil City News that his circumstances are familiar. It’s also not uncommon for people to have removal orders filed even though they believe their immigration papers are in order, she said.  
The arrest
Montes was with his partner and child in the car when a sheriff’s deputy stopped the family, according to Shipley. 
“She is going to have a baby any day,” Shipley said. “It’s heartbreaking what is happening.”
At first, the barbershop owners believed Montes had been sent to the ICE holding facility in Aurora, Colorado. But dozens of attempts to reach him were futile, they said.
Oil City News attempted multiple times to reach the privately-run Aurora Detention Center through its published number, which rang but was not answered.
Weston said a family member got through to the facility, but was unable to talk to Montes, even after putting money on his account for phone calls. Families of detainees have described the need to pay for phone calls and FaceTime to communicate with detainees.
In an attempt to see Montes, a family member traveled to the Colorado facility on Dec. 2 for a visitation, but was told that he may have already been deported. Two days later, a family member was able to reach Montes and confirm that he was still in the United States but had been sent to an ICE facility in a different state. On Dec. 5, the family used an online ICE locator tool that showed he was being held in CoreCivic’s Adams County Correctional Center in Natchez, Mississippi. Montes’ information was later missing from the locator tool when the family and Oil City News tried again. Four days after the locator tool indicated he was in Mississippi, ICE responded to Oil City News with the email saying Montes had already been deported on Dec. 4.
According to Shipley, Montes had told a family member that he had “signed some paperwork,” but wasn’t sure about the document’s meaning.
A spokesperson for Gov. Mark Gordon’s office said a representative had been in contact with the family, but was not directly involved and could only offer advice. 
The Laramie County Sheriff’s Office confirmed that their deputies made the initial traffic stop that night for an inoperable headlight. “ICE authorized deputies to take Montes into custody,” a spokesperson said.
Montes has been stopped by law enforcement before. Last fall, he was pulled over three times and issued citations for traffic violations, court documents show. Most of the citations were for improper registration, not having a valid driver’s license and not possessing insurance. Otherwise, Oil City News did not locate a criminal history for Montes.
Trefonas, the Jackson-based attorney, cautioned that it’s risky for people to be driving if they have uncertainty about their immigration status, “but I’ve also had U.S. citizens wrongfully detained as well with mistaken identities, particularly with common last names.” 
After being swiftly transported to a facility, she described, it’s possible the detainee either didn’t have a phone number memorized or didn’t have an opportunity to call anyone. “And then they’re moved or removed from the country before there was any time to talk with them about it.” 
Montes does not have an immigration attorney, according to Shipley. Immigration attorneys interviewed by WyoFile recently said the confusing process of detaining, moving and eventually possibly deporting migrants to different countries has become typical as the Trump administration increases its deportation efforts.
“We’re seeing people moved around so much they lose track of what day it is … they don’t know time and place,” Laura Lunn, of the Rocky Mountain Immigrant Advocacy Network, told WyoFile. “People [end up] detained in Aurora, Colorado, and don’t know there’s a giant mountain range outside their front door.”
Shipley and Weston have been posting updates on the Drew’s Barbershop Facebook page, trying to rally community support for Montes, and established a GoFundMe fundraiser to offer financial help for his family, and to possibly hire an attorney. Shipley said they are determined to help bring him back to Cheyenne to be with his family.
Aside from the personal cost, the couple said the aggressive crackdowns have taken a toll on small businesses, including theirs.
“It’s not about the money, it’s about the humanity,” Shipley added. “We’re taking a big hit and other small businesses affected by this are taking huge hits too, but the fact is the people in the barbershop are losing a colleague, they’re losing a trusted friend and part of the culture of the barbershop, a community watering hole where people are supposed to be safe.”
While Montes is now in Nicaragua, his pregnant partner, son, and job remain in Cheyenne.

(Photo by Getty Images)With high grocery prices continuing to squeeze Minnesotans, a newly unsealed antitrust complaint provides a path towards relief. 
The complaint is a revealing look at the way big retailers can wield their power over food manufacturers to drive up prices — while crushing competitors. The lawsuit also underscores that if Minnesota legislators are going to effectively address sticker shock at the grocery store, they must address the consolidation that has a stranglehold over the industry.
A judge recently ordered that an antitrust complaint against PepsiCo that was brought by the Federal Trade Commission under the Biden administration, but dropped earlier this year by the Trump Administration, be unsealed and made available to the public. 
The complaint provides a unique look at price discrimination in practice, which involves charging retailers different prices for the same good, often at the behest of powerful retailers. That practice is a violation of an antitrust law known as the Robinson-Patman Act.
For the past decade, according to the unsealed complaint, Walmart has used its immense power to demand promotional payments and allowances from Pepsi that have kept prices of soft drinks lower than other retailers. Walmart has also used Pepsi to help it monitor prices of soft drinks at competing retailers. When the gap between Walmart and others is too low, Pepsi limits allowances and raises wholesale prices for those companies. “Rather than simply working with Walmart to reduce prices, Pepsi’s actions have had the effect of raising prices for customers of competing retailers,” the complaint says.  
While Pepsi revealed to investors it could not risk angering Walmart, they did benefit from preferential promotion and in-store placement. 
“Walmart’s promise is: Keep us the king of our domain and we’ll make you the king of yours,” wrote Stacy Mitchell of the Institute for Local Self Reliance, the organization — with a strong Minnesota presence — that sued to unseal the FTC’s complaint. 
While the FTC lawsuit targeted soft drinks, this is just a glimpse at a more pervasive practice. 
A small food cooperative in New London told legislators this year about the disparity in wholesale prices they face. 
Meanwhile, a study from the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta last month found market consolidation has driven food inflation higher.
From the 1950s until the early 80s (a time of aggressive Robinson-Patman Act  enforcement) independent grocery stores captured over half of America’s grocery dollar. 
Today, the four largest grocery chains capture over half of America’s grocery dollar while the market share of independents has dropped to 22%. Walmart alone commands a fifth of the grocery market nationally, 19%  in the Twin Cities, and over half of the market in some parts of rural Minnesota. Meanwhile, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, 1.6 million Minnesotans have low retail access and 16%  of the state’s census tracts are food deserts. This transformation of the grocery industry over the past four decades follows a decision by presidents of both parties to let the law collect dust.
While Minnesota cannot revive enforcement of the Robinson-Patman Act, it can create its own standards. 
The bipartisan Consumer Grocery Price Fairness Act would do just that. 
The legislation would give Minnesota clearer and stronger tools for policing price discrimination in the grocery industry. Building off the principles of the Robinson-Patman Act, the law would require suppliers to offer goods to retailers on equivalent terms and prohibit retailers from extracting unfair concessions from suppliers.
The legislation also addresses key loopholes in the Robinson-Patman Act. This includes the ability of suppliers to engage in price discrimination if retailers are in different “channels” such as giving a preferential price to a dollar store chain compared to a traditional grocery store. The legislation would also ban the kind of access discrimination experienced during the pandemic, i.e., Walmart threatening to fine suppliers that did not give them preferential access to goods.
The Robinson-Patman Act was passed in 1936 when Minnesota stood at the forefront of a nationwide movement to address the harms of chain stores. 
Gov. Floyd B. Olson of the Farmer-Labor Party secured passage of a tax on chains. 
His predecessor, Republican Gov. Theodore Christianson, advocated for a national version of the tax. “Selling the goods is far more important than manufacturing them,” Christianson told Congress in 1940. While the taxes Olson and Christianson fought for were eventually tossed out by the U.S. Supreme Court, the Robinson-Patman Act became the enduring legacy of that movement. 
Today, Minnesota can create a new legacy that helps reign in the power of big box stores and provides relief to consumers.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/GettyImages-1168244477-1-1024x716-1.jpg,,,2025-12-18 07:59:04.490415

New abortion data backs our longstanding argument: that legal doesn’t mean accessible.
State data reported in The Missouri Independent, and subsequently backed up by a national report released last week by the Society of Family Planning (SFP), shows the $31.5 million investment last year to help pass the abortion-rights constitutional amendment yielded, according to the state health agency, fewer than 100 in-clinic abortions statewide this year — almost identical patient numbers in Missouri the year before Roe fell. 
SFP’s report is the first national state-by-state data drop that shows abortion numbers after November 2024, when Missouri and six other states voted to protect abortion rights. The chart is a stunning rebuke of campaign “strategy” and the $300 million invested nationwide. Access in states with newly amended constitutional protections, including in Missouri, which was the lone state in the abortion ballot cohort to claw back a total ban, saw almost no change in the number of people who could access an in-clinic abortion in their home state.
It might be why the well-funded anti-abortion right withheld money to fight ballot measures — spending money to keep things the same seems like a waste. In fact, the pro-abortion side outspent anti-abortion opposition eight to one nationwide in 2024. One should question such a lackluster response from the usually rabid anti-abortion zealots.
The Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services counted 80 in-clinic abortions in the past year. That’s nearly $400,000 per abortion in Missouri. In capitalist terms, that’s an abysmal return on investment that should be a warning shot across the bow for funders and donors even thinking about further investments in policies that mimic the failed Roe v. Wade framework. 
Beyond the dollars and cents of it all, what did this cost us in human capital? I’m thinking about the countless supporters who spent their free time collecting signatures and knocking doors to sell the same false hope that turned them out to volunteer. Will they answer the call next time? Did this erode the hope we cling to when we all diligently participate in democracy year after year?
After all, the same legacy organizations and institutions who made big asks of supporters are the same ones choosing inaction after securing their limited victory. Planned Parenthood, the only abortion provider in the state, has kept abortion appointments largely unavailable and self-imposed a gestational limit well before the state’s cut off. 
More than 800 Missouri physicians who signed a letter in support of the reproductive freedom amendment last year are nowhere to be found providing abortion care while capacity is repeatedly cited as a challenge to expanding access.
The Missouri Abortion Fund is experiencing a decline in donations while footing the bill for out-of-state abortion care, which accounts for the majority of Missouri patients. Those lucky enough to get an appointment in-state still face an insurance ban leaders of last year’s campaign did not bother to challenge in their litigation strategy. What’s Next member, Right By You, took on parental involvement laws that effectively ban abortion for young people, expensive and time-consuming legal work that should never fall to already under resourced grassroots organizations.
One year later, the reality is abortion access looks much the same. It’s inaccessible. What’s worse is, as an early member of the campaign coalition, I know the focus was to turn out pro-choice Republicans to win limited abortion rights, ignoring the wider consequence of doing so. As a result, the hole in which we are trying to dig ourselves out of is deeper than ever.
Missouri’s anti-abortion supermajority grew, as these same majority “pro-choice” voters ushered in a second Trump presidency. 
What we must do next is openly analyze this with truth, transparency and accountability so it doesn’t repeat. Rote victory statements, in these dark times, are unproductive at best and threaten our collective fight for progress.
As an organizer, I’ve been trained never to engage the public without a call to action. Yet, these are the hardest times to come up with a clear ask when the problems we face are intricately weaved in a multitude of harms. 
So, I default to the basics. I call on allies to oppose efforts that uplift the Roe status quo. Insist on bodily autonomy. Resist the temptation to advocate in binary terms. It’s more than abortion. It’s about the freedom to parent, or not; birth your children with dignity and autonomy. 
The right to end a pregnancy on your own terms. And liberation to make these decisions without punishment. You can’t have your freedom and your fascists too.
Use your power — whether it’s your voice, your money, your time or your work — to demand, fund, and support solutions that end pregnancy punishment. 
On the cusp of a midterm election, be ready to see the same hollow promises and find the guts to challenge it with your vote and your voice. Let’s lock arms with one another and demand better from the leaders and institutions we fund and elect to represent our interests.",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_8060-1024x614.jpg,,,2025-12-18 06:59:16.554380

He is shown in May when he announced a special legislative session to consider disaster relief, stadium funding and spending items (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent).The capital gains tax cut passed this year by Missouri lawmakers will cost far more than expected and shrink state revenues, a new state budget estimate shows.
The consensus revenue estimate, issued Wednesday, anticipates that revenue in the year ending June 30 will be $400 million below estimates made a year ago. Growth will return for fiscal 2027, the estimate predicts, but the rebound will be modest, state Budget Director Dan Haug said in an interview with The Independent.
“The governor has been pretty transparent and pretty vocal that this is going to be a difficult budget year,” Haug said.
Gov. Mike Kehoe is scheduled to deliver his budget proposals on Jan. 13.
When lawmakers voted on the bill exempting profits from the sale of stocks and other assets from Missouri income tax, the official estimate put the revenue loss at about $160 million in the current fiscal year, with ongoing revenue losses at $111 million.
The state is now expecting a revenue loss in the current fiscal year of about $500 million from the cut, with an ongoing revenue loss of $360 million annually, Haug said. 
That is close to the approximately $600 million estimate for the loss from the left-leaning Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy and reported by The Independent — and disputed by the state revenue department — weeks before the final vote in May.
During the most recent complete fiscal year, Missouri collected $13.4 billion in general revenue. 
Through Tuesday, tax receipts for the year have grown 3.5%, enough to generate about $350 million in unanticipated revenue if continued through June 30 The capital gains tax cut, and to a smaller degree state tax impacts of federal changes, will help push the trend line into negative territory, with a contraction of 2.1% and total revenue of $13.15 billion.
“What we expect to happen is that most of the reduction from capital gains will occur in that February to April period when people start filing their returns,” Haug said.
The state does have a cushion to absorb the loss of revenue. 
For several years, Missouri has enjoyed historically large reserves of surplus cash. The surplus peaked at nearly $8 billion in June 2023. Large sums have been set aside for improvements to Interstates 70 and 44, a major expansion of the Capitol Building and construction projects on college campuses and elsewhere.
The state employee pension fund received a one-time injection of $500 million and state employees have seen pay raises of as much as 35% since the start of 2021.
And lawmakers have been able to earmark hundreds of millions for pet projects and programs, despite vetoes by Kehoe and his predecessor, Gov. Mike Parson, that cut many of the expenditures.
For the past three years, appropriations for ongoing programs have exceeded current revenue, with the shortfall coming from the surplus.
“We’ve sort of gotten a little out of what on ongoing expenditures versus ongoing revenues,” Haug said. “We need to get that back under control.”
Kehoe has said he will make eliminating the state income tax, which accounts for about 65% of general revenue, his top goal for 2026. 
The budget will be “challenging,” Kehoe said In the news release reporting the new revenue estimate
“Spending, not revenues, is the problem facing state government,” Kehoe said.
Republican budget leaders from the House and Senate, quoted in the news release, echoed Kehoe. Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Rusty Black of Chillicothe said he will “develop a fiscally responsible budget,” while House Budget Committee Chairman Dirk Deaton of Noel said his goal is to “deliver a sustainable budget.”
The top Democrat on the House Budget Committee, state Rep. Betsy Fogle of Springfield, said the state has problems that require attention — and money — and the issue is insufficient revenue, not overspending.
Democrats warned that the capital gains cut was being low-balled but had no power to stop it, Fogle said. Being correct doesn’t help fund services, she said.
“What helps me is making sure that my constituents have a strong social safety net, have access to good public schools and have a state government that is more focused on making proper investments in the next generation and less focused on winning a primary election,” Fogle said.
Issues that require immediate attention, Fogle said, include the growing number of people languishing in jail while they wait for state mental health evaluations and treatment, which has doubled in two years to nearly 500, and federal program changes that increase state costs for Medicaid and other benefits.
Lawmakers must also deal with department budget requests that have identified more than $1 billion in new costs to continue current programs. 
“Very few people in the General Assembly have been at the table when we’ve had to make drastic cuts,” Fogle said. “It’s very important that we do so in a thoughtful way that protects the core vital services of our departments.”
It would be irresponsible to eliminate the income tax, Fogle said. 
“I cannot believe we are having a good faith conversation about the elimination of the income tax and blowing a $9 billion hole in our state budget,” Fogle said.
For the past three years, appropriations for ongoing programs have exceeded current revenue, with the shortfall coming from the surplus.
“We’ve sort of gotten a little out of what on ongoing expenditures versus ongoing revenues,” Haug said. “We need to get that back under control.”
The current budget, after Kehoe’s vetoes, projects spending $15.7 billion in general revenue, about $2.6 billion more than the new estimate anticipates in revenue. 
Fogle said she is worried that the state will cut optional services for Medicaid recipients or reduce funding for higher education and public schools to align expenses with receipts.
Kehoe will include some surplus funds in his budget proposal, Haug said. 
“One nice thing about the fund balance we do have is it does let us try to solve this problem over a couple of years, versus having to solve it all in one year,” Haug said. “And so I think what you’re going to see with our budget this year is the beginning of that process, sort of reining in some of the spending.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/052725_kehoe2-1024x614.jpg,,,2025-12-18 06:59:16.554380

Among other similar critiques, the phrase “cultural and linguistic responsiveness” had triggered a hold on her request while she amended her language.
“Though it does not explicitly state the terms diversity, equity, or inclusion, the term ‘cultural and linguistic responsiveness’ can be seen as a similar word to DEI,” read a communication to Graves from the federal Office of Head Start, which lies within the Health and Human Services Department, headed by Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

“I knew it might be coming,” Graves said of the challenge to her application. “It’s kind of hard to know what words or phrases might trigger a question.”
But this particular query was surprising, Graves said, given that the language in question was drawn verbatim from federal Head Start performance standards, and further grounded in the program’s statutory mandates. 
Head Start is a federal program that provides child care, meals and other services to young children, parents and pregnant women who have an income below the federal poverty line. In Vermont, roughly 1,250 kids are enrolled in the program, of which advocates report roughly one-fifth are experiencing homelessness.
The complications with Graves’ application occurred in what was already a challenging time for many Head Start providers, with the government shutdown this fall causing funding delays across the program. Though Graves’ grant was nearly a month late, her organization was able to avoid layoffs or service freezes, with the Vermont Department for Children and Families offering no-interest loan options to Head Start providers as a backstop.
As programs in Vermont continue to apply for their annual federal funding allocations this year, they have encountered significant changes to how federal agencies are handling such requests. While national Head Start leadership remains confident in the program’s stability, Vermont providers are expressing concern about how such modifications will affect them.
This focus on ensuring that federal funds do not support DEI-related programming has become par for the course, according to Tommy Sheridan, deputy director of the nonprofit National Head Start Association.
The messaging around DEI under President Donald Trump’s administration, Sheridan said, has been a “180 degree difference” from the policies set out by President Joe Biden’s administration.
“The Office of Head Start will not approve the use of federal funding for any training and technical assistance (TTA) or other program expenditures that promote or take part in diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives,” read federal guidance Graves received in March.
But in practice, Sheridan said, determining the details of what this shift means has often been challenging for providers.
“We have not really received effective guidance at this point from the (Trump) administration about what they’re looking for,” he said Monday.
Christy Swenson, who chairs the board of the Vermont Head Start Association and directs the Head Start Program at Capstone Community Action in Barre, said guidance from the federal level has not only been unclear but at times also contradictory to law.
“Many of the guidances that have been provided over the last nine months are directly in opposition to the Head Start Act,” she said in an interview earlier this month. 
It’s a potential conflict that has drawn national attention in recent months, as Head Start associations in a handful of states sued the Trump administration earlier this year for alleged violations of the 2007 Head Start Act.
“We have to follow the law,” Swenson added. “I’m sure there are a lot of programs (that) are confused.”

Swenson and Sheridan said they had heard a number of reports that artificial intelligence had been used to complete application screenings. Federal communication to Graves referred to a “manual review” of certain phrases in her application, leaving an open question about what other, initial methods were used to screen the document.
While the use of AI would be a concern in itself, Swenson said, that practice would be part of a larger movement toward a new kind of federal application review that is simultaneously more cursory and more targeted.
Swenson said under the Biden administration, funding request screenings were extremely detailed. In-depth budgets would generate dozens of questions from officials each cycle, she said, with multiple follow-ups over the course of the year to ensure compliance. 
Without that oversight, Swenson said, she’s concerned that a small number of programs could begin to misuse funds, which could nonetheless “really darken the reputation of all Head Start programs.”
Graves said a small handful of DEI-related queries were the only questions she received from the Office of Head Start this year. 
The new process also comes after significant layoffs of federal workers from the Office of Head Start earlier this year, Swenson noted.
Graves said the mandatory revisions she had made to her organization’s budget request were essentially semantic. Her team, she said, is “complying to the (federal) directives while still carrying out the individualized services to children and families.”
She received her funding award shortly after making those changes to her applications.
What “cultural and linguistic responsiveness” actually means for Graves is individualizing her organization’s support for each family, she said. Champlain Valley Head Start provides not just early childhood education, but also home visits for young families and translation assistance when necessary, among other programs.
“We live in a very, you know, culturally diverse setting here in Burlington, Vermont,” Graves said. “We will continue to provide those services.”
Swenson agreed, citing the Head Start Act once again.
“Really at the heart of its intent,” she said, “is that we meet families where they’re at.”
Sheridan, the deputy director of the National Head Start Association, said he had heard from the Office of Head Start that the changes in application requirements were designed to streamline and “simplify” the review process. The changes, while “a little bit of a surprise,” hadn’t had harmful results for programs so far, he said, though his team will be monitoring the situation closely.
But the new guidance surrounding DEI has affected this year’s funding application process significantly, he said, with programs like Graves’ frequently having requests returned.
“We’ve had to go one way, and now we’re having to go the absolute opposite direction,” he said.
Nonetheless, Sheridan said he was confident in Head Start’s stability, despite suggestions earlier in the year that the Trump administration might attempt to eliminate the program.
“Head Start has continued to have strong bipartisan support,” Sheridan said. “Policymakers trust us — they know that Head Start has strong evidence of its effectiveness.”

(Getty Images)As Indiana lawmakers prepare to reconvene in January for a shortened 2026 legislative session, multiple Republican legislators have filed bills to expand how the state carries out death sentences — reopening a debate over capital punishment that stalled in the Statehouse earlier this year.
At the heart of two bills — one in the House and another in the Senate — are additional execution options beyond lethal injection, which is currently the only method authorized under Indiana law.
Senate Bill 11, authored by Indianapolis Republican Sen. Mike Young, would allow Indiana to use a firing squad to carry out executions under certain circumstances.
Under Young’s proposal, the death penalty could be inflicted by firing squad if the Department of Correction determines — at least 30 days before a scheduled execution — that it is unable to conduct an execution by lethal injection due to the unavailability of required drugs.
The bill would also allow a condemned person to request execution by firing squad at least 30 days before the scheduled date.
Separately a House bill authored by Republican Reps. Jim Lucas of Seymour and Andrew Ireland of Indianapolis, would allow executions to be carried out by either firing squad or nitrogen hypoxia. Lucas said lethal injection would remain the default method, but condemned individuals could request an alternative.
Story continues below.
20251216111200206
 
The Indiana Capital Chronicle obtained a copy of the bill which was filed this week but as of late Wednesday had not yet been published on the General Assembly’s website where all filed bills are publicly accessible.
“It’s a simple bill,” Lucas told the Capital Chronicle. “We’re going to go with drugs as the first option,” Lucas said. “But if (the condemned) want to choose one of these other options, they can.”
Lucas said the measure was drafted in collaboration with DOC officials and is driven largely by the state’s difficulty securing lethal injection drugs and the cost associated with executions. In the last year, Indiana officials paid up to $300,000 for a single dose of pentobarbital.
He said the goal is to align Indiana’s exertion protocols with other states and the federal government, and that his bill “was an ask from the White House.”
Could legislation pass — or stalemate?
Young’s legislation additionally details procedures for firing squad executions, requiring a five-member team made up of DOC officers selected by the prison warden.
Four officers would fire weapons containing live ammunition, while one would fire a weapon containing a blank round, with firearms loaded in a way that prevents squad members from knowing which ammunition they are firing. The bill would also shield the identities of firing squad members from public disclosure and legal discovery.
Currently, five states authorize the use of firing squads under certain circumstances: Idaho, Utah, Oklahoma, Mississippi, and South Carolina.
Nine states permit executions by lethal gas, but only five — Alabama, Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi and Oklahoma — specifically autho­rize death by nitro­gen hypox­ia, a process that deprives inmates of oxygen using nitrogen gas.

So far, Alabama and Louisiana are the only states that have per­formed exe­cu­tions by nitrogen gas, according to the Death Penalty Information Center.
Lawmakers are set to reconvene Jan. 5.
Republican leadership has not yet said where the supermajority caucuses in either chamber stand on new legislation, or if the bills will get committee hearings during the short session, which is scheduled to conclude by the end of February following redistricting debates in December.
The proposed bills follow more than a year of concerns over the state’s ongoing difficulty obtaining lethal injection drugs. The problem that has delayed executions nationwide and prompted states to revisit alternative methods.
Indiana has spent more than $1 million over the last year to procure pentobarbital, and Gov. Mike Braun said previously that the state has faced difficulties accessing the lethal injection drug.
But when asked earlier this week about pending death penalty legislation, the Republican governor struck a cautious tone.
“Even though I’m anticipating that there might be some stuff there — I’ll look at that,” Braun said, referring to death penalty bills. But he added that such measures “don’t rise to the level of other issues,” such as lowering health care costs and passing reforms related to education and utilities.

“If it comes up,” he continued, “then I’ll view it on the merits at the time.”
Hoosier prosecutors, meanwhile, have urged lawmakers to preserve the death penalty as an option. 
Vicki Becker, the Elkhart County prosecutor speaking on behalf of the Association of Indiana Prosecuting Attorneys, said prosecutors oppose removing capital punishment as a tool — regardless of how the legislature ultimately structures it.
“State of Indiana, prosecutors don’t want to lose tools. They don’t want to lose tools,” Becker said. “And in the grand scheme of things, when we have cases that truly are the worst of the worst, we need to have those tools.”
Becker said prosecutors will serve as subject-matter experts as lawmakers debate the issue but emphasized that the final decision rests with the General Assembly.
Opposition mounts, too
Opposition to the death penalty has also intensified. 
On Tuesday, more than 70 handwritten letters from pastors and members of Indianapolis First Friends and Shalom Zone, a self-described interfaith group, were delivered to the governor’s office calling for abolition. Braun briefly met with the group and promised a more formal conversation would follow.
“Like so many Hoosiers, 23 other states, and the entire European Union, we believe the death penalty should be abolished,” said Jodie English, a Quaker who helped organize the letter drive.
Braun — whose administration oversaw two executions in 2025 — has called on lawmakers to take up the issue but has stopped short of endorsing any specific execution methods.
The governor has pointed to South Carolina, however, which recently reinstated the firing squad as an option after years of delays due to its inability to obtain lethal injection drugs.
In June, Braun disclosed that Indiana officials spent $1.175 million on lethal injection doses over the past year — $600,000 of which was spent on drugs that expired before use. The cost has been between $275,000 and $300,000 per dose.
But Braun’s office has since refused to disclose how much the state paid for the latest three sets of lethal injection drugs purchased by the DOC in recent months. At least one of those doses was used for Roy Ward’s execution in October.
Braun has maintained, too, that the high cost and short shelf life of the drug should prompt new discussions on how the state approaches capital punishment moving forward.
Lawmakers failed to advance several death-penalty-related proposals during the 2025 session, including a Republican-backed bill to abolish the death penalty altogether.
‘A hell of a lot less expensive’ than lethal injection: Could Indiana approve firing squads?

That proposal drew some bipartisan support in both chambers but never received a committee hearing. At the time, House Speaker Todd Huston and Senate President Pro Tem Rodric Bray said the issue lacked sufficient consensus to move forward during an already hectic session.
Lucas said he’s confident that his bill will receive a hearing in the House and advance out of the chamber, but he was less certain about its prospects in the Senate.
“I absolutely refuse to predict what the Senate is going to do on anything,” he said. “I’m over in the House. I’m working the House side. That’s my focus right now.”
Five men remain on Indiana’s death row at the state prison in Michigan City. Since December 2024, the state has carried out death sentences for three inmates: Joseph Corcoran, Benjamin Ritchie and Ward. Corcoran’s marked Indiana’s first executions in more than a decade. 
The state has not requested execution dates for any of the remaining death row inmates.
“We’re not relitigating the death penalty or anything like that,” Lucas said. “And we want to keep this as humane and efficient as possible, for all parties involved.”

(Photo by Dana DiFilippo/New Jersey Monitor)One in seven people who died in New Jersey’s state prisons since 2018 died of “unnatural causes” including overdoses, suicides, homicides, and accidents, a state watchdog found in a new report.
Investigators from the Office of the Corrections Ombudsperson found that 336 people died in state Department of Corrections custody between 2018 and 2024, with medical examiners attributing most — 83% — to natural causes.
While the number of deaths held fairly steady at an average of 41 per year (excluding a pandemic-related spike in 2020), the prison population fell by a third from over 19,000 in 2018 to under 13,000 last year, the report notes. That means the overall death rate rose over that time.

Of deaths deemed unnatural, 20 people fatally overdosed, 13 died by suicide, six were murdered, and eight died of accidents (including falls and one accidental choking believed to be related to drug use or medical issues), researchers found. Most unnatural deaths occurred at Northern State Prison in Newark and New Jersey State Prison in Trenton. Nine people who died were 25 or younger, with the youngest just 20. Eight of those deaths were ruled unnatural, the report notes.
Of natural deaths, 48 were attributed to COVID-19 and 172 others to cardiac issues, cancer, and respiratory or pulmonary diseases, the report says. Most occurred in hospitals. About a third were receiving end-of-life or advanced nursing care in an extended care unit at South Woods State Prison in Bridgeton.
A Department of Corrections spokesman did not respond to a request for comment.
Investigators examined only death trends and did not assess preventative or emergency responses by the state Department of Corrections or medical providers, incident reports, patients’ medical records, or the department’s process of assessingthe morbidity and mortality of people in its custody.
The findings are meant to allow the public, policymakers, and prison administrators “to have an initial understanding of the big picture, ask questions, flag concerning trends, and engage in a policy discussion about how to prevent deaths in the future,” said Terry Schuster, the state corrections ombudsperson.
Schuster recommended that the Department of Corrections begin publicly reporting on deaths in custody, including “contextual information” about the people who died and the causes, circumstances, and locations of deaths.
“There are many reasons why publicizing information about people who have died in state prisons is critical,” Schuster wrote. “Doing so may help create transparency for the public, queue up important questions for prison officials and health care providers, understand the scale of an epidemic, and draw needed attention to facilities or custody settings where unnatural deaths or other preventable deaths are occurring in larger numbers.”

The incident took place on May 27 and involved a youth at the Jonathan Delagrave Youth Development and Care Center in Caledonia.  The video appears to show four staff […],"A screenshot from a video released by the Wisconsin State Public Defender that shows a youth in detention being restrained and beaten by staff at the Jonathan Delagrave Youth Development and Care Center in Caledonia on May 27, 2025. The Wisconsin State Public Defenders Office released a video Tuesday of an incident involving a staff member repeatedly punching a then-15-year-old at a juvenile detention center.
The Wisconsin Examiner’s Criminal Justice Reporting Project shines a light on incarceration, law enforcement and criminal justice issues with support from the Public Welfare Foundation.
The incident took place on May 27 and involved a youth at the Jonathan Delagrave Youth Development and Care Center in Caledonia.
 The video appears to show four staff members directing him to move from a spot by a wall in a hallway, possibly to a nearby room, and Elliott not moving. After a staff member swung at him, the situation devolved into a struggle. Elliott was struck repeatedly by staff before and after he was on the ground.
The incident occurred less than a month after the 48-bed facility opened on May 1, the State Public Defenders Office (SPD) said. According to the SPD, the teen had bruises, swelling on his right eye, blurred vision and headaches, scrapes and cuts and dried blood in his ear, based on records from evaluations arranged by the facility. 
“To the parents who have kids in a detention center, check on your babies,” said Kianna Reed, his mother.
The SPD wants its client immediately transferred from the facility and placed in a group home “where he can receive specialized therapy and support.”
“The people in this video should have never been entrusted with caring for children. This is a sickening act of violence,” State Public Defender Jennifer Bias said in a statement. 
The family is looking for an attorney for a civil lawsuit against Racine County, the SPD said.

In the SPD release, Reed said that “seeing that video and knowing my son is still in that facility is terrifying,” and that “the staff need proper training and accountability.”
In a statement emailed to the Examiner, a Racine County spokesperson described the publicly released video as a partial record of a longer incident  and said that staff’s interaction with the youth took place over several minutes. It said the youth clenched his fists and made multiple threats of physical violence to other juveniles and staff.
“Maintaining the safety of youth and staff in our facilities is our highest priority,” Amberlyn Yohn, administrator of youth rehabilitation services, said in the county’s statement. “Situations like this are complex and unfold quickly. While one employee’s actions became the focus of this incident, our broader team followed established protocols and cooperated fully with the review process.”
The county commits to making sure staff have the training, oversight and support needed for managing difficult situations, Yohn said.
The “primarily involved staff member” was immediately placed on administrative leave after the incident and resigned within three days, Racine County said in a statement emailed to the Examiner. According to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, his name is Robert Knight, and he told the Journal Sentinel his actions were justified based on Elliott’s history at the center. He disputed that he resigned because of the investigation.
A different worker seen repeatedly striking the teen was ordered to complete eight hours of remedial training and appears to still be employed at the facility, according to the public defender’s office. Three of the four staff members involved are still employed at the center, according to the public defender’s office, which obtained records showing the staff’s employment status.
Knight said her son was displaying signs of aggression at the time of the incident, according to the Journal Sentinel. He said he intended to force the boy back rather than strike him.
The teen had been found guilty of charges of retail theft and obstructing an officer.
A new alternative
Efforts to close the Lincoln Hills facility have not yet proven successful, and its location makes it difficult for youth there to maintain contact with their community and families.
Years after a 2017 lawsuit filed over abuses, Gov. Tony Evers announced in October that the state had reached full compliance with all of the court-ordered reforms. The Department of Corrections’ website describes plans to build smaller facilities and keep youth closer to home.
In addition, the state has awarded money to counties to establish Secure Residential Care Centers for Children and Youth (SRCCCY). Milwaukee’s is expected to open in 2026; Racine’s is the only one that is currently open. The county website says it provides a “structured and rehabilitative environment for male youth.”
The facility was built as an alternative to the Lincoln Hills and Copper Lake youth prisons, the SPD said in its release. Some juvenile offenders can now go to the facility instead of Lincoln Hills, Eileen Fredericks, the SPD’s youth defense practice coordinator, told the Examiner.
Fredericks said that “we only have one, and then shortly after it opens, we have this really serious incident.”
The county’s website says that youth are placed in the SRCCCY under a statute that requires that the youth committed an act that would carry a sentence of six months or more if the youth were an adult. The youth also must have been found to be a danger to the public and in need of restrictive custodial treatment.
In the weeks before the facility opened in May, the Racine County Eye reported that officials said the center is a more cost-effective and compassionate alternative to state-run youth correctional facilities such as Lincoln Hills.
According to the public defender’s office, at the time of the incident, the teen was a few weeks into a five and a half-month period of participation in the SRCCCY’s RISE-UP program. He has been in detention consistently since December 2024, the SPD office said.
In the SPD’s release, Bias argued that building “shiny new prisons” won’t prevent situations like what happened to the teen. 
“We need meaningful reforms to the way our children are treated in the juvenile justice system,” Bias said. “We need judges who will prioritize alternatives to incarceration and detention workers who value care over punishment.”
Fredericks said she wants “these kids to be seen as kids” and that “there’s kind of this mindset that they’re less than kids, because they’ve done something wrong.”
Transparency concern
Bias accused the county of seeking to “sweep this incident under the rug.” The public defender’s office called for a “full-scale” investigation into conditions at the facility and the qualifications of staff members who interact with children. 
Reed told the Examiner she did not see any of the video released Tuesday by the SPD until October. 
In its statement, the county said that immediately after the May 27 incident, the mother of the youth and the Wisconsin Department of Corrections were notified. The Examiner reached out to the DOC and was told that the Jonathan Delagrave facility is county-run, and questions regarding personnel or those housed there are best directed to Racine County. 
The county said important privacy protections for juveniles must be respected, but that the county has been and remains transparent in its response to the incident. 
Law enforcement and independent human services agencies fully investigated and reviewed the incident, the county said. The details of the investigation and relevant video were provided to the Racine County District Attorney’s Office, which declined to pursue prosecution, the county said.
Warning: the video released by the Wisconsin State Public Defender’s Office contains graphic footage of violence against a child.

WyoFile digs into Wyoming’s 84-page Rural Health Transformation Project application, examining proposals that include nursing grants, EMS incentives and a state-run insurance plan.
The post What’s in Wyoming’s application for up to $800M in federal health funds? appeared first on WyoFile .","With the smallest population in the country spread over a huge area, Wyoming’s rural health care gaps are acute. Patients drive long distances for care; hospitals struggle to hire medical professionals and health care is expensive — even with insurance.
These realities underscore a huge opportunity looming for the state. Wyoming is vying to receive up to $800 million in federal funds over five years for initiatives designed to innovate and revolutionize its rural health care system. 
The Rural Health Transformation Program, a new federal initiative created by President Donald Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act, is designed to funnel $50 billion to states over five years to stabilize and strengthen rural hospitals and providers. The program aims to offset a portion of the federal funds for health care that were cut in the Beautiful Bill. Wyoming submitted its application in November and should learn its fate at the end of the year.
There’s no guarantee Wyoming’s initiatives will be fully funded. But a dive into the 84-page application reveals both compelling data about the state of health care here and an innovative array of proposals aimed to bolster it.
Proposed initiatives take many forms. They include incentives for small rural hospitals to provide basic services and cut extraneous ones that can be performed at regional facilities; grants for clinical workforce training programs and five-year commitments from grads; a state-run insurance plan for catastrophic events; and permanent, investment-generated revenue to prop up the industry.
The community engagement involved and breadth of proposals in the Department of Health’s application are impressive, said Healthy Wyoming Executive Director Jenn Lowe, whose work advocating for health care access often makes her skeptical of state policy. 
“The Department of Health did a superb job in pulling this application together in a brief amount of time,” Lowe said. “It is analytically strong. It is data driven, and it is grounded in community input. It comes up with some innovative solutions” and has gone beyond many other states from a transparency standpoint. 
However, Lowe said, there are some vulnerabilities, and the implementation window for deploying what could be an enormous tranche of funding is very short — which concerns her. 
What’s in it 
The application opens by describing the particular characteristics responsible for such steep challenges in Wyoming. 
Wyoming’s census-designated “frontier” areas comprise most of the state in terms of both area and population — approximately 253,000 people, or 44% of the population, live in frontier areas. That’s compared to 30% in rural areas and 26% in urban cores, the application states.

Populations in the frontier areas are also disproportionately older — meaning care needs are higher in those areas. In addition, services are more sparse and emergency response times longer in these lightly populated places. 
Areas of concern range from Wyoming’s high suicide rate to an anticipated jump in uninsured residents to a notable erosion of maternity care services. 
“Our biggest challenge lies in access to basic medical care,” the application states in identifying its top priority.  
Other priorities include building up the state’s health care workforce, improving residents’ metabolic, cardiovascular and behavioral health and using technology to improve chronic disease management and bring care closer to home. Here are some of the initiatives proposed to address those priorities:

Build cooperative agreements for EMS agencies to work together on a regional basis, using regional dispatch to coordinate things like interfacility transfers.
Create financial incentives to persuade small designated “Critical Access Hospitals” to focus on essential community services of an emergency department, an ambulance service and a delivery facility for babies. Currently, small hospitals sometimes opt to close delivery facilities, which are not profitable, but continue to offer other, more lucrative procedures. 
Establish a state-operated public insurance plan, dubbed “BearCare,” that would cover health care emergencies, such as a car crash or a bear attack, for dues-paying members. 
Bolster the medical workforce by offering grants for Wyoming educational institutions to do things like hire faculty or develop career pipelines.
Fund, in perpetuity, an annual number of awards to cover educational costs for individuals interested in joining one of four clinical pipelines: nursing, EMS, behavioral health and physician.
Add more slots to Wyoming’s existing accredited programs for post-graduate medical education, likely in new sites. 
Implement the Presidential Fitness Test in Wyoming’s primary and secondary schools. 
Limit the state’s SNAP benefits to healthy food purchases, not including things like sodas and candy. 
Stand up a grant process for technology that promises to improve care delivery closer to home or build systems that can work across providers.

At the core of Wyoming’s sustainability plan, the application reads, “is the establishment of a dedicated, purpose-driven, and actively-managed Wyoming Health Transformation Perpetuity.” 
Similar to Wyoming’s Permanent Mineral Trust Fund, this “perpetuity” would use investments to continually generate revenue for health care programs, the application says.
The application’s vision is sprawling and ambitious. Implementing it will require manpower. With almost 1,400 employees in four divisions, the Wyoming health department is a “superagency” that’s well-equipped for the challenge, the application states. 
“We have a lot of infrastructure in the department that does this kind of stuff already,” said Franz Fuchs, WDH deputy director and the application’s lead author. The department would also anticipate hiring around 13 contractors to help with the load, he said.

The public process confirmed what the Health Department has suspected for some time, Fuchs said, which is that a fundamental mismatch between fixed health care costs and Wyoming’s rural volume is at the heart of many of its needs. 
“And so we’re really trying to target these really big economic problems,” he said, rather than proposing more gimmicky and short-term fixes. 
What now
The process began in September, when Wyoming Department of Health staff kicked off eight in-person and three virtual meetings to gather feedback. The state received 1,300 responses to an online survey it circulated. The application was then drawn up and submitted by the Nov. 5 deadline.
“It was definitely a tight timeline,” Fuchs said. The ultimate product, he said, reflects the community feedback received during the meetings as well as stakeholder meetings with groups like hospital CEOs, long-term care facility managers and representatives of the Northern Arapaho and Eastern Shoshone tribes. 
“We definitely let the public process, the public feedback we received, drive everything,” he said.
The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services is expected to announce its funding decisions by Dec. 31. The way Fuchs understands it, the feds can ultimately pick and choose which parts of the application to fund — rather than approving or denying the entire thing.

It’s impossible to say how much Wyoming will receive, but health news outlet KFF anticipates the state is looking at $750 million. 
A federal announcement, however, won’t spell the end of the process. The Wyoming Legislature, which has shown skepticism of the size and breadth of the health department, will have to appropriate the funds. There are also some statutory requirements, such as the creation of the perpetuity and other state policy changes. More significant initiatives, such as BearCare, would likely require standalone approval, Fuchs said.
Worries and hopes 
Even with the initiatives still in the application phase, opinions are emerging about the appropriateness and feasibility of Wyoming’s Rural Health Transformation proposals. 
The Legislature’s Joint Appropriations Committee just wrapped up two weeks of budget meetings. As lawmakers reviewed the Health Department’s numbers, lawmakers discussed the application. One proposal that lawmakers frowned upon was the state-run catastrophic health insurance plan. 
“I’m struggling with how we should go into the free market,” said Rep. John Bear, R-Gillette, who has no relation to the name BearCare. “I’m not inclined to want to compete in the private sector. I don’t think it’s the proper role of government to do so.”
Bear was also skeptical of the proposed perpetuity’s ability to keep pace with ever-rising health costs and remain effective.

The BearCare proposal is coming at a time when many in Wyoming are bracing for the country’s largest spikes in Affordable Care Act prices. Affordability of insurance in general was the No. 2 concern that came up during the public process, WDE Director Stefan Johansson told the committee. 
Freedom Caucus lawmakers on the appropriations panel derisively called BearCare “GordonCare” in a reference to Gov. Mark Gordon, who has supported the state’s application process. 
“Families, seniors, and communities are stronger when they are healthy and have reasonable access to healthcare,” Gordon said in a budget message statement last week. “We must maintain access to safety net services for all Wyoming communities, including quality care for children, seniors, people with developmental disabilities, and others who lack physical or financial means.”
Lowe of Healthy Wyoming said that while it’s promising, the implementation piece of the plan worries her. It’s a big ask for an agency that is facing likely cuts. 
“I think that there are many moving parts that must align — legislatively, operationally and across different provider types on a pretty short implementation window,” Lowe said. The biggest obstacle, she added, may very well be found in the Wyoming Legislature. 
“There’s so much discord in the state Capitol these days that we have this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, and I’m afraid we’re going to squander it a little bit,” Lowe said.

Laramie County commissioners selected Fornstrom to represent a House seat vacated by the late John Eklund.
The post A Q&A with Pine Bluffs’ Justin Fornstrom, Wyoming’s newest state lawmaker appeared first on WyoFile .","Rep. Justin Fornstrom was sworn in Tuesday as a state lawmaker, filling a vacancy in House District 10 left by John Eklund, who died in November after a battle with cancer. 
House District 10 encompasses a central section of Laramie County and its southeast corner and includes the towns of Albin, Burns and Pine Bluffs. 
Fornstrom, a Republican, is the former mayor of Pine Bluffs, where his family has been based for generations. A rancher and business owner, he graduated from high school in 1990 and earned a bachelor’s degree from the University of Wyoming in 1995. Soon after college, Fornstrom started a farming operation with his dad and brother. He and his wife, Kara, have a daughter. 
Fornstrom spent about 16 years on the Laramie County Fire Board, mostly as president, and was elected Pine Bluffs mayor in 2021. 
WyoFile spoke with Fornstrom by phone on Wednesday following his swearing in. 
This interview has been edited for length and clarity. —Ed. 
WyoFile: Starting about halfway through the term, how are you preparing for the job and the upcoming budget session?
Rep. Justin Fornstrom: Well, I’ve been working with [the Legislative Service Office], they do a great deal of training. I actually had training all day yesterday. None of it was about the budget, just about practical things. But they have a great deal of content, which I’ve just kind of really scratched the surface of, but intend to drill down here as we go. But a lot of good budget training, the interim committee work is all archived, and so they’re very helpful and that’s what they’re charged with doing. Any bit of background or help I need in that area, they’ve been very gracious about supplying, and to be honest with you, I’ve just really got rolling in that process. So I think I’m behind the eight ball, for sure, just on a time basis, but I fully intend to devote the time and get up to speed to the best of my ability, and look forward to putting in the work and being as informed as I can going to the session. In addition to that, just speaking to other representatives, lawmakers, people who are familiar with the process has been very helpful. So I look forward to taking input from wherever I can get [it] to do the best job I can for the people in House District 10 and the state of Wyoming. 
WF: What encouraged you to serve in House District 10?
JF: Frankly, it hadn’t really occurred to me to do this. I had a great deal of respect for John as a legislator and a good man in general, a good community man, and a good family man. So it never really occurred to me that he wouldn’t be there, so I hadn’t given it a lot of thought. But after his passing, I got a lot of encouragement from people around me that felt like I would be able to do a good job. So there was some struggles, and a little bit in that decision making. But really it was just about an opportunity to serve a greater number of people and all those folks in House District 10, as well as the state of Wyoming, and maybe have an opportunity to influence some of the policies statewide. It was a general interest in it, but also a desire to serve. And so even as mayor, on the fire board, I’ve always had a desire to give back to the community or to the area, and maybe now the state, and so I put my name in and just kind of let things end up where they got. 
WF: You mentioned serving as mayor of Pine Bluffs. What did you learn from the experience of serving in local government?
JF: Well, my background really is in management. So being a mayor is — much of it is a management job. But also, you get to learn the inner workings of various levels of government from the bottom up. And [I] spent a lot of time working with the county, some special districts, other municipalities, other organizations in the state, and understanding where money comes from for municipal government. And just really kind of honed some skills about budgeting and revenue and some of that, obviously, on a different scale than statewide budgeting, but the principles are similar. And learned a lot about how important those financial sources are to do good work for the people of your community, and what it takes to access those and figuring out how to best be responsible with those funds for the greater good of your community. 
WF: Speaking of local government — in recent years, lawmakers have made several changes to residential property taxes, including a 25% cut. And there’s now a discussion to eliminate residential property taxes and to raise sales taxes to replace that resulting revenue loss for local governments. From your perspective, what do you think are some of the appropriate next steps for lawmakers to take?
JF: It’s pretty early on for me, but I can tell you I don’t want to speak to, nor do I know about all of the discussions that have taken place surrounding this. I more or less sat on the sideline and watched, so I don’t feel like I have the full set of information to understand everybody’s train of thought on this. However, I also know that these cuts are difficult for municipalities and county governments and special districts, for sure, and so I guess I would say that I would like to see maybe more discussions surrounding what those cuts look like. I mean, what do they actually look like to the people when they happen? I’m in the same boat on this, I’m a taxpayer, a citizen as well, and so I understand the sentiment and this kind of quick rise we had in property taxes, perhaps, is faster than anyone would have liked. And obviously, I see the need for certain areas of that to get some tax relief, but I also think, simultaneously, you have to inform the public about what that looks like, what reduced taxes looks like in terms of reduced services. And I don’t think you can have one conversation without having the other. But if the conversation is more or less just about cutting your property taxes, well, of course, myself and everyone else in the state is going to be in favor of that. Everyone would like to keep their taxes at least reasonable.  Zero [residential property taxes] is also, as you mentioned, on the table. So if you don’t know how that’s going to impact your daily life in your community or your county, then that’s a pretty easy decision to make. But if you’re armed with more facts, perhaps we all come to a different decision about the need to completely eliminate property taxes.

WF: Switching gears a little bit — lawmakers have also spent a lot of time in recent years aiming to overhaul the state’s election system. From your perspective, do Wyoming’s elections need improvements?
JF: So my feeling is Wyoming has one of the safest, straightforward election systems in the country. I will say this, I’m not fully versed on everything that was put forward in the interim, and so I don’t want to speak to individual bills. But just on the whole, we have a safe system. I think we did the low-hanging fruit, and now we’re maybe starting to get into areas that are more difficult for the average person to understand why we’re still trying to shore up problems that aren’t readily seen. And that’s a pretty political answer, but I would say I just don’t want to comment a lot, because there’s quite a few additional proposed changes coming our way, and I would need to review all of those, and haven’t at this point, but I generally think we have a good, safe election system as it stands today. And so I would need to be more informed and probably convinced that we have continuing issues that need to be resolved.
WF: Generally speaking, are there areas that you would like to see lawmakers focus more of their attention on?
JF: Obviously, the budget, as a newtimer, is my primary focus — to learn, understand and make responsible votes about the budget. Then there’s our state’s energy sector, another spot where we have legacy energy sectors that we need to support and that’s a pretty complex issue. There’s a lot of things going on in that space, including a greater focus on nuclear. And as I’ve said in other forums, we’re blessed with our great natural resource of uranium in Wyoming. And how do we best use that? Does it all need to leave the state? Or should we be adding value to it here in Wyoming? And the jobs that that might create, I think that’s a pretty interesting topic. And how communities feel about uranium and nuclear energy can be controversial, and I think we need to take a really hard look at what that would mean to our state in terms of revenue and in terms of jobs, and so those are a couple issues. The last thing I would say is, what we do to promote business in Wyoming, those type of activities, and what the most effective way to do that, and the jobs that the businesses provide and quality of life for our citizens and hopefully potentially stop or reduce the out-migration of our young people by just having a really, really good climate for business and the jobs it does bring.
WF: What else would you like your constituents to know about you?
JF: Just that I’m a person that enjoys learning, enjoys hearing different perspectives, that I have a pretty even personality and like to make good, solid, informed decisions. And I come from an agricultural background and Speaker [Chip] Neiman was gracious enough to give me John’s [committee] assignments in Agriculture and Select Water. And so I feel like I bring some value to those. But I’m interested in other facets of what goes on in our state, and I do enjoy the process of understanding issues and feel like I am pretty even-handed and like to make decisions as such. And so my intention, in addition to the statewide issues, is that House District 10 has its own things going, and much of that is agriculture and just general citizen issues and other things. Really, my objective is to represent House District 10, much like John did. I can only aspire to do a good enough job to live up to his example as a legislator and as a family man, and all those things. That’s my objective.

Being socially reserved has its place, but it shouldn't come at the expense of telling the truth, writes columnist David Romtvedt. 
The post Telling my wife I love her appeared first on WyoFile .","“Oh, my god,” my friend says, rushing up to me, “Did you hear about the Norwegian farmer?”

Opinion

“No, what?” I ask.
“He said he loves his wife so much he almost told her.”
This is the kind of joke I heard growing up in a Norwegian-American family. It’s one of many light-hearted critiques of Scandinavian reserve. Another of these jokes I heard defined the difference between Norwegian introverts and extroverts — introverts look at their shoes when they talk to you, while extroverts look at your shoes.
This famous Norwegian reserve is part of a broader cultural sensibility we often attach to Americans of northern European Protestant Christian backgrounds. The Minnesota writer Carol Bly, who worked for the National Farmers Union, published an entire book — “Letters from the Country” — in which she sought to understand and articulate some of the reasons why we often feel lonely and dissatisfied. One of the things Bly noted was that Midwestern mothers taught their children three rules above all: be nice; think nice things; and if you can’t say something nice, don’t say anything. That is, be reserved.
Of course, as Bly knew, we should try to be nice — don’t be rude to people. But the rule to think nice things — that’s never going to fly. Still, our thoughts can stay inside us, so perhaps we can modify this to say, “don’t cling to your cruel thoughts and don’t act on them.” It’s rule No. 3 that worried Bly the most, for in saying nothing, we often repress truths that need to be told for our own good and the good of those around us. Sometimes the truth really will set us free.
I have a friend who came to Wyoming after living much of her life in New York City, where she said people met regularly and talked about everything, including their fears, their anger, their doubts — in short, their feelings. If they couldn’t meet in person, they talked on the phone. “Every day,” my friend told me, “Talk, talk, talk about everything. We knew each other. Here in Wyoming, you could live next door to someone for 10 years and know almost nothing about them. Hello, hello and that’s that, plenty said.”
While my friend’s experience may be at the extreme end of our culture of reserve, it’s not completely inaccurate. I, too, have noticed that it can be hard to get to know people. Another friend told me that when he moved to Wyoming, people asked him which church he would attend. When he explained that he was not a churchgoer, he was then asked how he thought he was going to make friends. Staying in our own closed spheres is another part of reserve.
One thing that happens when we practice too much reserve is that minor disagreements and social conflicts get bottled up. Time goes by, and we’re jamming more and more of these pieces of discord into the bottle until one day it can’t hold anything else and we explode. We go to meetings where people shout obscenities at one another, where someone gets shoved or punched. Our annoyances, kept in check for too long, become rage — and then, watch out.
I was once at a rather fancy dinner party here in Wyoming where people got to arguing about politics. I expressed views that another person disagreed with and as we talked, the person suddenly stopped and asked me, “Where are you from?”
“What does where I’m from have to do with the subject?”
“Where are you from?”
“Really, it has nothing to do with…”
“Where are you from?” The person asked yet again with barely withheld fury.
“Well, I live here in Wyoming but I was born in Oregon and grew up in Arizona.”
“Born in Oregon — that’s just the East Coast on the West Coast.”
That was the end of the talk, as my place of birth was enough to indicate that whatever I said was not worthy of consideration. It was as if I’d drunk dangerous thoughts with my mother’s milk.
All these little vignettes are related in that they deal with how we understand reserve and its link to both politeness and social conflict. I think Carol Bly is right in arguing for telling the truth, while I recognize that we can’t tell all the truth all the time. Maybe in those moments when the truth won’t serve anyone, reserve is the best option. But really, reserve’s limitations or possibilities aside, that Norwegian farmer should tell his wife he loves her.

(Photo courtesy of Aranda congressional campaign)In Miguel Aranda’s bid to be the Democratic nominee for Congress in Wisconsin’s 1st Congressional District, the college administrator says he brings a variety of assets.
One is local political experience. In his second term on the Whitewater School District school board, he serves as vice president. Board elections are nonpartisan.
“I’m not in politics because I want to make a career out of it,” Aranda said in a recent interview. “I can work across the aisle.”

Aranda, 35, is one of a growing number of hopefuls aiming for the Democratic nomination to run against Republican U.S. Rep. Bryan Steil, now in his fourth term. Other declared Democratic candidates are ironworker Randy Bryce, emergency room nurse Mitchell Berman, Racine community activist Gage Stills and Janesville union leader Enrique Casiano.
“I’m the only one who has won a political campaign,” Aranda said. “I know how important it is to bring people together and stay united.”
The Cook Political Report’s most recent update, Dec. 9, maintained the 1st District’s projected 2026 outcome as “likely Republican.” Despite such forecasts, in the current cycle the district has drawn a broader array of potential Democratic opponents than it has seen in years.
The party’s last contested primary came in 2020. In 2024, what was expected to be at least a three-way primary race was avoided after Peter Barca’s late entry into the contest led the rest of the field to drop out by summer.
Aranda is the associate director of a college readiness program at the University of Wisconsin-Whitewater.
A Spanish speaker and an active Democratic party volunteer for the last 15 years, Aranda has organized bilingual workshops at party events. When the Whitewater school district held a referendum to raise property taxes in support of school district operations in 2022, Aranda said, he did presentations directed to the local Spanish-speaking community.
Public education is one of his top campaign priorities, he said. While funding is primarily a state and local function, the federal role in supporting public schools is important, he said, and he opposes the Trump administration’s attempts to dismantle the federal Department of Education.
“There’s a lack of public education funding,” Aranda said. “Local constituents are going to feel it in their pocket. Republicans aren’t doing much to assist in our investment for the future.”
Aranda’s parents, both Mexican immigrants, settled in Whitewater in the early 1990s, he said, and he grew up in the community, which straddles the line between Walworth and Jefferson counties.
“When we came to Whitewater, the only people that helped us were public school teachers,” Aranda said of his family’s experience.
He said immigration reform is another of his campaign’s concerns. On that, “there’s a lot of things at the local level we cannot do,” Aranda said. “I truly believe immigration reform that is comprehensive and fair will help not just public education but a lot of the scarcity and pain that people are feeling.”
Aranda has a master’s in business administration. He’s also held a variety of other jobs, he said, giving him the sort of direct experience he believes many voters can identify with.
“I’ve worked in call centers, custodial services and fast food,” Aranda said. “People want a good, stable job — this message is very simple. That’s what I want to guarantee for others.”
He supports a proposal advanced by Sen. Bernie Sanders, the Vermont independent, for a federal law setting the minimum pay for public school teachers at $60,000.
“Republicans say you can’t do that, but now you see ICE [agents] offered more money and debt forgiveness,” Aranda said.
While Aranda is not the only Hispanic entrant in the Democratic contest, he considers an ability to appeal to Hispanic voters to be one of his selling points. The 1st District has “a lot of Latino potential voters,” Aranda said. “They’ve been frustrated with both political parties.”
Aranda said he’s been traveling throughout the district to meet with Democratic Party groups and solicit their support. He also has been trying to educate and engage casual voters and non-voters, he said.
He described a recent visit to a college organization of Latino students. After introducing himself and his campaign for the 1st District, “Nobody knew who their representative was,” he said.
“Some don’t know what a Republican or a Democrat is and what they stand for,” he added. “Republicans take advantage of that, too.”
Aranda believes motivating more people who have been largely detached from politics to take an interest and go to the polls can help Democrats flip the seat.
“I think there’s a huge opportunity there,” he said. “I think there’s an opportunity for younger voters, too — for their voice to be heard.”

(Photo by Kirsten Strough/USDA)Cattle was “king” when it came to Idaho agriculture in 2025, but other farmers may be facing headwinds in 2026. 
Tariffs, inflation and hot and dry weather are likely to continue to put pressure on Idaho farmers and producers heading into the new year, according to a number of experts who spoke Wednesday at the University of Idaho Ag Outlook Seminar in Boise. 
Speakers at the event discussed economic conditions, weather forecasts, state and federal policy considerations and specific commodity outlooks. 
 Idaho’s agriculture cash at all-time high, largely driven by cattle and beef industry 

Agriculture makes up around 17% of Idaho total’s economic output. 
In total, cash receipts from Idaho agriculture in 2025 are predicted to reach an all-time of $12.1 billion, up 2% from last year. For the first time since 2003, the cattle industry brought in higher receipts than milk. 
“Whether it’s Idaho or the country, it’s a tale of two ag economies,” said Brett Wilder, U of I assistant professor and area extension educator covering farm business management. “One, is cattle is king right now. If you’re in the beef cattle industry, you’re probably the only one feeling really good about your financial situation. If you are in any other sector of agriculture, oftentimes, probably find yourself sitting at the table wondering what the seed bill is going to be, repairs, fertilizers. … expenses are high.” 
Trump to send $12 billion in one-time payments to farmers to offset ag losses

Cattle and calves generated around $3.89 billion in cash receipts in 2025, which was about 32% of Idaho’s total and an 18% increase from the previous year. 
However, crops like wheat, potatoes, sugar beets, and barley were all down from the year before. Sugar beet prices are expected to continue to drop, Wilder said, with an expected additional 30% to 40% drop in cash receipts. He said this was largely due to demand lessening for sugar, too much supply, and lots of sugar coming from other parts of the world.
“When you think about what is the state of Idaho’s ag economy, we’re at record highs in cash receipts. Things look really good, but when you get under the hood, there’s a lot to unpack,” Wilder said.
Since 2009, the inflation-adjusted cash receipts for cattle have risen 180%, he said. 
Some typical farm expenses were down. Spending on feed decreased 6% and fertilizer decreased 8%, he said. Labor costs rose around 6%, storage and transportation rose 9%, and interest expense went up 5%. 
Idaho farmers and ranchers are expected to have spent $717 million on interest by the end of the year, Wilder said, which is up 78% since 2021. 
“If you’re a small producer, starting producer, leveraged producer, you’re carrying the majority of that burden,” he said. 
Leveraged producers are those who borrow funds for their operation. 
All told, net farm income was up 6% from last year, he said, to about $2.7 billion.

 Idaho’s trade was strong in 2025, will be watched closely in 2026 

Wilder said Idaho is expected to finish 2025 with a record high in agriculture exports of $3 billion. Of all Idaho’s agricultural cash receipts, exports make up about a quarter, Wilder said. 
Many of those exports were completed under preexisting contracts and negotiations that occurred in 2024, he said. 
Going into 2026, it’s hard to say what will happen. U.S. trade with other countries has been volatile, as President Donald Trump has escalated trade wars with a number of countries using high tariffs, including Canada. 
Trump administration tags $700 million for regenerative farming

Canada accounts for 32% of Idaho’s agricultural exports. Mexico accounts for another 19%. 
Although the rates have changed over time, the U.S. and Canada for a time went back and forth with high tariff rates — which are taxes on imports. Most of Canada’s counter-tariffs have been removed under an agreement that went into effect in September. Similar tariffs and counter tariffs were threatened with Mexico, but most were removed under the same September agreement. 
Most of Idaho’s exports are dairy products, accounting for 22%.
“Geopolitics and trade are absolutely going to be front and center,” Wilder said of 2026. 
Asked if the U.S. trade relationship with Canada had been damaged to the point where it might affect Idaho agricultural exports, Wilder responded, “We’re still seeing trade move forward, but what that’s going to look like going forward will likely change.” 
Doug Robison, Idaho president of Agwest Farm Credit, said Wednesday he predicts tariffs will “continue to be a headwind for agriculture and agricultural commodities over probably the foreseeable year.” 
 Idaho entering winter with high precipitation, low snowpack 

Although much of the Western U.S. is experiencing high rainfalls from the “atmospheric river,”  high temperatures have meant that it hasn’t resulted in mountain snowpack, said Troy Lindquist, senior service hydrologist with the National Weather Service office in Boise. 
“We’re just flirting with record-low snow pack,” Lindquist said.
Average temperatures across the Pacific Northwest have been six to 10 degrees above normal the last few weeks. The state also experienced low precipitation this spring, which is contributing to low snowpack levels. 
It’s early in Idaho’s typical snow accumulation season, he said, so there’s a chance for the outlook to improve. Nearly every basin in the state is about 50% or less of its normal snow pack, he said. The Snake River headwaters area is an exception, sitting at about 70% of normal. 
However, drought conditions that had been improving from the extreme conditions that had been occurring in September, especially in North Idaho. 
The region is expected to experience “weak La Niña” conditions, he said. Historically, these conditions, brought on by cooler-than-average ocean temperatures in the Equatorial Pacific, are associated with cooler-than-average temperatures. However, actual weather outcomes during these conditions have varied considerably over the years, Lindquist said. 
Sometimes, higher-than-average precipitation is also a result of these conditions, especially in northern Idaho. 
Weather forecasts through early January are showing a continuation of “active” weather patterns, with high precipitation, Lindquist said. There’s an equal chance of temperature coming in above, below or at normal, he said. 
In a more extended forecast of January through March, cooler-than-average temperatures are anticipated, especially in North Idaho. Northern and eastern parts of the state may also see above-normal precipitation, he said. 
Most of the state is expected to see more precipitation in February through April, with the exception of southwest Idaho. 
Heading into summer, forecasts show above average temperatures and below normal precipitation. Idaho had the fourth warmest “water year,” which ran Oct. 1, 2024, to Sept. 30, 2025, on record. 
“Climatologically, we’re just seeing pretty persistent above normal temperatures across the region,” he said, “especially during the summertime.”

Pictured: Tennessee State Capitol. (Photo: John Partipilo)A South Korea metals company will invest $6.6 billion to build a minerals refinery on the site of a shuttered mine in Smith County, marking the largest single economic investment in Tennessee history, Gov. Bill Lee announced this week. 
Korea Zinc will partner with the federal government in a joint venture that federal officials say aligns with the Trump administration’s goals to limit reliance on China for minerals critical to U.S. semiconductor, artificial intelligence, aerospace and defense industries. 
The public-private partnership gives the federal government a 40% stake in the company’s Tennessee operations, where some 540,000 tons of materials will be produced annually, according to the U.S. Department of Commerce. 
The investment is expected to create 320 jobs in Smith County and 420 jobs in Montgomery County, the planned site of the company’s new U.S. headquarters.

“These hundreds of new jobs will drive economic prosperity across the region for generations to come,” Lee said in a news release.
State leaders called the investment a major economic milestone for Tennessee, but did not disclose whether the deal came with the promise of taxpayer-funded incentives. 
“Details about grant assistance can’t be shared until contracts are fully executed,” a spokesperson for the Tennessee Department of Economic and Community Development wrote Wednesday in an emailed response to questions about potential incentives.
The Commerce Department has awarded the project $210 million in direct funding, the agency announced. The federal government will gain a 40% stake in the U.S. operations. As part of the deal, the federal government will also own 5% of the global Korea Zinc operations.
In a post on X, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick called the deal a  “big win for America.”
The announcement comes amid uncertainty over the future of BlueOval City, Ford Motor Company’s electric truck campus lured to west Tennessee with $1 billion in taxpayer incentives for thousands of promised jobs.
Announced in 2021 as the then-largest investment in state history, the campus’ opening has since been delayed multiple times. Ford announced this week it had scrapped plans for electric pickup manufacturing in favor of gas-powered vehicles.

In the late 1990s and early 2000s, Clubway Apartments in Greenville, North Carolina, was an “amazing” place, Barbara Gaskins remembers.
“When I was in high school, we used to come over here, all of us as teenagers,” said Gaskins, now 43. “There was a pool and a clubhouse. It was amazing back in the day.”
Gaskins is now a tenant at the 1960s-era apartment complex, and claims neglectful management and ownership has allowed it to deteriorate to the point where tenants’ health is at risk.
In recent months, Gaskins has been a strident critic of management at the apartment complex. She’s complained to city officials and posted videos on her social media feed showing falling ceiling tiles that she says expose mold, bathtubs that don’t drain and half-hearted attempts at repairs.
A woman who answered the phone at Clubway Apartments identified herself as a member of its management team. She declined to discuss tenants’ concerns with NC Newsline. And a man with Apartment Advantage Group LLC (AAG), the complex’s Panama City, Florida-based management firm, declined to identify himself or to discuss the matter when reached by phone, telling a reporter that the firm is “not commenting on any of that.” Multiple messages left with Greenville’s code enforcement department were not returned.
North Carolina law guarantees tenants the right to safe, habitable housing, privacy, protection from discrimination and the right to proper eviction procedures. It also limits security deposits to up to two months’ rent and prevents landlord retaliation.

Then-attorney general Josh Stein reminded tenants of their rights to safe housing in a March 2024 column about unscrupulous contractors and the challenges homeowners and renters face.
“Landlords are required to provide their tenants with a fit premises,” Stein wrote. “If you discover that something needs to be fixed, ask to have it repaired. Let your landlord know about the problem immediately over the telephone or in person, but follow up with a written request and keep a copy of it for yourself.”
If the landlord refuses to make repairs or remedy the condition in a reasonable period of time, Stein wrote, you may file a complaint with your local authorities, such as a code enforcement agency or fire and safety inspector.
But Nick MacLeod with the North Carolina Tenants Union says those steps aren’t always enough to get problems resolved for low-income renters.
The North Carolina Tenants Union, a statewide tenant advocacy group created 18 months ago, has had notable success organizing tenants across the state to fight against high rents, unlawful evictions and substandard rentals.
Most recently, the union helped Durham tenants win an amendment to the city’s housing code that prohibits landlords from collecting rent if a housing unit is found to be “imminently dangerous” to tenants’ health and safety.

MacLeod, the union’s executive director, said some tenants feel trapped in substandard housing because low-income residents often can’t afford higher-end, higher quality rentals. 
“When we talk to folks about why they stay,” MacLeod said, “the answer is ‘Well, this place is dangerous, but it is probably better than sleeping under an overpass.’” 
People who have been incarcerated, have poor credit or an eviction on their record are often forced into substandard housing because the bar to rent is lower, MacLeod said.
“What are the other options folks have, given that it’s often so hard to find an affordable place to live and moving is quite expensive?” MacLeod said.  
Nina Woods says she turned to the Red Cross for help when the ceiling in her Clubway Apartment came down, exposing mold.
Woods is a dialysis patient, and she’s concerned about her health. “I have a catheter in my chest, so I’m not even supposed to be breathing these toxins in at all,” Woods said.
The Red Cross provided money for a hotel and food after the incident, but only enough for a few days, she said.
“After that, I was right back in the apartment and they [Red Cross] told me that was a one-time thing,” Woods said.
Woods lives with her 13-year-old son. She has begun to limit her grandchildren’s visits, concerned about exposing them to mold.
Gaskins and Woods pay around $1,000 a month each for their two-bedroom apartments they share with their children. The average rent for a two-bedroom apartment in Greenville is $1,200 per month, according to ZillowRentals. Gaskins said higher-end apartments can cost $1,800 or more per month.
“That’s kind of what the hardship is, because it’s hard to find affordable housing,” Gaskins said, adding that the same group that manages Clubway Apartments also manages several of the other lower-cost apartment complexes in Greenville.

In early October, Gaskins and other tenants reached their breaking point after water and sewer lines at the apartment complex malfunctioned, leaving them without water and sewer service for several days.
Gaskins reached out to city council members and the city’s code enforcement team to alert them about living conditions at Clubway Apartments.
“We couldn’t use the bathroom, we couldn’t do anything,” Gaskins said. “There was raw sewage in some people’s apartments. I mean, it was bad.”
City officials, Gaskin said, told tenants that the apartment complex’s management must be given “reasonable time” to make repairs. Tenants are still waiting to see what happens while they live in unsafe and unsanitary conditions, she said. 
“I don’t think asking to be able to go and use the bathroom or to be able to go to the sink and get some water,  I don’t think that’s asking too much,” Gaskins said.
NC Newsline left multiple messages with Greenville code enforcement officials, but they did not respond.
On Oct. 28, a little more than two weeks after Gaskins stepped up complaints, she was awakened by what she described as a team of eight to 12 sheriff’s deputies. 
They had been sent to raid her apartment after receiving an erroneous tip from a “trusted” confidential informant that she had drugs stashed in the apartment. No drugs were found and no charges were filed against Gaskins.
Still, Gaskins was handcuffed in front of her two sons, ages 10 and 14. Her 18-month-old daughter was not at the apartment during the raid. 
“They were frozen,” Gaskins said of her sons. “They didn’t know what to think. I didn’t want to show them that I was upset and get them upset. I tried to stay as calm as possible.”
Gaskins believes her criticism of management at Clubway Apartments led to the raid on her home. She is convinced someone at the apartment complex falsely reported that she was dealing drugs.
While the raid took place, an apartment manager was in the parking lot recording it, said Gaskins, who shared a copy of the recording with NC Newsline.
“The whole while of this so-called drug raid, the apartment managers were outside going live on Facebook, saying that because I wanted to air them out [by reporting problems at the apartment complex], they were going to air me out,” Gaskins said, “and that it was a drug raid and they felt vindicated and wanted to see me come downstairs in handcuffs.” 
Gaskins is in the early stages of preparing a lawsuit, which she said could include claims that her Fourth Amendment rights against unlawful searches and seizures were violated. Gaskins said she is also considering a defamation claim because her “political career has been completely destroyed” by the news of a drug raid on her apartment. Gaskins is a community activist and former congressional and mayoral candidate.

Pitt County Sheriff Paula Dance has apologized to Gaskins and acknowledged the raid was a mistake. She said it occurred after a longtime, trusted informant got the apartment number wrong, sending deputies to Gaskins’ apartment. The informant, Dance said, has no connection to the management at Clubway Apartments. 
Dance knows Gaskins. She follows her on social media and even considered hiring her for a program at the Pitt County Detention Center. Dance said she can see how the timing of the raid could lead Gaskins to believe deputies were used to get back at her. 
The fact that an apartment manager live-streamed the raid further fueled Gaskins’s thinking that the raid was a “set up,” Dance said.
“I can guarantee you that this sheriff will never allow my office to be weaponized against anybody, let alone somebody I know personally,” Dance said, “It is just all an unfortunate set of circumstances.”
MacLeod, the tenant union’s executive director, said it’s important for tenants in substandard rentals to band together to fight for improvements. Doing so, he said, makes it more difficult for landlords to retaliate against tenants. 
“Ask yourself, ‘How many people would I feel safe going to do this with?’ and that will help you have a sense of whether we need 30% of the complex signed on to this, or 50% or 80%,” MacLeod said. “Get enough people before you go public to fight for the real big things.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Image-825x1024.jpeg,,,2025-12-18 06:59:16.554380

(Photo by R. Lehman/U.S. Forest Service)Public lands belong to all Americans — not just a fortunate few or the highest bidders. They’re a shared national treasure that defines our identity as Westerners. 
Last summer, Idahoans from every political background stood together to reject a dangerous plan to sell off these lands, and leaders like Congressman Mike Simpson and Sens. Jim Risch and Mike Crapo stood with us. Public lands aren’t a luxury — they’re a legacy. Once they’re privatized or sold, we never get them back.
That legacy faces a serious new threat. Congressman Russ Fulcher is pushing a plan to explore transferring management — and eventually ownership — of Idaho’s national public lands to state government. He’s called this transition “imminent,” pointing to frustrations with federal agencies and concerns about programs like Payment In Lieu of Taxes (PILT) and Secure Rural Schools (SRS).
Rep. Fulcher proposes exploration of transferring Idaho federal land to state and local control 

But his plan ignores a simple fact: Idaho cannot afford the more than $500 million annual cost of managing these federal lands. With Idaho already facing a $58 million shortfall this year and up to a $1 billion shortfall next year, the state would only have two options: raise taxes or sell our land. And Idahoans have made it clear repeatedly — they don’t want either.
Public lands are part of our family traditions, passed down from one generation to the next. They aren’t just property; they’re a way of life. Our public lands sustain local communities through Idaho’s multi-billion-dollar outdoor recreation economy; they support our $20 billion agriculture economy, and they’re the source of our clean drinking water. Congressman Fulcher’s proposal threatens those values and our way of life.
A recent survey found that 96 percent of Idaho registered voters want public lands to remain in public hands — a clear mandate from the people who live, work, and recreate here.
But there are real challenges on our public lands that need addressing, and that includes support for our public lands counties. The federal programs that help fund county services such as PILT and SRS enjoy a long history of strong bipartisan support from across the country. 
Just last week, the U.S. House reauthorized Secure Rural Schools funding on a 399–5 vote, hardly the sign of a program in danger. But these programs aren’t perfect, and Idaho’s counties deserve practical solutions from Congress that strengthen and stabilize county budgets without selling off or privatizing the lands that define Idaho.
This starts with improving PILT so that large public lands counties get their fair share of payments to handle the costs associated with providing access to our public lands, such as county road maintenance. We also need to work to make sure that SRS is reauthorized before it expires in the future. Critically, Congress needs to authorize permanent funding to cover the needs of both programs so that our counties have long-term budget security and stability.
We agree that public lands need improved management. Partnership programs like Good Neighbor Authority and Shared Stewardship programs have increased the capacity to get work done, but more improvements are needed. 
Agencies require funding and an adequate workforce to protect clean water, restore habitat for fish and wildlife, manage recreation, reduce hazardous fuels, and manage wildfire.

We also need to deepen collaboration with local communities, Tribes, and state agencies; and modernize policy so land managers have the adaptive tools needed in a changing West.
There are real challenges on our public lands but handing them over or selling them off to the highest bidder is not the solution. The responsible path is to work together with our counties, our state, Idahoans, and our federal delegation to strengthen county finances and ensure strong local input — while keeping these lands in public hands, where they belong. 
Congressman Fulcher’s proposal is a short-sighted plan that risks our way of life and robs future generations of what makes Idaho, Idaho.
Let’s keep Idaho’s public lands public, conserved, and accessible. Once they’re gone, they’re gone for good.

(Joe Raedle/Getty Images)Louisiana cannot enforce a 2023 law that requires social media platforms to verify the ages of its users, a federal judge ruled Monday, declaring that it violates the First Amendment.
U.S. District Judge John deGravelles of Louisiana’s Middle District ruled in favor of NetChoice, a trade association for companies such as Meta, Snapchat, X and YouTube. The group sued the state in March to block the Secure Online Child Interaction and Age Limitation Act. It calls for all social media sites with more than 5 million users to make “reasonable efforts” to obtain proof of age to establish an account. Underage users need parental consent to join such platforms. 
In his 94-page ruling, deGravelles said he agreed with NetChoice’s arguments that the law is overly broad and said it takes an “all or nothing” approach to policing social media use. 
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Judge deGravelles, a federal court appointee of President Barack Obama, described the act as “under-inclusive” because minors could access the same adult-oriented content on unregulated websites and would not be protected from such materials if they meet one-time age-verification and parental-consent requirements.   
The law also goes to the other extreme, deGravelles said in his opinion.
“It is over-inclusive in that it burdens a large amount of protected speech — for minors and adults alike,” he wrote. “And it is seemingly largely redundant of existing parental controls, meaning that there is a less-restrictive alternative: Louisiana can encourage the use of available tools.”
Attorney General Liz Murrill, who was a defendant in the case, called the ruling from deGravelles “very disappointing” in a statement and said she intends to challenge the decision before the U.S. 5th Circuit Court of Appeal. The ruling calls for the state to cover NetChoice’s attorney’s fees and court costs.
“It’s a very reasonable policy decision by the State Legislature to impose age verification requirements on these companies,” Murrill said. “They can do it, it is not burdensome, and it’s unfortunate that NetChoice chooses to litigate over this issue instead of voluntarily putting those protections in place for kids. We have an all-hands-on deck problem, and they should be a part of the solution.”
The act, authored by Sen. Patrick McMath, R-Covington, allowed the attorney general to fine social media companies up to $2,500 for each violation of its terms.
Murrill has previously gone on the offensive against online companies, filing a lawsuit against Roblox in August in state court. The attorney general described the popular gaming site as “overrun with harmful content and child predators.”",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/social-media-phone.jpeg,,,2025-12-18 06:59:16.554380

It’s not the most effective use of taxpayer money, so we’re not going to give WisconsinEye a blank check to keep running it irresponsibly.” LeMahieu speaks on the Senate floor in September 2023. (Screenshot via WisEye).Legislative leaders have been in discussions with WisconsinEye, the broadcast network that recently stopped offering coverage of state government business, about a potential long-term solution for the financial crisis facing the organization, the president of the organization told the Wisconsin Examiner Wednesday.
Due to a lack of funding, WisconsinEye halted its livestream coverage of state government on Monday and pulled down its video archive of over 30,000 hours of state government proceedings, candidate interviews and other programming. WisconsinEye launched in 2007 as an independent, nonprofit organization funded mostly by charitable donations.
Jon Henkes, president of WisconsinEye, has said that the organization had trouble raising sufficient funds to meet its operational costs due to a competitive fundraising environment. The organization sent a letter to lawmakers in November asking them to modify the terms of $10 million in state matching funds set aside for an endowment for the organization, giving it access to the money without raising the dollar-for-dollar match.
Henkes told the Wisconsin Examiner on Wednesday that conversations are taking place in the state Capitol as legislators look for a solution so that WisconsinEye can continue in its current form. 
“We’re not there yet. This is a process, and it’s going to take a little bit of time as it relates to when will we go back up,” Henkes said. “The conversations going on right now would be a long-term solution.” 
The organization has until June 30, 2026, to raise matching funds to access the $10 million endowment funding first set aside in the 2023-25 state budget.
WisconsinEye asked the state to provide about $1 million in funding without the matching requirement to cover its 2026 operational budget. 
Henkes said another potential solution would be for the state to remove the matching requirement and manage the money as an endowment on behalf of WisconsinEye. He said there would be a “significant amount of money that would generate earned income” to take care of the majority of the organization’s budget and complement the income WisconsinEye brings in from on-air sponsorships and small online giving.
“It’s early in the process, but the signals that we’re getting from the people who are the decision makers are very encouraging to us,” Henkes said. 
The Wisconsin Examiner reached out to Assembly Speaker Robin Vos (R-Rochester) and Senate Majority Leader Devin LeMahieu (R-Oostburg) for comment but did not hear back by Wednesday evening. 
LeMahieu has expressed skepticism about giving the organization state funding, telling the Associated Press that it’s “important to make sure the public can view what’s going on in state government” but that “looking at the way [WisconsinEye is] currently run, it seems like they’re really burning through money. It’s not the most effective use of taxpayer money, so we’re not going to give WisconsinEye a blank check to keep running it irresponsibly.” He also told the Wisconsin State Journal that it “may not be the most responsible way to provide this service to the public.”
Democratic Minority Leader Greta Neubauer (D-Racine) told the Wisconsin Examiner in an interview last month that she thinks WisconsinEye is “essential” and that lawmakers “should have structured their funding a little differently in the state budget, but we have an opportunity to do so now to make sure that they can provide that service.”
Democratic Senate Minority Leader Dianne Hesselbein (D-Middleton) told the Examiner in an interview on Monday that WisconsinEye has been a “helpful tool” that has been “nice for people to be able to stay at home and be able to watch what we’re doing” and she is open to having conversations with her Democratic and Republican colleagues on a path forward. 
Henkes said the organization is still looking for funding from donors to help get its coverage up and running in the short term. 
“There are a couple of six-figure gift requests that are under consideration right now with prominent people in Wisconsin,” Henkes said, adding that those donations would put WisconsinEye in the position “to bridge the gap toward what the state intends to do and get us back on back on the air. We’re hopeful.”
“Our board has said, well, if we’ve got an agreement for the long-term, and we found some short-term funding, we’re back in business,” Henkes said.
Four Democratic lawmakers propose replacing WisconsinEye
A group of Democratic lawmakers, including Sens. Mark Spreitzer (D-Beloit), Chris Larson (D-Milwaukee), Kelda Roys (D-Madison) and Rep. Brienne Brown (D-Whitewater), introduced their own proposal on Tuesday to replace WisconsinEye with a public affairs network run and operated by the state government. 
“Thanks to this shutdown, the public will not have online access to committee hearings and public meetings happening this week, which they have come to rely upon,” the lawmakers said in a co-sponsorship memo. “This failure underscores a fundamental need: Open government requires reliable and permanent public infrastructure, not a private entity that can be shut down due to difficulties raising funds or in an attempt to pressure legislators to provide funds. Public access should not be dependent on the generosity of donors.”
Under the proposal, the $10 million would be repurposed to start an Office of the Public Affairs Network that would be attached to the Department of Administration. The office would have a $2 million annual appropriation under the bill.
The network would need to provide live coverage of state government including all legislative floor sessions, all meetings of legislative committees, meetings of executive branch agencies, the state Supreme Court and other judicial proceedings, news conferences as well as related civic events.
According to the lawmakers’ memo, the office would need to operate in a “strictly nonpartisan manner” and “guarantee unrestricted public access without requirements such as online account registration, paywalls, or other burdens.”
A Public Affairs Network Board would also be created that would be responsible for appointing the director of the office and overseeing its activities. The board would include the governor, two public members appointed by the governor and four state lawmakers.
The bill also includes a provision to allow current employees of WisconsinEye who have demonstrated their talent and technical expertise to be rehired.
The DOA would also need to attempt to obtain the complete digital archives of WisconsinEye in order to permanently maintain them as part of the new network’s archive.
Henkes had a number of concerns about the proposal. 
“WisconsinEye, as an independent network, is in fact in the tradition of Wisconsin’s commitment to open, transparent government of the people, for the people, by the people,” Henkes said. “We just strongly believe that a state-run, government-controlled state Capitol network is not in the best interest of Wisconsin.”
Henkes said the proposal brings up questions about whether having a board that includes lawmakers and the governor could politicize things and “inject partisanship into decision making on programming and what committee gets covered and what committee doesn’t get covered.”
Henkes said he is also concerned about the expanded capacity that lawmakers proposed. He said that under its contract, WisconsinEye is required to cover floor sessions as well as a certain percentage of committee hearings, but not everything. 
“Truth be told, the Legislature in its wisdom in the current contract with WisconsinEye does not require us to cover every committee hearing because they know that some of those are of minimal interest to the public and would probably draw the attention of 10 viewers,” Henkes said, adding that he also thought the cost to expand that coverage would be “at least double” the $2 million lawmakers included annually.
Henkes added that for 18 years WisconsinEye has exceeded its contractual obligations and that includes covering over 14,000 hours of live video, which is also archived, as well as over 16,000 additional hours of interviews with hundreds of candidates for office, news conferences, rallies, debates and other coverage. 
“We bleed for this mission and we care greatly about civil dialogue in this state and inspiring informed voter participation, and it’s a model in terms of programming and coverage that’s exceptional,” Henkes said. “Its just that the funding model in the current philanthropic environment is not sustainable.”

The state’s comptroller instructed the city to build its cash reserves and retire more debt over the next five years. Martin had $257,000 in its cash fund at the end of the 2025 fiscal year. By 2030, that cash fund should hold more than $2.7 million, according to the comptroller’s plan. 
That means the city should have $465,000 in the fund by the end of fiscal year 2026.

Those goals have Martin officials shaking the proverbial couch cushions for savings, however large or small.
“It’s going to take some hard work for a lot of people in the next few years,” Belote told the Lookout following Monday’s meeting.
Searching for savings
Belote presented the committee with a list of savings possibilities totaling $111,250. It includes shifting the $48,750 mayor’s salary from the general fund to other sources, freeing up general fund dollars. Savings possibilities include trimming administrative expenses, cutting $10,000 from the legislative out of town travel budget and saving a remaining $6,000 intended for legislative board-approved projects. Closing out the Community Development director’s salary, travel, and other line items could save another $34,500.
These suggestions are not final and would need approval from the Board of Mayor and Aldermen. 
Martin will retire around $800,000 of debt in the next five years, Belote said. 
“This is a call to be creative. No stone unturned, here. That’s what we’ve got to do,” he said.
The committee also discussed exploring the potential sale of the Weldon Building, a historic building that once served as the city’s post office and later the city library. A series of leaks and air conditioning problems has left the building with extensive damage that will not be covered by insurance. 
The committee agreed that the city should begin researching renovation costs and the building’s value in its current state.
Committee members voted unanimously to recommend that the Board of Mayor and Aldermen sell two city-owned vehicles previously used by Brundige and Thompson — together worth an estimated $80,000 that would be returned to the city’s sewer and gas fund for public works equipment needs.
The committee also voted to recommend halting three ongoing grant-funded projects that require city contributions to move forward, including:

Two sidewalk renovation and street beautification projects on Elm Street that would cost a combined $695,000 to complete (already-completed engineering work can be revisited in the future)
A multimodal project on N. Lindell street from Brian Brown Memorial Greenway to Palace Street, connecting to Park Place Apartments that would cost $113,800 to complete, and is not expected to start this fiscal year

‘Moving forward’
City officials are still in the early stages of sorting through the fallout from Brundige and Thompson’s indictments. 
In late November, when Belote took the reins as mayor, he too said he would consider resigning after several community members voiced their concerns about an overall lack of oversight from the Board of Aldermen during Brundige’s tenure. 
But Belote led the city’s next Board of Mayor and Aldermen meeting on Dec. 8, where the board selected Ward 1 Alderwoman Celeste Taylor to serve as vice mayor. 
“We’re moving forward,” Belote said Monday, reiterating that he plans to retire after the city elects a new mayor in 10 months.
Belote’s former Ward 2 seat is now vacant, and is expected to be filled by an alderman selected by the board from a pool of applicants in January.
Martin mayor indicted on theft of funds, official misconduct 

Ward 3 Alderman Jacob Crowe in November called for the resignations of Belote and Aldermen Danny Nanney and Terry Hankins, as the trio served on the Finance Committee during the period when the former mayor and finance director allegedly misused city funds. Hankins said he will not seek reelection in 2026. 
Belote announced on Dec. 8 that Crowe, who has a background in finance, will now serve on the Finance Committee after his seat is confirmed in January. Crowe attended Monday’s meeting and was invited to be part of committee discussions, though he cannot yet vote. Another community member seat on the committee is vacant and is expected to be filled in January. 
The Finance Committee on Monday voted to recommend that the Board of Mayor and Aldermen further expand the committee, adding an additional two community seats. The committee also decided to meet regularly on the third Thursday of each month.
The mayor is responsible for calling finance committee meetings, Belote said. At the beginning of Brundige’s 20-plus-year tenure as mayor, the committee met every month. Belote said three aldermen can together force the mayor to call a finance committee meeting. Though Belote said he did personally ask the mayor to hold more committee meetings over the last three years, it does not appear that the board took action to force Brundige’s hand.
“It got very lax,” Belote said Monday. “But we are back, and we’re going to talk about things.”

(Photo by Caity Coyne/West Virginia Watch)As West Virginia leaders plan to make economic development a cornerstone of the 2026 legislative session, a new report published Wednesday shows the state has far to go — both technically and financially — in addressing basic infrastructure needs.
The report, published by the American Society of Civil Engineers’ West Virginia Section, has the state receiving an average of a “D+” grade for its infrastructure. It accounts for 18 infrastructure categories, ranging from roads, bridges and dams to school facilities, drinking water, broadband and more.

ASCE publishes these state-specific report cards about every four years. The most recent one published in West Virginia, according to Tabitha Lafferre, the president of the ASCE’s West Virginia Section, was in 2020 and only covered five infrastructure categories. That year, she said, the state received a “D.”
At a news conference on Wednesday, Lafferre said it was good to see the state improve slightly in its infrastructure status. But, she continued, it’s clear that much work remains to be done.
“This [D+] is still two notches below the national grade of a C, and unfortunately, it’s not a grade that we can find acceptable if we want an infrastructure network that can protect our residents and businesses sufficiently,” Lafferre said. “However, this represents progress and I will say, it’s something that we should be proud of.”
Seven of the 18 categories detailed in the report card — aviation, broadband, dams, drinking water, roads, school building infrastructure and wastewater — included estimates on how much funding will be needed to both maintain current infrastructure and meet potential future needs. Those seven categories alone totaled nearly $13 billion in estimated funding needs over the next several years. 
The report card emphasized that extreme weather events in West Virginia — which are becoming increasingly common due to climate change — present massive challenges in addressing infrastructure needs. Other challenges highlighted in the report throughout several categories include the state’s population decline, rapidly aging and out-of-date infrastructure, rugged natural terrain and funding restraints.
Throughout the state report, authors stressed the importance of federal funding in both upkeeping and improving the state’s existing infrastructure. 
The report does not account for previously allocated federal infrastructure funding sources — grants and otherwise — that have been under threat by the Trump administration over the past year. Those include initiatives passed by Congress through the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act and the American Rescue Plan Act, which were both signed into law by former President Joe Biden in 2021.
Lafferre, responding to a question regarding federal funding instability, said Wednesday that part of the reason the report card is compiled is to show lawmakers — statewide and federally — how critical it is to protect and increase funding for infrastructure initiatives.
“One of the most fundamental things about the report card is we can use it as a tool to take to our legislators to show, you know, this is the reason we need more funding,” Lafferre said. “The IIJA is great. But it was a one time thing. We need that (funding) consistently across the state to improve our efforts.”
Lafferre called the state’s infrastructure systems the “backbone of West Virginia’s economy.” 
“When it’s functioning as planned, it’s often out of sight, out of mind,” Lafferre said. “But when infrastructure encounters a serious problem or a system fails, the consequences can affect people’s quality of life and have serious, widespread economic impact.”
Rodney Holbert, the region four governor for the statewide ASCE chapter, said improving the state’s infrastructure and ensuring funding is secured to address future needs is crucial if the state wants to build up its economy.
“The future of our state relies on our ability to maintain and improve upon the current conditions of these infrastructure networks,” Holbert said. “These systems drive economic growth, create jobs, improve public health and protect us from environmental threats.”
West Virginia’s below-average infrastructure grade comes as state leaders plan on making economic development a cornerstone of the upcoming legislative session. Republicans in the state House of Delegates said earlier this month that they want to see heavy investment and innovation for the state’s aviation industry. Per the report card, the state’s airports are estimated to need at least $132 million in infrastructure investments over the next five years to adequately operate.
Throughout his first year in office, Gov. Patrick Morrisey has repeatedly touted his “Backyard Brawl” economic growth plan, which aims to see West Virginia compete more aggressively with surrounding states in recruiting businesses, increasing development opportunities and more.
Per the ASCE, every state surrounding the Mountain State — Virginia, Kentucky, Maryland, Ohio and Pennsylvania — received higher average infrastructure grades than West Virginia in their most recent report cards.



The 2025 ASCE Report Card for West Virginia’s Infrastructure was compiled by a committee of more than 25 civil engineers from throughout the state with support from about 50 former Fairmont State University Students.
The infrastructure report card is published about every four years, with the last statewide report coming out in 2020.
The 2025 report looked at 18 infrastructure categories and used several metrics — including the condition of the infrastructure, its current and future capacity, funding sources compared to estimated future needs, operation and maintenance needs and more — to assign letter grades.
Grades given in each of the categories are meant to reflect how the infrastructure itself is performing, not the work done by individuals to maintain and upkeep it.

 The Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation has agreed on a deal for 120 beds at the Burleigh/Morton jail in Bismarck. 
The agreement guarantees that the state agency will pay for the beds, even if not all of them are full, at a rate of $105 per day or $4.6 million annually. The daily rate is less than the Burleigh-Morton jail’s typical rate of $115 per bed that it charges other counties and federal agencies. 
The state will use the Burleigh/Morton jail for minimum security inmates and programming. The corrections department will provide case managers and treatment staff but the Burleigh County Sheriff’s Office is in charge of staffing correctional officers.

“It’s going to work out pretty nice for both of us,” Colby Braun, director of the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, said in an interview. 
Burleigh County Sheriff Kelly Leben said the contract helps offset the jail’s operating costs. 
“We pay the same price to heat and cool that building, whether there’s one inmate in there or 500. It just gets a lot cheaper, the more you got in there,” he said. 
The 120-bed area had been used by the jail before, but is sitting unused in part because of staffing challenges, Maj. Trent Wangen of the Burleigh County Sheriff’s Office told a group of state lawmakers last week. 
The jail has been able to hire more staff in recent months, making the deal possible.

Braun said the jail in Bismarck along with 96 beds from a temporary mancamp on the grounds of the Missouri River Correctional Center should satisfy the corrections department’s space needs in the short term, which was an issue during this year’s legislative session.
The corrections department hit its capacity for male inmates of 1,624 in 2023. The number of inmates has continued to grow. The male population as of September was 1,919.
Gov. Kelly Armstrong’s budget proposal highlighted money for the state Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation to staff and operate a new section of the Grand Forks County Correctional Center. 
But the Grand Forks County Commission eventually backed away from the deal. 
Grand Forks County Sheriff Andrew Schneider, who operates the jail in Grand Forks, said the negotiations with the corrections department hit some snags.
Schneider said one issue was concerns from county commissioners about inmates being released into the Grand Forks area. Schneider said the corrections department eventually addressed the concern, but Grand Forks County chose not to reopen negotiations. 
Schneider said the new section of the Grand Forks jail has been used to allow for some renovations on older parts of the facility. The sheriff said he hopes to have the staff in place by Feb. 1 to use all the beds at the jail. 
The Legislature passed a budget for the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation that included $28.4 million for payments to county and regional jails to house state prisoners. 
Leben said state funding in the 2027 legislative session will be key to keeping the arrangement going.

Wangen said he expects the arrangement to continue through multiple two-year budget cycles. 
Wangen and Schneider said their jails often provide space for federal agencies, too, such as Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the U.S. Marshals Service. 
Rachelle Juntunen, deputy director of adult services for the correction department, also told lawmakers that the Heart River Correctional Center in Mandan for female inmates is progressing and is expected to open in late 2027. 
When it is open, the Dakota Women’s Correctional Rehab Center in New England could be converted into a facility for up to 126 male inmates, Juntunen said. 
In addition, the North Dakota Legislature set aside $20 million to plan a new medium-security prison that’s proposed next to the State Penitentiary.

As an acute care physician in rural Michigan, I encounter patients with psychiatric crises, often due to inadequate access to preventive mental health services. These are Michiganders who either don’t have insurance coverage, or if they have it, are unable to access consistent outpatient care due to constraints such as lack of reliable transportation to appointments, prohibitive expense of medications, and limited coverage of outpatient facilities due to Medicaid cuts.
Consequently, these patients are brought in by police or EMS when at a point of crisis, often arriving with complicated acute medical conditions in addition to a psychiatric emergency. Unfortunately, due to societal stigma and policy decisions over generations, we have underfunded both research and medical care for this population.
My role in these cases is to stabilize the medical issues before transfer to a psychiatric unit. However, a significant bottleneck arises when medically stabilized patients wait days in the emergency department for an available psychiatric bed, lowering ER bed availability for other critically urgent cases.
The increase in ER case load prolongs their confinement in a stressful, uncomfortable environment. The overcrowded ER, with just a curtain separating each patient, is inherently ill- suited for people grappling with severe distress, anxiety, and psychosis.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Psychiatric patients are either transferred to the psychiatric unit or, if ineligible for inpatient care, there is compounded pressure on the hospital social worker to secure long-term support with paltry outpatient options as their only recourse.
Without realistic access to medication, reliable transportation, or stable housing, an aspect that could easily be addressed through public policy – many fall back into crisis and return to the ER, perpetuating a cycle of readmission that is tough to break.
This reality is particularly dire in our rural communities, where mental health professionals and social resources are especially scarce, inpatient beds are few, and transportation barriers make continuity of care nearly impossible. The hospital in these scenarios serves as a safety net with critical resources that are necessary because the preventative resources are inadequate.
Without policies to protect Michiganders from private interests profiting through insurance and third-party actors like pharmacy benefit managers, we will continue to see worsening health outcomes and rising costs.
We know that for every percentage increase in local public health spending, there is a decrease in mortality rates for that region, particularly in rural communities. We know that publicly funded programs such as Medicaid improve access to primary care and timely care for chronic conditions. This is especially crucial for rural communities which often see the largest benefits in reduced cost- related barriers to care.
The One Big Beautiful Bill Act, passed earlier this year, will exacerbate our collective crisis. The current mental health crisis is the result of decades of neglect and flawed public health policy, heightened by societal stigma and underfunding. Historic cuts to public health, including the 1965 Medicaid prohibition on hospital funding and the subsequent 1981 Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act’s reduction of mental health grants, shifted patient management away from community care and onto the criminal justice system and ERs.
In the setting of this larger picture, I return to my community hospital and the health care access it provides for my community. The most dangerous action Congress could take now is to cut resources from our already overburdened community hospitals, which function as a critical social safety net when our public health fails. Losing further resources in this context means those on the margins will be the hardest hit, deepening a systemic crisis initiated by policy decisions decades ago.
Medicaid and Medicare funding cuts will further limit hospitals and providers’ ability to provide around-the-clock support, slashing the very funding that sustains behavioral health teams, community partnerships, and other critical resources that hold the system together.
When Congress slashes hospital reimbursements and critical access resources, it is not cutting inefficiencies; it is cutting lifelines. The result is predictable: longer waits, fewer staffed psychiatric beds, and patients discharged back into crisis because there is nowhere else for them to go.
Continuing to target health care access will further abandon American hospitals already stretched thin by treating those impacted by the opioid epidemic, workforce shortages, continued burdensome and excessive policies from commercial insurers and lingering pandemic pressures.
Protecting funding for Medicare and Medicaid means protecting access, ensuring that the next patient in crisis finds care and not a crowded waiting room.

This story was produced by the Tennessee Lookout and WPLN News, with support from the Pulitzer Center and the Education Writers Association. 
After the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis sparked nationwide protests about racial injustice in 2020, the Tennessee Legislature formed a committee to answer a question: How much do we owe Tennessee State University?
TSU was created in the early 1900s as a land grant university for Black residents who weren’t allowed to attend the state’s other land grant university, the University of Tennessee. This was not unusual: Every Southern state founded at least one Black public university, as part of their efforts to maintain segregation while remaining eligible for federal funds.
These universities were all poorly funded by their state governments throughout the Jim Crow era. And even after, states often continued to shortchange their historically Black universities. But the exact amount of underfunding is vast, hard to calculate, and even harder to make a political case for. 
Here are four ways to make that calculation.
State land grant funds since 1957: $544 million
Because TSU was created as a land grant school, it’s entitled to money from the federal government to fund certain programs related to science and agriculture. The state is then legally required to match those funds.
Rep. Harold Love, D-Nashville, spoke on the House floor in 2016 about the state’s ongoing failure to match those funds for TSU’s land grant programs. The legislature agreed to start matching the funds from that year forward, but Love wanted the state to rectify the previous years of underfunding.
He then chaired the bipartisan Joint Land-Grant Institution Funding Study Committee, which sought to tally how much the state owed TSU. According to a report by the Office of Legislative Budget Analysis, the state failed to allocate any land grant funds to TSU from fiscal year 1957 through 2007. The University of Tennessee, however, did receive its full state match and sometimes even more than what was federally required.
The committee calculated the total sum owed as between $150 million and $544 million. (The difference depended on which ratio the state used to determine how much federal land grant funding was allocated to TSU compared to UT.) These numbers did not account for inflation. The legislature later budgeted $250 million in backpay for TSU.
State land grant funds before 1957: Unknown
Love says he still wants to know how much state funding for TSU’s land grant programs was missing before 1957. Those budget books weren’t in the legislative library when Love was researching the funding a few years ago, he says, but he has since found the records. He has not yet finished the calculations.
Love says asking for additional back pay would require some political strategy. He declined to say whether he would bring it up in the state legislature in early 2026. 
 ”I would probably work on the rest of the $544 (million) first,” he said. “It’s been my experience that people like to get one thing and then move to the next.”
Per-pupil spending since 1987: $2.1 billion
In 2023, the Biden administration shared a vastly different calculation: Instead of looking specifically at land grant funding, it researched how much Tennessee spent per pupil at its two land grant universities since 1987, based on their overall state allocations and enrollment. 










We can clearly see how these institutions are being robbed, literally robbed, to preserve segregation.


– Crystal Sanders, Emory University


It found that the state spent significantly more on each UT student compared to each TSU student, for a total financial gap of $2.1 billion. While the disparity is not necessarily illegal, it is a meaningful indication of how much the state has invested in the students at each of its two land grant universities.
Biden’s education secretary, Miguel Cardona, urged Tennessee at the time to make “a substantial state allocation” in addition to doubling its land grant matching money going forward. Although the $2.1 billion figure became a rallying cry on TSU’s campus, Republican lawmakers in Tennessee quickly dismissed the Biden administration’s calculation as a “political number.” It has not gained additional traction in the state legislature.
The Debt: Almost 60 years ago, a court case at TSU transformed Tennessee higher education

Segregation scholarships in the ‘30s-’60s: $8 billion
Crystal Sanders, a professor of African American studies at Emory University, identified another slice of funding that was taken from many public HBCUs around the South from the 1920s to the 1960s. During segregation, Black students couldn’t attend predominately white institutions, and Black universities had limited options for graduate programs. 
So Tennessee passed a law in 1937 saying that the state would pay for Black students to go to graduate schools out of state — and would pull the money directly from TSU’s budget. This worsened the financial strain on public HBCUs that were already struggling with poor state funding.
“We can clearly see how these institutions are being robbed, literally robbed, to preserve segregation,” Sanders said.
Sanders found the budget books that show how much money the state spent on each Black graduate student. She estimates that, with inflation, Tennessee owes TSU about $8 billion to account for the funds it took from the school for segregation scholarships.
It’s a large sum, but Sanders believes using historical records to make a calculation is pivotal to making the political case for repayment. “ You can say, here are my receipts. This is what I’m owed,” she says. “This is not how I feel on Monday, and maybe my opinion’s going to change on Thursday. … This is about a debt that the state owes, and states have to pay their debts.”

(Photo: Karen Pulfer Focht for Tennessee Lookout)In recent months, Memphis residents have been told — by federal officials and echoed by local leadership — that the city is safer. 
Crime statistics are cited. Task forces are announced. Press conferences are held. Yet for many Memphians, especially those who live in over-policed neighborhoods, these assurances ring hollow — not because reform is impossible, but because accountability remains largely unproven.
Nearly a year ago, Mayor Paul Young announced the formation of a task force focused on policing and public safety. Since then, there has not been a single comprehensive, public-facing document outlining that task force’s findings, recommendations or implementation outcomes. No clear timeline. No benchmarks. No explanation of what has changed as a result of its work. This silence echoes the skepticism many residents already feel toward initiatives like the Memphis Safe Task Force — initiatives that promise reform but rarely show their work.
This is not merely a matter of political theater or messaging. It is a question of political leadership.
The Department of Justice’s Pattern and Practice Investigation into the Memphis Police Department documented serious and, in some cases, unlawful conduct by officers. The findings were not abstract. They were specific. They detailed patterns of excessive force, unconstitutional practices and systemic failures that demanded more than acknowledgment. They demanded consequences.
Stockard on the Stump: Memphis mayor balks at community call for police consent decree

Yet to this day, there is no publicly identifiable officer that city leadership can point to as having been disciplined, terminated or otherwise held accountable as a direct result of reforms implemented in response to the DOJ’s findings. If accountability has occurred, the public has not seen evidence of it. And accountability that cannot be demonstrated cannot be trusted.
It is important to be clear: This critique is not rooted in a belief that Mayor Young is incapable of political courage. In fact, the opposite is true. The mayor has demonstrated fortitude and resolve on other contentious matters. He has stood firm amid criticism surrounding major development projects, including xAI. He has asserted his authority decisively when he believed boards were operating inadequately, as seen in his intervention with the Memphis Area Transit Authority Board. In those instances, whether we agree with his actions or not, the mayor showed a willingness to confront dysfunction directly and publicly.
That is precisely why the absence of comparable leadership on police reform is so troubling.
When it comes to policing, the mayor’s office has not exhibited the same level of urgency, transparency or political courage. Nor has Police Chief C.J. Davis offered the public a clear accounting of how DOJ findings have translated into concrete disciplinary actions or structural reforms within MPD. Leadership that expects trust must be willing to demonstrate accountability, especially in an institution with a long history of harming the communities it claims to protect.
Compounding this failure is the role of the Memphis City Council. The council possesses oversight authority,approving budgets, receiving briefings and having the power to demand documentation, timelines and measurable outcomes. Yet far too often, members have functioned as a passive audience rather than an active check. When legislative bodies fail to insist on evidence, executive silence becomes normalized. Oversight deferred is accountability denied.
This is not a call for spectacle or public shaming. It is a call for governance. Police reform cannot be reduced to dashboards, talking points or selective statistics. Reform requires public documentation, clear standards and demonstrable consequences for misconduct. Anything less erodes trust and deepens the very crises of legitimacy city leaders claim they are addressing.
If Memphis leadership is serious about reform, it must answer a basic question: what, if anything, has the mayor’s task force actually produced? The absence of any public findings or recommendations suggests that reform has been reduced to performance rather than practice. 
In the meantime, the city’s dismissal of the Department of Justice’s report as “meaningless” has left thousands of residents — already subjected to pretextual and racially disproportionate traffic stops—exposed to the very forms of police misconduct reform was supposed to address. This is not public safety. It is punitive populism masquerading as policing, operating without transparency, accountability, or meaningful oversight.
Memphis does not need more assurances that it is safer. It needs evidence that leadership is willing to govern with transparency, courage, and integrity — especially when it comes to policing. Political courage has been shown in other arenas. It is far past time to show it here, too.
