The Wake Forest Demon Deacons defeated the University of Delaware Fightin’ Blue Hens, 52-14, Saturday, November 22. The Blue Hens end the regular season with a 1-5 record on the road. 
 
Nick Minicucci and the University of Delaware offense moved the ball well as they operated within the two minute timeout. The Blue Hens trailed by three scores as the game neared halftime. Starting on the Demon Deacons’ 20-yard line, Minicucci connected with receiver Sean Wilson near the left sideline.
Wilson caught the pass and turned to run upfield, but as he made his move the ball fell from his hands. The ball bounced off cleats and shins before Wake Forest recovered the ball at its own 21-yard line. On the ensuing play, redshirt senior quarterback Robby Ashford launched a deep pass to junior Carlos Hernandez that was caught and taken 79 yards for a Demon Deacon score.
The quick score left UD with a 28 point deficit at halftime that it couldn’t overcome. The Demon Deacons defeated the Blue Hens, 52-14, in Delaware’s final road game of the season. The Blue Hens only won one game on the road this season. 
UD’s lone road win this season came in its first conference game against FIU back in late September. Since then, Delaware is 0-4 as the traveling team scoring less than 30 points in all but one of those games.
UD’s offense faced similar road struggles against Wake Forest’s 24th ranked defense in yards allowed per game in the country.  
The Blue Hens’ offense accumulated 35 total yards in the first quarter and only registered two first downs in the first 15 minutes. Delaware earned its first score of the game on a pass to sophomore running back Viron Ellison Jr. stepping in as the starter with senior Jo Silver out for the game. Ellison’s 43-yard catch and run down the left sideline cut the Demon Deacons’ two score lead down to one early in the second quarter. 
Wake Forest’s offense started strong by scoring on its first five offensive possessions. Running backs Demond Claiborne and Ty Clark III ran the ball into the endzone on Wake Forest’s two first quarter possessions. Connor Calvert converted on two field goals and Ashford ran in his first touchdown of the afternoon in the second quarter, before Ashford and Hernandez connected on their big play before halftime.
The Demon Deacons carried that momentum over to the third quarter scoring touchdowns on both of their third quarter drives. By the time the fourth quarter began, UD trailed by 42 points. 
Minicucci and other starters for both teams gave way to backups in the fourth quarter. Sophomore quarterback Braden Streeter threw his first touchdown pass of the season in the final frame giving UD one last score before the game ended. 
The Blue Hens finished the game with 300 total yards of offense. Ellison Jr. led the team in both rushing and receiving amassing 94 total yards on 16 touches. The Demon Deacons finished with a season high 577 total yards of offense along with a season high 52 points. Hernandez finished with 197 receiving yards and a Wake Forest record 93-yard touchdown catch.
The loss is Delaware’s sixth this season and second to a Power Four school — an opponent from the Big Ten, ACC, Big 12 or SEC conferences — in its first FBS season. In their road games against power four foes Colorado and Wake Forest, the Blue Hens scored a combined 21 points and allowed 83. 
The Blue Hens return home for senior night Saturday, November 29, in their final game as a first time FBS school.

(Photo by Jeanette DeDios/KUNM-FM)Members of the New Mexico congressional delegation and Pueblo leaders held a press conference at the All Indian Pueblo Cultural Center on Friday to urge Department of Interior Secretary Doug Burgum to visit Chaco Culture National Historical Park and continue protecting it from oil and gas drilling.
In October, the Bureau of Land Management began a process to revoke protections for 10 miles around the national parks to allow for possible oil and gas exploration.
This comes after the New Mexico congressional delegation and Pueblo governors held a press conference in front of the U.S. Capitol in September to demand that the Trump administration protect Chaco Canyon.
New Mexico tribal leaders push to protect Chaco

Chaco has massive buildings constructed over a thousand years ago by ancestral Pueblo people, with roads leading to other far-flung settlements.
Craig Quanchello, governor of the Picuris Pueblo and vice chairman of the All Pueblo Council of Governors, spoke on the cultural significance of Chaco.
“Our ancestors lived there, prayed there, studied the stars there, and carried teachings outward into our modern Pueblo communities,” he said. “Our ties to Chaco live in, our songs, our ceremonies, our pilgrimages and our ancient roads and shrines that stretch far beyond the park itself.”
U.S. Sens. Martin Heinrich and Ben Ray Luján were in attendance alongside U.S. Rep. Melanie Stansbury.
Stansbury said during the federal shutdown, tribal leaders were unable to reach the Bureau of Indian Affairs, but did receive a letter from the Trump Administration informing them that they had two weeks to respond to Chaco being taken out of federal protection.
“Can you imagine the cruelty, the insensitivity, the stupidity of an administration contacting tribal leaders as they are trying to figure out how they are going to feed their people and balance their budgets and keep their public safety in order to tell them that they are going to take away their most sacred lands and open it up for private oil and gas drilling?” she said.
Quanchello said that this issue affects everyone.
“This is not only a Pueblo issue, it’s an American issue about history, heritage and a landscape recognized around the world,” he said.
Congressional and Pueblo leaders invited Burgum to visit Chaco and to have a meaningful talk with them.

The Snow
Harper Goddard, 14, Chester
A fresh white blanket covers the hill.
I press my palms down into the layers.
Flakes fall onto my face.
They melt fast, but the feeling stays,
that numbness that soaks the apples of my cheeks.
I take off my mittens.
The pain is worth it.
The cold overrules all.
Maybe if I lie here long enough, it will swallow me whole. 
My hair turns into damp, tangled strands of amber.
My eyelashes are no longer light brown, but white.
My nose is pink, nearly sunburnt.
There’s a silence that comes with the snow,
a peace of some sort.
I’ve never known a world like this –
a tranquil world,
a worry-free world.
A world where only your breathing is heard.
It almost feels like a dream.
My heart beats quickly inside my chest.
Not in fear;
I know fear well.
It’s a different feeling.
The pond smooths over with a thick layer of ice.
The water now looks as though it’s running clean.
The plow scrapes loudly against the asphalt patch of our driveway.
The driver is inconsistent in his schedule, driving my mother mad each morning he doesn’t show.
How did I go from Santa Ana winds to this?
The universe works in mysterious ways…
Nearly everyone within our little town groans at the sight of the tiny specks falling to the ground.
“I hate winter,” they all say.
I think it’s a gift. But I’ll never tell them that.

Cancer shouldn’t be harder to fight just because you live in a small, rural community. 
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Randall Holcombe: The Vermont cancer care model, a rural cancer care revolution.","This commentary is by Randall Holcombe, M.D., of Burlington. He is the associate dean for cancer programs at the University of Vermont’s Larner College of Medicine and director of the UVM Cancer Center, Vermont’s only not-for-profit comprehensive clinical and research cancer center. 


At a recent appointment, one of my patients asked me, “How long are you staying around?”
It wasn’t a casual question. In rural Vermont, folks have seen their share of “locums” — short-term doctors who come for a few weeks or months and then move on. For cancer patients, that revolving door can feel unsettling and leads to fragmented, poorly coordinated care. They want to know the person caring for them will be there for the long haul.
The truth is, recruiting oncologists to rural areas has always been difficult, and across the country the number of cancer doctors hasn’t kept pace with demand. A major study in the Journal of Clinical Oncology from 2007 predicted that demand for oncologists would increase by 48% by 2020. From 2015 to 2022, the number of medical oncologists grew by only 14.5%. This gap hits rural communities hardest.
And here’s the tough reality: nationwide, rural patients are more likely to die from cancer than those in cities. That’s not acceptable. At the UVM Cancer Center, our mission is to reduce the burden of cancer for everyone in Vermont and northern New York. That means making sure people in every corner of our catchment area, especially those in rural communities, have access to expert, academic-level cancer care.
So, what are we doing about it? 
First, we’re planting seeds for a stronger oncology workforce.  One big step we took this year is expanding our hematology and oncology fellowship program to include rotations in rural practices. We hope that by training fellows in rural settings they might one day establish or join an oncology practice in a rural community.
Also, this year we launched our BioMobile Laboratory program — a lab on wheels in our Cancer Center van that will be traveling to rural high schools around the state. By giving students an up-close look at cool cancer science and research, we hope to inspire them to become the next generation of doctors and scientists in Vermont. 
Our van is also traversing the state to bring community skin checks, HPV vaccination clinics  and educational programs that encourage colon cancer, breast cancer and lung cancer screening. We know that today’s efforts will reap long term benefits, when fewer of our family members and neighbors get diagnosed with advanced stage cancers. 
And, starting next year, the UVM Cancer Center will lay the foundation for a statewide collaborative network that connects academic cancer experts at the UVM Cancer Center with primary care practices. We call it the “Vermont Cancer Care Model,” and it’s designed to improve cancer outcomes for rural patients while supporting a community of providers, leading to lower rates of physician burnout and a more stable healthcare workforce.
Under this system, rural providers can consult with disease-specific experts about how to help patients manage cancer treatment side effects. Meanwhile, rural cancer patients will receive as much of their care as possible close to home, which reduces costs and eliminates unnecessary travel. This system may even allow patients to participate in cutting-edge clinical trials run by the UVM Cancer Center, which today are only available if patients travel to Burlington or Berlin.  
At the UVM Cancer Center, we are starting this work today, and we believe our efforts will improve the quality of care, reduce the burden of cancer on patients, and lower overall health care costs.
It’s true that big ideas and building a new infrastructure require investment — but don’t Vermonters deserve this? Cancer shouldn’t be harder to fight just because you live in a small, rural community. It’s time to change that and make Vermont a model for rural cancer care nationwide.
When my patient asked if I was staying, I told them, “I’m here to stay.” Their smile said it all. But wouldn’t it be something if, one day, no patient ever had to ask that question again?

,Mississippi Today,2025-11-23 12:00:00+00:00,Mississippi Today,Supreme Court could strike down a rare Mississippi effort to improve voter access,Bobby Harrison,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/11/23/mississippi-voter-access-supreme-court/,Republican groups are asking the U.S. Supreme Court to rule that a law passed by a GOP-led Mississippi Legislature is unconstitutional. The law is a rare example of Mississippi improving voter access.,"Seldom in the history of the state has the Legislature passed laws, without being forced to by the federal courts, to make it easier for Mississippians to vote.
As COVID-19 spread in 2020, Mississippi legislators and election officials were criticized by national groups because of their nominal efforts to accommodate voters during the deadly pandemic. In the midst of the health scare, Mississippi legislators took one step to improve voter access.
Granted, it was a small step, but by Mississippi standards perhaps a landmark event. The Legislature amended state law to allow mail-in ballots to be counted if they arrived in the circuit clerk’s office within five days after Election Day.
Republican groups are now asking the U.S. Supreme Court to rule that a law passed by the Republican-dominated Mississippi Legislature is unconstitutional.

Never mind that Mississippi is one of only three states in the nation that does not allow some form of no-excuse early voting – in person, by mail or both. Never mind that many of the people who are allowed to vote by mail – if they have an excuse – must have two election documents signed in front of a notary public to do so. In many cases, the mail-in ballot request must be notarized and then the envelope that is used to return the ballot via mail also must be notarized.
So, in 2020, the small step of providing some protection to ensure mail-in ballots would be counted even if there was a postal office snafu was celebrated.
And it seems a bit perplexing that the Republican National Committee would challenge the five-day rule in Mississippi since many other states – 14 – had similar laws and in some cases have had the laws for some time. Even more states – 29 – allow military and overseas ballots that are postmarked by Election Day to be counted after Election Day, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. It is not clear what a Supreme Court ruling striking down the Mississippi law would do to the overseas and military ballots.
Most believe that if the law is found unconstitutional in Mississippi, it would mean the other states that allow mail ballots to be counted after Election Day – as long as they are postmarked on or before that day – also would be null and void.
Such a change could be important in a so-called swing state where the elections are often close and a few thousand late-arriving ballots could make a difference in determining the next president.
But the only problem with that thinking is that most of the states that allow late-arriving ballots to be counted are not swing states. Some are blue states while others are red. Nevada is perhaps the only swing state that allows late-arriving ballots to be counted if they arrive after Election Day, excluding the additional states that allow late-arriving military and overseas ballots to be counted.
The Mississippi five-day rule has a certain symmetry. After all, people who try to vote without the required government-issued photo identification have five days after the election to prove they are who they say they are. So, it makes a certain amount of logic to allow election officials to also count late-arriving ballots for five days as long as they were postmarked by Election Day.
Plus, the five-day rule must help a little for people voting by mail who must get two documents notarized.
Various groups have routinely listed Mississippi at the top or near the top in terms of the most restrictive states to vote.
Now, will the nation’s highest court rule that one of the state’s few efforts to improve access is unconstitutional?",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/04110931/3X0A1890.jpg,,,2025-11-23 07:56:16.193046

The state’s largest ski area hopes to welcome back the international racing circuit’s annual Thanksgiving weekend competition in 2026 —potentially on an every-other-year schedule.

KILLINGTON — Killington Resort, on hiatus from hosting World Cup ski racing as it completes $60 million in improvements, is aiming to welcome back the circuit’s Thanksgiving weekend competition in 2026.
The one caveat: The state’s largest ski area and its new independent owners are talking about limiting their future participation to every other year due to the international event’s $2 million annual cost.
“It’s an expensive operation,” Phill Gross, a lead Killington investor and private capital manager, said at a recent community meeting. “It takes cash flow away from the development of the mountain, as good as it is for the brand.”
Since its Vermont debut in 2016, the World Cup annually draws up to 20,000 spectators and a national television audience of 2 million viewers for Alpine women’s races on the Saturday and Sunday after Thanksgiving.
When local investors formed the Killington Independence Group to buy the ski area last year, they announced $38 million in upgrades — starting with a new $12 million Superstar trail chairlift whose construction required this month’s competition to relocate to Copper Mountain in Colorado.
Killington leaders now are floating the idea of taking turns hosting the World Cup with the western ski area. 
“We’re hoping that we can do an every-other-year contract,” Gross said, “but that’s to be determined.”

As for other plans, the new owners just announced an additional $22 million in infrastructure work as they raise the capacity and reduce the energy consumption of the resort’s 9-million-gallon-a-day snowmaking system.
“Part of being independent that’s really been great for us is just being nimble and quick,” Killington CEO Mike Solimano said at the community meeting. “Say we have savings in one capital project, we can quickly decide to implement another one.”
The development comes seven decades after a 20-something visiting honeymooner named Preston Smith raised $30,000 for a simple shelter and parking lot and opened Killington’s first trails in 1958. 
Smith, now 95, went on to create the biggest snow-sport resort in eastern North America. It was sold to the Maine-based American Skiing Company in 1996 (the same year neighboring Pico Mountain joined its portfolio), then to the Utah-based Powdr Corp. in 2007 and finally to the Killington Independence Group last year.
The latest plans call for upgrading the resort’s more than 20 chairlifts over multiple years to ensure access to all 92 miles of terrain, even during snowstorms.
In a related but separate action, Canada’s Great Gulf real estate group — another lead Killington investor — is continuing to seek permits for a 450-acre retail and residential slopeside village. Developers unveiled plans two years ago with hopes of starting construction as soon as 2026, but design changes and ongoing study by local and state review boards have sparked delays.
“I would say there’s a ton going on, but not a ton I can really report on,” Solimano said of the status of the village development process.
Killington was the first eastern U.S. resort to open this ski season, launching Nov. 12 with a record amount of snow-covered terrain. The new owners anticipate a busy Thanksgiving week, even without international racing.
“I think as much as everyone loves the World Cup, others are going to be thinking, ‘I really like having all these trails open,’” Solimano said.

This story by Clare Shanahan was first published in the Valley News on Nov. 18, 2025.
WHITE RIVER JUNCTION — Parking changes are on the horizon in three Upper Valley communities. After much debate, meters are scheduled to be installed in downtown White River Junction in the coming weeks. Elsewhere, a Hanover parking garage was slated to reopen this week and Woodstock has approved a new parking ordinance.
The 16 new kiosks in White River Junction will regulate 211 parking spaces, including on-street parking and spaces in the town square parking lot across from the Hotel Coolidge. It will remain free to park in the South Main Street lot near the VFW building all day.
Parking will cost $1 an hour and can be paid for in 15-minute increments for up to two hours. The kiosks will accept cash and cards, and connect to a mobile phone app. The system, from San Diego-based IPS Group, is the same one that is online in Hanover.
The goal of the meters is “not so much about the revenue as about making sure that people are in compliance” with an existing two-hour parking limit in most downtown spots, Planning and Development Director Lori Hirshfield said.
Whether to install parking meters has been a point of contention in Hartford for years. The Selectboard came under fire last fall when its members unanimously opted to use $145,000 in leftover COVID-19 aid to purchase the kiosks.
The decision was unpopular with many residents who saw their votes against using $160,000 of local option tax revenue to purchase meters in 2020 as a rejection of parking meters altogether. The town ballot measure was defeated handily by a margin of 2,088-906.
After public outcry, the Selectboard briefly delayed its vote on the parking ordinance that would implement meters before opting to approve the policy at a July 14 meeting with the goal of increasing turnover in downtown White River Junction which is often strapped for parking to access downtown businesses.
Exactly when the meters will be installed is not yet clear, but once contractors start the work it will take three to four days to get the kiosks installed, Hirshfield said.
Once the meters are installed they won’t be turned on right away, Hirshfield said. Town staff will have to test the machines to make sure everything is running smoothly, install signage around town with parking information and hire staff to enforce the meters, Hirshfield said. They also want to give residents time to get used to the new system.
The revenues are expected to cover the cost of an enforcement officer within the Hartford Police Department. Hiring for that role is still ongoing.
Hanover parking garage to reopen
In Hanover, the municipal parking garage that has been closed to the public for renovations since mid-September is scheduled to partially reopen Wednesday, according to an announcement from the town.
Work included concrete repairs, updates to emergency lights and the structure’s carbon monoxide monitoring system and other structural work.
Along with the reopening, the Hanover Selectboard opted at a Monday night meeting to introduce new parking rates in the garage for a three-month trial period starting Wednesday.
The new rates will include one hour of free parking, an increase from the previous 15-minute limit, and charge by the hour instead of by 15-minute increments. Rates range from $3 for one to two hours to $20 for the day.
With the changes, the town aims to “streamline” parking garage operations and “simplify the fee structure,” Town Manager Robert Houseman said in a recording of the meeting. During the three months, town staff will monitor garage usage, revenues and customer feedback to make long-term adjustments to parking in downtown Hanover.
Woodstock trustees adopt new parking ordinance
In Woodstock, the Board of Village Trustees unanimously adopted a new parking ordinance last week that is set to take effect in January. The ordinance, which has been in the works since the start of the year, makes several changes to village parking. These include raising fines for parking at an unpaid or expired meter from $10 to $15.
Parking fees also will be charged from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. Monday through Saturday, one hour less than previously. The new ordinance also adjusts parking regulations around the village, including designating Ford Street, Stanton Street and Charles Street as new no parking zones.
The ordinance has been in the works since January when Trustee Lisa Lawlor started looking at ways to increase revenues in the Village that are not contingent on taxes. Lawlor found that the previous fines for not feeding the meter are lower than other towns that are either similar or nearby to Woodstock.
The change in fines was a good opportunity to look at the existing ordinance and focus on making it “easier to understand for everyone,” Woodstock Municipal Manager Eric Duffy said at the time.
The town was successful in that effort, Lawlor said.
“We clarified; we did everything we could to make the language more straightforward,” she said at the Nov. 10 meeting.

Jim Pillen's press conference at the Governor's Mansion on April 28, 2025. Pillen is running for reelection. (Juan Salinas II/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — The Republican primary race for Nebraska governor is already heating up, and it might soon get serious. 
Trump donor and multi-state agribusinessman Charles Herbster has made more pointed statements about Gov. Jim Pillen in recent weeks on social media.  
Herbster’s posts have shifted in tone from talking about national politics and President Donald Trump, with some references to state politics, to more direct criticism of Pillen as he continues mulling a 2026 rematch bid for governor.
Starting this month, Herbster has criticized Pillen for not listening to the business community, for not selling the state aggressively enough to business leaders elsewhere and for resisting voter-approved medical cannabis, the legalization of which Herbster now says should be respected. 
“Our governor should be the state’s leading salesman,” Herbster wrote one post. “To say we should not focus on attracting new businesses is beyond reckless — it is not leadership.”

In another social media post, Herbster said, “Governor Jim Pillen has done everything he can to delay and dismantle the voter-enacted medical cannabis statutes.”
Herbster also has started reviving his 2022 campaign staple of saying he wants to “Make Nebraska Great Again” and sounds more and more like someone running for governor. 
Asked this week whether his statements should be read as telegraphing a 2026 bid, he told the Examiner, “Governor Pillen’s shortcomings make it hard to say no.” Herbster said his decision on whether to run would come closer to the new year. 
“We are not on a path to success,” Herbster said. “Our governor seems stubbornly convinced he alone has all the answers and continues to double down on failure. He can tout some social-issue wins — which I wholeheartedly support — but Nebraskans are worried about the economy.”
If Herbster gets in, 2026 would be a rematch between the two candidates who received the most votes in the 2022 GOP gubernatorial primary. That race included former State Sen. Brett Lindstrom of Omaha, who is now running for the open seat in Nebraska’s Omaha-based 2nd Congressional District. Lindstrom finished third in that 2022 GOP primary.

That 2022 contest was one of the most expensive gubernatorial races in Nebraska history, with $29 million flowing into it. Herbster largely self-funded his campaign, while Pillen raised large sums and also benefitted from outside help by then-Gov. Pete Ricketts.
Herbster during that 2022 primary earned the endorsement of President Donald Trump, while Pillen was backed by Ricketts. Pillen appointed Ricketts to the U.S. Senate shortly after becoming governor. Ricketts, R-Neb., won a special election in November to serve out the final two years of former GOP U.S. Sen. Ben Sasse’s term. Ricketts is currently in a heated race against former Omaha labor leader Dan Osborn, a registered nonpartisan. 
Herbster spent weeks of that campaign denying the allegations of eight women who alleged in a 2022 Nebraska Examiner article that Herbster had groped them. All eight accounts were corroborated either by witnesses or people the women told what happened immediately afterward. But the reasons for his loss were more complex than the national political narrative.

Several GOP operatives have expected Pillen to draw at least one primary challenger, partly because of national and local polling numbers that indicate he could be vulnerable. Among the criticisms they and others have said he is likely to face are about increased state spending, the effectiveness of state investments in property tax relief and his tax and budget proposals.
But Pillen is an incumbent, and Nebraska rarely changes horses midstream. The last incumbent Republican to lose the Governor’s Mansion was Gov. Kay Orr, who lost to Democrat Ben Nelson in 1990. Pillen had more than $3 million in cash on hand last year, state campaign finance reports show. Many expect him to raise more than $10 million. 
The governor announced his reelection bid in May. His campaign video focused on controversies familiar to those who followed his 2022 campaign, including support for tougher immigration enforcement and other culture-war issues. Pillen, in his end of session speech to state lawmakers, touted the passage of bills that limit high school and college sports participation to students’ sex at birth, banning lab-grown meat and lowering income tax rates.
Herbster said Nebraskans are with Pillen on some of those issues, but he said more needs to be done about core issues that have long been central for statewide campaigns — particularly job creation and reducing property taxes. 
People, Herbster said, are “worried about property taxes.” He said “they’re worried about making ends meet.”
Pillen’s campaign declined to comment Friday on Herbster’s potential bid.
Pillen, whose family owns a major hog operation based in Columbus, has prioritized property tax relief, including investing $1 billion into a state effort to fund more of special education costs and a baseline amount of state aid to K-12 schools. 
The governor said last week that he wants to address property taxes again soon. But state lawmakers face a larger projected deficit this upcoming session than the one senators just filled this spring.
Nebraska Democrats have hinted at an announcement of a gubernatorial candidate as early as this week. Some Democratic political observers have speculated that a state senator might run. Others have made noise about a possible third-party or nonpartisan candidate.
Republicans outnumber Democrats in Nebraska by roughly 2-to-1, with about 22% registered either nonpartisan or with a third party. The GOP primary for governor is May 12. The general election is Nov. 3.

(Photo by Christiana Botic / Verite News and Catchlight Local/Report for America)NEW ORLEANS — On the afternoon of Sept. 22, a text thread on Jennie Moctezuma’s phone started flooding with messages after federal immigration authorities appeared near KIPP East Community Primary School in New Orleans East, according to eye witnesses and school administrators.
The messages — sent between members of local immigrant-led civil rights group Unión Migrante — said U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents were spotted at the end of the street where cars lined up to collect children leaving the school during dismissal.
A former school administrator in New Orleans in the years following Hurricane Katrina, Moctezuma knew the impact of stressful situations — like a parent potentially being arrested and detained — on young minds.
“Children who are in trauma can’t thrive when they’re carrying around fear, even if they’re little,” Moctezuma said in a phone interview in November. “They may not understand what’s happening, but they can certainly feel it.”

When administrators at KIPP New Orleans Schools, the charter school network that runs KIPP East, found out about the agents, they sprang into action. They wanted to make sure that, whatever was happening, dismissal remained safe for children, guardians and school staff, according to the managing director of impact Ashley Daniels-Hall and director of school operations Maleka Williams.
Daniels-Hall said ICE agents were “cooperative” when school administrators asked them to move their vehicles that blocked the pickup line. In an email to other KIPP staff, Daniels-Hall said that ICE was in the neighborhood for “something separate.”
“Thankfully, they did not attempt to interfere with dismissal,” Williams said. The administrators were not aware of anyone connected to the school being arrested.
ICE spokesperson Linsday Williams wrote in an email to Verite News that their, “operations were not conducted at the school and had no impact on its activities.”
It was not the first time immigration officials were seen near a KIPP School. Williams said ICE agents showed up near KIPP Morial, also in New Orleans East, in March. According to Daniels-Hall, agents did not enter the school campus and appeared to be searching for a specific individual.

Since President Donald Trump took office in January, promising mass deportations, federal immigration authorities have increasingly been conducting raids and effecting arrests in or near locations once seen as off-limits.
In the first days the beginning of Trump’s second term, the U.S. The Department of Homeland Security — which oversees ICE and U.S. Border Patrol — removed Biden-era measures that placed restrictions on immigration enforcement actions in or near “sensitive locations,” including courthouses, churches, medical facilities and schools. 
“ICE is NOT targeting schools or daycare centers,” read a September press release from ICE.
But in the past few months, there have been documented immigration arrests around a school outside of San Diego and in Oakland, California, both at times of day when parents would be present. And in the midst of stepped-up immigration actions in Chicago as part of operation “Midway Blitz,” immigration agents went inside a daycare center building to arrest a teacher.  School attendance has dropped in Chicago since the immigration crackdown began, particularly in schools in areas that have been targeted.
Fear in New Orleans’ immigrant communities has lately intensified this week, after the Associated Press reported that 250 Border Patrol agents will come to New Orleans and surrounding areas to conduct immigration sweeps, similar to what has happened during Midway Blitz in Chicago and, over the past week, during operation “Charlotte’s Web” in Charlotte, North Carolina.
According to the AP, authorities plan to arrest as many as 5,000 people in Southeast Louisiana as part of operation “Swamp Sweep.”
‘The fears are there’
The day after agents were spotted near KIPP East, Moctezuma drove from her home near the Fairgrounds to meet other Unión Migrante members near the school to canvass the neighborhood. Volunteers circled several blocks surrounding the school and created Facebook Live reels declaring that streets were all clear. They offered to escort children to school, although, she said, no one was needed in that capacity.
While there have not been reports of immigration actions in or directly surrounding New Orleans area schools this year, federal agents have been seen conducting investigations and arrests within a few blocks of schools, according to sources who have spoken with Verite News.
Since the news about Border Patrol’s imminent arrival in New Orleans broke, InspireNOLA CEO Jamar McKneely said he’s received multiple emails from families concerned about what protections schools will offer to make sure students and their families don’t become targets.
“Our families can know how we’re trying to protect them, that they just don’t have to pull their kids out of school, that they don’t have to be concerned,” McKneely said.

K-12 schools are required by federal law to educate students regardless of their immigration status. KIPP New Orleans and InspireNOLA, the largest charter networks in New Orleans, confirmed that they do not collect information regarding family status. That’s also true in Jefferson Parish schools, where 39% of students are Hispanic.
But fears about immigrant tracking laws and activity near schools persist. Clay Moise, a member of the Jefferson Parish School Board, said community members have reached out to him with their concerns.
“The fears are there,” Moise said. “Our response has been the same all along. We don’t allow ICE into our schools as policy.”
NOLA Public Schools did not respond to requests for comment. Gabriela Biro, a board member on the Orleans Parish School Board, speaking in her personal capacity, said she encouraged residents to join groups like Unión Migrante.
Charter school administrators in Orleans Parish have been training staff to prevent potential ICE enforcement on campuses. While McKneely said that InspireNOLA is starting to work on its policies to protect students, Daniels-Hall said KIPP has a clearly outlined process to determine if ICE agents should be allowed on campus, which includes requiring a judicial warrant. Before an agent can come on the grounds, a staff member should work with their legal team to ensure that a warrant is viable, Daniels-Hall said, adding that these extra training measures for front office and operations staff are meant to “keep the school community safe.”
So far, those measures seem to have worked. There have been no appreciable drops in attendance among Hispanic students at KIPP, Moise and Daniels-Hall said. The Sept. 22 incident, Daniels-Hall said, didn’t impact attendance the following day.
But that could change if sweeps intensify due operation Swamp Sweep, which is reportedly set to begin in earnest after Thanksgiving. (While it might have been a coincidence, McKneely said some schools in his network saw a drop in attendance the day after news about Border Patrol coming to New Orleans broke.)
“Schools are a safe place for students and families,” Daniels-Hall said. “[We’re] really reinforcing that we’re doing any and every thing to keep the school community safe, that it’s a safe place and it’s supposed to be a joyful place for children to learn.”

(Photo courtesy of Moms Over Margins)Brown University Health has named the 12 members of its new Community Advisory Panel who will discuss the fate of our beloved Newport Hospital’s Noreen Stonor Drexel Birthing Center. Of the 12 individuals named, five of them are employed in some capacity by Brown University Health and two of them sit on the Newport Hospital Foundation Board; I believe that most of them truly have the best interests of the community in mind, despite the fact there are significant segments of the community unrepresented by this group. 
To be clear, I applaud every individual who is able to serve on the panel, while still wondering if there’s more that can be done by Brown University Health to make this feel like a community-wide process. 
Newport Hospital birthing center community advisory board to hold first meeting next week

I appreciate that it is impractical to invite every single key stakeholder into the room, but those who would be most impacted by the closure of the birthing center — notably, those who do not have the means to travel elsewhere to attend to their reproductive needs, and those within the BIPOC community, who already face statistically and significantly worse maternal health outcomes — may not have a direct voice in this process. 
Furthermore, due to the fact that all members of this Community Advisory Panel are required to sign a confidentiality agreement prior to their participation, I am concerned there may not be as much clarity as the community deserves regarding the discussions and outcomes of these meetings. Brown University Health said panel members were asked to sign the agreement because they will be receiving proprietary information. But there are thousands of people in Newport County who have a right to know what’s going on throughout this process, and Brown University Health has a duty to update the community on what takes place in these closed-door meetings by virtue of the fact that they operate Newport County’s only hospital. The whole community has a very real and critical stake in this outcome, and I urge Brown University Health to be open with the community about when the general public can expect regular and candid briefings about this process and any relevant information discussed at these meetings.
I would also recommend that, when considering a Community Advisory Panel that will determine the future of our island’s families, the timing of these meetings be a little more family-friendly. There will be four meetings to determine the birthing center’s survival, which will take place from 4-5:30 p.m. on weekdays between now and the end of April — the first of which will occur the Monday before Thanksgiving, the busiest travel week in the United States. I was, in fact, invited to participate in the Community Advisory Panel, but I had to decline due to my working hours and our day care’s pickup time, which is one of the latest on the island.

It is understandably impossible to accommodate every individual’s needs and schedule, but the time selected for the meetings does seem to unintentionally exclude most parents and working individuals without flexible schedules, many of whom will likely need or have already used the birthing center’s services.
Newport Hospital’s birthing center has provided exemplary, evidence-based care for decades and is recognized by the World Health Organization and UNICEF as “baby friendly,” becoming only the 40th hospital in the U.S. to earn that distinction. I speak from personal experience when I say that it is the exception, not the rule, to find safe, high-quality, compassionate care in one place for reproductive needs, and the Noreen Stonor Drexel Birthing Center goes above and beyond to deliver just that. 
I applaud every person who is selflessly sacrificing their personal and professional time to be a part of this panel and hope that Brown University Health will truly listen and learn from the individuals they have selected about exactly what this birthing center means to our community, the lives it saves, and the profound impact it has on the very fabric of our island.

Not if you’re in a rush,Jan Ellen Spiegel,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/11/23/ct-nuclear-energy-future/,"The owner of the one nuclear station in CT sees the challenges of building new nuclear here. If those could be overcome, it would be a long way off.","Nuclear power seems to be having a moment.
As the Trump administration methodically throws up roadblocks to slow, if not stop, carbon-free renewable solar and wind power, carbon-free nuclear appears to be the go-to idea for large amounts of power that are presumed to be needed in the future for data centers, AI and more. 
Nevermind that before two new nuclear plants opened in Georgia in 2023 and 2024 — seven years late and double their original budget — there had been no new nuclear power plants in the U.S. in more than 30 years. 
Now the chatter is around so-called small modular and micro-reactors — touted as easier, cheaper, and faster, leading to a public perception they are ready to be pulled off the shelf and plugged in.
But here’s the problem with that. They don’t exist yet.
Former Nuclear Regulatory Commission Chair Allison Macfarlane, now director of the School of Public Policy and Global Affairs at the University of British Columbia, is among those who are frustrated with the public and governmental belief about small modular reactors, also known as SMRs. 
“They do think that,” she said of the public perception that small nuclear reactors are an immediate option to help meet energy needs. “A lot of the media writes about these things as if they do exist. ‘We know that they’re cheap, we know that they’re safe.’ But we don’t know anything, because they don’t exist.”
But they are in development. As of last summer, the Nuclear Energy Agency dashboard listed 127 different small modular reactor designs in existence globally, with about 60% of them in active stages of research and development. 
There are three reactors operating around the world that are reported to be small reactors: A floating one in Russia powering a remote Arctic region and two in China, but details about those projects have not been shared.

The SMRs are often bundled under the category of advanced nuclear energy. That advanced designation generally refers to the supposedly newer ways they are cooled, and changes to pressurization and uranium formulation common to the water-cooled light-water reactors that comprise most of the world-wide nuclear reactor fleet today. 
“Advanced is rather a misnomer of a term,” Macfarlane said, echoing the views of others. “It should really be non-light-water, because ‘advanced’ suggests there’s something new here, and there isn’t anything new. Most of these technologies have been tried for 50 to 70 years.”
She said eight countries have tried to build more than 25 different versions of one of the technologies — sodium-cooled fast reactors. “No one has been able to get them to produce electricity economically, viably and reliably.”
What do we know and what don’t we know about updated nuclear power options? And how realistic are any of them — including in Connecticut?
The short answer — even the owner of the one nuclear station in Connecticut sees the challenges of building new nuclear in the state. And if those could be overcome, it would be a long way off.
The basics of nuclear power haven’t changed much in decades. It’s carbon-free. The classic units — like the 94 stations operating in the U.S. — can generate a lot of power. The two units at the Millstone Nuclear Power Station total about 2,100 megawatts. Plants can provide that power 24/7 with planned interruptions for re-fueling and maintenance. Despite a plant’s large footprint compared to similarly sized fossil fuel power, it takes up far less space than renewables such as wind and solar fields.
It’s more efficient than other forms of power, including renewables, which means nuclear doesn’t lose as high a percentage of its power as other power sources do. Some nuclear systems require a lot of water for cooling — but so do conventional power plants — leaving both vulnerable to droughts, floods and warming water, some of which are due to climate change.
But nuclear power is not renewable and its radioactive waste is not really recyclable, as some claim. Plants take a long time to build and they cost a lot of money. 
Enter the notion of small nuclear power plants broadly, and SMRs specifically.
Smaller nuclear units
“I find the name SMR a little bit misleading because it should be called smaller modular reactor, because they’re still 300 megawatts,” said Jacopo Buongiorno, professor of nuclear science and engineering at MIT. “This is a substantial facility, requires a lot of civil work, site excavation. So it’s not a factory-produced reactor by any stretch of the imagination.”
Buongiorno said the first one likely to be built in North America is from BWRX — a longstanding nuclear company — at the Darlington nuclear site in Canada. It’s slated for 300 megawatts. 
An early-stage project in Wyoming by TerraPower, a private company founded by Bill Gates, will be 345 megawatts. In October the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, NRC, approved its environmental impact statement, the first such designation for new technology nuclear.

The federal government-owned Tennessee Valley Authority, TVA, is also building what it calls an advanced nuclear SMR that uses molten-salt cooling. The unit by Kairos, a startup, is not expected to go online before 2030.
Prior to these efforts, the Biden administration had approved one new project by another startup — NuScale — for a unit in Idaho. But that plan dissolved when costs increased. A larger NuScale design was approved in May by the Trump administration.
Also in May, President Donald Trump signed four executive orders to speed up several aspects of nuclear development. They include adding 300 gigawatts — that’s 300,000 megawatts — of nuclear power by 2050. And they order the NRC to speed up licensing, which some see as dangerous rubber stamping. Earlier this month, Trump nominated a former executive at Westinghouse, a longtime player in the nuclear space, to the NRC.
But Buongiorno and others said, as an alternative to the SMR, there is a proven modernized reactor already available in the U.S. — the AP1000 — Westinghouse’s full-size reactor. 
“It’s a great design. It’s an American design. And my personal opinion is that our best bet if we want to grow nuclear is to build more of those AP1000s,” he said. “The downside of the AP1000 and any other large reactor is it takes time to build these units, and it costs a lot of money.”
That is also the reactor used in the two new units added to Georgia’s existing Vogtle plant. But Buongiorno said it would be a mistake to judge the economics of a new big reactor like the AP1000 by the Vogtle experience. It was the first of its kind so likely to be more expensive and slower, though he admitted overall the U.S. nuclear industry does not have the greatest construction track record.     
Westinghouse also hadn’t built a nuclear plant in a generation, which brings up another category of problems. The kind of skilled workforce and expertise needed to build and maintain a nuclear facility has all but vanished in the U.S., as has the supply chain that once supported nuclear construction. While the fuel supply is the same for old and new nuclear plants, there’s not enough of it and some of what is needed comes from Russia.

Then there is the question of whether SMRs and micro-reactors will be cheaper and easier to build. The answer depends on the definition of cheaper and easier, especially considering the cost per unit of power.
Ask Buongiorno if it’s cheaper: “The answer is absolutely no. We expect, actually, small, modular reactors to produce energy that will be more expensive than large reactors. This is a mathematical certainty.”
Ask Macfarlane: “It’s quite realistic — at least the light water reactor designs are realistic. The advanced designs less so.” In fact, Macfarlane has just co-written a paper on the cost question. “We conclude that economies of scale still will hold. It’s just simply cheaper to build a single, large light water reactor than 10 small ones,” she said.
Ask Jeff Semancik, the Radiation Division director at the Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection (DEEP): “There’s a trade-off that you’re looking at between what are the upfront capital costs versus the long term cost of electricity.”
On the other hand, Buongiorno points out that investors will perceive the upfront risk as smaller.
“If the check that you need to write at the beginning of the project to build the plant is $3 billion instead of $10 billion, the risk associated with the project is significantly smaller. And that’s really the value proposition for the smaller reactors, the overall project risk, financial as well as execution. There is less to build.”
It’s generally thought the footprint for an SMR won’t be that much smaller, especially if the plan is to install several at once. Siting might be a little easier because of new safety systems that require a smaller perimeter, though factors like access to transmission lines or availability of transmission capacity could impact siting and cost.
The lower the power, the less potential radioactivity if a problem arises. There’s also less radioactive waste, though there’s still no U.S. repository to store it.
As the scale continues to shrink, Buongiorno believes his point about the cost per kilowatt hour continues to hold true. Power from microreactors would be even more expensive per unit, but they are a different animal. They are envisioned to be 10-15 megawatts, but could be as small as one megawatt. The concept is also more as a standalone system that’s not necessarily tied to the grid, so the need for transmission and distribution and its costs may be avoided even though the power itself costs more.
Their use, experts say, would be more for out-of-the-way or hard-to-access locations where connecting to a grid would be extremely expensive or even impossible and where the alternative might be diesel generators. Think remote mining camps or extreme rural Alaska without connecting highways. Or for use by the military, which the Trump executive orders specifically target. The military has a history of small reactor use in things like submarines and aircraft carriers going back decades, though the technologies are not the same as land units.
“The business model is very different. These are not grid-connected electric generators. These are co-located with their end users” Buongiorno said. “So the devil is in the detail of these things, which means it’s all going to be site- and customer-dependent.”
Microreactors are expected to be easily transportable with other needed components, but they are even less developed than SMRs. An initial testing pilot project in the U.S. is expected next summer, which may be aggressive timing, even though some of the well-known and experienced nuclear companies are looking at them. So true deployment, even if everything goes well, is still years away.
What it means for Connecticut
New nuclear is on the table here.
In the last few legislative sessions, lawmakers cleared a slight path. They lifted the state’s nuclear moratorium for the Dominion site in Waterford, which houses Millstone, thereby allowing for nuclear expansion at that location. They also established a process for municipalities to begin consideration of hosting new nuclear facilities and authorized $5 million in bond funds for DEEP to give grants for technical assistance for early site permitting.
To that end, in October DEEP announced informational sessions beginning in December to help municipalities better understand what nuclear power and its new iterations entail.
DEEP is aware of the realities of potential new nuclear power, as evidenced in this 2024 report that noted advanced nuclear technology, SMRs and more are in early stages and that “cost competitiveness has not yet been demonstrated and is unlikely to be realized unless or until such technologies move beyond ‘first of a kind’ projects and are deployed at scale.”
In other words, there’s a long way to go.
“It’s a significant amount of time that’s required to get these large projects off the ground,” said DEEP Commissioner Katie Dykes, noting that a project like Revolution Wind, under construction now, first solicited proposals in 2017. “Many of the resources that we’re talking about now and planning and engaging on, we’re contemplating deployment and commercial operation timelines that are in the late 2030s. That’s not unique to nuclear.”
But Connecticut does have some unique circumstances with nuclear — some helpful, some less so.
Dykes thinks the national lack of a nuclear workforce is less of an issue here with existing training at Three Rivers Community College in partnership with Dominion, as well as the skill sets associated with the state’s large defense industry — especially submarines and their nuclear components. And she said DEEP already is responsible for nuclear safety.
On the other hand, she and others point out that a deregulated utility market like Connecticut’s could face challenges with nuclear’s expense. 
“How do we create the right balance in terms of the investment approach here to making our market an attractive place to invest while not burdening ratepayers with all of the risks of cost increases?” she asked.
In the meantime, in late October, Connecticut signed on as the 12th observer state to an effort known as Advanced Nuclear First Movers, which also has 11 full state members. Its inception was several years ago through the National Association of State Energy Officials, NASEO, as an education mechanism around advanced and other new nuclear.
Now more formalized, the group is working through the variables and unknowns as states consider the various technologies in the face of state climate policies, electricity needs and costs.
Nuclear, while promising, is not a panacea, said David Terry, NASEO’s president. “It’s kind of flashy in the news right now for good reason, because people are interested. But it’s not a panacea,” he said. 
And with trying to figure out what kind of power to use 30 years from now and a lead time that could be a decade, the message, he said, is to weigh the pros and cons carefully. “And, oh, by the way, if you choose the wrong thing and you choose too many of the wrong thing, you’re going to pay dearly.”

CT history
Connecticut’s nuclear history dates to the 1968 opening of the Connecticut Yankee in Haddam, which stopped producing electricity in 1996. Millstone Unit 1 began operation in 1971 and it stopped producing electricity in 1995. Units 2 and 3 — which are still running — opened in 1975 and 1986 respectively, with Unit 2 just celebrating its 50th year. Each has had its license extended, to 2035 and 2045 respectively.
The Millstone units constitute about one-third of the power generated in Connecticut and along with the Seabrook Nuclear Power Plant in New Hampshire, the only other nuclear plant operating in New England, supply one-quarter to one-third of the region’s power.
The Millstone units have older technology systems that use Long Island Sound, which is literally outside their doors, for intake and discharge water. In the summer of 2012 after a very warm winter and summer, Unit 2 shut down for 12 days due to intake water temperatures that exceeded what was allowable. The NRC subsequently approved an increase in allowable water temperature and Dominion spokesperson Susan Adams said via email there have been no issues since.
That incident followed a situation in August of 2011 when water from the Sound overtopped the seawall around the plant during Tropical Storm Irene. Adams did not respond directly to the question of whether this has happened since.
The company has clear procedures in place to respond immediately to prevent any impact to operations, she said in an email. “If a storm is coming, we have in our procedures to build a 2-foot-high wall with sandbags around the doors of specific locations.”
The Union of Concerned Scientists has tracked nuclear power safety for years. The director of that effort, Ed Lyman, said climate issues such as rising water temperatures, drought that causes reduced water, flooding and more intense storms are not necessarily safety issues. “But they could be a real operational issues if it has to shut down for some period of time.” He also said plants in Europe, in particular, have had to lower power output during heat waves in recent years.
After the flooding of the Fukushima plant in Japan in 2011, the U.S. looked at the flood standards for its plants. “It turns out that nearly every plant in the country, when they did these assessments, they found out that they were probably vulnerable to more severe flooding than they were designed to withstand,” Lyman said.
With the moratorium now removed for additional building on the Millstone site, there has been some chatter that, despite its proximity to the water, it might be a good location for SMRs given that transmission and interconnections are already available.
Semancik at DEEP said the effects of climate change are considered when sites are selected. “You’re required to do a meteorological, hydrological study of all the sites, including what the potential exists going forward,” he said.
While Dominion has expressed interest in SMR development, Adams noted in a lengthy written response that their focus on SMRs at the moment is at a location in Virginia.
“While we’re not opposed to an SMR at Millstone Power Station, Connecticut might not have the regulatory environment for one. The upfront costs for an SMR, though less expensive than traditional nuclear, are significant enough that Connecticut’s deregulated market might not support such a project,” Adams said, echoing Dykes’ concern. “However, we still plan to work with Connecticut’s policymakers on potential paths to taking advantage of SMR’s next-generation nuclear technology.”

Now what?
Buongiorno offers three thoughts on why nuclear can still be considered worthwhile.
One is that in the face of Trump administration policies that don’t advocate decarbonization, if that is a still a state goal, nuclear is the lowest carbon energy source available and it’s scalable. Another is its reliability. It can run 24/7, which means it is stable and therefore keeps the grid stable. And third is its local economic benefits. It provides high-paying permanent jobs in addition to the initial construction jobs. And a facility will pay local taxes.
But he said: “If we need more power between now and the end of 2030, then nuclear can play a fairly limited role.”
And, of course, you have to be willing to pay. “But I got news for you — you got to be willing to pay for any of the energy technology that you choose,” Buongiorno said. “There is no free lunch.”
That’s something Dykes knows all too well.
“How do you do that? What will it cost? How can you de-risk it?” the DEEP commissioner asked. “How can we make sure the costs are shared equally among those who benefit from the investment?”
Former NRC Chair Macfarlane offers a stark answer when asked whether it’s realistic to move ahead with the new reactor designs.
“I don’t think so,” she said. “It depends on what you want to do. And if you either want to A, address climate change or B, address the energy needs from AI, … it means you have to address it immediately, like yesterday, and none of these technologies are available.”
She said it may be something to continue to develop and see if will work. But she said it will probably take a couple of decades to commercialize. 
“To put all our treasure into nuclear right now is not very smart.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/WCK_4724-scaled-e1763585120220-1024x650.jpg,,,2025-11-23 05:01:20.932111

In March 1942 it had published “The Case Against the Jews,” a polemic by 33-year-old journalist and conscientious objector Milton Mayer.

(UCLA Library Special Collections)The Saturday Evening Post was in trouble.
In March 1942 it had published “The Case Against the Jews,” a polemic by 33-year-old journalist and conscientious objector Milton Mayer. Two years before, also in the pages of the Post, Mayer had urged the United States to stay out of World War II because another global conflict would do more harm than good. Now the young activist, who was of Jewish heritage himself, accused American Jews of losing their souls by being assimilated into materialistic, gentile culture.
Subscriptions were canceled and so many advertisers lost that the Post had to double its newsstand price, to a dime. With a circulation of just over 3 million, the Post was America’s best-selling publication. But with the trouble caused by Mayer’s piece, it saw the top spot go to Life, an upstart photo magazine not yet a decade old.
If there was a star at the Saturday Evening Post, it was Norman Rockwell.
Rockwell, whose saccharine illustrations of American life featuring cooks, policemen, housewives in bathrobes, and boys and dogs adorned many Post covers, watched the turmoil at the magazine with concern, according to Rockwell biographer Deborah Solomon. There were rumors the magazine was about to fold.
“When he thought about the Post going under, he wasn’t sure whether his career would be over, or whether he would be better off,” Solomon writes in “American Mirror,” her 2013 biography of Rockwell. “At least his life would be in his own hands. Tired of answering to Post editors, he wanted to do something major, to alter his fate.”
The Post, which had a reputation of being isolationist, anti-New Deal, and skeptical of the administration of Franklin D. Roosevelt, found itself in a precarious spot. The country had entered World War II less than four months before and the outcome seemed anything but certain. In Europe, the Nazis had invaded Poland, Belgium, Holland, France — and now Russia. Jews, dissidents, homosexuals, Romani, and Soviet prisoners of war were being sent to Dachau, but it was not yet known the forced labor concentration camp was transforming into an extermination machine. In the Pacific, the Philippines had fallen to the Japanese and Gen. Douglas MacArthur had fled the island stronghold of Corregidor. Since Pearl Harbor, American resolve had turned against the powers of fascism and imperialism.
The Post was in danger of losing the trust of the American people.
Curtis Publishing sacked Post editor Wesley Stout and a couple of other names high on the masthead. The new editor was Ben Hibbs, a Kansan who was editing the Country Gentleman, another Curtius publication, aimed at the business of farming.
Hibbs was 40. He had grown up in Pretty Prairie, a town of a few hundred in south-central Kansas. His first byline, at the age of 10, was an announcement for the local paper about his fourth grade class hosting a Saturday morning picnic at the Old Settlers Grove.
“I suppose I never had a chance to be anything but a journalist,” he mused. “To me the English language has always seemed to be an instrument of beauty and precision, and from early boyhood the mere act of setting down words on paper has kindled within me a pleasant glow of inner excitement.”
He worked his way through journalism school at the University of Kansas in Lawrence by working in a brick plant, sweeping up the local Methodist church, and bussing trays in the cafeteria. After graduation, his first job was as a reporter at a newspaper at Pratt, and he was soon writing about moonshiners in the sandhills. He later took a job as an English instructor at the college at Fort Hays, he recalled. But he wasn’t happy and soon returned to journalism.
His last job in Kansas was as managing editor of the Arkansas City Traveler. Then Curtis Publishing of Philadelphia offered him a job as an associate editor of the Country Gentlemen, a publication with an eye-popping circulation of more than 2 million. When he became editor of the magazine in 1940, he introduced himself to readers as a Kansas product who loved America and believed in human freedoms.
He said he had “an abiding faith in the triumph of human liberties over brutality and blood and ruin which darken half the world, that (I believe) passionately that the decency and fundamental rightness of the people, particularly the common folks, will carry this nation through the storm and dangers of the years we now live.”
He rejected isolationism because science had erased the protections of time and distance. After Pearl Harbor, he urged Americans to stay “mad, fighting mad” to accomplish the tasks ahead and to give their children a chance at a peaceful future.
“Ben Hibbs speaks the ‘Kansas language’ so well and so consistently that his style of writing may be expected to have some influence on the tradition-bound Saturday Evening Post,” predicted an opinion writer at the Kansas City Star in March 1942.
The writer then quoted Hibbs on a recent visit to his Kansas hometown.
“There are thousands of Pretty Prairies throughout this land and therein lies my faith in America. … In the country and the country towns there is still a stability of thought and life which is our greatest bulwark in time of crisis.”
As Hibbs was being named editor of the Post, Rockwell was wrestling with his artistic crisis. In May 1940 a former administrator of the Museum of Modern Art, Thomas D. Mabry, now assigned to a division that produced graphics for the war department, told Rockwell that one of their urgent needs was for posters depicting the four freedoms as outlined by Roosevelt in his 1941 State of the Union address. But the material assigned to Rockwell to illustrate, including the Atlantic Charter, was too abstract to render into a painting, according to biographer Solomon.
How do you visualize freedom?
The answer came to Rockwell as he was lying in bed in his Arlington, Vermont, home at 3 one morning. He’d recently attended a town meeting during which a working-class acquaintance had spoken against a plan to rebuild a school that had burned down.
“Nobody agreed with him, but everyone listened,” Solomon wrote.
That’s it, Rockwell thought. That’s freedom of speech.
Rockwell could show Roosevelt’s four freedoms — speech, worship, freedom from want and freedom from fear — by painting his neighbors doing ordinary things, as Solomon put it. Rockwell was at his studio by 5 that morning, roughing out sketches.
But the Office of War Information was not enthusiastic about Rockwell’s sketches. Rockwell was told the OWI wasn’t looking for illustrators, according to Solomon, but for fine arts men — real artists.
On his way back home, Rockwell stopped in Philadelphia for a meeting with his new editor, Hibbs. If Hibbs didn’t immediately recognize that Rockwell had the idea for some of the most iconic images in popular art, he at least saw a chance to counter the anti-Mayer backlash and shore up relations with the Roosevelt White House.
“Drop everything else,” Hibbs told him. “Just do the Four Freedoms.”
Rockwell spent the next seven months on the paintings, according to the Saturday Evening Post’s website. They were published weekly starting Feb. 20, 1943, each occupying a full page (and the pages were big back then, 10 by 13 inches) and accompanied with an essay. The essays were by Booth Tarkington, Will Durant, Carlos Bulosan, and Stephen Vincent Benét.
“Freedom of Speech” was the first in the series, a realization of the sketch of the town hall meeting, with a forgettable essay by Tarkington.
“Freedom of Worship” came next. It is a tightly framed composition of mostly white faces and hands in prayer representing several mainstream faiths. It is considered to be the weakest of the series. It is a pleasing composition, but does not convey the constitutional guarantee of freedom of — and freedom from — religion.
“Worship” is accompanied by an essay by Durant that is at once offensively pompous and puerile: “When we yield our sons to war, it is in the trust that their sacrifice will bring to us … the privilege of winning for all peoples the most precious gifts in the orbit of life — freedom of body and soul.”
“Freedom from Want” was third, with an essay by Filipino-American novelist and poet Bulosan. This is the illustration that depicts a family at Thanksgiving dinner, with a grandmotherly type placing a huge roast turkey on the family table. The essay is the best and bravest of the four, with Bulosan writing on behalf of the working poor, migrants, artists and intellectuals, and the disaffected.
“If you want to know what we are, look upon the farms or upon the hard pavements of the city,” he writes. “You usually see us working or waiting for work or waiting for work, and you think you know us, but our outward guise is more deceptive than our history.”
Bulosan talks about Kansas wheat and Mississippi rain, of the winds of the Great Lakes, of the timbers in Oregon and wildflowers in Maine.
“We are multitudes in Pennsylvania mines, in Alaskan canneries,” he writes. “We are millions from Puget Sound to Florida. In violent factories, crowded tenements, teeming cities. Our numbers increase as the war revolves into years and increases hunger, disease, death, and fear.”
The fourth painting, “Freedom from Fear,” finished the series with the March 13, 1943, issue. It depicts a white couple tucking their children into bed for the night, the father holding a newspaper with a headline about German bombings. The accompanying Benét essay is unremarkable.
The Rockwell paintings were an immediate hit. The government made them the centerpiece of a new war bonds campaign and a seemingly endless series of posters followed. You can still buy them as prints from the Norman Rockwell Museum at Stockbridge, Massachusetts, where the artist lived the last 25 years of his life.
In 1943, the paintings weren’t just popular art but an articulation of what many Americans were searching to put into words. What were we fighting for? What are the things that are most precious to us? What is the promise of American democracy? They were an affirmation in oil paint of our basic decency, of our shared dreams, and a belief in the future. The paintings helped us make sense of an otherwise senseless world. They are flawed by mid-century prejudices and assumptions, something the Post seems to acknowledge in part with the Bulosan essay, but they are as near a universal artistic declaration of democracy as we could have expected, if not hoped for.
For a 21st century reimagining of “Freedom from Fear” and the other paintings, Smithsonian magazine featured the work of artists Ryan Schude, Edel Rodriguez, Tim O’Brien, and Melinda Beck.
Rockwell would continue his work long after World War II, and he would wrestle in a more realistic way with American democracy in “The Problem We All Live With.” It is a 1963 depiction of a Black child, Ruby Bridges, being accompanied by U.S. marshals as she walks past racist graffiti on her way to school.
Rockwell died in 1978, at the age of 84.
Hibbs died before him, of leukemia, in 1974. He was 73.
His obituary in the New York Times noted that Hibbs, who helmed the Post for 20 years, had been a personal friend of President Dwight D. Eisenhower. He had met Eisenhower when, during World War II, the general invited him and other journalists to tour Dachau to counter misinformation that atrocities there had been exaggerated.
In other words, Hibbs was brought to the death camp to fight the first round of Holocaust denial. Some 40,000 individuals died there, of overwork, disease, starvation, and execution. In total, the Nazis killed six million Jew and millions of others.
“I have been asked by many people if the concentration camps were as bad as the newspapers have been saying,” Hibbs wrote in the Post. “I can answer in one word: Worse.”
Milton Mayer, the young writer who in 1942 upset the Post applecart, survived the furor over his essay. A decade later he traveled to Germany and interviewed the residents of a midsized town about how ordinary people felt about the Nazi regime. What he found, reported in his 1955 book “They Thought They Were Free,” is that the descent into totalitarianism was so gradual that most people didn’t notice it.
Mayer died in 1986, at 77. The book is Mayer’s best known work.
In it, he concluded that otherwise decent individuals had allowed themselves to be seduced by lies, and some clung to those lies long after the defeat of the Nazis.

It might depend on where you live.,"Is it possible to live in our state without a car?
We have over 1.1 million cars registered in Connecticut (not counting SUVs, pickups and vans) for our 2.6 million licensed drivers. But that still doesn’t account for another half-million adults who don’t drive, by choice or economic necessity.


According to AAA, in Connecticut it costs about $11,000 a year to operate a new car (not counting its purchase price), well above the national average. You can blame high insurance premiums, property taxes, registration and maintenance… plus the cost of gasoline. That means the average driver pays about 70 cents a mile to drive.
But in most of the state, access to a car is essential for daily living, especially if you’re older.
Something like 19% of all Connecticut residents are over age 65. Over age 70, traffic fatalities increase with age; by age 85, drivers have probably outlived their ability to drive safely.
Every year some 600,000 adults in the U.S. stop driving. But because seniors make 90% of their trips in private cars, either driving or as passengers, what happens next?
When seniors stop driving it impacts more than their mobility. It can also affect their health. Seniors who stop driving make 15% fewer trips to the doctor. They can’t get out to shop as much. They isolate socially, which can lead to depression and a downward spiral in health.
Living in the suburbs, 80% of seniors reside in car-dependent neighborhoods. Some 53% of those areas don’t have sidewalks and 60% are not within a ten minute walk of a transit stop, assuming the elders can still walk that distance.
The cost of bus fare isn’t the main reason that dissuades seniors from riding the bus. It’s not knowing where the bus stops are, when they run, the lack of a shelter and, yes, probably a fear for their safety. Plus not all buses kneel, which makes boarding a challenge.
Many affluent communities offer free or low-cost ride services for seniors (and others with disabilities). In Greenwich there’s “Call A Ride,” in Fairfield “Dial A Ride” and in Darien “At Home in Darien.” And several cities offer on-demand, Uber-like services such as Norwalk and Westport’s “Wheels2U” and New Haven’s “Via NHV.”
At the other end of the mobility spectrum, many of our cities and towns have gone to great expense installing bike lanes. But when’s the last time you saw them being used? They sound great, offering a chance for exercise and enhanced mobility, but they’re hardly useful year-round. And they certainly don’t replace the utility of a car.
Metro-North, Shore Line East and the Hartford Line are great if you’re going to a city center. But getting to the station usually means relying on a car. And when you alight from the train in many towns, that last-mile to your destination still involves a cab or bus (if it runs your way).
So can you live, work and play in our state without a car? You decide.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/wheels-2U-1024x591.jpg,,,2025-11-23 05:01:20.932111

Since being appointed by Gov. Ron DeSantis to the position in July, Ingoglia has held press conferences in some of the state’s cities and counties, where he has aggressively called out alleged overspending. It’s been a central feature of the state’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) efforts, later rebranded by Ingoglia as the Florida Agency For Fiscal Oversight (FAFO). 
The media events are also a way to plug a (still to be written) constitutional amendment for the 2026 ballot that likely will ask Floridians if they support reducing or possibly eliminating property taxes on homestead properties.
“We’re not going away,” Ingoglia said during a press conference in Seminole County in September. “We’re going to continue beating this drum from now up until the time that we get actual property tax reform on the ballot in 2026.”
Seminole County Republican County Commissioner Lee Constantine isn’t impressed.
“This whole thing is a made-for-television event, and it’s specifically made for television for the CFO’s reelection,” he said Wednesday during the Florida Association of Counties 2025 legislative meeting. That’s where he and Broward County Democratic County Commissioner Steven Geller traded stories about their counties’ FAFO audits.
Geller, who served in both chambers of the Legislature for 20 years (1988-2018), criticized the calculations Ingoglia’s office derived to allege that Broward has indulged in $189 million in “wasteful spending” over the past five years. 
“Check the numbers,” he said. “Because they are fictitious. Made-up. Phony. False.”
Constantine, too, questioned the accuracy of some of the CFO’s numbers for Seminole County. He found it telling that, when a local reporter asked Ingoglia to provide specific examples of alleged waste, “He couldn’t answer specifically where he got it, referring to the suggestion his county had indulged in $48 million in excessive and wasteful spending.”
 “He also could not answer all this money we were overspending. Give us one example. Just one.” 
Similar criticism has come from additional local governments that have received a FAFO audit. The CFO has said that he ultimately will come forward with thosse details.
The governor’s office did release a statement on Oct. 1 with 10 specific examples of such alleged overspending by local governments around the state, such as the city of Jacksonville spending $75,000 for a hologram of Mayor Donna Deegan greeting travelers at Jacksonville International Airport in multiple languages.
(Deegan responded in a written statement; “Mayors greet travelers at airports across the country and use multimedia platforms to promote their cities as tourist destinations. This is just a new and innovative way to do that.”)
The Seminole audit came shortly after the five-member Seminole County Commission — all Republicans — voted 4-1 to increase the base property tax rate by 0.5 mills in the face of a $35 million budget deficit, a 10% increase over the previous year.
Constantine defended the increase Wednesday, saying it was the county’s first in 16 years. He went on to say that the commission sent Ingoglia a letter immediately after he held his press conference but didn’t receive an immediate response.
“Crickets,” he said.
Days later, Seminole County went public in a press release.
“On October 7, the CFO’s Florida Agency for Fiscal Oversight (FAFO) presentation alleged that County spending exceeds an index he created based on population growth and inflation,” part of the release said. “However, the CFO’s model ignores more than $120 million of state-imposed mandates and essential services that Seminole County is legally required to fund.”
Ingoglia then “started calling some of our prominent citizens … and asked if they would endorse him for CFO. And they all said, ‘Not until you make it right in Seminole County,'” Constantine continued.

That’s when the CFO sent a letter to the county commissioners, thanking them for their efforts and saying that “no future action” was needed on their part, other than to “continue to look out for the taxpayers of Seminole County.”
Constantine is actually grateful for the whole exercise, because he says it allowed county officials to further inform their citizens about the need for the property tax increase. “The CFO did not move the needle in my county at all,” he said. “In fact, after our response, it was much more positive for the tax increase than it was before.”

Advice for other counties
When asked what advice they would give other counties facing similar scrutiny, Geller said it’s incumbent that “you get the information out to your voters.”
“We all know this is only being done as part of the governor’s tax elimination package for ad valorem taxes, and you have to start attacking those numbers,” he added.
The answer is not to respond directly to the CFO’s office.
“They’re not going to apologize,” Constantine said. “They’re not going to change their mind. They’re not going to say, ‘Oh, we now studied the numbers and this county is doing great.’ So, your real response is to your citizens, and letting them know exactly where your money is being spent, and why it’s being spent, and that’s something that we have to do every day, anyway.”
The Phoenix reached out to CFO Ingoglia’s office for comment.
“The CFO’s message to these big government apologists is clear: Stop lying to the taxpayers and stop wasting money to the tune of tens of hundreds of millions of dollars each year,” said Sydney Booker, communications director for Ingoglia.

(Photo by William J. Ford/Maryland Matters)The Charles County Democratic Central Committee voted overwhelmingly Saturday to nominate Del. Kevin Harris (D-Charles and Prince George’s) for the Senate seat vacated this month by Michael Jackson, who is now the State Police superintendent.
Despite a 9-1 central committee vote and the backing of Jackson, however, Harris still has a ways to go before he can be considered the nominee. Because the 27th District includes parts of three counties, Calvert, Charles and Prince George’s, central committees in all three get to have their say. Charles was just the first.
Harris was one of three candidates who appeared during the nearly two-hour special public hearing, along with fellow District 27 Del. Jeffrie Long and lawyer Jason Fowler, who had ran unsuccessfully in the district before.
Harris represents District 27A, which covers parts of Prince George’s and Charles; Long represents District 27B, which includes Prince George’s and Calvert counties; Fowler ran in 27C, which is all Calvert and currently held by Republican Del. Mark Fisher.
Fowler’s experience in that part of the district was a key part of his argument to the central committee.
“The other two candidates that are here today in this process are first-term delegates. They have never faced general election opposition,” he said. “This district is too diverse, too competitive and too important to leave to somebody that is untested.”

Several of the 11 central committee members said the choice wasn’t easy among the three candidates, but the majority still chose Harris, who’s served in the House of Delegates since 2023.
The final vote was nine for Harris, with committee member Melissa Davis voting for Fowler and committee member Abena McCallister abstaining. Long did not receive a vote at this hearing.
“I’m hoping to see each of you be [future] candidates and be vocal members within our community in Southern Maryland to carry on the promises and ideas that you do have,” said committee member Desmond Rozier. “Organizing and advocating doesn’t stop in office.”
Each candidate had a chance to address the committee and each was asked the same list of questions, while the other candidates were out of the room in what was a largely low-key meeting.
The candidates generally agreed on the need to support mass transit to connect the Southern Maryland district to Washington, D.C., and on working with those who may have differing viewpoints.
A few chuckles came after Hammad Martin, who manages a law firm in Charles County, spoke in support of Fowler and called him “the white Obama.”
Long, elected to the House of Delegates in November 2022, was the only one of the three to mention the Trump administration and its impact on the state’s financial situation.
“A lot of what we’re facing as a budget crisis is a direct result of President Trump and his adversarial administration,” Long said. “I do believe that once we see brighter days, which will come, we can reinvest into programming so vital to our communities.”
As for Harris, he was the only person to mention Gov. Wes Moore’s (D) mantra to “leave no one behind.” Moore is an Army veteran.
“In this case, we [are] leaving no counties behind. So, one team, one fight,” Harris, a Navy veteran, said before the committee voted.

Harris won the endorsement of the former senator, Jackson, who stepped down 10 days ago to become superintendent of the Maryland State Police. Jackson called Harris “a person of service” who will help all three counties in the district.
“I believe in folks who are of service. He shows that continually,” Jackson said.
After Harris was chosen, he thanked the committee, the other two candidates and those in the audience for attending.
“Without you all, we don’t have a community,” he said.
The Prince George’s Democratic Central Committee is scheduled to hold a public hearing Tuesday to select a candidate for the vacant Senate seat, followed by the Calvert County Democratic Central Committee next Saturday.
But the decision could be made before Calvert meets: According to an Oct. 21 letter from the Maryland Attorney General’s office, each central committee has one vote on the Senate nominee, so if Harris gets the backing of Prince George’s, the race would be over.
“If two [central committees] select candidate A and one selects candidate B, the name of candidate A is sent to the Governor,” the letter said, but if each settle on a different candidate, all three names go to the governor, who makes the choice.
Once a name, or names, are sent to the governor, he has up to 15 days to make the appointment.
The committees could be meeting again soon, depending on who is nominated. If Harris gets the nod, the Democratic committees in Charles and Prince George’s counties would have to meet to nominate someone to fill his District 27A in the House. Should Long win, central committees in Prince George’s and Calvert would meet to fill his seat.
The committees have a little less than two months to seat a delegation before the Jan. 14 start of the 2026 General Assembly.

But as a national conversation has arisen about cash bail and public safety, fueled by misinformation from the White House, Massachusetts is on the sidelines.  
At the same time, Massachusetts has been undergoing its own experiment with releasing people who would otherwise be detained pretrial this summer—people who were denied their right to counsel while bar advocates declined taking new appointed cases, holding out for a pay raise to continue serving as public defenders.  
In light of these developments, now is a critical time to pursue evidence-based policy that fosters both community safety and racial justice. Massachusetts can take up that mantel with holistic pretrial reform to reduce the use of cash bail and pretrial detention. 
For people who are legally presumed innocent, cash bail produces wealth-based detention and a two-tiered system of justice: freedom for those with financial means, and detention in conditions indistinguishable from punishment for those without.  
The vast majority of people prosecuted for crimes in the Commonwealth are indigent. Therefore, for many accused people, posting any amount of bail can be nearly impossible. Given the socioeconomic and racial wealth disparities throughout Massachusetts, the Commonwealth’s current system of release and detention disparately burdens people of color. This affects entire families, who scrape together funds to buy their loved ones’ freedom. And any system which releases someone based on their access to wealth, rather than their true threat, enables precisely the severe harms to individual and community safety we all want to prevent.  
Eight years have passed since the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court first required judges to consider the financial circumstances of people accused of crimes when deciding whether to impose cash bail as a condition of release. One year later, the Legislature adopted omnibus criminal justice reform legislation that sought to reduce stark racial disparities in incarceration, reduce the criminal system’s overall footprint, and study continued bail reform.  
While that set of reforms resulted in some important gains in justice and community safety, the benefits of the limited pretrial reforms were not distributed equally: new research from the Roundtable on Racial Disparities in Massachusetts Criminal Courts, a project of the Program in Criminal Justice Policy and Management of the Harvard Kennedy School Malcolm Wiener Center for Social Policy, provides suggestive evidence that white people have been the biggest, and nearly only, beneficiaries of the limited pretrial reforms adopted since 2017. As the jail population fell statewide, that decrease was almost entirely among white defendants.  
To better understand why this happened, we examined two sources of pretrial detention: cash bail and prosecutors’ requests to hold people without bail because they are alleged to be too dangerous to release pretrial. We found that racial disparities continue to pervade pretrial detention and release decision-making, even controlling for factors like the severity of criminal charges and whether the criminal accusation carries a potential penalty of a mandatory minimum sentence.  
Black and Hispanic people continue to have bail set more often and in higher amounts relative to white people. We also found gaps and inconsistencies in available data about criminal system decision points. For example, a 2016 study by the Council on State Governments Justice Center identified outstanding warrants, probation detainers, and bail revocation as larger sources of pretrial detention than dangerousness findings. But, despite many improvements and a data overhaul required by the Criminal Justice Reform Act, the state does not presently produce data on these sources of pretrial detention. 
While Massachusetts boasts both historically low crime rates and incarceration rates, the Commonwealth’s pretrial system is behind the times. And sheriffs’ budgets have generally increased—with much more spent on security staff than programs to help people get their lives on track after incarceration.  
Policymakers should follow the emerging evidence base in jurisdictions across the country to rein in the use of pretrial detention and cash bail. Spending even a few days in jail is associated with a greater likelihood of being arrested on a new charge or convicted of a new crime, indicating that pretrial incarceration impedes safety for all of us.  
Study after study in states as diverse as Texas, Illinois, New York, and New Jersey shows that curtailing the use of cash bail has positive outcomes, including fiscal and public safety benefits as well as enormous benefits for affected families. In this moment, it is critically important to reject rhetoric fueled by racism and fear and dig into the data to understand who benefits, and who suffers, when our public policy is based on tradition rather than evidence.  
Researchers consistently find severe consequences of cash bail and pretrial detention: loss of employment, greater housing instability, greater likelihood of conviction and a longer sentence to incarceration, the traumatic experience of parental separation for children of incarcerated parents, and decreases in the economic stability of whole families. And even in Massachusetts, the conditions of confinement where people are detained pretrial are indisputably punishing.  
In jail, people experience strip searches, public showers, open communal toilets, inedible food, rodent infestations, limited access to hygiene, crowded dorms or two-person cells the size of a parking space, lack of sleep, enforced idleness; sensory deprivation and sensory overload from constant noise, harsh lighting, and a lack of time outdoors; exposure to violence, punitive sanctions like solitary confinement that may constitute torture, inadequate medical care, and a heightened risk of premature death. And beyond this multitude of harms, evidence shows bail doesn’t even work: cash bail does not incentivize return to court.  
There is much left to do in Massachusetts to pursue a holistic community safety agenda. Whether on police accountability, violence reduction, or reducing prosecutions of misdemeanors that clog our criminal courts and impede public safety, a concerted effort is needed to continue to build a system that prioritizes justice, not punishment.  
The bar advocate counsel crisis has exposed new opportunities. The majority of cases dismissed against people who never received constitutionally guaranteed attorneys were low-level charges like trespass and drug possession, and yet still some 1,300 people were detained without counsel between May and October. While prosecutors should seriously scrutinize low-level cases to determine whether those prosecutions should be revived, in keeping with an emerging evidence base supporting misdemeanor non-prosecution as a public safety intervention, court actors across the board should also adjust their general approach to release and detention, having learned the rarity of serious pretrial violence even in cases where people typically would have been detained by bail.  
Now is a critical moment to confront conventional wisdom and politicized rhetoric that investing in public safety means investing in more jail for more people. There are better, more cost-effective policy interventions to achieve return to court: emerging research shows that text message reminders improve court appearance rates. Reforms in other jurisdictions have shown that people can be released at higher rates and continue to come back to court at even higher rates.  
In other words, rather than continuing to invest in ever-increasing sheriff budgets, policymakers would do well to build on these lessons in crafting a path forward. While the “gravy train” of sheriff budgets receive new scrutiny due to high-profile instances of alleged misconduct, the Legislature and the public should be equally concerned with the underlying policy goals of this spending: human caging, disproportionately of Black and Hispanic people who are presumed innocent. To achieve safe and thriving communities for all, relying less on pretrial jailing is an essential policy agenda.

(Photo courtesy of TVW)For Washington residents, getting help from state government could soon become easier and more secure, thanks in part to increased use of artificial intelligence.
Early next year, the state will launch the first public version of a new Resident Portal as part of a redesigned and expanded wa.gov. It will give people a single place to sign in and find and use online services across state agencies.
Officials say the goal is to save time, reduce frustration and make government work more like private sector sites like Amazon, but with public accountability at the center. 
In an interview on TVW’s “Inside Olympia,” Washington’s chief technology officer, Gretchen Peri, called the effort “an exercise in efficiency and effectiveness,” adding that government must “constantly look to strike” this balance on behalf of the public.
The rollout will be phased. 
A pilot completed this past June tested a personal profile, AI chatbots and tailored service recommendations, for things like professional license renewals, social services, cash benefits and assistance with employment, higher education and workforce training. 
A statewide rollout began the next month, with the first public version planned for early 2026 as the state retires its older Secure Access Washington login system. The state expects to add agencies and features through 2029.

The project builds on more than 25 years of digital government. Washington launched Access Washington in 1998, one of the nation’s first government web portals, to help people find services online. 
The new Resident Portal comes with technologies that help deliver on that original promise, with tools designed for cellphone users. Instead of navigating hundreds of agency sites and logins, residents will use a single connected system spanning more than 140 agencies.
Chief Privacy Officer Katy Ruckle, also appearing on “Inside Olympia,” told host Austin Jenkins the portal’s success depends on maintaining public trust. 
“Security is how we’re protecting the data,” she said. “Privacy is really thinking about the ‘what’— what data are we collecting, and for what reasons do we need it?” 
Her office has set new guardrails to ensure agencies limit what they collect and use it responsibly. She and Peri are developing a statewide framework to guide how agencies deploy automated tools, while aligning with the state’s privacy principles. 
In practice, they say responsible AI means using automated tools carefully and transparently, ensuring they serve the public good, protect privacy and include clear human oversight. The focus is fairness, accountability and limiting data use to specific, lawful purposes.
Some applications are straightforward: AI is already helping people navigate government. The Department of Licensing uses a public-facing chatbot named DOLLY on its website to answer customer questions. 
At the Department of Commerce, an internal chatbot pilot is making regulatory and compliance work more efficient, allowing expert staff to focus on more complex and substantive tasks instead of manually reviewing documents.
Ruckle said piloting and implementing chatbots is done with careful human supervision to ensure privacy, security and accuracy. Some applications raise fewer privacy questions, she said, such as AI trained to identify fish species from underwater video. Unlike people and their data, she noted, “the rockfish just doesn’t care.”
The portal’s evolution comes on the heels of an executive order from Gov. Bob Ferguson directing agencies to improve how they serve residents. 
“The time is right for us to actually understand where we are today, where we want to be, and then prioritize the initiatives that are going to get us there,” Peri said.

TUSCALOOSA — When Vanderbilt University football fan Douglas Dill set out with his son the morning of Oct. 4 to watch their team play rival University of Alabama, he didn’t expect his game-day experience to include a gurney ride to a medical facility inside Bryant-Denny Stadium.
But by the fourth quarter in Tuscaloosa, with the sun beating down on the upper decks, the 60-year-old needed medical help.
“It was smoking hot up there,” said Dill, who traveled from Nashville for the game. “The sun was burning me through my clothes. I needed to get up and get some fluids in me or I was going to go down big time. I was starting to get light headed.”

Dill, who operates a courier service with his wife, said he drank water throughout the day but he had none left by the middle of the fourth quarter. His son and a stadium paramedic helped him down the steep upper-deck stairs to where additional emergency medical personnel were waiting with the gurney.
Paramedics treated Dill for dehydration as well as low blood sugar and monitored his blood pressure, which had climbed above normal. Dill has type 2 diabetes but does not usually have high blood pressure. While Dill missed the end of the game, he recovered enough for his son to drive him home.
Dill is one of hundreds of fans who have fallen ill from extreme heat in recent years at college games in powerhouse stadiums in the Southeastern Conference. The SEC, a collegiate athletic association, represents programs across a dozen states and accounts for nine of the country’s 13 largest football stadiums.
ICN reviewed temperature studies of heat conditions at Auburn University, the University of Alabama and Mississippi State University, and collected its own temperature measurements during two games in October, one at the University of Alabama in Tuscaloosa and the other at University of Alabama at Birmingham.
An Inside Climate News analysis of data from inside these southern stadiums found that temperatures can spike for hours, from 10 to 16 degrees Fahrenheit higher than outside heat, depending on the venue. Concrete surface temperatures in seating areas of the Tuscaloosa stadium measured over 130 degrees Fahrenheit.
Those high temperatures had consequences. Auburn University averaged well over 100 emergency calls per game in 2024, with the majority being heat-related. Halfway through the 2025 season, Alabama was averaging 60 to 65 medical calls per game, with 50 to 75 percent of calls during day games related to heat, according to interviews with medical personnel, though university officials provided lower numbers.

Auburn administrators said they are aware of excessive heat risks for spectators and are trying to enhance cooling efforts. University of Alabama officials said in a statement that “fan safety is a top priority” and that it aims to safeguard fans by providing cooling stations and emergency responders during games in Tuscaloosa.
The university informs spectators about the free water stations and first aid through websites, apps, social-media channels and in-stadium announcements from the public-address system and on video screens, the statement said. The University of Alabama at Birmingham, which has a stadium about half the size of Tuscaloosa’s arena, has also provided cooling stations.
Still, none of the universities have made changes that could make the biggest difference in lowering the potential for illness: shifting game times or the season itself. That would require a much greater degree of cooperation—particularly because of the financial consideration of big college football—across athletic conferences.
Medical professionals said that spectators need help in assessing heat risks and making safe choices on game days.
“People tend to really want to be there, and so they will endure perhaps more physical discomfort to stay there throughout the event than they would if they were just taking a walk or doing stuff on their own,” said Dr. Cheyenne Falat, an assistant professor of emergency medicine at the University of Maryland who specializes in weather-related and heat illnesses.
Another factor that likely affects fans’ ability to withstand heat is alcohol consumption. Auburn, University of Alabama and University of Alabama at Birmingham have recently allowed the sale of alcohol at games. Medical logs reveal that alcohol was a complicating factor at Auburn University for people treated for heat-related illnesses during games. Auburn began selling alcohol in 2024, the other schools in 2022.
As climate change intensifies, heat risks are likely to increase.
A federal government analysis of climate modelling predicts that by the 2040s, the average maximum daily temperature in Tuscaloosa, the home of the University of Alabama, will be 5 degrees Fahrenheit above the average registered from 1961 to 1990.
A researcher who has tracked heat risks at Auburn University’s Jordan-Hare Stadium—at 88,043 seats, second in capacity in the state only to the University of Alabama’s 101,821— said his ongoing work is aimed at crafting possibilities to alleviate potential harm.
“I don’t want to say it’s out of the realm of possibility, per se, but I would say in terms of solutions, I think we have to face the reality that we are, in fact, going to have [midday]  games,” said Brandon Ryan, an Auburn graduate researcher and teaching assistant in the department of geosciences. He’s been measuring in-stadium temperatures since 2023. “If that’s unavoidable, how do we tackle that problem?”

First responders busy

For a few months every year in Alabama, Saturdays are sacred. College football reigns as the king of sports across much of the South, and in this sun-drenched state, two fields hold dominion: the Alabama and Auburn gridirons.
But gathering to yell “Roll Tide” or “War Eagle” as teams compete in these massive concrete stadiums comes with costs. First responders at these universities increasingly spend days, and sometimes nights, rescuing football fans exposed to excessive heat.
Wes Michaels, emergency services coordinator at the University of Alabama’s Bryant-Denny Stadium and a lieutenant with Tuscaloosa Fire Rescue, said 60 medical professionals were on hand for the Crimson Tide’s Oct. 4 game against Vanderbilt, with its capacity crowd.
“You think, man, 60 people, that’s a lot,” Michaels said. “I’ll tell you, with 100,000 people in here, it gets really, really busy. Everybody is doing something, tending to a patient.”
Researchers at the University of Alabama in Tuscaloosa raised an alarm 15 years ago about in-stadium heat. An Auburn University research team, led by Ryan, continues to study heat stress among fans on much-anticipated game days at Jordan-Hare.
Ryan knows about sacred Saturdays—especially the hot ones.
One of them came on Sept. 21, 2024, when Auburn played Arkansas.
Kickoff that day at Jordan-Hare was at 2:30 p.m. The high temperature at the university airport station was 88 degrees. The heat index, a measure of the “feels like” temperature that accounts for humidity, was around 90 degrees from noon through 5 p.m.
Inside Jordan-Hare, the 13th largest stadium in the United States, the temperature was much higher.
“It was brutal,” Ryan said.
Brandon Ryan, an Auburn Ph.D. student and graduate teaching assistant, holds a bachelor’s in atmospheric science and a master’s in geography. (Lee Hedgepeth/Inside Climate News)
He saw some fans in higher tiers leave their seats in search of shade in the stadium walkways. Many guzzled water. Others were less able to cope. Heat indices in the stadium, according to temperature sensors Ryan installed in seating sections across the facility, ranged from 97 to 114 degrees.
“They were literally dragging people out of the way,” Ryan said of medical personnel. He said his review of emergency service records found that first responders received 214 medical calls during that game, the majority of which were heat-related.
Ryan was not wholly surprised by the illnesses. He had been studying stadium heat for more than a year then, working with a faculty advisor and members of the university’s public safety team. Because of his ongoing research, Ryan has become the institution’s go-to expert on stadium heat, offering a scientific approach with a bit of a fan’s heart.
“I don’t want it to have to come to somebody dying, and maybe now we’re doing something about it,” Ryan said of his interest in stadium heat. “I don’t want it to be someone I know. I don’t want it to be one of my students.”
Ryan’s research conclusions and related recommendations have been shared with university officials and offer some sobering conclusions about game-day health risks.
Temperature and humidity observations measured throughout Jordan-Hare Stadium from 2023 to 2025 revealed that the heat index in the facility regularly reached 10 or more degrees above that measured outside its walls. During some games, heat indices inside the stadium, built in 1939, rose to over 100 degrees, according to Ryan’s research.
Ryan said that large sports stadiums like Jordan-Hare can trap excessive heat for several reasons. High-capacity stadiums pack in spectators, and people who sit for the average three-hour game may find themselves hostage to the sun. High humidity is also a problem, limiting the body’s natural cooling ability.
James Spann, chief meteorologist for the ABC affiliate in Birmingham, attends all the University of Alabama home games in Bryant-Denny Stadium as a weather advisor to coaches. Known for engaging live broadcasts during severe weather events and for focusing on weather-safety education, Spann helps spectators stay on top of the weather, too. He issues updates that are shared on the stadium’s large video screens.
Body heat adds to the thermal load inside the stadium, increasing air temperature by 2 to 5 degrees, Spann said. Artificial turf can heat up to 20 to 30 degrees hotter than the ambient air, he continued, and concrete and metal stands absorb and radiate heat.

And where a fan sits—in the sun or in the shade—can make a big difference, too, according to Spann. Seating areas in the sun in Bryant-Denny Stadium can be 10 to 15 degrees warmer than shaded areas, “so if you’ve got a day where it’s 90 degrees, it could be 105 in the sun,” he said.
Spann said fans know this, but seven of eight spectators randomly interviewed during the Oct. 4 game underestimated how hot it got inside the stadium, giving the day’s forecasted high in the mid-80s or a lower number. An Inside Climate News reporter measured temperatures as high as 96 degrees in the stadium that day.
Asked about whether the public and designers and operators of sports stadiums need to take rising maximum daily temperatures into consideration in their decision making, Spann referred such questions to Alabama’s state climatologist, John Christy, who notably rejects mainstream climate science. Christy has argued there is no causal link between CO2 emissions and a warming climate.
Even when weather conditions are overcast and breezy, as they were during University of Alabama at Birmingham’s Oct. 4 game against Army in Protective Stadium, a significant temperature difference can occur between inside and outside the stadium, which seats about 45,000 people.
That day, kickoff was at 11 a.m. and measurements taken by an Inside Climate News reporter that day recorded a difference in air temperatures of as much as 10 degrees—depending on sun exposure—even in a newer stadium. Protective Stadium opened in 2021.
Ryan said his data at Auburn’s Jordan-Hare Stadium shows that sun exposure has a clear and measurable impact on the relative comfort of a particular seat.
“Day games are extremely problematic,” Ryan said. “Night games, not as much.” Over three seasons of observations, Ryan said his measurements recorded heat index values exceeding 115 degrees at least once during both the 2023 and 2024 seasons, both on late September day games.
During that same two-year period, elevated temperatures inside the facility have led to more than a thousand heat-related medical calls to first responders, records show.
On the day of the 2024 Auburn-Arkansas game, Ryan said, sensors in seven of nine seating sections across Jordan-Hare measured “feels like” conditions above 103 degrees. Temperatures exceeding that are characterized as dangerous by experts, making “heat cramps or heat exhaustion likely, and heat stroke possible with prolonged exposure and/or physical activity,” according to the National Weather Service.



Ryan has also relied on data from Auburn university officials to collate his findings. In 2023, there were as many as 43 heat-related medical calls per game, university records showed.
Spectators at Jordan-Hare suffered heat-related illnesses including nosebleeds, seizures, dehydration and low blood sugar and complaints of feeling lightheaded and dizzy. Other fans called first responders for abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, heart palpitations and difficulty breathing.
By 2024, medical calls increased significantly inside the stadium, according to Ryan’s research.
First responders averaged 161 calls per game for a total of more than 805 calls at all home games, the majority of which were for heat or cardiac-related events, records revealed.
In the 2023 data set, of the 113 emergency calls attributed to heat-related illness, 44 involved individuals who fainted or were reportedly “about to faint.”
Numerous heat-related incidents reported inside Jordan-Hare included alcohol as a contributing factor, according to medical logs reviewed by ICN. Although the school did not begin to sell alcohol inside the stadium until the 2024 season, experts say alcohol use may have exacerbated the risk of heat-related illness.
Alcohol contributes to heat illness in two ways, said Falat, the University of Maryland expert on weather-related illnesses and the university hospital’s assistant medical director for the adult emergency department.
Alcohol dehydrates, she said, and dehydration is an initial stage of heat illness that can lead to heat exhaustion and heat stroke. Then, “as you drink more and more, your ability to recognize your symptoms becomes impaired … and that’s when we start to really, really enter that danger zone,” she said.
Spann, the meteorologist, said alcohol consumption during early-season day games at Bryant-Denny Stadium in Tuscaloosa has proved to be a significant problem. “The worst thing you can do is drink a lot of alcohol on a hot day out there in the sun, and nothing good is going to come out of that,” he said.


The university challenge

Since 2023, Ryan has been submitting recommendations to Auburn University officials, outlining the empirical data from the research team and making policy suggestions aimed at mitigating health risks.
Ashley Gann, Auburn’s public information officer for campus safety and security and a meteorologist herself, said Ryan’s work “was incredibly valuable” and has helped administrators build a strategic heat plan.
“His work helped validate the importance of our existing heat plan and gave us the data we needed to refine it even further,” Gann said. “Thanks to Brandon’s study, we were able to concentrate resources in the areas of greatest need and engage in more strategic pre-planning for both football and baseball events. His contributions have strengthened our ability to protect fans and staff from heat-related risks.”

Earlier research at the University of Alabama in Tuscaloosa stands as a precursor to Ryan’s findings, which he is continuing to refine and plans to publish.
Fifteen years ago, researchers conducted a study similar to Ryan’s at Alabama’s Bryant-Denny Stadium.
Barrett Gutter, now an assistant professor of meteorology at Virginia Tech, tracked temperature data in Bryant-Denny Stadium as part of his student research in 2009. The facility was constructed in 1929 and has been expanded multiple times.
Gutter collected readings at six locations inside the stadium during a game in October 2009 and compared them to temperatures recorded at the National Weather Service station at Tuscaloosa Regional Airport. He found “significantly warmer temperatures” at each location inside the stadium.
Temperatures in the concourse areas were up to 17 degrees higher than those at the airport, while temperatures at field level seating and in the upper decks were recorded 10.5 degrees and 13 degrees warmer, respectively.

Gutter’s study was conducted before a stadium expansion in 2010 that enclosed the south end zone and added an upper deck with about 9,000 seats. The stadium also added artificial turf sidelines in 2023. Gutter said in a recent interview that temperature differentials likely would be greater today.
“When you close in a stadium like they did, it really limits the amount of air flow and circulation you’re going to get in there,” he said. “You basically are just in a bowl, and so all of that heat has a harder time basically evacuating that stadium. When you have an open end zone, you have a way for that heat to escape.”
Gutter’s research provided some telling geographical detail about seating risks then. Field-level temperatures between 3:15 p.m. and 5 p.m. were about 6 degrees higher on the east side versus the west side of Bryant-Denny Stadium. The western section of the upper deck casts a shadow that gradually covers seating on the western side of the stadium during that time period, Gutter observed. The shadow cooled the temperature sensor in that location.
Gutter later pursued research on stadium heat at Mississippi State University, where he was a professor. Last year, he and three other researchers published a study in the journal Atmosphere that analyzed the impact of heat exposure on spectator health at Mississippi State’s Davis Wade Stadium.

The researchers deployed 50 sensors around the arena and measured temperature and humidity from August through November 2016. They compared that data with readings at a weather station near Mississippi State as well as first-aid and emergency medical data from the university’s office of emergency management.
“What I got out of that study, more so than anything, was, on a spatial and temporal scale, how much fluctuation you see even through a game, which is the influence of shade,” Gutter said.
Gutter said the Mississippi study solidified findings from the Bryant-Denny research. Heat-related illness comprised up to two-thirds of cases requiring first-aid at Mississippi State. The majority of heat-related incidents occurred in the most thermally oppressive parts of the stadium, according to the study.
The study concluded there was a need for greater monitoring of heat exposure inside stadiums, better education for spectators regarding heat-mitigation strategies, and stadium design modifications to improve circulation, increase shade and reduce crowding.
The search for water
On the day in October that Douglas Dill fell ill at the University of Alabama, a reporter for Inside Climate News recorded temperatures inside and outside Bryant-Denny Stadium. The readings were recorded from 12:08 p.m. to 4:55 p.m. and approximately every 30 minutes during the game. Air temperatures were measured using a probe thermometer, and an infrared thermometer was held above concrete and metal in seating areas to measure surface temperatures.
Temperatures were recorded on the eastern side of the stadium, where spectators were in direct sunlight for the entire game.
At 2:30 kickoff time, an air temperature reading in the upper deck of the stadium was 11 degrees warmer than the temperature recorded at the airport. Temperatures measured inside the stadium ranged from 85 degrees to 96 degrees.
Surface temperatures in the stadium were higher. Concrete registered as high as 130.8 degrees. Metal seats tested by ICN were up to 108.8 degrees.



The university, in a statement responding to ICN’s queries, said it provides 20 cooling stations—16 with free water and 11 with electric fans—inside the stadium to help spectators cope with the heat.
But ICN found that one of Bryant-Denny Stadium’s cooling stations needed help itself on that day.
During the second quarter, when long lines for water had formed at the Level 2 cooling station near the student section, the 150-gallon water tank there ran dry. No staff person was there to refill it, even though the station is one of seven that emergency medical personnel are supposed to staff, according to a university cooling station map.
Spectators aren’t allowed to bring water into the stadium. They are allowed to carry empty water bottles and fill them once inside.

On Oct. 4, graduate student Izzy Piper waited in the water line approximately 15 minutes and found the tank had run empty. “I’m in the student section. It’s just in the sun the entirety of an afternoon game, and I hate being hot,” Piper said, explaining her cooling station stop.
Shannon Coughlin, a student waiting behind Piper, noticed a hose connected to the empty water tank and eventually turned a knob that sent water flowing—to his relief and that of others in line.
Coughlin has type 1 diabetes and said he needs more than the average amount of fluids to avoid dehydration at football games.“I gotta drink water,” he said. “That’s why I come back to places like this [the cooling station]. When the sun is right on you, it’s murderous.”


The university did not respond to questions from Inside Climate News about the empty water tank or the long lines for free water.

Emergency calls

Emergency medical staff who operate a 10-bed first-aid facility at Bryant-Denny Stadium said on Oct. 4 they had received an average of 60 to 65 medical calls per game at that point in the 2025 season. Not all calls are heat-related. The percentage of heat calls depends on game time, temperature and time of year, according to Michaels.
“Heat is one of our biggest challenges we face,” Michaels said.
During the Oct. 4 game, 50 percent to 60 percent of calls were heat related, with most people suffering from heat exhaustion or fainting, said Michaels, who has worked as a first responder at the stadium since 2009. Problems slowed in the second half as shade spread over the western half of Bryant-Denny Stadium, he said.

On Sept. 13, during the Wisconsin-Alabama game that kicked off at 11 a.m., every bed and chair in the first-aid facility was occupied, Michaels said. The high temperature outside the stadium that day was 92 degrees.
There were more than 70 EMS calls during that game, and approximately 75 percent were heat related, Michaels said. “The Wisconsin game was very challenging as far as managing the heat-related stuff,” he said. “Crews did a really good job of getting people to where they needed to go, whether it be a cool zone, whether it be one of the first-aid rooms or whether it be the hospital.”
There have been games with as few as about 10 calls, he continued, and those are typically at night or late in the season.
Michaels said people planning to attend a game should know what the physical demands are and consider their health conditions. They should be aware, for instance, that they might have to walk a mile and half in the heat just to get to the stadium, then walk up spiral ramps and stairs to get to their seats, he said.
“That can be a lot,” he said. “Folks have to know their limitations.”
Other medical professionals said much the same, adding that people should wear ventilated clothing and shaded hats, use cooling rags and stand near fans when possible on hot days. Elderly people, young children and those with certain medical conditions or who are taking particular medications are especially vulnerable to heat risks.
Heat already kills more Americans than any other weather-related hazard, according to the National Weather Service, and climate change is leading to more frequent, intense and longer-lasting heat waves, Falat said.
“It’s absolutely expected that deaths and other complications from heat-related illnesses will rise as those events rise, but it is also an opportunity for us as a society to really increase our public health awareness of these events, because the statistics don’t have to follow suit,” she said.
Dr. William Barton, assistant medical director of the emergency department at DCH Regional Medical Center, located two miles from Bryant-Denny Stadium, said the football season also affects his emergency department. Between 50 and 100 people are treated at the stadium’s first-aid facility during some games, he said. Paramedics send an average of 10 to 20 people per game over to the medical center’s emergency room, Barton said, and the majority are experiencing heat-related illness.
The university provided far lower numbers of illness to Inside Climate News.
“So far this season, EMS has responded to 18 heat-related calls during three home football games,” according to the university statement dated Oct. 10. “Last season, EMS responded to 26 heat-related calls during seven home games. During the past two seasons, two fans were transported to the hospital for heat-related illness.”
“Hydration is the big thing,” Barton said. “That’s where most people run into trouble. Your skin does what’s called evaporative cooling, and in the process of that, you lose a lot of fluids from your body. You are going to find yourself in a position where you’re becoming dehydrated, and you really didn’t know that you were.”

Minor changes, major stakes

Universities are making some headway in addressing heat risks in their football stadiums.
The University of Alabama added cooling stations a decade ago, and that has made a difference, Michaels said. “Before those cooling stations were installed, it was nothing to have 100 calls in a ball game,” he said about Bryant-Denny Stadium. “And when the university invested the resources to permit those cooling stations, it drastically affected the call volume.”
Both Gutter and Ryan said that there are other small steps that universities can take such as improving air circulation, creating more shaded areas in the stadiums, increasing access to cooling stations and improving education about heat-related illness.
Decisions that could limit the most risk, experts said—banning midday games during warmer months, enclosing stadiums or building climate-controlled facilities, and even shifting the football season to later in the year—do not seem likely.
The college sports schedule is part of an economic engine that few universities can individually challenge. Given the culture of sports in the United States, shifting seasons isn’t easily done, Gutter said, but moving game times may be possible.
“If I had a magic wand, I wouldn’t play games in August and September, in the Southeast, in the midday or afternoon,” he said. “I would wait to play them in the evening. As you’re transitioning to fall and more into winter, shift those games more into the later afternoon,” to protect fans from the cold.

Ryan isn’t optimistic that kickoffs will be pushed to later in the day.
“If we could do everything after four o’clock or later, for example, that would be great,” he said. “But in terms of practicality or actuality—probably not going to happen.”
Global sports have begun to adapt to the realities of a warming climate, Ryan said, and some leagues may be setting an example for U.S. athletics.
“FIFA had to change the way they did the World Cup,” Ryan said. “We even saw it with the Paris Olympics. If the Olympics are having to think about this sort of stuff, we’re probably gonna have to think about these things too.”
Heat-related deaths, Ryan said, are ultimately avoidable.
“I care about this university a lot. I care about my students a lot. I want them to come to the game to watch the game, and I don’t want them to worry about their grandma passing out,” he said.
Douglas Dill doesn’t regret his day at Alabama’s Bryant-Denny Stadium. His team lost, 30-14. But he said Vanderbilt played a good game and his heat-illness episode won’t deter him from witnessing future ones.
“I love football, and nothing will keep me away from it,” Dill said.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Bryant-Denny-Stadium-for-Nov-21-2025-story-1024x637.jpg,,,2025-11-22 08:56:52.442638

(Photo by John Hult/South Dakota Searchlight)Whether or not she’s a baseball fan, South Dakota Secretary of State Monae Johnson finds herself living one of Yogi Berra’s famous sayings: “It’s deja vu all over again.”
The New York Yankees’ catcher didn’t have Johnson in mind when he said it, but her future bears a remarkable resemblance to her past.
In the summer, Johnson will find herself fighting for her job at the state Republican Party convention where some nominees for statewide office are chosen. She’s being challenged by state Rep. Heather Baxter, a Republican from Rapid City.
Former state trooper plans run as Democrat for secretary of state

In a South Dakota Public Broadcasting story about her candidacy, Baxter said she would align herself with President Donald Trump’s platform on election reform. Trump’s platform isn’t about fair play at the ballot box so much as it’s about poor sportsmanship. That can be seen in his reaction to the recent passage of Proposition 50 in California. Without evidence, Trump has decried that election as rigged. Now it will be up to various “election integrity” groups to offer conspiracy theories about shadowy forces behind the scenes that are as nefarious as they are unidentifiable.
Four years ago, it was Johnson who did the challenging at the convention, calling out incumbent Secretary of State Steve Barnett for not caring enough about the integrity of South Dakota elections. Johnson was successful and has to hope that history doesn’t repeat itself at the next GOP convention.
Johnson got some of her support at the 2022 convention from election integrity enthusiasts who took their cue from Trump’s assertions that the 2020 election was somehow rigged against him. By their tortured logic, even elections in states like South Dakota that voted heavily for Trump need to be cleaned up.
After Johnson’s election, the integrity crowd expected her to act like a fox in the henhouse, exposing all the corruption that was surely hiding behind every voting machine. Instead she started acting like, well, a secretary of state. So far on Johnson’s watch, what South Dakota’s elections have lacked in drama they have made up for in professionalism.
This has caused Johnson to run afoul of groups like the Luddites in the South Dakota Canvassing Group. They want to go back to the good old days when men were men and paper ballots were counted by hand.
Unfortunately for her, Johnson has other problems beyond the fight for her job. She was recently subpoenaed to appear before the Legislature’s Government Operations and Audit Committee.
Usually elected officials will just show up when asked to testify to legislators. The committee issued the subpoena because it said Johnson had failed to show up to testify in the past.

Johnson said she had informed the committee she was conducting county auditor training on the day the committee wanted her to show up. Committee members wanted Johnson to answer questions about the methods used for purchasing new election technology and whether the purchase was subject to the bidding process.
Johnson should probably avoid making legislators — who control her budget — as surly as the election integrity buffs. Lucky for her, the South Dakota Canvassing Group doesn’t have subpoena power.
It wouldn’t be out of character for Johnson to avoid public scrutiny. One of the first official actions she took as secretary of state was forming a 15-member group to discuss election audits and draft legislation. The topic was so important that Johnson announced the meetings would be held behind closed doors.
Fresh off a campaign in which she pledged to bring greater transparency to elections, the irony-impaired Johnson held her committee meetings in secret to discuss election integrity.
As Johnson deals with irritated legislators and an attempt to kick her out of her job at the next GOP convention, she might start quoting another saying from Yogi Berra: “The future ain’t what it used to be.”

,Mississippi Today,2025-11-22 12:00:00+00:00,Mississippi Today,"Under new EPA rule, protections would dry up for wetlands across the Mississippi River basin","Madeline Heim, Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, Cassandra Stephenson, Tennessee Lookout, Elise Plunk, Louisiana Illuminator and Phillip Powell, Arkansas Times",,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/11/22/epa-rule-wetlands-protections/,A proposed new EPA rule is the latest in a decades-long fight over which streams and wetlands qualify as “Waters of the United States” and thus are regulated by the federal government.,"Many acres of wetlands across the vast Mississippi River basin would lose federal protection under a new rule proposed by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. 
Agricultural and builders’ groups have called it a win for private property owners. Environmental groups warn that it will exacerbate costly challenges like flooding that already plague the river and its tributaries. 
The new rule, proposed Monday, is the latest in a convoluted, decades-long fight over which streams and wetlands qualify as “Waters of the United States” and thus are regulated by the federal government under the Clean Water Act. Environmental advocates claim more expansive federal protections are needed to preserve the country’s natural resources, while some farmers and homebuilders argue the government is overstepping its authority to control how they use their land. 
A landmark 2023 U.S. Supreme Court case, Sackett v. EPA, used a narrow definition to determine which wetlands get federal protections. EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin promised earlier this year that the agency would adjust its definitions to comply. The proposed rule delivers on that promise.
The proposal will be open for public comment for 45 days before it moves forward.
Wetland advocates are still parsing details of the proposal but say they’re concerned with the impacts it could have. 
“This does not help any of the issues the basin is facing,” said Kelly McGinnis, executive director of One Mississippi, a group that advocates for the river. “Whether we’re talking water quality and pollution, trying to mitigate the impact of the more frequent floods and droughts we’re seeing — removing even more wetland protections … is devastating.” 
States along Mississippi River have varied wetlands protections 
In Sackett v. EPA, a couple asked the Supreme Court to restrict federal regulations of wetlands so they could build a home on their northern Idaho property. The court ruled in their favor, saying only wetlands that have a continuous surface connection with another r protected water body — such as a permanent, navigable waterway — qualify for protections under the Clean Water Act. 
The Clean Water Act protects the “Waters of the United States” but it does not define them. That has fallen to the EPA, which has changed its definition repeatedly since the law’s passing in 1972. The murkiness and scope of the definitions has long frustrated stakeholders. 
In a news release, Zeldin said the new EPA rule follows the Sackett decision closely, granting protections only to wetlands that touch another protected water body and have visible water for at least part of the year.
Experts say a wetland is doing work even if it doesn’t usually have water in it or is isolated. The benefits of wetlands lie in their ability to relieve flooding, purify water, mitigate drought and provide wildlife habitat. Experts say in an era of increased storms, droughts and floods wrought by climate change, they’re needed now more than ever. 
Many groups have attempted to predict how many wetlands will lose protections following the Sackett decision, but the actual impact is yet to be understood. What is clear is that with more limited federal regulation, states will have different rules governing wetlands. 
Along the Mississippi River, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Tennessee and Mississippi have wetland protections that go beyond the Clean Water Act, a Mississippi River Basin Ag & Water Desk analysis found.  Mississippi, which has 4 million acres of wetlands, protects these areas beyond the federal progam with state laws, such as the Coastal Wetland Protection, which specially targets coastal areas. 
Iowa, Illinois, Missouri, Kentucky and Arkansas do not have more protective wetland laws on the books. Louisiana extends state protections to its coastal wetlands, but not inland ones.
And state laws are still moving targets. Tennessee lawmakers, for example, voted this year to roll back protections that had been in place since the 1970s requiring developers and landowners to seek state permission and pay for mitigation before draining or altering isolated wetlands. In Illinois, where researchers have estimated about 72% of the state’s remaining wetlands could lose federal protections under Sackett, lawmakers have drafted legislation beefing up their state’s regulations, though they have not passed it, yet.
There are also unanswered questions about how the Sackett decision would affect areas along the Mississippi and other rivers where the river’s main channel is separated from the floodplain by built levees — a concern Justice Brett Kavanaugh mentioned directly in his concurring opinion on the case. 
Wetland-rich Louisiana, in particular, relies on manmade flood control structures to try and hold back floodwaters from low-lying communities. State legislation passed in 2025 made wetland areas behind levees ineligible for state protection. 
Should those areas lose federal protection, it opens them up to “a ton of risky development,” said Haley Gentry, assistant director at the Tulane Institute on Water Resources Law and Policy in New Orleans. 
“The reason to not build in a wetland shouldn’t have been, ‘Oh, you have to get this pesky federal permit,’” Gentry said. “It’s that wetlands flood … this is not creating more affordable housing, if you’re building risky homes in flood zones.” 
Mississippi River basin wetlands are already in trouble 
Groups like the American Farm Bureau Federation and the National Association of Manufacturers, whose members faced the potential of hefty fines if they altered federally regulated wetlands, have reacted positively to Zeldin’s proposed rule. 
The groups have complained that the previous definition, which was published in early 2023 and protected a broader swath of wetlands, left farmers confused about things like what constitutes a continuous surface connection between a wetland and a water body, said Courtney Briggs, senior director of government affairs for the American Farm Bureau Federation. 
“The fact that this administration has come in and given definitions to those terms already improves the situation significantly,” Briggs said. “It gives our farmers more confidence in using their own land.” 
Environmental groups, however, say that there will be consequences of the administration’s effort to make it easier for people to drain and fill wetlands for their own purposes. 
“They have, in this rule-making, completely ignored the costs of fewer wetlands and more polluted water to communities around the country,” said Mark Sabath, a senior attorney at the Southern Environmental Law Center.
In Mississippi, protecting wetlands is at the heart of the fight against the  Yazoo Pumps, a flood relief project that the U.S Army Corps of Engineers has touted for decades. The project now also has the backing of the Environmental Protection Agency, whose veto killed a previous iteration in 2008 because of the pumps’ potential to harm 67,000 acres of valuable wetland habitat. In a Jan. 8 letter, the EPA wrote that proposed mitigation components are “expected to reduce adverse effects to an acceptable level.” 
However conservationists, including a group of former EPA employees, are not convinced. 
The Mississippi River basin is home to many different types of wetlands, from Minnesota’s peatlands to the swamps of the Gulf South. In some places, they carry economic benefits of their own — like in Arkansas, where they provide crucial habitat for waterfowl that hunters spend big money to shoot. 
According to data from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, 132,000 acres of wetland across the basin were lost between 2009 and 2019, the equivalent of about 100,000 football fields. 
The last time EPA was reworking its definition of the“Waters of the United States,” in 2022, the  Mississippi River Collaborative, a consortium of environmental groups focused on the river,  wrote that the link between continued destruction of wetlands and increased nutrient pollution, a persistent problem for the Mississippi River, “is very clear.” 
“One cannot protect waters like the Illinois, Mississippi, and Ohio Rivers and the Gulf of Mexico without protecting wetlands and small streams,” they wrote.

This is Stories From The States. I’m Chris Fitzsimon. Here at States Newsroom, we know there’s a lot going on around the country every week, in every state. This week, we’re talking about mid-decade redistricting. Texas and California have grabbed most of the headlines in the battle. Now, GOP led states like Indiana are facing pressure from the president to redistrict. All while some states like Missouri, North Carolina, Ohio and Utah already have enacted new maps for the 2026 midterm elections. But Utah’s case is unique. That redistricting fight was spearheaded by Utah voters who ultimately won. Firstm that’s where we’re heading, and we’ll hear from one of the plaintiffs in the case.
Katharine Biele  
All you have to do is make a map that is fair to everyone. Everyone’s voice should matter.
Chris Fitzsimon  
Then we’ll check in with the Brennan Center for Justice to find out if all this mid-decade redistricting business is actually normal. Up first is a Utah News Dispatch reporter. We’ll hear from her in just a moment.
Chris Fitzsimon  
A Utah judge recently approved a redistricting map that would give Democratic candidates a good chance at winning one of the state’s US House seats in the 2026 midterm elections. This redistricting dispute started back in 2018 though, way before the Trump administration started pushing for mid-decade redistricting to rig the maps to try to keep control of the US House in 2026. Katie McKellar, a senior reporter from the Utah News Dispatch, has been closely covering this for years. She joins us now. Hi, Katie.
Katie McKellar  
Hi. Thanks for having me.
Chris Fitzsimon  
Thanks for being with us. All right, let’s jump in. Tell us about this. This case, it nowhere near started just this year. Give us a little bit of background on what’s at stake here.
Katie McKellar  
Oh yeah, there’s a long history here in Utah. So back in 2021, that year, the Republican majority Utah legislature repealed and replaced a ballot initiative that was narrowly approved by Utah voters in 2018. And that ballot initiative  driven by anti gerrymandering groups called Better Boundaries, sought to implement an independent redistricting process here in Utah, meant to guard against gerrymandering, and they argued that there were too many Democratic, independent and even more moderate Republican voters here that were being dispersed or cracked through the redistricting process. And so they put Proposition 4 on the ballot for voters to decide whether it should become law, and it passed. But Republican leaders here have long believed that they have the final say when it comes to ballot initiatives, and so they repealed and replaced Prop Four with a law known as SB 200 and essentially, what that law did was water down Prop Four and turn the independent redistricting commission that was supposed to draw the state’s maps into an advisory body that could ignore those maps.
Chris Fitzsimon  
So basically, the voters decided they wanted to do this with the independent commission. The Republican legislature said, ‘No, thanks’. We’re going to turn this into an advisory commission, even though the voters didn’t want that?
Katie McKellar  
Exactly, exactly. And so instead, they repealed and replaced that law with one that that turned into an advisory body that they could ignore. And so even though that independent commission drew a set of maps that year, lawmakers do their own and they adopted those maps and that congressional map and that set created four solidly Republican congressional districts, and that prompted pro democracy groups like the League of Women Voters of Utah, Mormon Women for Ethical Government and a handful of Salt Lake County voters who felt disenfranchised by that new congressional map to get together and sue. And they alleged that that 2021 map was a blatant gerrymander, and that lawmakers violated their rights to reform their government through a ballot initiative.
Chris Fitzsimon
So really, the lawsuit was about the ballot initiative as much as it was the districts. Sounds like.
Katie McKellar  
Absolutely it was about both. It was about gerrymandering and lawmakers overstepping on a ballot initiative. And so after that case spent several years winding through the courts. Ultimately, the Utah Supreme Court, on an appeal, sided with the plaintiffs on the claim that lawmakers violated their right to alter and reform their government, and that led a district court judge to deem the 2021 map the result of an unconstitutional process. So she didn’t rule, she didn’t weigh in on whether it was a gerrymander, but she did say it was an unlawful map because it was the result of repealing and replacing a ballot initiative. And so she she voided that 2021 map and ruled that Utah must go through a court ordered redistricting process to put in place a lawful congressional map to be used next year in the 2026 elections, and that’s how we got where we are today.
Chris Fitzsimon  
Thank you. It’s not a simple topic. I think you did a great job explaining it for us. And so tell us when the Trump administration got involved and people thought that they were going to have some role in this.
Katie McKellar  
So while mid, mid decade redistricting is is a debate happening all over the country right now, Utah’s mid-decade redistricting process right now is unique, because this was court ordered this was a judge saying Utah lawmakers overstepped, we need to fix it. And so it’s very unique compared to the other conversations happening in states like California and Texas.
Chris Fitzsimon  
Right. And so now tell us what happened. The map that was chosen does appear to give Democrats a chance at winning one of these districts. From what I’ve read, a lot of this revolves around Salt Lake County, which is the most populous county in the state.
Katie McKellar  
Yeah, so over the last several a couple of months, really, this court ordered process took a long time. The judge took several weeks to hear from both sides, the legislative attorneys and attorneys for the plaintiffs and each side. She gave an opportunity to submit some maps to consider. So the legislature voted on a map known as map C that lawmakers contended abided by Proposition Four’s criteria, and that would be fair. And you know, looking at that map compared to the 2021 map, it is true that it was a bit more competitive for Democrats, but it would still result in four pretty solidly red congressional districts, and then the plaintiff submitted two options. One map was a lease change map based off of the map that the lawmakers approved to just kind of tweak the boundary so it didn’t split as many cities. Or they also submitted another one that was drawn with an algorithm that was created based off of Proposition Four’s criteria, and that map is the one the judge ultimately picked. And in that map, there’s the first congressional district is concentrated around the northern part of Salt Lake County, which is a very populated part of Utah. And the result is three pretty, like, really safe Republican districts, and one pretty safe Democratic district.
Chris Fitzsimon
Somebody described to me that the old maps that they were under and some of the proposals that weren’t adopted look like a pizza cutter had done them that they divided up most of the population into into pizza slices so the Republicans could maintain control.
Katie McKellar  
Oh yeah, that has been a strategy for a long time. And you know, the plaintiffs in the lawsuit alleged was blatant gerrymandering Republicans here, they like to describe it as pizza slice, or mixing urban and rural voices, so that urban and rural voices in each district are represented on the federal level. Well, the plaintiffs allege, you know, that’s just cover to crack Salt Lake County into four different pieces so that there would not be a Democratic district.
Chris Fitzsimon  
And what was the reaction there, when the court chose the map that gives the Democrats a chance to claim one of the districts?
Katie McKellar  
Oh, the the plaintiffs in the case were thrilled. They thought that was a great win, because that map, to them, was based wholly off of Propositions Four’s criteria. Democrats were thrilled, Republicans were angry. There’s been a ton of backlash from Republicans. I mean, even before the judge picked that map, some Republican lawmakers began saying, if she didn’t pick their map that they submitted to the court map see that they would argue it would amount to malfeasance, because they still firmly believe, despite all the court rulings, that the Utah constitution ultimately gives them and only them, the ability to pick maps in the redistricting process. And so couple of things have been happening. Republicans and a group called Utahns for Representative Government are pursuing another ballot initiative to repeal Proposition Four to go on the ballot in 2026 for voters to consider. And in the meantime, I think we can still expect plenty of court appeals, legislative attorneys saying they’ll be willing to take it all the way to the US Supreme Court if necessary. But you know, barring some crazy upset, because we’ve already hit the deadline for a map to be used in 2026 even if they went on appeal. I don’t know if there’s even time to put a different map in place for 2026 but 2028 who knows? We’ll just have to see.
Chris Fitzsimon  
The judge has been attacked, right? And there’s even been like talks of impeaching the judge. It really has gone to a new level it seems like.
Katie McKellar
We’ll have to see if those threats are just threats, or if, if lawmakers actually try to carry that out. One lawmaker has said he’s open a bill file to do articles of impeachment, but I haven’t been able to get the senate president or the house speaker on record solidly saying yes, we’re going to try to impeach her, so we’ll have to see.
Chris Fitzsimon
Right. Well, we will check back with you. Katie, thanks for all your great reporting there, and thanks for being with us. Thanks. Chris. Katie McKellar is a senior reporter at the Utah News Dispatch. That outlet is a part of state’s newsroom. Since chatting with Katie, the Utah judiciary has issued a statement addressing threats to Judge Diana Gibson, who ruled on the maps. They addressed the heated political reaction as well as the threats of violence to Judge Gibson saying, “threats of violence against judges or court personnel are unacceptable, dangerous and may violate state of federal laws”. As Katie mentioned, the approved map drawn by the plaintiffs of Utah’s redistricting lawsuit was a collective effort of nonpartisan groups, faith based organizations, a legal center, and a handful of Salt Lake County voters who all said they just wanted fair maps. In a moment, we’ll meet one of the plaintiffs from that case. We’ll be right back.

After almost seven years of a legal battle against a GOP led state legislature in Utah, a broad coalition of plaintiffs finally had their congressional district map approved by federal judge. It wasn’t easy, and has involved a referendum that lawmakers ignored, legal machinations and now calls to impeach a judge. Joining us now with one of the people who was part of this redistricting fight, Katharine Biele is the President of the League of Women Voters of Utah. She joins us now. Hello, Katharine. Thanks for being here.
Katharine Biele  
Thank you so much Chris.
Chris Fitzsimon  
So Katharine, your group was one of the plaintiffs in this case, and now a judge has approved the maps you and other Utahns had sought, right.
Katharine Biele  
They did. I mean, we were thrilled.
Chris Fitzsimon
You were thrilled. I was gonna ask your reaction. Were you surprised?
Katharine Biele  
Not completely. We had very good arguments. I mean, our arguments were based in the Utah State Constitution, Article One, Section two, which gives the citizens the right to change the form of government. So we had a very good argument. We were never trying to leave the legislature out of it. We totally expect the legislature to draw the maps. All we require is that they draw them fairly.
Chris Fitzsimon
Just to be clear, the maps that had been drawn or that were drawn by the General Assembly, or the ones that they were were promoting, really, I always hear it as an outsider to Utah, hear it described as like pizza slices, which keeps sort of all the parts of Salt Lake City separated in effect.
Katharine Biele
And it’s not just Salt Lake City, but Salt Lake Salt Lake County. This is where the hub of the population lives. They divided the county into four slices going down to the very tip of Southern Utah, St George, so we in urban Salt Lake have the same representative as those down in southern Utah.
Chris Fitzsimon  
And what was the reaction from the legislature and the proponents, or the I guess the people who wanted to continue to draw the maps the way they had been drawn.
Katharine Biele  
The legislature is up in arms. They will not stop this should have been easy. I mean, how hard is it to draw a fair map? It’s not a partisan thing. It is. Just look, this is these are communities of interest. Salt Lake County is one community of interest. Southern Utah is another. The rural, rural areas are another. So it’s just really not that hard. They were furious because they thought we were taking away their responsibility, which we are not.
Chris Fitzsimon  
You know, Utah has a reputation, I think, from afar, and I think I’m sure it feels that way a lot of times in Utah you have Republican governors in the past have reached across the aisle. There’s been a lot of national publicity. They’ve been the leaders in sort of a different kind of campaigning. So I think there’s a perception that politics in Utah hasn’t gotten to the bitter level that we’ve seen around the country. And yet it feels like in this case, maybe that has changed some.
Katharine Biele  
I will say that it may be changing a little. This is all based around the national politics and the kind of national politics that are coming down to Utah. There are many people here, many legislators who think that whatever Trump says and whatever he does, they should do however. We also have enough. I mean, we respect the legislature, and the legislators do have good intentions. They just have to get away from the whole idea that only Republicans can be in charge of everything.
Chris Fitzsimon  
Do you have trouble as a citizen activist or a member of an organization, getting some voters to understand really what’s at stake. I think sometimes, even when I’m talking to folks about redistricting battles, and we’ve had a lot of them in states that I’ve been in, people sometimes their eyes glaze over and they want to talk about a lot of other issues. But this feels like a in some cases, a technical thing.
Katharine Biele  
Well, and this is it’s hard, it is very difficult, and I think the legislature has made it even. More difficult on purpose. They want the citizens to be confused and to say, ‘Okay, we’re going to leave it to the legislature, because we don’t get it.’ It’s not that hard. All you have to do is make a map that is fair to everyone. Everyone’s voice should matter. We don’t all win. We just need to have a voice. I have heard as a league of women voters. We register voters all the time. What they say to us is, why should we vote? We know what the outcome will be. This at least gives those voters a chance. Is it over? No, it probably will never be over. I mean, the legislature has talked about appealing. You know, if they appeal to the Supreme Court, that is really a delaying tactic, because our Supreme Court ruled unanimously in our favor. So it’s unlikely that they would do anything different. But I can’t say I’m not a lawyer. They have talked about running an initiative, which is ironic, a citizens initiative to overturn a citizens initiative. And that is exactly what you said. It’s because people are confused, and they think, Oh, well, we can confuse them more, and they will just vote our way to get rid of Proposition Four.
Chris Fitzsimon  
Well, I really appreciate you being with us, and thanks for all your efforts for democracy there in Utah. Thank you very much.
Katharine Biele
Thank you too.

This week, a federal court blocked Texas from using their new congressional maps for the 2026 election. Texas was the first state pushed by the President to take part in this unusual mid-decade redistricting scheme. This move has led state lawmakers across the country to talk about redistricting when they only discuss it every 10 years. Is all this mid decade redistricting now going to be the new normal nationally? Coming up, an expert from the Brennan Center for Justice will help us figure that out. Then Evening Wrap newsletter author Danielle Gaines will join us about the story she’s looking out for. We’ll be right back.

Congressional district maps are generally redrawn every decade after the US Census, unless a court intervenes and orders state lawmakers to redraw them to settle a lawsuit. But the Trump administration has been pushing GOP led states to redistrict this year, purely for political reasons, to make it harder for Democrats to take over control of the House in the 2026 election. What are the long term effects of the break from precedent, and what happens if it becomes the new normal and maps are drawn every two years instead of every 10? We spoke with Kareem Crayton. He’s the vice president of the Brennan Center for Justice’s Washington DC office, and he has a doctorate in political science. Just a note. We spoke with Kareem before the news broke in Texas this week where a federal court blocked Texas from using their new congressional maps for the 26th election. Now they have to go back to their 2021 maps, which, by the way, are already gerrymandered by the Republican controlled General Assembly. He joins us now, Kareem, thanks for being here. Delight to be with you. Thank you. Well, what do you make of this overall? I think if we were sitting here a year ago, it’s hard to imagine the pressure being brought on so many states to dramatically change the way they draw district lines.
Kareem Crayton
Yeah, about a year ago, I think most of us thought that the only movement was going to be in the courts, with things that were already on the table. I think it is hard to have predicted such a massive number of states jumping into the pool and that most of the disruption and chaos is coming really at the instigation of the White House.
Chris Fitzsimon  
It puts a good government advocates like folks at the Brennan Center in a bit of a tough place at the beginning of all this national mid-decade redistricting discourse, after Governor Greg Abbott announced that he was doing that in Texas, there was a lot of discussion about, should states that have commissions or states that are committed to trying to drawing on gerrymandered districts also play what did you make of that sort of the machinations there?
Kareem Crayton  
Well, I would say the tough position that we’ve been in is actually one that preceded Governor Abbott’s move, and it is where the Supreme Court of the United States failed to adopt a national standard. In the absence of that, notwithstanding the fact that the Supreme Court said it had no particular opinion about political gerrymandering, number of states saw that as an invitation. And I think what we’re seeing is the result of that. So both. For what Texas has done, and California and other states have done, in reaction, is in some ways not surprising, if also quite lamentable.
Chris Fitzsimon  
To have a legislature, for example, Texas, who already gerrymandered the districts with their own majority come back and, in effect, re gerrymander them. Is this? What is this unprecedented? Had you seen anything like this before?
Kareem Crayton  
I think, writ large, it is unprecedented. It is fair to say that states have gone back to the well in the past, first time where we’ve seen, you know, the legislature in Texas at least go back and say, Oh, we didn’t gerrymander enough. And certainly, when you add to that, the National reaction where some states are going back to say, the public, we want to do a re gerrymandering of this state, is that okay, in light of all the other things that you’ve seen, and in California, the people said, Yes,
Chris Fitzsimon  
I covered redistricting in North Carolina for a long time. And what do you make of this? For the voters? I think it’s already sort of hard to explain to folks who don’t do this for a living, who are just living their lives trying to make ends meet, and now they can’t vote for the person they used to their districts are different. How do you communicate this effectively, the importance of this to folks who aren’t really involved in the political process.
Kareem Crayton  
The people that are supposed to be served by the redrawing of districts are the people who are supposed to be represented, and those are voters, and not the electeds. And what you see with these changes, in the absence of a national standard is that people who live right next to each other, who share the same city, who understand the same sets of issues that affect them all are now divided by essentially arbitrary lines, and they’re done really for no other purpose than to serve a political interest, and in fact, an interest that might not even be in the state that’s supposed to be represented. So I think all of these, you know, line drawing and re line drawing efforts are bringing people farther and farther away from power and democratic system. People aren’t supposed to be, particularly in elections, the source of power, and that’s of real concern.
Chris Fitzsimon  
We also had some news recently from the Indiana Capitol Chronicle, despite visits from the vice president and pressure from the president, many Republicans there are choosing not to participate in this mid cycle redistricting.
Kareem Crayton
Well, we’re seeing a lot of folks, I think, look at this and say, one, what does it cost us to try to do this? Yes, maybe the White House really wants us to do it, but what do we lose by going back to the will and redrawing the map? And frankly, it is probably not off of anybody’s mind. The fact that we had elections in November that I think, surprised a lot of people. And so if you’re doing these redraws, you’ve got to think about the world, not just as it exists right now, but what it’s going to look like a year from now and beyond. And in places where, if you’re a Republican you’re looking at, you know, what was pretty much a clean sweep behind the Democratic Party. And you got to wonder, is there a line at which and pardon the pun, but yes, if you cross that line in drawing new district maps, do you make yourself less likely in a democratic wave year to be competitive? Again? This is sort of done from the perspective of partisanship. But what is lost in all of this is the people ultimately are going to want to choose. And I think the real challenge that a lot of people are grappling with is, well, look, we might want a certain political outcome, but if the public overwhelmingly sees us as grabbing more power than we’re due, it might be that there’s a wave so big that we can’t gerrymander our way out of it.
Chris Fitzsimon
You mentioned a national standard. Is there some, some world, ideal world, where all this publicity and frustration leads us back to a conversation about how everybody should do redistricting in some fair and open and honest way?
Kareem Crayton
Well, I certainly hope so. The Congress of the United States still has the ability to say to the public, you know what? We hear you. And there should be a national standard, and we’re going to carve one. To carve one out that might not be true, that may or may not be true of this existing Congress, but the public is frustrated enough. It’s entirely possible that, you know, the public votes for people who will step into the breach. And by the way, it’s important to note you now hear both Republicans and Democrats, often, many of them on the losing end of a redistricting fight. Say, though there should be a national standard. So I think the more that becomes, as you point out, a priority for the public as a whole, but also for the elected to recognize. You know, in the main, this may or may not be a matter of whether or not I gain from a particular line drop, or whether the country gains overall from a system that makes sure that people at the forefront of how districts get drawn

Coming up. We’ll check with evening rap newsletter writer Danielle Gaines, stay with us.
Chris Fitzsimon  
Joining us now is Danielle Gaines. She writes States Newsrooms, daily newsletter called The Evening Wrap Danielle, it’s great to see you. Let’s let’s jump in. Talk about the big things this week and what’s coming up. First of all. What big stories Did you notice this week?
Danielle Gaines
Well, we’ve had some coverage about the changes that are coming to programs in the United States who have typically assisted refugees when they arrive here, and so our reporter in Rhode Island spent some time at the refugee Dream Center there, and she was talking with women in a class that’s meant to improve their English skills, but it’s also about so much more for them. So it’s like cultural, emotional, social. It was a really beautiful story just getting to know the women, but it also kind of touched on the fact that this was a place that is meant to be filled with love help these people feel at home, and instead, a lot of the emotion there has been replaced with fear, which is all too familiar to this group of people and uncertainty the folks who go there are among hundreds of 1000s of lawful immigrants who will soon lose food benefits in the US, as provisions of the one big, beautiful Bill act take effect. And in addition to food benefits, there are other things coming up that are big changes for programs that we established to help people get on their feet so the work requirements and Medicaid are going to be a problem. These are folks who aren’t working because they’re trying to gain proficiency in English so they can work, and they’ll lose support during that process. The story also had an economic analysis of refugees and immigrants in Rhode Island that I found really interesting. So 15% of the state are immigrants, and $5.5 million in annual food benefits will be gone under these provisions, and soon child tax credits will be gone as well, to the tune of $30 million so it’s a big shift on a family level, but also, you know, on a state economic level,
Chris Fitzsimon  
Yeah, I think that bill still feels like it’s hanging over so many people. When the when those provisions take effect?
Danielle Gaines  
Yeah, one of the coordinators there said that’s going to be, quote, disastrous, once it all kind of takes shape together.
Chris Fitzsimon
What about coming up next? What about things to look for?
Danielle Gaines  
Yeah, so this week, I’ve been featuring a special mini series from our reproductive rights reporting team on the state of state shield protections for abortion medications. And so there’s a lot that has been going on with that, and a lot that is going to be going on with that. So over the series of stories, our team looked at the status of state shield laws as well as efforts to puncture them, as well as challenges to mifepristone in lawsuits and the federal regulatory level. So there is an ongoing lawsuit related to the federal regulations The ACLU is seeking information, kind of just looking at what is the Trump administration’s FDA actually looking at with these long established medications, and who are they talking to as they’re looking at it. So that’s a lawsuit to be on the lookout for. And then on the state side of things, shield laws that protect abortion providers have been established in lots of states to protect them from out of state lawsuits, but a new bill is taking effect in Texas, and that aims to kind of puncture the durability of those laws. It’s was described as the first bill in the country to explicitly target shield laws and shield providers, and it gives any Texan the power to sue anyone involved in mailing an abortion pill to the state. So we’ll have to see what unfolds there.
Chris Fitzsimon  
It seems like then, I mean, it’s been ongoing, but the next frontier of the whole abortion debate seems like the battle over these, this medication and access to it. Yes, agreed. Well, what about one last thing? What shall we leave us together with?
Danielle Gaines
Well, just a time for Thanksgiving. I figured that we’d talk about food waste, not to be a downer, timely, but our friends at the Iowa capital dispatch covered a study by the State Department of Natural Resources, and that study found that Iowans throw away, on average, 200 pounds of food each year. When you account for industrial food waste. On top of that, it’s about 300 pounds. Wow. And that’s actually less than what the EPA estimates for the country as a whole, which is between 492 pounds and more than 1000 pounds. So this study was just a way to look at how to cut down on food waste, how food waste can be diverted, how to avoid it in the first place. So I thought I’d share some of the tips that I gleaned from it. You know, the first one is to purchase your food thoughtfully, and then, in terms of disposal, you can seek ways to donate something that you don’t want, share it with a neighbor, a friend, compost it instead of sending it to the landfill. My personal favorite is to just immediately freeze. So if you have a veggie tray at Thanksgiving, like, don’t just shove it the back of your fridge to let it waste away. Cut it up right away, put it in a baggie, and then some night, you’ll want soup, and it’ll be right there, ready cut up for you.
Chris Fitzsimon  
That’s a great idea. It does seem at every party, the veggie tray is the last to go.
Danielle Gaines  
I know it’s such a shame. I also think you could waffle iron just about anything. From Thanksgiving, which is a great way to use up leftovers.
Chris Fitzsimon  
Wow, I haven’t thought of that one. I might try that. Do I really appreciate you as always you being with us.
Danielle Gaines  
Yes, thank you so much.

The school is less than a mile away from the construction site of Meta’s new data center, Hyperion. Officials shut down the playground in front of the school because of safety concerns related to the truck traffic. (Dylan Hawkins/Gulf States Newsroom)Penelope Hull doesn’t care that the road in front of her elementary school leads to what will be the largest data center in the world. She just misses the playground in front of Holly Ridge Elementary School.
It’s shut down this year because it faces the roads where, every day, thousands of dump trucks and 18-wheelers thunder toward “Hyperion,” Meta’s $27 billion data center being built less than a mile away.
Holly Ridge is a town of fewer than 2,000 in Richland Parish, in the northeast corner of the state, where nearly a quarter of residents live below the poverty line. Before Meta broke ground last December, the town’s two-lane roads were quiet, scenic routes mostly used by locals.
Now, the noise from the trucks lined up outside the elementary school shakes the classrooms.
“You can’t pay attention,” Hull, a fourth grader, said. “And then you get off track and you lose what the teacher was telling you to do.”
The school sits tucked in the corner where Highways 80 and 183 meet. At that intersection alone, there have been at least three big truck crashes this year.
“They wrecked into the gate, and then they had to build a whole new gate,” Hull said. “And that’s why they’re saying we shouldn’t go out there… because there’s too many wrecks and Meta trucks. And they could crash.”

On the roads surrounding Meta’s construction site, vehicle crashes have gone up by more than 600%. There have been 64 crashes between January and mid-September this year, compared to just nine for all of 2024, according to police records obtained by the Gulf States Newsroom.
In one crash, two dump trucks collided head-on. The driver who caused it had an expired Mexican driver’s license, and his injuries were so severe, he had to be airlifted to a hospital — with the helicopter landing in a field behind the school.
In a statement to the Gulf States Newsroom, Meta said it sets strict guidelines about speed and safety, but did not respond to questions about specific crashes.
Interviews with residents and crash reports tell a different story: careless, reckless and sometimes unlicensed drivers rumbling through the rural town, endangering everyone.
Hull said she’s heard about trucks colliding and killing a driver, and described a near-miss when she and her grandmother “almost got killed” by an 18-wheeler.
“On the school bus, the trucks make you feel anxious that they’re gonna wreck,” the nine-year-old said. “It’s really bad. I don’t like it.”

He ‘never had a license’
The Hyperion project came together over the course of 2024 through a whirlwind of negotiations and non-disclosure agreements between Meta, Entergy, and state officials who rewrote laws and created new tax exemptions to win the deal. While Meta estimates employing about 5,000 construction workers at the peak of the project, the 4-million-square-foot data center is expected to employ about 500 permanent workers once completed in 2030.
Crashes in Holly Ridge are surging in conjunction with the explosion in traffic around the Hyperion site. Traffic data from Louisiana’s Department of Transportation and Development (LaDOTD) gives a clear picture of how much it’s increased since Meta started construction.
LaDOTD installs temporary traffic count devices on state highways that record the total traffic volume over a 24-hour period. One of those locations is right in front of Holly Ridge Elementary School on Highway 183, which only has three recorded counts in the last 10 years.
A count taken on a school day in February 2022 recorded 1,817 vehicles in one day. The next available count from the same spot was taken in July 2025, showing a jump to 5,224 vehicles — nearly triple the previous count, despite being in the summertime with no school traffic.

In a statement, LaDOTD said Meta has not violated any permits or agreements. But documents obtained by the Gulf States Newsroom show Meta — through its developer Laidley LLC — agreed it was responsible for ensuring public safety and minimizing work zone impacts.
Police crash records suggest that isn’t happening — many of the crashes appear to be caused by drivers in transit to the Meta construction site.
Some happened because the large trucks couldn’t see the smaller vehicles or hear their horns before backing or turning into them. Some, because the driver, who was en route to his workplace at the Meta site, was tired.
Others are more alarming: A hit-and-run where the dump truck left the scene; an 18-wheeler trying to beat an oncoming train across the railroad tracks before deciding against it and backing into another vehicle; a driver leaving the scene, abandoning his wrecked vehicle in the median, so he wouldn’t miss a morning meeting at the Meta site.
In August, a dump truck hauling dirt drove off the road and crashed into a tree, killing the driver, according to Tracy Morris with the Richland Parish Coroner’s Office.
In September, an 18-wheeler collided with a dump truck turning onto the road leading to the Meta site. In the report, the driver told the deputy that “he does not and has never had a driver’s license.”
Greg Fischer, with the Louisiana Highway Safety Commission, said it was “shocking” to hear that one of the drivers heading to Meta’s site was hired without any license, much less the specialized license required to operate large, heavy vehicles like an 18-wheeler or dump truck.
“I don’t understand how that could even happen,” Fischer said. “You would think that a company would vet their drivers — at least to the extent that they have a commercial driver’s license before they put them out on the road.”
Unlicensed drivers operating dump trucks and 18-wheelers, Fischer said, create a “dangerous situation” to both themselves and the community.
“The worst case scenario is a fatality — a fatal crash,” he said.

‘They think they run this road’
In a statement to the Gulf States Newsroom, a spokesperson for Meta said the company strives to be “good neighbors” and to mitigate disturbances to the community. But around a dozen people who live on the roads surrounding Hyperion interviewed by the Gulf States Newsroom say otherwise.
All of them say they’ve never been contacted by the company or any officials — even after filing complaints with the city and law enforcement officials.
“Nobody hadn’t come talk to me about nothing,” said Dorothy Lively, who lives at the corner of Highway 80 and Jaggers Lane, one of the main entrances to the construction site.
Workers park their trucks in her yard without asking. Dust, dirt and sand kicked up from the site get into her home, irritating her sinuses.
She’s “scared to death” about trying to pull out of her own driveway and said she feels trapped in her home.
“It looks like a train, one after another,” she said of the line of trucks that can sometimes stretch for miles on the road in front of her home.
Nearby, on Highway 183, Tatjana Thompson said she waits to walk to her mailbox until the evening, when the traffic slows down, because she’s worried about being hit by one of the trucks bound for Hyperion. She lives directly across the street from the site and workers park in her yard, too.
“They think they run this road,” Thompson said. “I don’t know where they done their driver’s license.”
About a month ago, she said a new 45 miles per hour speed limit sign was put up in front of her home. But the trucks ignore it, she said. The sign is bent at an angle after being hit by a passing vehicle.

‘It’s incumbent of them to be a good steward’
State and parish officials are aware of residents’ concerns.
In June, Gov. Jeff Landry visited Holly Ridge and met with the Richland Parish Sheriff’s Office to discuss complaints. In an interview with TV station KNOE News, he acknowledged the traffic concerns and promised control measures. “I know that it’s causing a lot of traffic problems around this area,” he said. “We’re going to start looking into making sure that we have the proper traffic control to handle the amount of work that’s coming.“Because guess what? That project is transformational for this area, but like all good things, it comes with good problems.”
Landry has called the project a “game-changer” for the state that will bring thousands of jobs and cement Louisiana’s place as a hub for artificial intelligence.
“This facility is a great example of how Louisiana is quickly becoming one of the best states in America to do business,” Landry said, standing at the Meta site, in a video posted on Facebook, the social media site owned by Meta.
Landry’s office and the Richland Parish Sheriff’s Office did not respond to questions for this story. But following Landry’s visit, LaDOTD announced plans to convert three intersections along Highway 80 to “all-way” stops to help control traffic, including the intersection in front of Holly Ridge Elementary School.
But many of the crashes this year occurred after Landry’s visit and the installation of additional all-way stops, including the 18-wheeler racing a train, the helicopter landing at Holly Ridge Elementary, the dump truck driver who died and the unlicensed Freightliner semi-truck operator.
Despite rumors circulating in the community, both Meta and the Richland Parish School Board told the Gulf States Newsroom there are currently no plans to relocate the school.
Meta says it’s investing more than $200 million in local infrastructure improvements. But the fault for the increase in vehicle crashes, according to Brian Wolshon, a researcher who studies highway safety at Louisiana State University, doesn’t lie with the infrastructure. It lies with the drivers and Meta.
“Just because you’re Meta and you’re this trillion-dollar company, and you roll into West Yahoo, Louisiana, and we’re rolling out the red carpet,” Wolshon said, “I think it’s incumbent of them to be a good steward of the public trust.”
While old state highways like 80 and 183 may have been unprepared for a massive influx in heavy truck traffic, even the safest road in the world, Walshon said, can’t prevent careless or reckless drivers from causing crashes.

’They’re constantly turning off the power’
It’s not just increased traffic and crashes that are frustrating residents.
Joseph Williams and his wife, Robin, are also “pissed off” about the data center’s impact on water and electricity.
Though construction won’t be complete until at least 2030, Hyperion will use about three times the amount of power than the entire city of New Orleans uses in a year. To feed the behemoth’s energy demand, the power company, Entergy, plans to spend $3.2 billion to build three new gas-powered plants.
Meta signed a contract with Entergy that has not been publicly disclosed, so it’s unknown how much the international company worth trillions is paying for the additional infrastructure.
In a statement to the Gulf States Newsroom, Entergy said that factoring in the “various costs and benefits, Meta coming to Louisiana means customer bills will be lower than they otherwise would have been,” through Meta contributing large cost-based payments to the energy company.
Those payments, Entergy said, would effectively offset grid upgrade and storm-related costs — reducing what regular ratepayers would otherwise have to pay.
Grid upgrades and storm-related costs are imposed by Entergy, a company that reported earnings of more than $1 billion last year, and contribute to a higher energy burden for ratepayers. Advocates warn the additional costs of building new gas plants to power Meta’s data center could be passed on to Entergy customers across the state as well.
The Williamses live across from the site on Caston Road, and said they’re already being affected.
Since Meta began construction, they said their water sometimes turns “rust-colored” and their electricity cuts off with no warning.


Let us know what you think...


 

“Entergy goes out here all the time. I guess with them now, they’re constantly turning off the power,” Joseph Williams said, pointing to the expanse of dirt, trucks and heavy construction equipment at the Meta site — what was once trees and fields in front of their home.
In one recent instance, they said their power was out for three days. And they tried contacting Entergy for information.
“I blew Entergy up,” Robin Williams said. “They said it’d be back up by 12, by 2, by 4, 8 o’clock the next morning.”
Entergy denied any power outages in the area caused by construction. But the couple said they ended up staying at a friend’s house for the next few days until their power was restored.
The lack of notice and delay, they said, makes them feel “unimportant.”

	New England winters can get wicked cold. This week, five of the region’s states launched a $450 million effort to warm more of the homes in the often-frigid region with energy-efficient, low-emission heat pumps instead by burning fossil fuels.


“It’s a big deal,” said Katie Dykes, commissioner of Connecticut’s Department of Energy and Environmental Protection. ​“It’s unprecedented to see five states aligning together on a transformational approach to deploying more-affordable clean-heat options.”


The New England Heat Pump Accelerator is a collaboration between Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and Rhode Island. The initiative is funded by the federal Climate Pollution Reduction Grants program, which was created by President Joe Biden’s 2022 Inflation Reduction Act. The accelerator’s launch marks a rare milestone for a Biden-era climate initiative amid the Trump administration’s relentless attempts to scrap federal clean energy and environmental programs.


The goal: Get more heat pumps into more homes through a combination of financial incentives, educational outreach, and workforce development.


New England is a rich target for such an effort because of its current dependence on fossil-fuel heating. Natural gas and propane are in wide use, and heating oil is still widespread throughout the region; more than half of Maine’s homes are heated by oil, and the other coalition states all use oil at rates much higher than the national average. The prevalence of oil in particular means there’s plenty of opportunity to grow heat-pump adoption, cut emissions, and lower residents’ energy bills.


At the same time, heat pumps have faced barriers in the region, including the upfront cost of equipment, New England’s high price of electricity, and misconceptions about heat pumps’ ability to work in cold weather.


“There’s not a full awareness that these cold-temperature heat pumps can handle our winters, and do it at a cost that is lower than many of our delivered fuels,” said Joseph DeNicola, deputy commissioner of Connecticut’s Department of Energy and Environmental Protection.


To some degree, the momentum is shifting. Maine has had notable success, hitting its aim of 100,000 new heat pump installations in 2023, two years ahead of its initial deadline. Massachusetts is on track to reach its 2025 target, but needs adoption rates to rise in order to make its 2030 goal.


The accelerator aims to speed up adoption by supporting the installation of some 580,000 residential heat pumps, which would reduce carbon emissions by 2.5 million metric tons by 2030 — the equivalent of taking more than 540,000 gas-powered passenger vehicles off the road.


The initiative is organized into three program areas, or ​“hubs,” as planners called them during a webinar kicking off the accelerator this week.


The largest portion of money, some $270 million, will go to the ​“market hub.” Distributors will receive incentives for selling heat pumps. They will keep a small percentage of the money for themselves and pass most of the savings on to the contractors buying the equipment. The contractors, in turn, will pass the lower price on to the customers. In addition to reducing upfront costs for consumers, this approach is designed to shift the market by encouraging distributors to keep the equipment in stock, therefore making it an easier choice for contractors and their customers.


These midstream incentives are expected to reduce the cost of cold-climate air-source heat pumps by $500 to $700 per unit and heat-pump water heaters by $200 to $300 per unit. When contractors buy the appliances, the incentive will be applied automatically — no extra paperwork or claims process required.

“It should be very simple for contractors to access this funding,” said Ellen Pfeiffer, a senior manager with Energy Solutions, a clean energy consultancy that is helping implement the programming. ​“It should be almost seamless.”


Consumers will also remain eligible for any incentives available through state efficiency programs, such as rebates from Mass Save or Efficiency Maine, but will likely not be able to stack the accelerator benefits with federal incentives like the Home Efficiency Rebates and Home Electrification and Appliances Rebate programs.


Program planners expect to be finalizing the incentive levels through the end of the year, enrolling and training distributors in the early months of 2026, and making the first participating products available in February 2026, said New England Heat Pump Accelerator program manager Jennifer Gottlieb Elazhari.


The second program area is the innovation hub. Each state will receive $14.5million to fund one or two pilot programs testing out new ways to overcome barriers to heat pump adoption by low- and moderate-income households and in disadvantaged communities. One state might, for example, create a lending library of window-mounted air-source heat pumps, allowing someone whose oil heating breaks down the time to research replacement options rather than just installing new oil equipment.


The innovation hub will also include workforce development and training. Organizers are talking with contractors and other partners to figure out where the gaps are in heat pump training. In the first few months of 2026, they will develop a program with a target start date in April.


The goal will be not only to ensure that there are tradespeople with the needed skills to install the systems, but also to lay the groundwork for faster adoption by spreading knowledge about the capabilities of the technology and the available incentives.


The third major area of the accelerator is resource hub to aggregate information for contractors, distributors, program implementers, and other stakeholders. Overall, organizers hope to have all three hubs operational in spring 2026.


Accelerator planners expect programs to boost adoption even as a federal tax credit of up to $2,000 on heat pumps and heat-pump water heaters is phased out at the end of the year, leaving states leading the way on clean energy action.


“At the state level, this is one example of a way we are helping to make progress in reducing greenhouse gas emissions, but with a solution that can help people take control of their energy costs,” Dykes said. ​“That’s really what we’re focused on.”",https://mainemorningstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/GettyImages-1934748893-scaled-1-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-11-22 05:57:27.318048

Few political alliances in recent American history have seemed as solid as the one between Donald Trump and the country’s farmers. Through three elections, farmers stood by Trump even as tariffs, trade wars and labor shortages squeezed profits.
But Trump’s second term may be different.
A new round of administration policies now cuts deeper into farmers’ livelihoods — not just squeezing profits but reshaping how farms survive — through renewed tariffs on agricultural products, visa restrictions on farm workers, reduced farm subsidies and open favoritism toward South American agricultural competitors.
In the past, farmers’ loyalty to Trump has overridden economics. In our study of the 2018-19 trade war between the U.S. and China, we found that farmers in Trump-voting counties kept planting soybeans even though the trade war’s effects were clear: Their costs would rise and their profits would fall. Farmers in Democratic-leaning counties, by contrast, shifted acreage toward alternatives such as corn or wheat that were likely to be more profitable. For many pro-Trump farmers, political belief outweighed market logic — at least in the short term.
Today, the economic effects of policies affecting farmers are broader and deeper — and the resolve that carried farmers’ support for Trump through the first trade war may no longer be enough.
 
Tariffs: The familiar pain returns
The revived U.S.-China trade conflict has again placed soybeans at its center. In March 2025, Beijing suspended import licenses for several major U.S. soybean exporters following new U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods. Trump countered with a new round of reciprocal tariffs, broadening the list of Chinese imports hit and raising rates on already targeted goods.
An October 2025 deal promised China would buy 25 million metric tons of U.S. soybeans a year, but relief has proved mostly symbolic.
Before the 2018-19 trade war, China regularly imported 30 million to 36 million metric tons of U.S. soybeans annually — more than one-third of all American soybean exports. Now, Beijing has signed long-term contracts with Brazil and Argentina, leaving U.S. producers with shrinking overseas demand for their crops.
Prices remain roughly 40% to 50% below pre-2018 levels, and farmers are storing record volumes of unsold soybeans.
In 2019, the federal government cushioned those losses with over $23 billion in bailout payments to farmers. This time, Republican leaders show little appetite for another bailout. Meanwhile, the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s funds for farm relief are running low, leaving farmers with lower prices and less support.
 
Labor: Fewer hands, higher costs
Farms are also short of workers. Roughly 42% of U.S. crop workers lack legal status, according to the National Agricultural Workers Survey. Tougher immigration enforcement and slower visa processing have thinned the labor pool just as production costs are surging. Hired-labor expenses rose 14.4% from 2021 to 2022 and another 15.2% the following year, and costs such as fertilizer, equipment and parts climbed sharply.
Many growers are turning to the H-2A guest worker program — a legal pipeline for seasonal foreign labor that has quadrupled in size over the past decade. But it is expensive: Farms must pay the adverse effect wage rate, a federally set pay rate that is more than twice the regular federal minimum wage. And farms must provide every H-2A worker with free housing and free transportation to and from the U.S., as well as from their housing to the worksite. Large agribusinesses can absorb those costs; small family farms often cannot.
As exports collapsed in late September 2025, the head of the American Soybean Association wrote a public letter to the White House begging for help, saying, “We’ve had your back. We need you to have ours now.” The hard-line immigration policy approach that rallies rural voters is also pushing smaller farms to the brink — forcing them to ask what their loyalty still buys.
 
Subsidies and symbolism: The Argentina shock
The question of the value of farmers’ loyalty sharpened in the fall of 2025 when the U.S. Treasury approved a $20 billion currency-swap deal with Argentina — supporting the country’s president, Javier Milei, a political ally of Trump, while the country remains a direct agricultural competitor.
U.S. farmers, already frustrated by low prices and visa delays, took it as an insult. Argentina is among the world’s largest soybean exporters, and U.S. farm groups asked why the federal government would underwrite a competitor while trimming support for American producers at home.
The tension deepened when Trump floated the idea of buying Argentinian beef for U.S. markets — a remark one Kansas rancher called “an absolute betrayal.” The plan may be economically minor, but symbolically it pierced the “America First” narrative that had helped hold the farm vote together.
 
Clean energy: The new rural subsidy under threat
For decades, the farm vote relied on federally funded support programs — crop insurance, price guarantees and disaster assistance — which account for a significant share of net farm income. Over the past five years, a quieter lifeline has emerged: renewable energy.
Wind and solar projects have brought jobs, tax revenue and steady lease payments to rural counties that have been losing both population and farm income for decades. Iowa now gets about 63% of its electricity from wind, while Texas, Oklahoma and Kansas have seen significant growth.
That momentum has stalled. In August 2025, a U.S. Treasury Department policy change froze billions in rural investment in renewable energy projects. Industry trackers report that prolonged uncertainty has pushed many Midwestern renewable projects into limbo.
For farmers, this isn’t an abstract climate debate — it’s a lost income stream. Leasing land for turbines or solar panels brought in tens of thousands of dollars a year and kept many family farms afloat.
The freeze wipes out one of the few growth engines in rural America and highlights an irony at the heart of Trump’s message: The administration that promises to protect the heartland is dismantling the clean energy investments that were finally helping it diversify.
 
Politics: How deep does loyalty run?
As our research found, during the first trade war, Trump-voting counties absorbed heavy financial losses without changing course. That loyalty was propped up by subsidies — and by hope. This time, neither cushion is secure.
Many farmers still share Trump’s skepticism of Washington and global elites. But shrinking federal backing, tighter labor and a competitor’s bailout cut close to home. The question now is whether cultural identity can keep outweighing material loss — or whether the second trade war will signal a deeper political shift.
No sudden collapse of rural support for Trump is likely; cultural loyalty doesn’t fade overnight. But strain is visible. Farm groups are quietly pressing for pragmatic trade policy and visa reform, and several Republican governors now lobby for labor flexibility rather than tougher enforcement.
If the first Trump trade war tested farmers’ wallets, this one tests their faith — and faith, once shaken, is far harder to restore.

(Photo by Lance Cpl. Cody Rowe/U.S. Marine Corps)Maryland lawmakers have joined more than 100 members of Congress pushing for the release of federal home heating assistance funds, just days before state health officials announced the first cold-related death of the season.
The Maryland Department of Health reported Friday that a man between the ages of 30 and 40 was found dead outdoors in Frederick County of weather-related causes, the first cold-related illness death of the 2025-2026 winter weather season. Last year, the state recorded 75.such deaths over the winter, the most in five years, according to state data.
The health department is urging Marylanders in need of heat to reach out to their local health departments or call the 2-1-1 line to find the nearest warming center or overnight shelters.
The death comes as a bipartisan group of House members is urging the Trump administration to release federal energy assistance dollars that help low-income families afford their energy bills in the winter.
The Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program, or LIHEAP, was paused during the recent 43-day government shutdown, along with other federal assistance programs suspended during that time. But while other project funding began to flow after the shutdown ended, the administration has not released LIHEAP funding to states that administer the program.
Three Maryland Democrats — Reps. Glenn Ivey (D-4th), April McClain Delaney (D-6th) and Kweisi Mfume (D-7th) — joined 100 other House members on a bipartisan letter calling on Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought to release the LIHEAP funds as soon as possible.
Mfume notes that around 100,000 Maryland households rely on LIHEAP to afford their energy bills, including 37,000 in Baltimore City and Baltimore County.

“For my constituents, this program is not a luxury – it is the difference between a paid utilities bill or a freezing home,” Mfume said in a written statement Friday.
While an executive order from the Moore administration helped stave off a lapse in benefits for November, the letter from congressional members warns that without “swift” federal action, LIHEAP payments may not make it out to Marylanders and other struggling families until January.
“It is unacceptable to leave them guessing as to whether the heat will still be on come the holiday season,” Mfume said. “The beneficiaries of this program, many of them seniors and veterans, cannot be left to shiver in the cold this winter.”
LIHEAP is a federally funded energy assistance program aiming to help lower-income households afford their utility bills during both the high temperatures of summer and the cold winter weather.
The stopgap budget that funded government operations and reopened the government included funding for LIHEAP at 2024 levels. For Maryland that was about $95 million, to cover just over 94,000 households in fiscal 2024, according to federal data.
But those dollars are not yet available to states.
The letter says that “flurry of chaotic firings at HHS in April,” may have resulted in a significant number, if not all, of LIHEAP staff getting laid off, which could be delaying payment for November.
“The Administration’s reckless firings of all LIHEAP staff will only prolong these delays, as it is unclear who will approve states’ program plans and manage the release of the funds now that funding has been approved,” the joint letter says. “While States and community organizations are working to provide emergency relief, it has been estimated that seniors and families may be without LIHEAP assistance until January.”
“With the winter months approaching and extreme heat becoming increasingly frequent,” the letter reads, “families may soon be faced with the impossible choice between keeping their homes at a safe temperature and putting food on the table or affording their medications.”
Maryland commits $62 million to fund share of November SNAP benefits USDA won’t pay for

Earlier this month, Gov. Wes Moore (D) issued an executive order to shuffle $10.1 million from the Strategic Energy Investment Fund to cover the LIHEAP payment gap in November, to “ensure Maryland households can continue to heat their homes and power essential household and medical equipment, particularly as colder winter months approach.”
This action avoided a disruption in LIHEAP payments for Marylanders in November, according to state officials, but Moore has warned against tapping into the state’s limited funding to help fill in when federal dollars are not available amid Maryland’s tight fiscal situation.
Meanwhile, cold temperatures in Maryland have already resulted in a fatality this year.
“Maryland’s first cold-related death of the year emphasizes the importance of resources and preparedness during the coldest months,” the department said in a Friday advisory.
“To prevent the onset of cold-related illnesses, including hypothermia and frostbite, Marylanders should limit their time outside and wear several layers of lightweight, insulated clothing to avoid exposure to cold weather,” the announcement said. “Be sure to insulate your toes, fingers, ears, cheeks, and the tip of your nose.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/4076292-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-22 07:56:58.074493

(Photo by Danielle E. Gaines/Maryland Matters)The board overseeing the state’s multibillion-dollar education reform plan has some suggestions for state lawmakers when they convene in January for the 2026 legislative session.
The Blueprint for Maryland’s Future Accountability and Implementation Board approved several legislative recommendations Thursday that include consolidating the number of reports from local school districts, modifying and expanding options for teacher programs and “permanently” authorizing eligible schools that receive concentration of poverty grants to get funding for fine arts programs such as music, arts and dance.
The chosen recommendations highlighted in the 15-page document are in bold type focus on the Blueprint’s five pillars, or priorities, that deal with early childhood education, high-quality and diverse teachers and leaders, college and career readiness, more resources for students to be successful, and governance and accountability.
One suggestion requests the legislature extend the plan to “hold harmless” funding for multilingual learners, students in poverty and those in special education. That provision, which protects those students from any per pupil funding cuts that come along, is currently set through fiscal 2027; the board wants it extended through fiscal 2028.
The board also recommends the legislature maintain the state’s current methodology of how it counts low-income students.
The recommendations are based on a report last month from the Governor’s Office for Children, which assessed the state may have fewer students in poverty. In other words, school districts would receive less money.
That report, based on student enrollment from the 2024-25 school year, determined at least 59% of schools across the state experienced a decrease in the number of students in poverty. Part of the state’s calculation for students in poverty includes a family’s income as well as those receiving free and reduced-price lunches in schools.
AIB Executive Director Rachel Hise said the recommendations would provide state officials with more time to conduct further analysis and assess the number of students affected.
According to an AIB legislative summary, staff recommended supporting the level funding for those students after determining that “proposed methodologies to calculate students in poverty were no more accurate than those that are currently in use. Further, the options identified impacted an overwhelming number of LEAs [local education agencies] negatively.”
Another legislative recommendation is to allow out-of-state teachers to verify at least two years of experience, versus having to take a test to prove teaching ability. This proposal is aimed at helping decrease the state’s teacher shortage.
One other recommendation deals with dual enrollment, which allows high school students to take college courses locally for free, with tuition paid for by the school district. It wants the legislature to extend statutory authority of the AIB and state Board of Education from fiscal 2027 to fiscal 2030 to require a minimum number of course a school district must offer.
When both boards held a joint meeting in September, they approved a legislative recommendation to extend another dual enrollment policy through fiscal year 2027.
The policy, which currently runs through the end of this fiscal year, allows students who are designated as college and career ready by the 10th grade to take two college courses in the fall and another two in the spring.
Students who have not meet the college and career readiness standard can still take two courses during a school year and receive additional support in English, math and other areas.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/blueprint-newsletter-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-11-22 08:56:52.442638

New CEO for Montgomery economic development
After a nationwide search, the Montgomery County Economic Development Corp. said it has selected Jared Smith, the director of economic development and tourism for the city of Henderson, Nevada, to be the organization’s next president and CEO.
Smith will start Dec. 8. He succeeds former CEO Bill Tompkins, whose term ended Aug. 15.

	Smith brings more than 20 years of economic development and business experience with local and state governments, according to a statement from MCEDC. Before Henderson, which is part of the Las Vegas metro area, he was chief operating officerat the Las Vegas Global Economic Alliance. In that job, he generated $17.2 billion in economic impact over six years, the most in the organization’s history, according to the statement.
It said that over the past decade, Smith has helped drive diversification of Nevada’s tourism-based economy, with a “proven track record in business attraction, retention, expansion, and workforce development includes partnerships with hundreds of companies across both established and high-growth industry sectors.”
Smith has twice been recognized as part of a nationally top-ranked economic development team and currently chairs the International Economic Development Council’s national Committee on the Future of the Profession, helping shape strategies that influence communities across the U.S.
“I’m pleased to welcome Jared to Montgomery County,” said County Executive Marc Elrich. “The appointment of a new CEO at MCEDC marks the beginning of the next phase in advancing the County’s long-term economic development strategy.”
The appointment comes shortly after the Montgomery County Council approved a five-year redesignation of MCEDC, reaffirming the organization’s role as the county’s official economic development entity.
“Montgomery County is an extraordinarily diverse place where innovation, infrastructure, and talent converge, with talent as its key driver of economic competitiveness,” Smith in the news release announcing his appointment. “I look forward to building on MCEDC’s strong foundation to attract investment and expand opportunity across the County.”


First lady joins Hall of Fame

But has he ever been lumped together with Dominique Dawes? And Larry David and Connie Chung and Len Elmore and Carly Fiorina and Boomer Esiason? And Jim Henson? His wife has.
First lady Dawn Moore, a University of Maryland, College Park, alumna, was inducted earlier this month into the University of Maryland Alumni Hall of Fame, which includes all those people and 62 others. Moore, a 1997 graduate of the university, was inducted for her decades of experience and commitment to public service, according to a statement from the first lady’s office.
“The University of Maryland changed my life. It taught me that service is not about stature or status — but it’s about doing the right thing for the good of our communities,” Moore said in the statement. “This guiding principle has carried me more than two decades of public service.”
University of Maryland President Darryll J. Pines said Moore has “dedicated her life to public service, connecting communities, creating opportunities for people to succeed and thrive, and inspiring Marylanders with her commitment to leadership, community and family.”
The award was announced in late October and the induction ceremony was earlier this month.  Since 1995, the University of Maryland Alumni Association has inducted 68 distinguished alumni into the Alumni Hall of Fame. Inductees have given back to society by educating, entertaining, serving, or defending their communities, the association said.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/DSC_0185-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-22 10:59:54.460935

(Pool photo by Bethany Baker/The Salt Lake Tribune) One of several reports prepared for a Utah judge draws a conclusion that convicted killer Ralph Menzies is “not competent to be executed” for the 1986 murder of Maurine Hunsaker. 
The finding doesn’t definitively answer the question of whether Menzies, 67, will be put to death for the crime. The judge will make a determination on legal competency after a court hearing expected to last several days next month. 
The U.S. Supreme Court has ruled a person cannot be put to death without a rational understanding of the reason for the penalty, saying that would amount to cruel and unusual punishment. 
In an evaluation dated Nov. 17 and publicly available in Utah court records for a time Friday, forensic psychologist Michael P. Brooks wrote that “Mr. Menzies is unaware of the crime for which he is convicted, the parameters of the case (e.g., victim’s identity, specific acts he was found to have committed, etc.), the capital nature of the sentence he received, or how the punishment will be carried out.”
Brooks, an employee of the Utah Department of Health and Human Services, was ordered by the court to conduct an independent examination. He previously concluded that Menzies was fit to receive the death penalty, testifying in November 2024 that Menzies “knows that the ‘state wants to kill me because I killed a person and killing people is wrong.’” 
Utah’s medical experts say Ralph Menzies is competent to be executed. His attorneys disagree

For the new evaluation, the psychologist met with Menzies on Oct. 20 and Nov. 12, for 70 minutes both times. In one of the sessions, Menzies asked, “why would they want to kill me?”
“I asked after his understanding of the crime for which he had been convicted and the legal proceedings to this point, but he merely shook his head,” the 30-page report says. 
A spokesperson for the Utah Attorney General’s Office, which is defending the state’s plan to execute Menzies, declined comment. Jennifer Moreno, one of Menzies’ attorneys, said his legal team knows about the report but did not provide comment on its conclusion. 
Menzies does not have a “substantial probability” of getting to a point of restored competency, “given that there is no treatment that would improve any cognitive deficits incident to this condition,” the review found.
Menzies killed the 26-year-old Hunsaker nearly four decades ago after kidnapping her from her job at a gas station in Kearns. He tied her to a tree in Big Cottonwood Canyon, strangled her and slit her throat, prosecutors said. She was found by a hiker days later.

Menzies had been scheduled to be executed by firing squad Sept. 5. As the date drew closer, his attorneys argued his dementia had worsened.
After a judge rejected those arguments, they appealed to the Utah Supreme Court. The state’s high court called off the execution in September, ruling there was enough evidence to warrant another competency evaluation. 
The court’s decision triggered the new round of proceedings, requiring reports from at least two state examiners and other evaluators commissioned by the state or Menzies’ attorneys. 
For those already on death row before May 2004, including Menzies, Utah allowed a choice between lethal injection and firing squad. Menzies chose the firing squad. Now the default method of execution is lethal injection, unless the necessary drugs are not available.

Elissa Slotkin took to social media on Friday night to report that the Michigan State Police responded to a bomb threat at her home.
Slotkin was reportedly not at home at the time of the incident. State Police searched her property in Holly and confirmed that no one was in danger.
The bomb threat comes after she and other Democratic lawmakers created a video calling on the various branches of the U.S. Armed Services to reject any illegal order that might come down from President Donald Trump or the newly renamed Department of War under Secretary Pete Hegseth.

Trump responded with vitriol calling the video “seditious behavior from traitors, punishable by death.”
Slotkin responded by saying that the video “really isn’t about those of us who made the video … this is about who we are as Americans and how we’re going to engage with people who we disagree with.”
Trump threatens Democratic lawmakers including Slotkin, calling remarks ‘seditious’ on Truth Social

Trump’s administration later backtracked on those comments and White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Trump did not want to execute the lawmakers.
Slotkin served as a CIA intelligence officer before running for the U.S. House of Representatives and then the U.S. Senate, where she now currently serves.
It was reported later that Slotkin amplified her security presence to a 24-hour detail after Trump’s posts.
Friday night’s bomb threat followed.
“Senator Slotkin is deeply grateful for the swift and professional response by Oakland County and Michigan State Police,” a spokesperson wrote on Slotkin’s social media pages. “U.S. Capitol Police will continue to investigate and hopefully hold accountable those responsible.”

Screenshot of Greene's video U.S. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene from Georgia, a Rome Republican, announced her plans to resign from Congress Friday evening in an unexpected video message.
Greene, who was first elected in Georgia’s 14th congressional district in 2020, said in a lengthy and pointed video statement posted on social media that her last day in Congress will be Jan. 5, 2026.
Once a staunch supporter of President Donald Trump, Trump publicly broke ties with Greene after she expressed disagreement with him on a number of issues, the biggest of which was the release of the Epstein files.
Greene expressed disillusionment with the political system and Trump, predicting that if she were to stay in office, she would face and defeat a Trump-funded opponent while Republicans lose the midterms nationwide.
“It’s all so absurd and completely unserious,” she said in the video. “I refuse to be a battered wife hoping it all goes away and gets better. If I’m cast aside by the president and the MAGA political machine and replaced by neocons, big pharma, big tech, military industrial war complex, foreign leaders and the elite donor class that can never, ever relate to real Americans then many common Americans have been cast aside and replaced as well.”
“There is no plan to save the world or a 4-D chess game being played,” she added. “When common American people realize and understand that the political industrial complex of both parties is ripping this country apart, that not one elected leader like me is able to stop Washington’s machine from gradually destroying our country and instead the reality is that they, common Americans, the people, possess the real power over Washington, then I’ll be here by their side to rebuild it.”
The Constitution calls on a state’s governor to declare a special election when a vacancy happens in the House of Representatives. 
Greene was reportedly considering a run for higher office, including as Georgia governor or for Democratic U.S. Sen. Jon Ossoff’s seat, both of which are up next year, but bowed out of consideration after being discouraged by Trump. 
Republican strategist Brian Robinson said that it’s unclear what Greene will do next, but that “she has the profile and the talent to make a splash whatever she does.”
“Her video message laid out a clear and detailed vision that could serve as a roadmap to a political future,” he said in a statement.
Greene said in her speech that her goal was to hold the Republican party accountable and put “America first.”
“I look forward to seeing many of you again sometime in the future,” she said and signed off with a smile. 
Josh McKoon, chair of the Georgia Republican Party, called the announcement a “surprise.” He thanked Greene for her “fierce and unwavering service” and said in a statement that the congresswoman “has been a tireless fighter” for conservatives.
“She entered Congress as a political outsider and never backed down from defending the forgotten men and women of our state,” McKoon said.
McKoon said the party will work to elect another conservative to the district. The 14th congressional district is deeply red, and Greene was reelected to her third term in 2024 with 64.4% of the vote.

Amid unionizing effort, patrol says opening Jackson Hole Mountain Resort on Nov. 28 remains top priority.
The post Jackson Hole Ski Patrol takes steps to unionize appeared first on WyoFile .","The Jackson Hole Ski Patrol has taken the first step to unionize in an effort to secure “fair compensation, comprehensive benefits and equitable career incentives,” the group said in a statement.
Tyler Babcock, a nine-year Jackson Hole ski patroller, told WyoFile that 93% of eligible patrol members signed the petition filed Thursday with the National Labor Relations Board and support a vote to decide whether to be recognized under law as a union. Patrol members who did not sign the petition hold management positions and, as such, are prohibited from forming a union under the National Labor Relations Act.
A vote could be bypassed if the Jackson Hole Mountain Resort voluntarily recognizes the Jackson Hole Ski Patrol as a union.

“That is a potential outcome,” Babcock said. “But more than likely, we will hold a vote. That vote will likely take place in the next four to six weeks. While there’s a lot of unity in our group, we don’t want to be presumptuous,” Babcock said. “We want to allow everybody in our group to make their own independent decisions.” 
If the unionization drive succeeds, the Jackson Hole Ski Patrol would join the Communications Workers of America, which has already successfully negotiated contracts for patrollers and ski lift operators with resorts across the country. The movement to unionize under the Communications Workers of America gained national attention after the Park City Ski Patrol ended a months-long strike last winter by negotiating a contract with Vail Resorts for higher wages, better parental leave and educational opportunities. 
According to Babcock, the Jackson Hole Ski Patrol is already a tight-knit group, and “forming a union would just make it official.” Seeking livable wages is only a small piece of what it means to form a union, he said. 
Unionization would enable the patrol to negotiate for a variety of needs, from working conditions to benefits, Babcock emphasized. He said that all of the seasonally employed ski patrollers, many with families who have worked for the resort for decades, lack access to basic health insurance. He noted that this is especially critical right now because “the Affordable Care Act is about to crumble” — an apparent reference to the expiration of tax credits that subsidize health insurance plans bought through the federal marketplace. 
The effort to unionize will improve job security, helping to create a safer and more enjoyable environment for everyone, Babcock said. In order to protect the public, he stressed that long-time, experienced patrollers are needed to successfully perform complicated and dangerous jobs.    
“In a town that has the largest income inequality gap in the country — if you are able to make a sustainable living in a town like this, then you’re going to have longevity,” Babcock said. “As ski patrollers, institutional knowledge is important in this job. You don’t really want a young, inexperienced person coming in to perform avalanche mitigation with explosives.”
“The skills and institutional knowledge acquired through years on the job is critical and irreplaceable for maintaining the highest safety and operational standards,” the Jackson Hole Ski Patrol said in a press release. “JHSP is committed to ensuring JHMR maintains its position as a leader in mountain safety and guest experience. Unionizing will help patrollers secure the stability, representation and long-term foundation necessary to provide the world-class experience Jackson Hole is known for.”
While it is too early in the process to request specific changes, Jackson Hole Ski Patrol is asking its employer, the Jackson Hole Mountain Resort, to have a seat at the table.

The resort issued its own statement in response to the ski patrol’s union petition: “We care deeply about every member of our team, and we value the important role ski patrol plays at our resort. We are committed to listening, engaging respectfully and continuing open dialog. Our focus is to work together toward an outcome that supports our employees and the exceptional experience we strive to create for our guests and our mountain community.”
Forming a union can take months or even years, so in the meantime, the patrol’s priority is to open the resort on time — Nov. 28. When asked about the possibility of a walkout or strike, Babcock said that patrollers are committed to their work and not interested in a fight.
“We love our jobs,” Babcock said. “We look forward to going to work at the resort. That’s really what we are focused on. It’s business as usual. We hope snow continues to accumulate.”
If certified, the patrol will organize as the Jackson Hole Ski Patrol Union under Communications Workers of America Local 7781, United Mountain Workers.

(Photo by Yereth Rosen/Alaska Beacon)Rates of pertussis, also known as whooping cough, are surging in Texas, Florida, California, Oregon, and other states and localities across the country.
The outbreaks are fueled by falling vaccination rates, fading immunity, and delays in public health tracking systems, according to interviews with state and federal health officials. Babies too young to be fully vaccinated are most at risk.
“Pertussis cases increase in a cyclical fashion driven by waning immunity, but the size of the outbreak and the potential for severe outcomes in children who cannot be vaccinated can be mitigated by high coverage and good communication to folks at risk,” said Demetre Daskalakis, a former head of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s immunization program, who resigned in August.
Before the first pertussis vaccine became available in the early 1900s, whooping cough was one of the most common childhood diseases and a major cause of childhood death in the United States. Today, children get a series of DTaP shots (full-dose version) starting at 2 months old, and teens and adults receive a Tdap booster (lower-dose version) every 10 years. (Both vaccines target diphtheria and tetanus in addition to pertussis.)
Until recently, 8 in 10 toddlers had received four doses of the DTaP vaccine by age 2, and case rates were controlled. But vaccine coverage has declined since the covid pandemic and increases in state nonmedical exemptions have widened immunity gaps, which is when the proportion of individuals who are immune falls below the level needed to contain spread.
Texas logged 1,928 pertussis cases in 2024. By October 2025, the state had exceeded 3,500. National numbers are just as stark: In the first three months of 2025, the U.S. tallied 6,600 cases — four times last year’s pace and 25 times 2023’s. Several states are posting their highest case totals in a decade, and outbreaks from Louisiana to South Dakota to Idaho make clear this surge isn’t regional. It’s everywhere.
Key Factors Behind These Numbers
Texas lawmakers recently passed a law that made it easier for parents to claim nonmedical exemptions from school vaccine requirements by allowing them to download exemption forms online. These forms now go straight to schools, not health departments, making the exemptions harder to track.
Dallas County Health and Human Services Director Phil Huang said the full impact of the new exemption rule is not yet known because it began this school year, but he expects it will make school-level vaccination rates fall even more.
He’s already noted a dramatic drop in vaccinations. Normally, during back-to-school season, “our whole front downstairs area is packed,” he said. “We did not see that this year.”
Huang believes fear of immigration enforcement may be keeping at least some families, especially Hispanic families, from getting vaccinated. Dallas County is about 40% Hispanic. “We think that a lot of them are deterred by the ICE activity,” he said, referring to Immigration and Customs Enforcement.
More complications: These vaccines protect against severe disease, but protection against infection fades over time, as is the case with the covid and influenza vaccines.
The U.S. switched in the 1990s from whole-cell pertussis vaccines to “acellular” ones, which cause fewer side effects but do not last as long. Because more adults today than in the past received the acellular vaccine as children, many have lost immunity over time and may unknowingly pass the infection to babies.
Babies Face the Greatest Risk
Whooping cough is especially dangerous for infants under a year old. Some stop breathing during coughing fits. Many need hospital care, about 1 in 5 of whom develop pneumonia, and about 1% of whom die.
Because of this high risk, the CDC urges pregnant women to get a Tdap vaccine during every pregnancy. This allows the mother’s antibodies to pass to the baby before birth.
Health officials once promoted “cocooning,” vaccinating all family members and caregivers around the baby, but that strategy was hard to carry out in real life and is no longer widely recommended. Vaccination of pregnant women and babies at 2 months of age remains the strongest protection.
Better Testing Finds More Cases
Modern PCR testing is also uncovering more pertussis cases than in the past. Many clinics now routinely use this lab-based technology to test for several respiratory infections at once, including pertussis. Ten years ago, these panels were uncommon.
CDC experts say this explains part of the rise in case counts. But the large number of infant hospitalizations and the size of state outbreaks show that true transmission has also increased.
A Growing Worry: Antibiotic Resistance
Doctors normally treat pertussis with macrolide antibiotics, such as erythromycin, azithromycin, and clarithromycin. These drugs work best early in the illness and help stop spread. Another drug, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, is an option for some older infants and adults.
But macrolide-resistant pertussis has become common abroad, especially in China, and recent reports show resistance rising in Peru. In the U.S., resistant cases have been rare.
CDC officials warn that resistant strains could spread more easily through international travel. Because treatment options are limited, especially for very young infants, health workers are watching this closely.
Huang said macrolide resistance has not been seen yet in Dallas County. But he is aware of the national concern.
What Happens Now
The resurgence of whooping cough has no single cause. Instead, several problems are occurring at once: falling vaccine coverage, only about 60% of pregnant women receiving Tdap, waning immunity, improved testing, and early signs of antibiotic resistance.
Health experts say solutions must match the problem’s complexity.
Across the nation, clinicians are being told to have a higher suspicion for pertussis when they see patients, especially children or caregivers of newborns with a persistent cough or coughing fits followed by vomiting. Babies who stop breathing or turn blue need immediate care.
Obstetricians are encouraged to discuss Tdap during every pregnancy. Pediatricians and family doctors are urged to check booster status for teens and adults.
Several states have issued health advisories over the past two years, including Texas, which has issued alerts in both 2024 and 2025 urging clinicians to stay vigilant.
Huang said Dallas County is trying to rebuild public health outreach programs that were cut when covid funding ended. But staffing is still limited. “There’s just a lot of different things that are making it more difficult,” he said.
He also noted that Dallas County now receives immunization registry data only once a month, rather than daily, making it harder to track vaccine coverage. “We don’t have that yet. … It’s not real time,” he said.
Protecting the Youngest
As the holiday season approaches, experts urge families with newborns to take extra care:

Ensure infants and children are up to date with their childhood vaccines and that everyone in the family is up to date with their vaccines for influenza, covid, and RSV, or respiratory syncytial virus.
Keep sick visitors away.
Seek care quickly if an infant has a cough or pauses breathing.

The Arkansas-based Tyson said in a statement that changes were designed to “right-size” its beef business and position it for long-term success. 
The Lexington plant is to close on or around Jan. 20. The statement did not elaborate on why the plant in the town of  about 11,500 people was targeted.

The company said it also will convert an Amarillo, Texas, beef facility to a single, full-capacity shift and increase production at other company beef facilities. The number of layoffs from that eliminated shift is about 1,700.
A recent earnings report indicated that Tyson stands to lose some $600 million in its beef business next fiscal year, on top of the already-incurred $720 million loss over the last two years. 
The closure sparked swift reaction from Nebraskans.
The Nebraska Cattlemen Board of Directors expressed disappointment — especially, it said, in light of Friday’s U.S. Department of Agriculture data that Nebraska cattle-on-feed inventories remain slightly above year-ago levels in spite of the ongoing cyclical tightness in national cattle numbers.

“We firmly believe there isn’t a better place to efficiently and economically raise cattle and produce beef than Nebraska,” the board said in a statement. “This will have a profound impact on the community of Lexington and many cattle producers.”
Nebraska Gov. Jim Pillen called the state’s cattle industry resilient and “the envy of the world.” He said Tyson leadership promised to “work on future value-added opportunities” in the state.
“Big picture — our excellent cattlemen and cattle feeders have emerging opportunities and will still have the Tyson market to sell into as its planned re-organization will boost capacity and jobs at other Nebraska plants,” Pillen said.
But U.S. Sen. Deb Fischer, R-Neb., a member of the Senate Agriculture Committee, blasted the decision.
“As the single largest employer in Lexington, Tyson’s announcement will have a devastating impact on a truly wonderful community, the region and our state,” she said.
Calling Nebraska a beef state that knows better than anyone the highs and lows of the cattle market, Fischer added: “It’s no secret that just a few years ago, packers like Tyson were making windfall profits while the rest of the industry was continuously in the red.”

“I call on Tyson to do everything in its power to take care of the families affected by this short-sighted decision,” she said. 
U.S. Sen. Pete Ricketts, R-Neb., said he would do what he could to support Nebraskans impacted and to help employees find work close to home.
“This news is especially heartbreaking around the holidays,” he said.
U.S. Rep. Adrian Smith, R-Neb, called the closure a disappointing loss for the city, Dawson County, the region and cattle industry as a whole. 
“Nebraska’s hard-working cattle producers are innovative and highly efficient as they work to provide high quality beef for consumers,” Smith said. “I welcome input from producers and stand ready to assist as we all move forward.”
In its announcement, Tyson said it recognized the impact its decisions have on its team members and their communities.
“The company is committed to supporting our team members through this transition, including helping them apply for open positions at other facilities and providing relocation benefits,” it said.

That anxiety erupted into protest on Friday as hundreds of students took to Hillsborough Street to demand ICE and Border Patrol end their North Carolina crackdown.

Kendelle Petty, a freshman from Nags Head, said many of her friends are afraid to leave their dorms as rumors of ICE sightings fly around campus. She marched in Friday’s protest carrying a sign that said, “No one is illegal on stolen land.”
“I think that our current administration is acting in a very similar way to Nazi Germany, and they’re dragging people out of their homes,” Petty said. “I’m just very frustrated — it’s like we’re not treating immigrants as people.”
The student protesters gathered at the base of the Memorial Belltower before marching down Hillsborough Street, past D.H. Hill Library, and through the campus grounds, chanting “Down with deportation, up with liberation” and “ICE out of NC now!”
The protest comes a day after mixed messages from law enforcement officials about the status of an immigration crackdown in N.C. by the Trump administration.
Mecklenburg Co. Sheriff Garry McFadden said Thursday he was told by federal agents that “Operation Charlotte’s Web” was over for now. But U.S. Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said the operation is continuing, punctuated by a mocking meme on social media.
As of Thursday, DHS reported 370 arrests in North Carolina through the enforcement operation. Immigration authorities detained U.S. citizens in some cases, and the expansive nature of the operation has drawn criticism from some North Carolina officials of both parties, who say it should focus on those who pose a danger to the public.
U.S. Customs and Border Protection did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the protest.

NC State spokesman Mick Kulikowski said the university is “closely monitoring the situation,” adding that campus police have reported no credible sightings of immigration agents on campus.
In a memo Tuesday, NC State executive vice chancellor and provost Warwick Arden told faculty not to provide any information about students to immigration enforcement without consulting the university general counsel. He also advised caution for the international community on campus.
“International students, faculty and staff should carry evidence of their immigration status with them at all times,” Arden wrote. “If they leave the Raleigh area, we encourage them to carry their passport.”
Livi Schwartz, an organizer with the campus chapter of the Young Democratic Socialists of America, said that, while there have been no verified sightings on ICE tracking apps, “the threat still feels very real to everyone.”
“Someone told us that he was stopped by someone on campus and asked for his passport and identification,” Schwartz said. “We have had people see suspicious vehicles.”
In response to those fears, students are mobilizing to prepare each other for encounters with ICE. Plastered across the campus are QR codes for immigrant rights resources and ICE tracking tools. Schwartz’s organization and lawyers from the University Student Legal Services held “Know Your Rights” information sessions Wednesday and Thursday at NC State’s Talley Student Union.
“It can be very difficult to act how we would want to in these situations,” Schwartz said. “We want it to be muscle memory for people so that they aren’t caught off guard, which is what the agents want.”
“This all-day climate of, ‘Are my students going to be okay? Is someone I know going to be kidnapped?’ That was new to me on this campus,” said English professor Belle Boggs. “It was incredibly disruptive to the students and to the faculty.”

Like Schwartz, Boggs said she has not had a direct encounter with ICE or Border Patrol agents. But colleagues have sent her photos of men dressed in black and green tactical garb on Hillsborough Street, and students have told her about encounters with them around D.H. Hill Library, she said.
“It felt awful to think about my students having to be afraid that they need to show proof of their immigration status to an armed, dangerous stranger wearing a mask,” said Boggs, who also serves as president of the state chapter of the American Association of University Professors.
In a statement Wednesday, the North Carolina AAUP condemned the immigration crackdown in North Carolina as “racist and xenophobic.”
“It will not succeed in cowing faculty and academic workers, in sowing division, or in keeping us from supporting our neighbors in need,” the professors said in the statement. “We will continue to fight for the colleges, universities, and communities we deserve.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/PB215232-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-11-21 18:58:40.051120

The North Dakota Native Heritage Showcase, sponsored by the state’s Indian Affairs Commission, featured about a dozen vendor tables at the Capitol with handmade jewelry, paintings, books and other items. 
Brad Hawk, executive director of the North Dakota Indian Affairs Commission, said the event is a way to showcase different Native cultures and give exposure to local nonprofit groups..
“It’s more than music. It’s more than regalia. We have different aspects of the culture in arts,” Hawk said. “It’s a communitywide event, a little bit for everybody, and that’s the way we set it up to be.”
Dakota Goodhouse, a Native American studies instructor at United Tribes Technical College, played a wooden, Native American flute and shared its history that spans “10 grandfathers’ lives.” There isn’t a definitive date of when the Northern Plains Indian-style flute appeared, but he said he believes it has been embedded in Native courtship traditions for about 900 years.





“Everyone remembers young love, and it is just something that resonates with us,” Goodhouse said. 
He said the flute’s dual-chamber design is unique among flutes and was modeled after how the downy woodpecker carves a tree limb in two different parts. Dakota and Lakota tribes noticed when the wind passed through the different holes on the woodpecker’s tree limb, a sound came out, he said.
Melanie Schwab, owner of The Modern Sioux in Mandan, crafts handmade jewelry from parts of animals killed in different hunts. She added her ancestors used all of the parts of the animals they hunted and her business honors that tradition.
“Whatever I am getting from the Creator, I want to use all of it,” Schwab said.

The auditor’s office report detailed complaints that were not investigated on time and cases closed without follow-up visits. The health department said it would work to implement recommendations.

Gov. David Zuckerman in South Burlington on Oct. 20, 2020.  File photo by Glenn Russell/VTDigger
The Office of the State Auditor found significant shortcomings with how the Vermont Department of Health reviews complaints related to food and lodging establishments, according to a recent report.
The report is the first audit of four planned for the coming months by Auditor Doug Hoffer and his staff, part of an effort to assess how the state government responds to Vermonters’ complaints. 
The department’s Food and Lodging program is responsible for ensuring that Vermont restaurants, hotels, and other similar establishments, follow the state’s health and sanitation regulations and protocols. The program provides licenses and inspects more than 6,000 food establishments and regulates lodging facilities, while addressing the complaints it receives from the public.
The audit selected 45 complaints for review out of the 1,081 complaints the program received between 2022 and 2024. The types of complaints that come in include allegations of unsanitary conditions, bed bug infestations, inadequate cooking and contaminated food equipment. Inspectors have to first verify if the complaints are true, and if so, recommend corrective actions.
However, the audit found that inspections were not always conducted within the required timeframe, and, in some cases, inspectors did not follow up to verify if the problems were resolved. Of the complaints reviewed, 16 of them were not investigated in the timeframe required. Seven out of the 10 complaints with more serious allegations were not investigated within the required two days. Two of them were not investigated at all.
Additionally, inspectors closed 18 of the 26 complaints that required corrective actions without confirming if the problems had been resolved. Hoffer said this does not necessarily mean that the owner of the establishment did not address the problem but that the inspectors did not visit the place again to check if they did.
“If you’re calling for a corrective action for a serious problem, you need to make sure that it’s been done and documented, and they were kind of short on that,” Hoffer said.
The audit also found that the Department of Health doesn’t measure the performance of the Food and Lodging program, which is a state requirement. The program is also missing specific policies and procedures for handling complaints.
Hoffer said the auditor’s office will follow up in one year and again in three years to see if the department has implemented their recommendations to improve the program.
The public complaint system evaluated in the audit is just one part of the work carried out by the program, according to Liz Wirsing, the senior program manager for Food and Lodging.
“The report evaluated a small sample of the hundreds of complaints that we receive and follow up on every year, so sometimes other priorities have to take precedence for protecting public health,” Wirsing said.
Still the recommendations are helpful, and the program is already working on implementing them, she said.  
“We appreciate the public reaching out to us and sharing their concern,” Wirsing said, adding that people should continue to file complaints. “It’s important information, and it does help alert us sometimes to things that need some follow-up.”

She is there because of people, she said in her first moments after being formally sworn in as the state’s newest justice. Walsh pledged to be the type of justice all Kansans deserve.
“And that is someone who, with a clear understanding of the legal issues, will faithfully interpret and impartially apply the law to the facts of each unique case, irrespective of popular opinion or political wins, and all while maintaining a humble awareness of each decision’s impact on people and on history,” she said.

Roughly 200 people gathered Friday in the Kansas Supreme Court in the Kansas Judicial Center in Topeka. Family, friends, colleagues, former justices and members of all three branches of government watched as Walsh said her first words from her new chair.
“I’m mindful of the climate and the context in which I am joining this court. This is without a doubt a critical time for the judiciary. But that has always been true,” Walsh said, “and that is because the judicial branch is so critical to our democracy.”
Former Supreme Court Justice Carol Beier and Walsh’s husband, Matt, introduced her to the court, and acting Chief Justice Eric Rosen swore her in. Walsh’s four children helped her shrug on what was once Beier’s robe.
Walsh applied to work for Beier as a fresh graduate of the University of Kansas Law School. Beier said a professor told her Walsh would be “the best hire I ever made.”
Beier was skeptical.
“I thought no new graduate could possibly deliver the performance he promised,” she said. “I have never been so happy to be so wrong.”
Beier added: “Like Athena, born from the head of Zeus, she was fully formed as a discerning intellect and an unusually mature lawyer and adviser.”
Former Kansas Supreme Court Justice Carol Beier speaks at Justice Larkin Walsh’s swearing-in ceremony on Nov. 21, 2025, in Topeka. Beier was a mentor to Walsh, giving her a research attorney position early in her career.
Walsh, the youngest justice on the court, began her duties two months ago after an informal swearing-in ceremony. She succeeded former Justice Evelyn Wilson, who retired in July following a Lou Gehrig’s disease diagnosis.
Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly, who was present at the ceremony, appointed Walsh in August from a slate of three nominees.
In her remarks, Walsh characterized the judicial selection process she endured as rigorous and transparent, a subtle nod to the recent challenges to the state’s merit-based approach. In August 2026, a constitutional amendment will appear on voters’ ballots asking whether they’d like to switch to a popular-vote approach.
Walsh spent the past dozen years in private practice, focusing on civil rights, workers’ rights, consumer protection and complex class actions, according to Kansas Judicial Branch spokesperson Lisa Taylor. Walsh, a Leawood resident, was most recently senior counsel at Stueve Siegel Hanson.
She has worked on at least two class action cases defending victims of sexual abuse. One was against Ohio State University for failing to protect hundreds of male student athletes from Richard Strauss’ systemic abuse. The case rose to the U.S. Supreme Court but wasn’t accepted for review.
She was also part of a Kansas legal team that represented a group of women who in April sued Lawrence Memorial Hospital and the University of Kansas Hospital Authority after a KU physical therapist accessed their medical files, which included images and body measurements. The physical therapist had never treated the women and accessed images for approximately two years without detection, according to court filings. The case is ongoing in federal court, and Walsh withdrew as an attorney in August. Walsh withdrew from the ongoing Ohio case in January 2024.
She is a graduate of Southern Methodist University, majoring in art and English. She is a 2004 graduate of the University of Kansas law school. In addition to her time as a research attorney for Beier, Walsh clerked for U.S. District Judge Carlos Murguia. She served two five-year terms on the Kansas Board of Law Examiners and has been involved with the Kansas Bar Association’s Annual Survey of Law for 20 years, beginning as co-chair and transitioning to editor, a role she still holds.
After one year in office, new justices undergo a retention vote to continue holding a seat on the court. Subsequent retention votes occur every six years.
In public interviews during the judicial selection process, Walsh said she was not a “self-promoter.” She said at the time that ego can hinder effective justice, and she emphasized adherence to law and careful consideration and examination of facts and issues.
Her parents, relatives and friends attended the ceremony, and Matt Walsh thanked many of them, while praising Larkin Walsh for her abilities as a mother, lawyer and new justice.
Matt Walsh and Beier spoke of her positivity, empathy, dignity and humility.
“Larkin knows exactly what court service demands,” Beier said. “She embraces the responsibility and she has crafted a record of achievement and service made to measure.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/PB210135-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-11-21 18:58:40.051120
,Mississippi Today,2025-11-21 23:22:53+00:00,Mississippi Today,Judge grants bail to Louisiana death row prisoner Jimmie Duncan,"Richard A. Webster, Verite News",,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/11/21/louisiana-death-row-prisoner-jimmie-duncan-bail/,"Louisiana death row inmate Jimmie Duncan is closer to freedom after a judge granted bail. Duncan was convicted in killing his ex-girlfriend’s toddler, but the conviction was based partly on bite mark evidence that is now considered junk science.","After more than 25 years on death row in Louisiana, Jimmie Duncan inched one step closer to freedom Friday when Judge Alvin Sharp of the 4th Judicial District in Ouachita Parish granted him bail, setting it at $150,000.
The decision comes nearly seven months after Sharp vacated Duncan’s 1998 first-degree murder conviction for killing his former girlfriend’s 23-month-old daughter, Haley Oliveaux, finding that it was based in part on bite mark evidence now considered by experts to be junk science.
The Ouachita Parish District Attorney’s Office has opposed Duncan’s release, arguing that Duncan is guilty of the murder. But in his bail ruling, Sharp pointed to evidence that the girl, who drowned, was at risk of seizure, meaning she could have died accidentally while in the tub. Sharp also noted the lack of blood or semen at the scene, contradicting the state’s position that Duncan raped Haley. And, he wrote in the ruling, there was a video, not presented at the trial, that Duncan’s legal team has alleged is evidence that — along with being based on debunked science — the bite-mark analysis in the case may have been fabricated.  
The “presumption is not great” that Duncan is guilty, Sharp said.
“This ruling acknowledged the clear and convincing evidence showing that Mr. Duncan is factually innocent,” his attorneys said in a prepared statement. “Although Mr. Duncan’s ordeal is not over, today marks a significant step forward for Mr. Duncan’s complete exoneration.”
His attorneys said they were working to get Duncan out of prison over the weekend. 
This week’s ruling is yet another chapter in a nearly three-decade legal odyssey that has spotlighted Louisiana’s troubling history with wrongful convictions, as well as its long-held reputation as one of the country’s most punitive states.
As ProPublica and Verite News reported in March, Duncan’s conviction was based largely on now discredited bite mark evidence presented by forensic dentist Michael West and pathologist Dr. Steven Hayne, whose longtime partnership as state experts has been questioned following concerns about the validity of their techniques. West and Hayne also worked on several disputed court cases in Mississippi.
Over the past 27 years, nine prisoners have been set free after being convicted in part on inaccurate evidence given by West and Hayne. Three of those men were on death row. Duncan was the last person awaiting an execution based on the pair’s work.
Duncan, 56, has maintained his innocence since first being arrested in 1993 after Haley’s death. In the ensuing years, Haley’s mother, Allison Layton Statham, has come to support Duncan’s release. At Duncan’s first bail hearing in July, Statham testified that she believes Duncan to be innocent and demanded his release from prison.
Efforts to free Duncan have become even more urgent given the state’s recent moves, under conservative Gov. Jeff Landry, to restart executions following a lapse of more than a decade. Louisiana had not carried out a death sentence since 2010 as it has been unable to procure the drugs necessary for an execution. To overcome that obstacle, the state Legislature, at Landry’s urging, recently approved an alternative method: the use of nitrogen gas, a controversial method allowed in only three other states.That opened the door to Louisiana’s first execution in 15 years. And on March 18, the state used nitrogen gas to put Jesse Hoffman Jr. to death. 
To criminal justice reformers, Landry’s execution push is even more concerning given the state’s history in convicting and sentencing to death people later found to be innocent. In the past three decades, the state has exonerated 11 people facing execution, among the highest such numbers in the country, according to The National Registry of Exonerations.
Despite Sharp’s finding in April that Duncan is factually innocent, Ouachita prosecutors continue to insist that Duncan raped and murdered Oliveaux and should be executed without delay. The district attorney’s office, in urging Sharp to keep Duncan locked up, has argued that Duncan is “a safety risk to not only the victim’s family, but also the general public.” The office has appealed the decision to the Louisiana Supreme Court. 
Duncan was arrested Dec. 18, 1993 after he reported finding Haley’s lifeless body floating in the tub of the home he shared with the girl’s mother in West Monroe. Duncan, who was babysitting that night, told authorities he had put the toddler in the tub to take a bath, then went downstairs to wash dishes. When he heard a noise coming from the bathroom, he rushed upstairs to check on her and found Haley floating face down in the water. She was pronounced dead a few hours later.
Prosecutors enlisted the assistance of Hayne, who had worked on hundreds of criminal cases in Mississippi and Louisiana over his decades-long career. Hayne conducted Haley’s medical exam and claimed he found evidence that she was sexually assaulted and intentionally drowned. He also claimed he found bite marks on her body.
Hayne’s frequent partner, West, then analyzed the marks and found that they were a match for Duncan’s teeth. Based in part on those findings, Duncan was charged with first-degree murder. After about two weeks of testimony in 1998, the jury found Duncan guilty and sentenced him to death.
Duncan’s post-conviction attorneys, however, later uncovered a trove of evidence which, they said, proves he is innocent and was wrongfully convicted, the most damning of which calls into question whether the bite marks Hayne said he found on Haley’s body were manufactured.
In a video of West’s 1993 examination of Haley — which was not shown to jurors at the trial — the dentist can be seen taking a mold of Duncan’s teeth and grinding it into the girl’s body. (West has previously said he was simply using what he called a “direct comparison” technique — in which he presses a mold of a person’s teeth directly onto the location of suspected bite marks.)
In his April ruling vacating Duncan’s conviction, Sharp said the work Hayne and West did on Duncan’s case was “no longer valid” and “not scientifically defensible.” Sharp also stated in his ruling that he found “very compelling” the September testimony of an expert medical witness who said that the child’s death was not the result of a homicide but of an accidental drowning. Prior to her death, Haley suffered several head injuries that could have caused seizures resulting in her drowning, according to the testimony.
Robert S. Tew, district attorney for Ouachita and Morehouse parishes, has argued that despite experts now dismissing bite mark evidence as “junk science,” it was an accepted methodology at the time of Duncan’s trial and that some experts still consider it to be valid. He has also noted that Hayne, who died in 2020, served as the pathologist for the district for over a decade and during that time “there has been no cases overturned because of Dr. Hayne’s autopsy.”
Tew’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
An initial bail hearing for Duncan held in July was delayed after prosecutors filed a motion to recuse Sharp, claiming he was biased given his earlier decision to set aside Duncan’s conviction. Sharp declined the request. In an October ruling, the Louisiana Supreme Court rejected the state’s appeal in a 6-1 vote. The court has yet to take up the state’s appeal of Sharp’s decision to set aside Duncan’s conviction.

The Montana Public Service Commission approved the Yellowstone County Generating Station at $246 million — less than the $289 million in additional rate base that NorthWestern Energy wanted.
Customers will pay for the plant.
How the amount will translate on customer bills is in the works, although NorthWestern already implemented increases associated with the rate case, to be adjusted based on a final decision.
Public Service Commission spokesperson Alana Lake said Friday she expects an estimate on customer bills to be available in the next couple of weeks.
This week, the Public Service Commission took action on the rate case, a complex and multipronged application that includes the controversial methane-fired plant outside Laurel.
In a report, staff analysts with the Public Service Commission said NorthWestern Energy built the plant without adequately evaluating more affordable options, it didn’t manage construction in a cost-effective manner, and it failed to show the plant was a prudent investment.
The staff report recommended disallowing nearly $60 million in recoverable costs compared to the amount NorthWestern requested.
However, the Public Service Commission opted to allow roughly $19 million of those costs related to litigation over the state issuing permits for the plant.
Commission Vice President Jennifer Fielder argued the substantial costs associated with litigation included halting construction, mothballing the work in progress and then ramping up again — all because the state failed to issue permits.
Meanwhile, Commissioner Brad Molnar said it would be important to confirm the cost estimate with actual receipts and other evidence.
And Commission President Jeff Welborn said he was torn on the matter, but those costs weren’t the utility’s fault, and it would be appropriate to adjust the final amount based on the evidence staff can find in the record.
Commissioners voted 4-0 to accept recommended staff reductions, except for the ones tied to permit litigation, with Commissioner Annie Bukacek abstaining.
Bukacek abstained from at least one other motion on the rate case, and did not respond to a message asking why.
However, Bukacek also proposed a motion to let NorthWestern recover $16.3 million for a portion of change orders, the ones associated with the utility switching contractors.
Bukacek argued NorthWestern had shown no evidence of “nefarious motives” nor had it “committed any crimes,” and she questioned whether it was reasonable to penalize the company for trying to do the best for customers.
Fielder joined Bukacek in support of the motion, but it failed, with PSC President Jeff Welborn joining Commissioners Molnar and Randy Pinocci in opposing it.
In a statement, Welborn said the outcome represents a balanced approach to regulation.
It means the Yellowstone County Generating Station will provide “critical capacity” in the winter, and it also represents savings for customers, the Public Service Commission said.
“The Commission’s responsibility is to strike the right balance — ensuring utilities remain capable of delivering safe and reliable service while protecting customers from paying more than what is just and reasonable,” Welborn said. “This decision, and the $43 million in savings for customers, demonstrates the value of a thorough public process and the dedication of our staff.”
A news release from the Public Service Commission said customers can expect reductions based on current rates — $111.58 for residential customers, according to the utility — because NorthWestern implemented its own “significantly higher rates” in May 2025.
The monopoly utility did so in a move that was legal but rare, according to the Public Service Commission; it took advantage of a statute that allows a utility to impose a new rate after an application has been pending for nine months.
The Public Service Commission staff will incorporate the decisions commissioners made at their meeting into a final order to be reviewed before Dec. 24, 2025, Lake said.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Methane-Plant-1.1-1-1024x767.jpg,,,2025-11-21 18:58:40.051120

(Photo by Sara Wilson/Colorado Newsline)A group of Black elected officials and leaders condemned recent efforts to dismantle practices and programs related to supporting marginalized groups in Colorado, reaffirming their commitment to furthering DEI in the state as the federal government rails against such efforts.
“It is crucial that we confront the harsh realities that persist in treatment of Black individuals,” state Rep. Regina English, a Colorado Springs Democrat, said during a press conference Friday at the state Capitol. “I want to send a clear message to Donald Trump and any other universities, colleges and organizations that will follow his lead — that we will not stand by and allow you to dismiss the voices of Black people.”
She was joined by other elected officials including state Senate President James Coleman, a Denver Democrat, state Rep. Junie Joseph, a Boulder Democrat, University of Colorado Regent Wanda James and former Colorado House Speaker Terrance Carroll.

Since returning to office this year, President Donald Trump has led a far-reaching effort to eliminate programs that support DEI — the abbreviation for diversity, equity and inclusion — including pulling hundreds of millions of dollars in research funding from schools and signing executive orders banning DEI-related work in the government.
“DEI is not just a slogan. It is a commitment to ensuring that every person, no matter their background, has a fair chance to contribute, to succeed and to belong,” Joseph said.
English and others specifically pointed to the University of Denver’s move in August to roll back DEI initiatives, including certain scholarships, spaces designed for specific identity groups and DEI training. The change followed a U.S. Department of Justice memo that defined DEI work as unlawful discrimination at schools, like DU, that receive federal funding. The university had not received direct outreach from the Trump administration about its DEI programming.










DEI is not just a slogan. It is a commitment to ensuring that every person, no matter their background, has a fair chance to contribute, to succeed and to belong.


– State Rep. Junie Joseph


The university maintains that it still has systems in place to foster a welcoming environment for all of its students and faculties.
“The work of fostering inclusion at colleges and universities has never been more complex or more vital than it is currently,” the school’s Vice Chancellor of Community Support and Engagement Christopher Whitt wrote in an opinion piece published by the Denver Post last week. “While the changes we have made at DU have not been easy, we are dedicated to continuing to partner with members of our community as the division thoughtfully forges a new path forward for inclusiveness for every student, faculty, and staff member.”

Other Colorado colleges also made changes in response to pressure from the Trump administration and new federal guidelines this year, such as changing language on websites and renaming offices.
“When institutions like DU bow down without being asked to, it sends a message,” said Alli Jackson, a DU alum who was recently elected to Aurora’s city council. “DEI is about inclusion. It is not about exclusion, and a lot of our population needs to be re-educated on that.”
English sponsored a successful bill during this year’s regular legislative session for the state to adopt education standards for Black history in public schools. She said she plans to introduce legislation related to Black maternal health next year, though the framework is still being worked out with stakeholders. She said she wants the messaging and education around the topic to be more comprehensive for health workers.
The Legislature should also “make sure that we are creating inclusive policies, policies that don’t have unintended consequences, especially if they’re not policies that are being run by people of color,” English said.
Additionally, a panel created by the Legislature in 2024 is overseeing a comprehensive study on how systemic racial discrimination in Colorado has impacted Black Coloradans.

(Photo by Tess Vrbin/Arkansas Advocate)Arkansas lawmakers returned an amended contract between the state’s child welfare agency and a California-based company to the subcommittee that previously reviewed it after a state representative raised concerns about the company’s stance on health care for transgender youth.
The Arkansas Legislative Council approved 23 amended out-of-state contracts Friday but sent one back to the Review subcommittee, which advanced all the contracts Tuesday.
Evident Change, a data-driven nonprofit that aims to improve social systems, provides “professional consulting services” to the Division of Children and Family Services within the Arkansas Department of Human Services, according to documents provided to the council.
The state’s business relationship with Evident Change goes back to 2018, DCFS director Tiffany Wright told the council. In its efforts to reduce the number of children in foster care, DCFS has worked with the nonprofit to train staff to better assess risk and safety and manage safety concerns.
Lawmakers are considering a $375,000 amendment to an existing contract with Evident Change that would bring the total authorized amount above $4.2 million, according to legislative documents. The money would pay for additions to Evident Change’s scope of work and performance indicators.
The work in question includes screening calls to the state Child Abuse Hotline, calibrating the hotline’s structured decision-making tool and coaching child abuse investigators, Wright said in response to questions from Rep. Ryan Rose, R-Van Buren.
State to change its child abuse and neglect referral system, partners with nonprofit

West Virginia contracted with Evident Change last year to utilize the structured decision-making tool for its own child welfare system.
Rose asked Wright if she was aware that Evident Change “publicly posted articles and argued that in Texas, gender transition surgeries, hormone therapies, et cetera for minors should not be treated or investigated as child abuse.”
Wright said she was not aware of this. Rose said the articles have been removed from Evident Change’s website.
In 2022, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott ordered the state’s Department of Family and Protective Services to launch child abuse investigations into parents who allow their transgender children to receive gender-affirming medical care. In 2024, an appeals court upheld a lower court’s decision to block the state from enforcing the order.
Rose said he had “real concerns” about DCFS working with Evident Change “because their decisions affect real families here in Arkansas.”
“There is a very definite contradiction between their public opinions and the law that we have established here,” Rose said.
The law in question is the Save Adolescents From Experimentation (SAFE) Act, or Act 626 of 2021. The law banned puberty blockers, hormones and gender-affirming surgeries for Arkansas children with gender dysphoria. Four families of transgender minors challenged the law, and U.S. District Judge James Moody blocked it in July 2021 before it could go into effect.
The law was the first of its kind to go to trial. In June 2023, several months after the eight-day trial, Moody ruled the law was unconstitutional on First and Fourteenth Amendment grounds.

Appeals court upholds Arkansas’ ban on transgender minors’ health care after SCOTUS ruling


An 8-2 ruling from a federal appeals court in August lifted Moody’s injunction and cleared the way for the SAFE Act to be enforced four years after becoming law. The ruling came after the U.S. Supreme Court’s June decision to uphold Tennessee’s similar law, which had also been blocked by a federal judge.
Rose was not yet in the Legislature in 2021, but he voted for the Protecting Minors from Medical Malpractice Act of 2023, which allowed private enforcement of the SAFE Act. The law created a 15-year window for adults to sue physicians for “any physical, psychological, emotional, or physiological injury” incurred while the adult received hormone replacement therapy, puberty blockers or gender-affirming surgeries as a minor.
Two Arkansas Children’s Hospital physicians testified at the SAFE Act trial in 2022 that they do not perform breast or genital surgeries on transgender minors or refer them for such procedures elsewhere.
Rose also voted for an amendment to that law this year that added mental health care providers to the law’s list of medical professionals liable for “gender-affirming intervention.”
He said Friday that Arkansas law “is clear” that gender-affirming medical treatments “constitute [child] abuse.” The SAFE Act, the Protecting Minors from Medical Malpractice Act and its amendment do not mention the word “abuse.”
In response to Rose’s questions, Wright said DCFS does not have a way of ensuring that Evident Change’s tools and assessments are “unbiased.”
The Legislative Council’s Review subcommittee did not discuss the Evident Change contract before advancing it Tuesday. Advancement did not require a vote, but the full council voted with some dissent to send the amended contract back to the subcommittee, which will meet again Dec. 16.
Evident Change has worked with the Annie E. Casey Foundation, whose annual reports on child wellbeing indicators continually rank Arkansas as one of the worst states for children.

Advanced Micro Targeting of Dallas, Texas, was hired by a PAC called People Not Politicians to help collect the signatures needed to put Missouri’s new congressional map on the 2026 ballot. In a lawsuit filed Nov. 11 in Missouri’s Western District U.S. Court, the company alleges four consulting firms are involved in an effort to pay signatures gatherers to abandon their work, turn over signatures and badmouth their employer.
The lawsuit says the defendants have “poached” 28 employees and illegally obtained proprietary information about workers and petition strategy. 
U.S. District Judge Greg Kays on Monday denied the company’s request for a temporary restraining order, stating the company had not proved “irreparable harm” that could not be compensated later. In response, the Advanced Micro Targeting filed an amended complaint, elaborating on the issues the activities of the four defendants are causing for the signature effort.
The defendants, the lawsuit states, are engaged in “an intentional and malicious effort to interfere with AMT’s operations in Missouri…”
According to campaign finance reports, Advanced Micro Targeting had been paid $1.1 million through Sept. 30 to collect signatures for the referendum. The company previously worked in Missouri on the drives to put abortion legalization and an increased minimum wage on the November 2024 ballot.
It is the first time since the company was established in 2007 that it has taken competitors to court, said Billy Rogers, company founder and president 
“This was so egregious,” Rogers said. “We’ve never seen anything like this.”
The Advanced Micro Targeting lawsuit bases its claims on federal law protecting trade secrets and common law protections against defamation. But some of the accusations, if true, could violate the Missouri Uniform Trade Secrets Act, while others may violate the Missouri Merchandising Practices Act. 
Republican Attorney General Catherine Hanaway’s office did not respond to The Independent when asked for comment on the allegations. The only public mentions of Advanced Micro Targeting from Hanaway came in two posts on social media accusing the company of violating the law.
In one, she said her office was investigating the company for employing undocumented immigrants “in their efforts to undermine the will of the people’s elected representatives.”
In the other, Hanaway said she had asked Immigrations and Customs Enforcement to investigate whether the company was “creating an environment for exploitation and human trafficking to thrive.”
Hanaway’s office did not respond to questions about the source of her information or why she deemed it to be credible.
Rogers said no one from the attorney general’s office has contacted him or his company to discuss the accusations. Every person being paid by his company to collect signatures, he said, is a direct employee — and every employee is a legal worker checked through the federal E-verify system.
“If we hear from the attorney general’s office or any other government agency, they want to take a look at our employee records and talk to us about our process, we’d be glad to talk to them,” Rogers said. “We do it right. We follow the law.”
Hanaway’s posts are an attempt at intimidation, said Richard von Glahn, director of People Not Politicians. She should know that the company verifies that its workers are eligible for employment, he said.
“The fact that she doesn’t know that shows that she conducted zero investigation and just put out the tweet, which continues the effort by opponents of the referendum to try to confuse and mislead voters as to what’s going on,” he said.
Dark money groups pour cash into fight over gerrymandered Missouri congressional map

Republicans muscled the gerrymandering plan past Democratic opposition during a September special session. Using the new map, Republicans hope to win seven of the state’s eight congressional seats by adding enough GOP votes to flip the 5th District, currently held by Democratic U.S. Rep. Emanuel Cleaver of Kansas City.
The lawsuit is a new layer of litigation related to the congressional map. 
There are at least eight cases currently underway, not all of which will be completed before the Dec. 11 deadline to turn in petition signatures. The next court hearing is Tuesday in St. Louis, where a federal judge will hear arguments over the constitutionality of a referendum on congressional district plans.
The Advanced Micro Targeting lawsuit names as defendants Let the Voters Decide of Celebration, Florida, and Vortex Elite LLC, of Miami, Florida; Synergy Wise Solutions, which has no website that could be found and lists an address that is a Pakmail storefront in Tucson, Arizona; and Onest Marketing, which also does not have a website that could be found and lists an address in an apartment building on the ocean in Miami, Florida.
The defendants, according to the lawsuit, obtained a confidential list of employees that included productivity rankings.
“Defendants are offering the employees on this confidential list huge sums of money (some were offered up to $30,000) to resign their employment with AMT and provide ‘intelligence gathering’ services for defendants,” the lawsuit states.
Each person hired by the company signs an agreement not to work for a competitor for a year after leaving Advanced Micro Targeting and not to try to hire employees away from the company.
In a statement issued through a communications consultant, Let the Voters Decide called the case a “bogus lawsuit” and cited Hanaway’s social media posts as evidence of bad practices.
“We will defend our company aggressively against AMT’s absurd claims,” the company said. “And anyone who reports or reads these claims really ought to consider the source.”
Vortex Elite did not respond to an email seeking comment. There were no contacts found for the other two defendants and none have lawyers listed for their defense.
The petition drive needs about 110,000 signatures spread across six of the state’s eight congressional districts to force a referendum. In its most recent update, People Not Politicians said it has gathered more than 200,000 signatures.
Von Glahn said the campaign will stop issuing updates as the deadline approaches. 
Most of the signature gatherers passing petitions are volunteers, von Glahn said. The efforts to divert signature gatherers from the task has been felt among volunteers as well, he said.
One volunteer in Columbia reported being offered $1,000 for a backpack of signed petition sheets, he said. Others have been approached by people seeking to sign for a relative or when they are not registered, both violations of state campaign law, he said.
“We’re going to continue together, even in the face of these clearly desperate attempts to keep this from reaching the ballot,” von Glahn said. “The interesting thing about all of the opposition tactics is they are not preparing to defend the map at the ballot. They are desperately seeking to keep it from going to a vote.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/091025_rally3-1024x615.jpg,,,2025-11-21 17:59:23.240797

(Photo by Greg LaRose/Louisiana Illuminator)A Louisiana Supreme Court justice, who requested that all of his divorce records be kept private for several months, is one step closer to a lifetime appointment as a federal judge. 
The U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday recommended Justice Will Crain for a seat on the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana based in New Orleans. The full U.S. Senate still has to confirm him before he can take the job.  

Crain, a Madisonville resident, has been on the Louisiana Supreme Court since 2020 and previously worked as a state appellate and district court judge. He also spent two decades as a practicing attorney in St. Tammany Parish. 

The justice placed his divorce proceedings and documents under court seal for most of the year before President Donald Trump announced Crain’s nomination to the federal bench Oct. 20.. This meant that no one besides Crain, his ex-wife, their attorneys, the judge presiding over their case and court staff had the right to access to his divorce records and proceedings for several months. 
Crain could not be reached for comment Friday afternoon on his cellphone. 

His divorce attorney, Ross Lagarde, has said the divorce seal was necessary to ensure the justice’s personal safety. The seal was in place for 11 months until August. It was lifted after after a reporter asked Lagarde why the documents weren’t publicly available.  
Judge William “Billy” Burris, of Louisiana’s 22nd Judicial District Court, granted the seal for Crain’s divorce records based on a state law that wasn’t in effect at the time, according to court documents released after the seal was lifted. 

A new state law allowing judges to keep their divorce records private was passed in June 2024, but didn’t go into effect until February 2025. Yet Lagarde cited the law as the justification in his request to seal Crain’s divorce records in September 2024, five months before the law became active. 
Burris, who also oversaw the rest of Crain’s divorce case, is now one of several Republican candidates running for the Louisiana Supreme Court seat that would be vacated by Crain if he becomes a federal judge. Burris could not be reached for comment Friday at his office. 
Crain is dating his former law clerk at the Supreme Court, Julie Eldridge, who filed for divorce from her ex-husband about a month before Crain filed. Infidelity was not mentioned in either of Crain or Eldridge’s divorce records.",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Crain-Red-Mass-2-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-21 17:59:23.240797

(Photo by Tyler Kaufman/Getty Images)The LSU Board of Supervisors’ vote Friday to intervene in the firing of former football coach Brian Kelly is its latest move to give members more power over day-to-day operations at the university.
The board held a special meeting Friday to authorize President Wade Rousse, who just started in the job this week, to review and, if appropriate, send a written termination notice to Kelly. It’s the university’s first response to a lawsuit Kelly filed seeking the full $54 million buyout he’s owed. The only way LSU can get out of paying him is by firing him for cause, which the university has not publicly indicated it will do. 
The vote also sets a precedent about the degree to which the LSU System’s governing board, mostly made up of allies to Gov. Jeff Landry, will be involved in hiring and firing coaches. 
In a statement after the meeting, LSU spokesman Zach Labbé said the board’s bylaws require them to take action on any personnel action related to a coach with a salary over $250,000. 
Historically, the board has not followed this bylaw. Ex-football coach Ed Orgeron was fired without the board authorizing his termination, as have a number of other coaches. Most recently, offensive coordinator Joe Sloan was fired just days after Kelly. Despite being paid more than $250,000, the board has yet to take action on his termination, which raises the question of whether he was officially fired. 
If the board continues on the path it set Friday, it would amount to a significant escalation in its day-to-day management of athletics. 
The move also raises questions as to why the board has approved contracts that include language that violates its bylaws. It has regularly approved coaching contracts, including Kelly’s, that allow the president to act for the university in firing a coach. 
LSU Board Chairman Scott Ballard and Labbé have not yet responded to questions as to the status of Sloan’s termination, why the board has not followed its bylaws for previous firings and contract approvals. John Carmouche, who chairs the board’s athletics subcommittee, also did not respond immediately to a call requesting comment. 
The current iteration of the board has been more interested in directly managing the university’s operations than previous ones. 
Following his inauguration in 2024, Landry, a staunch conservative Republican, appointed new members to join appointees of former Democratic Gov. John Bel Edwards, several of whom had swapped their allegiances to Landry. 
Among the first moves of the Landry-aligned board was to give itself the power to appoint members to any hiring search committee. Taken to its extreme, the new rule would allow the chair to stack any search panel, from a new professor to a football coach, and steer it to a preferred outcome.
The board later rolled back this new power to only apply to searches for high-level administrators, such as the president, chancellor, vice presidents and deans. Though Ballard no longer had the power to force members onto the search committee for Kelly’s replacement, he and Carmouche were appointed to the coaching search committee. 
Board members have also independently sought to influence hirings and firings throughout the system. 
Most notably, Esperanza Moran openly rallied to oust LSU Health Shreveport Chancellor David Guzick, who later resigned. 
Vice Chairman Lee Mallett made an early endorsement of Rousse just days after President William Tate announced his departure from LSU. Mallett’s support was key in influencing Rousse’s hiring.

The name, 7-OH, is short for 7-hydroxymitragynine, and it’s made by chemically converting the main opioid-inducing element in kratom. 7-OH is sold as gummies, candies, imitation ice cream cones, liquid shots, tablets and powders. People can buy 7-OH products in Missouri smoke shops, gas stations, convenience stores and online shops. 
Hanaway on Thursday announced her office had issued “civil investigative demand” letters, which are essentially subpoenas, to six companies that represent the “major points of sale” for both 7-OH and regular kratom products. The letters mandate the company to hand over multiple types of documents, including lab test results, research on health risks and safety label information.
Consumers, Hanaway said in a press release, “may be exposed to unapproved, unsafe and deceptively marketed opioid-like drugs.”
According to the letters sent to each company, the attorney general’s investigation targets the distribution of products containing 7-OH or “any part of the plant Mitragyna speciosa,” which is the kratom plant.
“We are deeply concerned,” she said, “that Missourians are being sold drug-like substances under the guise of harmless supplements, with no FDA approval, no safety testing, and in some cases no meaningful disclosure of what these products actually contain.” 
Missouri warns consumers of health risks associated with 7-OH products

The Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services issued a health advisory last month warning consumers of potential health risks it says are associated with 7-OH. 
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration sent warning letters in June to six manufacturers of 7-OH, and federal action is still pending. The companies the FDA targeted are different from the ones Hanaway is investigating, except for one.
Kansas-City-based Shaman Botanicals LLC — the leading supplier of 7-OH in Missouri — received letters from both the FDA and Hanaway.
The company’s owner, Vince Sanders, has said Shaman was the first company to make 7-OH products. 
Sanders replied to the FDA’s questions about the company’s products in August, told The Independent Friday, and has not yet heard back from the federal agency. The FDA warning has not stopped the company’s production, which he said is higher than ever.
The company’s response to the FDA warning letter included 300 pages of expert testimony and 200 pages of legal opinion, he said.
“I’ve got seven of the world’s experts on there that wrote letters that are saying, ‘Listen, you guys are completely wrong. Here’s the science, here’s the facts,’” Sanders said.
He plans on providing the same information to Hanaway, he said. Sanders’ other Kansas City company, CBD American Shaman LLC, also received a letter from Hanaway.
CBD Kratom, the largest kratom retailer in the country, was also among the recipients, along with St. Louis-area companies Green Dragon CBD, Emporium Smoke Shop and Moonlight Smoke Shop. 
CBD Kratom issued a statement Friday saying the company plans on taking the attorney general’s process seriously and “welcome any opportunity to demonstrate the strength of our safety standards, compliance practices, and long-standing commitment to consumer education.” 
CBD Kratom does not manufacture or sell 7-OH products, according to the company’s statement, and its leaders believe the investigation’s scope is “unusually broad.” 
The company pointed to the FDA’s distinction this summer between natural kratom and 7-OH. 
In a July press release announcing the FDA’s warning letters, the agency stated: “While 7-OH occurs naturally in trace amounts in kratom, the agency’s letters focus on concentrated 7-OH products such as tablets, gummies, drink mixes, and shots, which may be dangerous.”
Kratom leaves come from a tropical tree found in Southeast Asia, and they can be crushed and then smoked, brewed with tea, or placed into gel capsules.
The leaves contain an alkaloid called mitragynine. During digestion, the body converts it into 7-OH in small amounts. It’s what gives people the opioid-like effect.
The products the FDA is targeting contain a highly concentrated amount of 7-OH by taking mitragynine and chemically oxidizing it. 
The way that 7-OH is being marketed as kratom is what has the FDA and some medical experts concerned. 
Sanders argues his product is superior to most kratom products and shouldn’t be taken off the market. 
“We clearly have a better product,” he said. “Consumers voted with their dollar.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_2302-e1755617763363.jpg,,,2025-11-21 17:59:23.240797

Yaw/U.S. Coast Guard)The Trump administration on Thursday released a plan for offshore oil and gas leasing that would open up almost all Alaska marine waters to development, along with the entire Pacific coast and the Gulf of Mexico.
The Alaska portion of the plan proposes 21 lease sales through 2031, five of them in Cook Inlet, two in the Beaufort Sea, two in the Chukchi Sea and the others in other marine areas. Those include a lease sale in a newly designated “High Arctic” area that lies beyond the 200-nautical-mile exclusive economic zone and where U.S. territorial rights are not yet clear.
The only federal Alaska offshore area without a proposed lease sale is the North Aleutian Basin, where oil leasing is under an indefinite ban to protect salmon-rich Bristol Bay.
The new plan, which also proposes six oil lease sales off the U.S. West Coast and seven in the Gulf of Mexico, is similar to an offshore leasing plan proposed by the Trump administration in 2017.
In a statement, the Department of the Interior called the plan “a major step to boosting United States energy independence.”
“Offshore oil and gas production does not happen overnight. It takes years of planning, investment, and hard work before barrels reach the market,” Interior Secretary Doug Burgum said in the statement. “The Biden administration slammed the brakes on offshore oil and gas leasing and crippled the long-term pipeline of America’s offshore production. By moving forward with the development of a robust, forward-thinking leasing plan, we are ensuring that America’s offshore industry stays strong, our workers stay employed, and our nation remains energy dominant for decades to come.” 
Gov. Mike Dunleavy, a supporter of President Donald Trump, hailed the plan.
“Once again, the Trump Administration is leading the way to American energy dominance by restoring confidence in the federal government’s offshore leasing policies. Alaska has tremendous offshore oil and gas reserves that can power our economy for decades,” Dunleavy said in a post on the social media site X.
Another pro-drilling and pro-Trump Alaska public official, Sen. Dan Sullivan, R-Alaska, had a more muted response.
Sullivan, in a statement, said Burgum on Thursday “committed to me that DOI will continue to carefully listen to Alaskans throughout this process, particularly Alaska Native communities who live near the proposed leasing areas, including our whaling captains who bring generations of experience and deep knowledge of the Arctic Ocean.”
“It’s important for Alaskans to know that this draft proposal is not a final decision or a directive that any particular offshore lease sale will occur. Before any potential proposal is finalized, there will be multiple opportunities for public comment, environmental review, and additional analysis. As my office reviews the proposal, I will work to ensure that we are weighing in and amplifying Alaskan voices and views,” Sullivan continued.
Others expressed anger about the plan.

	Rep. Jared Huffman, D-California, was among a group of mostly California Democrats in Congress who blasted it during a news conference Thursday.
“We are here because President Trump just put out what we believe is an asinine pro-polluter plan to open up our coast to offshore drilling,” Huffman said. 
It is “not just a little bit of offshore drilling,” he said, but the entire California coast, the eastern Gulf of Mexico where residents have long opposed offshore drilling, and “every inch of Alaska.”  Huffman is the ranking Democrat on the House Natural Resources Committee.
Environmentalists singled out the proposed Arctic lease sales in particular.
“Drilling anywhere in the Arctic Ocean is completely irresponsible. It is remote, ice-filled, stormy, home to irreplaceable wildlife and subsistence traditions. There is no way to clean up oil spills in this environment, and they are inevitable,” Erik Grafe, an attorney for the environmental law firm Earthjustice, said in an emailed statement.
Additionally, Grafe said, leasing in the Chukchi and Beaufort Seas is unlawful.
“Those areas have been withdrawn from future leasing by Presidents Obama and Biden, and though President Trump has purported to reverse these withdrawals, he lacks that authority.  Only Congress can open them up again,” he said.
That finding was the result of an environmental lawsuit that Grafe represented. In 2019, Alaska-based U.S. District Court Judge Sharon Gleason ruled that Trump was barred from undoing Obama administration protections for Arctic and East Coast waters.  
A new lawsuit filed in February by many of the same plaintiffs addresses that issue again. The new lawsuit, also with Grafe as one of the plaintiff attorneys, targets Trump’s Inauguration Day executive actions that aimed to open wide swaths of territory to drilling and other development, including the Arctic Ocean.
Another pending legal question concerns whether the federal government has the right to sell leases in the area designated as the High Arctic. That area, part of the North American extended outer continental shelf, lies beyond the 200-nautical-mile U.S. exclusive economic zone. The Biden administration made a territorial claim to the area, which is larger than California. But the claim has yet to be confirmed. The U.S. is not a party to the United National Convention on the Law of the Sea, and that international treaty is used to adjudicate nations’ territorial claims in the outer continental shelf.
The idea of leasing most of the non-Arctic areas off Alaska’s coastline also got a poor reception on Thursday.
Anticipating the new Trump administration plan, a coalition of Alaska Native tribal governments in June sent a letter to Burgum expressing longstanding opposition to Bering Sea oil leasing.
The letter asked Burgum to drop all plans for selling leasing in areas from the Aleutian Islands to the Bering Strait.
“We, the Central Yup’ik, St. Lawrence Island Yupik, and Inupiaq people, have been here since time immemorial. Because we spend so much time out on the Bering Sea fishing and hunting, the sea is just as important to us as the land. The Tribes that still rely on these waters to hunt and fish remain unified in protecting these waters. Our people have been clear: the planning areas in our region should not be made available for oil and gas leasing,” said the letter, which was from the Association of Village Council Presidents, Nome-based Kawerak, Inc. and the Bering Sea Elders Group.
Kawerak, Inc. referred to that June letter Thursday to express its reaction to the new leasing plan.

	The tribal organizations have been the forces behind establishment of the Northern Bering Sea Climate Resilience Area during the Obama administration. The designation barred oil leasing and bottom trawling, addressed some shipping safety concerns and established a system for more tribal control.
The first Trump administration abolished the designation; President Joe Biden, in an Inauguration Day executive action, revived it. Trump, on the first day of his second term, abolished the protections again.
A spokesperson for the Department of the Interior said Friday that the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, the agency that manages offshore energy activity, will do further evaluation before settling on a final leasing plan.
“The First Proposal is the first of three required steps before the Secretary can finalize the 11th Program. BOEM is including these areas now to meet legal requirements, conduct further analysis, gather public and industry input, and ensure the Secretary can fully evaluate all options before deciding what areas to include in the final program,” Alyse Sharpe, a senior public affairs specialist, said by email.
Huffman, at the Democrats’ news conference, said the public is likely to mobilize nationally against the plan and that his colleagues will work to prevent it from being implemented.
That includes the proposed Arctic and Bering Sea lease sales, which he called “incredibly reckless.”
“We know what the seafood economy means to the state of Alaska. And we know what happened with the Exxon Valdez,’ he said, referring to the 1989 oil spill disaster in Prince William Sound.
“I’m a Californian, but I will fight to protect Alaska’s coast and Alaska’s fisheries as well,” he added.
Eight years ago, when the first Trump administration released a similar plan for oil leasing in almost all areas of federal waters off Alaska, the idea was widely panned in the state.
While political leaders supported leasing in Cook Inlet and the Beaufort and the Chukchi Seas, they objected to the idea of leasing other areas.
Among the groups objecting was the North Pacific Fishery Management Council, which manages commercial seafood harvests in Alaska’s federal waters. The council, citing “the substantial risk to the sustainable management of Alaska’s fisheries,” asked then-Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke to drop all the Bering Sea, Aleutian and Gulf of Alaska lease sales from the plan.
Then-Gov. Bill Walker and the all-Republican congressional delegation made similar requests to Zinke, asking him to focus the plan on Cook Inlet and the Beaufort and Chukchi Seas, while retaining longstanding buffers to protect whales and other subsistence resources. The Alaska Legislature passed a resolution with a similar request.
The first Trump administration’s expansive leasing plan never went into effect.
Gleason’s 2019 decision froze action on that leasing plan, and the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, the Interior agency that manages offshore oil and gas leasing, continued to work under the Obama administration’s 2017-2022 five-year plan. In 2023, the Biden administration released a five-year leasing plan for 2024 through 2029 that was limited to three Gulf of Mexico lease sales.
There has never been any oil produced from federal waters off Alaska except for a small portion of the Hilcorp-operated Northstar field in the Beaufort Sea, which lies mostly on state leases close to shore. The last federal offshore lease sale held in Alaska, a Cook Inlet sale held at the end of 2022, drew only one bid.

(Photo by Zoe Schacht/Colorado Newsline) Officials from across Colorado’s political spectrum are urging Gov. Jared Polis to deny a request from President Donald Trump’s administration to transfer former Mesa County clerk Tina Peters from state prison to federal custody.
The Colorado Department of Corrections said last week that it had received a formal request on Nov. 12 from the Federal Bureau of Prisons seeking the transfer of Peters, who is serving a nine-year prison sentence for her role in a breach of her office’s election systems, part of an attempt to find evidence of voter fraud in the 2020 presidential election. The request came amid mounting pressure from Trump, U.S. Pardon Attorney Ed Martin and other far-right figures in the election conspiracy theory movement who have called for Peters’ release.
In a letter to Polis on Friday, the Colorado County Clerks Association warned that agreeing to the request “would send a deeply damaging message” to the local officials who oversee elections in the state’s 64 counties.

“We are deeply concerned that, if transferred, Ms. Peters would continue disseminating the same false narratives that have already endangered clerks throughout Colorado and across the country,” the clerks wrote. “Her pattern of knowingly repeating false claims, long after they were disproven, has fueled harassment, threats, and intimidation against the very officials who protected the integrity of our elections.”
“The risks to these public servants would only grow if she were allowed to use a new legal narrative to further these falsehoods,” the letter adds.
Peters is serving her sentence in a state prison in Pueblo after being convicted of multiple felony counts in connection with her role in breaching Mesa County’s elections systems during a 2021 software security update. Calls for her release by far-right figures have intensified this month following the sweeping pardons that Trump granted to dozens of people involved in attempts to overturn the results of the 2020 election through “fake electors” schemes and other means.
Claims that the 2020 election was fraudulent or compromised have been debunked by elections officials, experts, media investigations, law enforcement, the courts and Trump’s own campaign and administration officials.










We are deeply concerned that, if transferred, Ms. Peters would continue disseminating the same false narratives that have already endangered clerks throughout Colorado and across the country.


– Letter from Colorado County Clerks Association


The clerks association, made up of Democratic, Republican and unaffiliated officials, called on Polis to show “courage” in denying the request, and asked to meet personally with the governor before he makes his decision.
“We expect that you will meet personally with Colorado’s clerks before any final decision is made,” the clerks wrote to Polis. “This personal meeting is crucial to ensure that the voices of those who bore the brunt of these events are fully heard.”
Asked about the clerks’ request, a spokesperson for Polis didn’t provide comment for this story before publication.
Violation of public trust
Trump does not have the power to pardon Peters, who was convicted on state charges. The formal BOP request reportedly came at the direction of the Office of Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche. A partially redacted copy of the email shared by far-right media outlets, which Newsline has not independently verified, showed an unidentified DOJ official ordering the BOP to “explore any and all avenues within BOP’s authority to seek and request” Peters’ transfer to a federal facility. In a Nov. 10 interview with longtime Trump ally Steve Bannon, Martin said that the transfer request would “put the right kind of pressure on” state officials.
Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser, a Democrat, and Mesa County District Attorney Dan Rubinstein, a Republican who prosecuted the Peters case, have also urged Polis to deny the BOP request. In a joint letter Thursday, they emphasized that Peters’ prosecution was supported by all three of Mesa County’s Republican commissioners and that she was indicted and convicted by juries of her peers, from a community “long recognized for its deep conservative values.”
“Put simply, Ms. Peters is in prison today due to the crimes she committed that put Mesa’s election systems at risk and violated the public’s trust, and for no other reason,” Weiser and Rubinstein wrote. “Her prosecution and sentencing were done with the utmost professionalism and respect for the rule of law, demonstrating how our criminal justice system should always work.”
The outcome of Peters’ transfer to federal custody, the letter adds, would be at best to circumvent Colorado’s criminal justice system in order to give her “preferential treatment,” and at worst to aid her “unauthorized or illegal release.”
“The State of Colorado should not be complicit in either such arrangement,” said Weiser and Rubinstein. “Failing to meet that principle will further strain confidence in our judicial process and embolden those lawbreakers that believe they can evade justice through political connections and pressure.”

The Iowa Grain Indemnity Fund is supported by farmers who pay a per-bushel fee into the fund when it is below its lower boundary, which the Legislature raised this year to $8 million. The fund was depleted in 2023 due to the bankruptcy of a large dealer, but the Grain Indemnity Fund Board stopped collecting the fees in September this year. 
A spokesperson with IDALS said the fund is currently at $12.6 million and the department does not anticipate that indemnity payments resulting from the Hansen-Mueller bankruptcy will result in the board reinstating grain indemnity fees. 
According to Chapter 11 bankruptcy filings for Hansen-Mueller, none of its 20 largest unsecured claims were with Iowa companies. Some of the top claims include one for more than $4.6 million with Viterra Canada Inc., a more than $2.5 million claim with Cargill in Minnesota and just over $2 million to Beloit, Kansas-based Agmark LLC. 
Hansen-Mueller had its grain dealer license revoked in Nebraska earlier this year, according to reporting from Nebraska Public Radio, when the company failed to make payments to producers. 
The company later made the payments and its license was reinstated by the state licensing agency in early November. 
According to a press release from the company, it intends to continue operations under the supervision of the bankruptcy court and “meet obligations” to employees and suppliers while the sale of its assets is finalized. 
Hansen-Mueller, according to its website, had locations in 10 states, including Iowa. The company had elevators in Sioux City and Council Bluffs. 
Iowa farmers with unpaid grain sold to Hansen-Mueller before Nov. 17, 2025, have until March 17, 2026 to file a claim with the state grain indemnity board. 
Claims must be made in writing and mailed to IDALS Grain Warehouse Bureau. More instructions are available online.

(Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — An Oklahoma law affecting transgender students’ use of public school bathrooms came before a three-judge panel Thursday in the U.S. Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals.
Senate Bill 615, signed into law in 2022, requires individuals to use multi-stall school bathrooms and locker rooms that align with their biological sex, not their gender identity. A single-use bathroom also must be made available. 
Oral arguments on behalf of three transgender students challenging the law contended an Oklahoma City federal judge was wrong to dismiss their lawsuit without further considering the case. The plaintiffs, led by then-Noble High School student Andrew Bridge, filed the lawsuit in 2022, arguing SB 615 violates Title IX and the U.S. Constitution’s Equal Protection Clause.
U.S. District Judge Jodi W. Dishman dismissed the lawsuit with prejudice in March 2024, meaning she found the case to be without merit and decided it cannot be refiled.
The plaintiffs then appealed the dismissal to the Tenth Circuit, based in Denver.
The plaintiffs’ attorney, Robert Gianchetti of Covington & Burling LLP, said his clients present a plausible claim for relief and “the students should be afforded the opportunity to prove their claims on their merit.”
“These are very fact-intensive issues that need to be resolved at a later date,” Gianchetti told the appeals court judges.
Oklahoma Solicitor General Garry Gaskins, representing the state and defending the law, contended the case would face “insurmountable obstacles” if it proceeds. He asked the Tenth Circuit judges to let Dishman’s dismissal stand.
The lawsuit is “fundamentally transformed” in light of the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision this year to uphold a Tennessee law banning gender-affirming medical treatments for minors, Gaskins said. The Supreme Court justices rejected similar arguments that the Tennessee law violated transgender students’ equal protection rights. 
Tenth Circuit Chief Judge Jerome A. Holmes echoed the Tennessee precedent. He referenced Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito’s opinion that determined different treatment based on gender identity is not enough to violate the Equal Protection Clause.
Rather, the challenged law must treat people unequally based on their biological sex to be overturned, according to Alito’s opinion.
“There’s no differential treatment of men and women in this case,” Holmes said of the Oklahoma lawsuit.
Allowing bathroom use by gender identity could present a “major safety concern,” the Oklahoma City federal judge decided when throwing out the lawsuit.
Tenth Circuit Judge Carolyn B. McHugh, though, said the safety argument “seems a little thin.”
“Do we just presume that there’s a safety issue?” McHugh said. “The (plaintiffs’) complaint suggests the safety issue goes the other way. If you force transgender students to use the bathroom of their sex at birth, they’re more likely to be subject to being beaten up.”
The choice of whether to overturn the dismissal and allow the lawsuit to continue now rests with Holmes, McHugh and Senior Judge Michael R. Murphy. The judges can reach a decision by voting 3-0 or 2-1.
There is no set timeline to issue a decision, but the court typically takes four months, said Cassidy Fallik, of the ACLU of Oklahoma, which represents the plaintiffs.

Free.,Trump praises NYC Mayor-elect Mamdani in warm White House meeting,Ashley Murray,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-praises-nyc-mayor-elect-mamdani-warm-white-house-meeting,,"WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump and New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani turned around their heated criticism in remarks to the press after an Oval Office meeting Friday.After months of attacking each other, Trump and Mamdani pledged to address the high cost of living for New Yorkers. The White House has tried to steer messaging toward affordability in recent weeks as Trump’s approval ratings on the economy have sunk. “Some of his ideas really are the same ideas I have,” Trump said. “You know the new word is affordability. Another word is just groceries. It’s sort of an old-fashioned word, but it’s very accurate. They’re coming down.”Food prices have risen considerably in recent years. Groceries overall cost 3.1% more than they did a year ago, according to the government’s latest Consumer Price Index.Mamdani campaigned on lowering the cost of living, including property tax reform, making buses free and floating the idea of city-run grocery stories.The mayor-elect described the meeting as “a productive meeting focused on a place of shared admiration and love, which is New York City, and the need to deliver affordability to New Yorkers.”“We spoke about rent, we spoke about groceries, we spoke about utilities, we spoke about the different ways in which people are being pushed out, and I appreciated the time with the president,” Mamdani said.The pair fielded questions on housing costs, crime, whether either of them would retract their recent barbs and whether Trump would backtrack his threats to cut federal money to New York City.“Well, I think if we didn't get along, whether it's cut off or just make it a little bit difficult, or not give as much, we want to see,” Trump said.“We had a meeting today that actually surprised me. He wants to see no crime. He wants to see housing being built. He wants to see rents coming down. All things that I agree with. Now, we may disagree how we get there,” Trump added.In response to a question about GOP Rep. Elise Stefanik, a Trump ally, calling Mamdani a “jihadist” as she eyes the New York gubernatorial seat, Trump said “she's out there campaigning, and you say things sometimes in a campaign.”“I met with a man who is a very rational person. I met with a man who wants to see, really wants to see, New York be great again,” Trump continued, adding “I’ll be cheering for him.”Mamdani will be the city’s first Muslim mayor, as well as the youngest ever elected.Mamdani sought meetingMamdani said he sought the meeting with Trump.“My team reached out to the White House to set up this meeting because I will work with anyone to make life more affordable for the 8 and a half million people who call this city home,” Mamdani said in a press conference Thursday.White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters Thursday the meeting “speaks to the fact that President Trump is willing to meet with anyone.”“It speaks volumes that tomorrow we have a communist coming to the White House.”Trump and congressional Republicans have repeatedly referred to the 34-year-old Mamdani as a “communist.” Mamdani, who ran on the Democratic ticket, identifies as a Democratic Socialist, an organization that claims roughly 85,000 members nationally. The ideology as a movement received a boost after the 2016 presidential run of U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, an independent who represents Vermont and caucuses with Democrats.Mamdani beat out former New York Gov.

(Screenshot from Tennessee Stands video)Gary Humble, who founded the grassroots conservative group Tennessee Stands, has dropped out of the 2026 race for Tennessee Senate District 27, ending visions he could overcome a small deficit from four years ago. 
In a press release, Humble said his personal life “is in a season of significant transition,” citing business opportunities and family needs. 
Humble first ran for the seat in 2022, challenging Senate Majority Leader Jack Johnson, a Franklin Republican, in the Republican primary. Johnson was a heavy favorite but beat Humble by only 786 votes out of a total 24,100 cast in the election, and the narrow win left the door open for a rematch. 
In April, the Lookout reported Humble would run again for the seat, and he formally launched his campaign in September. 
Humble formed Tennessee Stands in 2020, initially protesting pandemic policies and  galvanizing resistance to COVID-19 emergency orders by state and local officials. Since then, the group has grown into a political power, opposing Gov. Bill Lee’s private-school voucher plan and backing Rep. Jody Barrett, a Dickson Republican, in the recent Republican primary for Congressional District 7.  
“Our political system is not healthy. We all see it — the corruption, the power structures, the backroom deals, the pressure to compromise, and the machine that punishes anyone who dares stand outside it,” Humble said in the statement announcing his withdrawal from the race.. “The environment is spiritually exhausting, and the cost on families is real.”

A state Department of Natural Resources and Conservation official said during the Oct. 23 […],"Fire information for the Windy Rock fire is displayed near the Jens exit of I-90 on Monday, Aug. 25, 2025. (Jordan Hansen / Daily Montanan)Montana’s 2025 fire season is expected to be pricey — between $50 and $70 million — driven largely by a complicated wildfire near Drummond earlier this year that’ll likely come out to be the most expensive suppression effort in state history.
A state Department of Natural Resources and Conservation official said during the Oct. 23 Environmental Quality Council meeting that 2,303 fires burned 75,000 acres in Montana this year. 
This was one of the lowest acreages burned in state history, which Gov. Greg Gianforte has repeatedly pointed to and praised DNRC for its work. 
DNRC’s fire management manual says that under state law, the department is required to perform aggressive initial attack on all fires and keep them “as small as possible.”
“Under Montana Code Annotated 76-13-104, the DNRC has the responsibility to protect land, property and natural resources within the state,” the agency said to the Daily Montanan. “The department places the utmost importance on the lives of firefighters and the public and will not intentionally jeopardize safety in pursuit of fire suppression responsibilities.”
The steep costs of the fire season coupled with the sparse acres that burned have raised questions about the state’s approach to wildfires. The Gianforte Administration has focused on suppression, calling their methods, “a model of proactive planning and decisive action.” Legislators are drilling down on wildfire as part of a state study on suppression, as new research shows forests might not actually be as dense as once thought, directly contradicting a large swath of American fire policy.
The huge cost and relatively low acreage was discussed during a meeting of the Environmental Quality Council last month, as the state is studying fire suppression costs.
Fire mitigation, the practice of reducing risk of catastrophic wildfires, is one way state and federal legislators are looking at trying to solve the problem.
But some mitigation practices — including logging, thinning and prescribed fires — are controversial to some environmentalists and there is vast disagreement within those circles about what, if anything, should be done to the nation’s forests.
Legislators heard testimony on suppression efforts and smoke impacts of prescribed burns during the meeting, which comes under the backdrop of massive federal changes surrounding wildfires.
The Fix Our Forest Act, recently proposed federal legislation from Montana U.S. Sen. Tim Sheehy, has been a touchpoint for some environmental groups, saying that so-called thinning operations, a tool fire managers use to reduce fuel loads in forests, is opening the door to major logging projects in national forests. Sheehy himself is connected to the wildfire fighting industry, having founded Bridger Aerospace, an aerial firefighting company.
Those same environmental groups, as well as a California author and research ecologist studying the issue, also say the way prescribed burns and thinning operations are being conducted does not follow historical wildfire patterns, saying specifically that the idea that huge swathes of the country’s forests are too dense is fundamentally incorrect.
The state and federal government work closely together on wildfires, as about 30% of Montana’s land is federally owned. This also complicates who pays for what, as Montana receives reimbursements for wildfire expenditures, but it does not cover the whole bill.
Legislators passed a slew of wildfire-related bills during the last session, including House Bill 70, a study into state fire suppression, which is driving conversations on the topic and is expected to be picked back up again in January.
“It’s really difficult to totally criticize,” Sen. Willis Curdy, D-Missoula, vice-chair of EQC told the Daily Montanan of the effort on Windy Rock. “But on the other hand I think some serious questions need to be asked.” 
Gov. Greg Gianforte receives a brief from fire officials at the Windy Rock fire near Drummond, Montana, on Monday, Aug. 25, 2025.
‘A policy of aggressive attack’
The most expensive wildfire this season, the Windy Rock Fire, located about 17 miles from Drummond, still had people assigned to it in October, after being initially reported in late August.
The total cost to suppress the fire was about $56 million, though a DNRC spokesperson told the Daily Montanan that number is subject to change. The fire started on August 14 and burned 6,175 acres.
“It’s really important to note that the figure we provide may change and does not include the (Fire Management Assistance Grants). Finalized numbers for fire costs and FMAGs can take months and sometimes even years,” DNRC spokesperson Moria Davin wrote in an email.
The grants come from the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which has been in chaos since President Donald Trump returned to the White House. 
Likely, though, it’ll be among the most expensive suppression efforts in state history. Montana’s 10-year annual average for firefighting costs is about $30 million, said Wyatt Frampton, a DNRC official addressing the committee. There are no solid numbers yet on actual expenses, which also makes this year an outlier, Frampton said.
“Given prolonged staffing that we had into October and some ongoing significant expenses associated with special activities, we don’t have a firm resolution for you yet on those final estimates for fire season cost,” Frampton told the committee.
The Windy Rock Fire originated on Bureau of Land Management land and the state responded with its county assist team. Montana and the BLM have an agreement over fire “offset” protection in that area, Frampton explained.
“There are exchanges of protection,” Frampton told the committee. “There’s areas where the Forest Service protects Forest Service or BLM protects private property, and likewise, the state will protect federal lands to try to have a net balance between the agencies.”
The fire also became complicated almost immediately and it burned in rocky and steep terrain, which complicated efforts. It threatened about 175 residences as well, Frampton said. And beyond that, there were other problems, too.
“Dead and down fuels from a past Mountain Pine Beetle outbreak pose additional challenges,” an Aug. 16 press release from the fire states. “The Windy Rock Fire is located near a Wilderness Study Area and a Backcountry Conservation Area, requiring fire operations to take special considerations for these landscapes.”
The fire became something of a spectacle, in part drawing massive air tankers to Helena Regional Airport that performed sorties on the fire for a week in late August. Firefighters on a Sanders County fire noted getting air resources as “challenging” due to “escalating demands” in the region on Aug. 22.
When incidents get larger or more complicated than local or state resources can handle, special teams are called — in this case, Northwest Team 2.
The day they took command from the state, Aug. 25, Gov. Greg Gianforte visited and toured the fire’s command post saying that day, “we’ve pursued a policy of aggressive attack on all fires.”
And the state did — per reporting by Substack and podcast, The Hotshot Wakeup on Aug. 25, the amount of fire retardant Montana used increased from 400,000 gallons to more than 1 million gallons in a week around the time those tankers were operating out of Helena.
Beyond the cost, many environmental groups have serious concerns with fire retardant, which contains high levels of toxic metals. The effectiveness of aerial attack on a fire is greatly debated and aircraft are not effective and often grounded in windy conditions.
Former legislator Jim Keane, a member of the Environmental Quality Council, asked questions to state staff regarding the cost of aerial attack versus ground efforts. 
“There has to be an astronomical amount of aviation assets that went into this fire year on a minimum amount of acres,” Keane said during the meeting.
The Trump Administration has pushed for more money and equipment for firefighters, with some focus on aerial firefighting. In fact, Sen. Sheehy was a cosponsor on bipartisan legislation earlier this year that made it easier for private contractors to acquire airplane parts for the nation’s firefighting fleet.
This fire season is expected to be the most expensive in U.S. history, though stats available through the National Interagency Fire Center, which tracks fire acreage and cost, are not adjusted for inflation, the agency has previously told the Daily Montanan.
But it’s a flawed assumption that fires can be put out, said Chad Hanson, a research ecologist, an author and the co-founder of the John Muir project, calling into question the amount state and federal governments spend on suppression.
He went on to say that studies by the U.S. Forest Service regarding forest density are flawed, saying money currently being spent on suppression and many fire mitigation practices would be better spent on hardening homes against fire.
“Pretty much everything that we’ve been told about fire in our forests is incorrect, scientifically,” Hanson said. “And it’s not just some loose theory.”

‘A wink and a nod’
Hanson and several fellow researchers have authored studies in response to research from the U.S. Forest Service regarding density in forests.
The density question is fundamentally a disagreement over forestry practices. The general idea among those in support of logging and thinning to reduce fire risk is that suppression practices on wildfires in the United States have led to forests that are too dense. They say there used to be many small intensity fires in the nation’s forests and that thinning and prescribed burns will replicate this natural process.
It’s a focus of a Sen. Sheehy bill — the Fix Our Forest Act — currently moving through Congress. The bill would also make it easier for land management agencies to conduct thinning and prescribed burn operations. In practice, prescribed burns often cut down small trees and brush, which is known as mechanical thinning, which are then put into small piles and burned. 
And Hanson says that the assumption all American forests had frequent, low-intensity fires is fundamentally incorrect and that federal research left out information contrary to that.
“They omitted and didn’t mention massive amounts of data that showed that historical forests were really variable,” Hanson said. “There were open forests, for sure, but there were also a lot of really, really dense forests, a lot of forests in between. This really simplistic notion that the forests were all open and park-like at low density, is not even remotely accurate based on the science and that’s not a contested notion.”
That’s not to say Hanson is against prescribed burns — there’s places where it could help, he said — but he does think the forests are closer to their natural density than some federal studies would suggest. Hanson and other researchers, including William L. Baker, a University of Wyoming professor, wrote a peer-reviewed review of a federal study called “Evidence for widespread changes in the structure, composition, and fire regimes of western North American forests.”
The Baker paper found most evidence was omitted in the federal study was information that, “does not support their low-severity model, including 10 published rebuttals of their papers.”
The federal study included logging interests, the Missoula Fire Science Laboratory and Environmental and Forestry Departments from major state schools across the west, including the University of Washington, UC Berkeley, Northern Arizona, Penn State, Utah State, Oregon State, and Arizona. It also included the Nature Conservancy, as well as various state and federal land management agencies.
Many of those researchers get money from the U.S. Forest Service, Hanson said, which has priorities of its own.
“Under Federal laws, the Forest Service can sell trees on public lands to private logging companies and keep most of the revenue generated from those timber sales for its own budget, using the money to pay staff and buy new equipment,” Hanson writes in his 2021 book, Smokescreen. “This creates a powerful perverse financial incentive for Forest Service staff to ignore wildlife and recreational impacts and emphasize industrial logging.”
It’s important to note, Hanson said, that the Forest Service is in charge of managing the nation’s forests, not necessarily protecting trees.
“We’ll do all these logging operations, we’ll call it thinning and fuel reduction, with a wink and a nod, and it will tell communities it’ll stop the fire from reaching the towns,” Hanson said. “And that is a dangerous lie, because that’s not what’s happening. The fires are blowing right through those thin areas.”
It’s the same logic the Fix Our Forest Act is based on, Hanson said, which is why it’s drawn criticism from some environmental groups like the Alliance for the Wild Rockies and EarthJustice.
“Prescribed fire doing preventing stand replacement fire is immediate massive loss of wildlife habitat,” said Sara Johnson, an environmental advocate who founded Native Ecosystems Council. “It prevents stand replacement fire, which is a huge benefit to wildlife.”
‘Active forest management’
In 2020, the Montana Forest Action Plan, a report commissioned under then-Governor Steve Bullock found 3.8 million acres of Montana’s forests “in greatest need of attention” 
U.S. Forest Service Chief Tom Schultz, who spent 14 years with the Montana Department of Natural Resources and Conservation, has said the nation’s forests are in trouble because they’re not being logged enough — and Gianforte, the state’s current Governor, is a noted supporter of the logging industry as well.
“Montana’s forest products industry has an important and necessary role in achieving landscape-scale forest restoration and management across the state,” the report states.
Less than 100,000 acres per year were being treated in Montana in 2020, according to the report. That number appears to have increased — earlier this year, the Forest Service said they conducted hazardous fuels reduction work on 200,000 acres of Montana forest in 2024. The BLM conducted approximately 38,000 acres of prescribed burns last year.
“Active forest management, such as mechanical thinning and prescribed fire, is one of the most important tools to reduce the risk and severity of wildfire alongside a robust community preparedness strategy,” the report reads. “This approach is especially important in the low-elevation fuel types where past fire suppression has had the greatest impact in terms of in- creased fuel loading.”
A separate 2020 report commissioned by the DNRC found that 85% of the state’s forests are at an increased risk of wildfire. According to the agency, historical Montana fires  were characterized by frequent, low-intensity fire that mostly burned surface fuels without killing mature trees. 
This also occasionally included moderate or higher severity fire, agency spokesperson Anna Lau wrote in an email. Lau went on to say that the state’s low- to mid-elevation forests, which are mostly ponderosa pine and Douglas fir, fires would typically occur every 5 to 30 years. That maintained open forest structures and created variability in the forest, Lau wrote.
“It’s important to recognize that high-intensity, stand-replacing fires play a natural and necessary role in certain ecosystems particularly at higher elevations, such as subalpine fir and lodgepole pine forests,” Lau wrote. “These forests have evolved with infrequent but severe fires that reset ecological succession.”
The DNRC does prescribed burns as well and the Montana Department of Environmental Quality has a call every day in the fall with the U.S. Forest Service to discuss the day’s burn requests.
Smoke from prescribed burns is a concern and EQC members heard from one woman who described significant smoke impacts. Logging has no smoke impacts, which EQC chair Rep. Paul Fielder, R-Thompson Falls, brought up.
“There’s different options for managing forests,” Fielder said. “You can do prescribed burns, or you can do thinning and other methods of reducing the fuel loads there. And as long as we just say prescribed burns are the best way to go without looking at other options. I think we’re not considering the health effects of this.”
A 2025 Stanford study showed prescribed burns “can meaningfully reduce smoke emissions,” from wildfires. And the DEQ has multiple factors it considers in those decisions.
“Burn decisions are determined based on how efficiently the smoke is going to exit the community,” DEQ meteorologist Aaron Ofseyer said in a statement. “A critical metric for determining this is the ventilation index. This index is calculated by multiplying the mixing height and the transport wind. The higher the index, the more likely the DEQ is to approve a burn.”
For those deeply involved with the work, like Tim Rochell, a prescribed fire expert with Missoula County, there’s been movement in public perception of the issue. 
“What we’re doing right now is we’re changing a culture like people have been taught to be afraid of fire, as opposed to something that’s a natural part of our landscape,” Rochell said. “And I think we’re slowly starting to change that.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/WindyRock2-1024x678.jpg,,,2025-11-22 15:57:30.239299

(Courtesy New Mexico National Guard) 
The small state agency that coordinates responses to natural disasters and other emergencies across New Mexico is seeking a significant funding boost next year, a reflection both of an expected increase in fires and floods and also a potential exodus of contractors if federal funds stop flowing through the agency. 
Miguel Aguilar, the adjutant general of the New Mexico National Guard and secretary of the state Department of Homeland Security and Emergency Management, told the Legislative Finance Committee on Thursday that the agency is seeking a nearly $7 million budget for the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2026. That’s a roughly $2.5 million increase over the agency’s current budget.
The increase is necessary, Aguilar said, to keep up with increasing natural disasters, including ones the department is responding to now and that it expects in the future. So far this year, he reported, the department has activated its State Emergency Operations Center 11 times for storms, flooding and landslides.
“We’ve had a rough couple years,” Aguilar told the LFC on Thursday at the beginning of his remarks. He went on to say that prolonged drought means perpetual risk of wildfire, while burn scars across the state will often be the site of dangerous floods and debris flows.  
“Even moderate monsoon storms can produce dangerous runoff” in burn scars, he said. 
‘My staff is spent’: New Mexico emergency management leader reflects on year of disasters

The funding increase would allow the department to hire 13 new full-time employees, including engineers, analysts and program managers. The department currently has eight employees tasked with emergency response, according to the presentation. 
That small crew manages millions of dollars in federal grants, including for federally declared disasters like the Hermits Peak-Calf Canyon Fire in 2022 and the South Fork and Salt fires in 2024. 
Aguilar said the department relies heavily on private contractors to handle much of the work, a longstanding practice at the department since 9/11 and Hurricane Katrina. That’s when the state first began receiving a large share of its operating revenue in federal funds from the Federal Emergency Management Agency and other federal agencies. 
He expects federal funding to slowly go away, Aguilar said. That will mean a loss of the contractors, and, with them, institutional knowledge.
“As the burn scars heal, assuming there’s not another long fire,” the department will need to build its own capacity with new state employees, he said, as contractors leave alongside federal funding. 
“We don’t have the [staff] to really do the things that the state needs us to do over the coming years,” he said.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/480628493_945485931104974_4705135364372250275_n-1024x681.jpg,,,2025-11-21 17:59:23.240797

Etan Nasreddin-Longo said he’s humbled by the community support he has received. “It’s nice to know that that’s there. I’m just sorry that things have worked out this way. I wish I had a reason.”

Three weeks before Etan Nasreddin-Longo was fired, he received a compliment from the director of the Vermont State Police. Col. Matthew Birmingham had told him he was doing great work leading a committee under the Department of Public Safety, Nasreddin-Longo recalled this week.
“And then, in September, I get fired for absolutely no reason,” the former director of the Fair and Impartial Policing and Community Affairs Committee said.
Now, almost two months after he was fired, Nasreddin-Longo said he is “still in the dark” and has had no communication from the department about reasons behind his removal. 
While DPS Commissioner Jennifer Morrison said the decision was hers alone, she and other members of the state police have declined to comment on why he was removed, as it involves “personnel matters.” Birmingham did not respond to a request for comment.
Nasreddin-Longo, 62, is a professor of musicology and composer, a longtime advocate for racial justice and, until recently, the salaried part-time head of the DPS committee that advises and provides implicit bias training to law enforcement, among other things. 
He said he came to the position by chance when a gym buddy who was in law enforcement asked him to join a committee exploring bias-free policing. He was surprised by the term and recalled saying, “if you don’t have any bias, you’re probably dead.”Nasreddin-Longo, who identifies as mixed race, Jewish and Muslim, said he initially thought he would not get involved, but got drawn in more so after George Floyd’s killing in 2020, when he became a salaried civilian employee of the state police.
“You cannot be Black in this country, have a brain and have a heart and not get into this work at some point in your life, either professionally or not professionally,” he said.
Since then, Nasreddin-Longo’s work has been celebrated by advocates and racial justice leaders to advance equity statewide, such as creating a first ever anti-bias police training outline. In 2022, he was given an award for outstanding dedication and his contributions to the committee at the Vermont State Police’s annual ceremony at the statehouse.
He is “a trusted resource, a thoughtful educator” who has built bridges between marginalized communities and law enforcement, said Amanda Garcés, the new commissioner of the Vermont Truth and Reconciliation Commission. She briefly worked with him on a different Fair and Impartial Policing subcommittee under the Vermont Criminal Justice Council, which is tasked with creating the statewide model policy for fair and impartial policing.
“In every setting I have been part of, whether in community conversations or in discussions with law enforcement, people consistently spoke of Etan with genuine respect. His trainings, his approach to dialogue, and the care he brings to difficult issues have earned him deep regard across the state,” she wrote in an email.
Nasreddin-Longo said he particularly enjoyed forging new relationships between the DPS and groups like the Root Social Justice Center, which prioritizes Black, Indigenous, and people of color communities. But he received positive verbal feedback for such work from supervisors, he said, and has never faced a disciplinary action that he knows of. 
An ‘abrupt’ departure
The first indication Nasreddin-Longo had of any issues involving his position was at the beginning of September, he said, when he was asked to write his own contract for the first time. At that time, he learned that the department wanted to turn his salaried position into a consultant contract, with no reasons given. He declined but said it felt “very irregular” and “very abrupt.”
Then, during a Sept. 25 meeting with Morrison, Nasreddin-Longo was handed “a boilerplate termination letter” with no reasons given. He signed it and left. 
“I had no plans to say anything. I want them to say something,” he said.
The public safety department issued a brief press release on Sept. 29 confirming Nasreddin-Longo was “not currently a state employee.”
Almost two months later, Nasreddin-Longo said he doesn’t think it’s a coincidence that he was removed at a time when DEI efforts and diverse voices are being undermined and undercut across the state and nation. 
“I certainly wasn’t thinking of retirement,” he said.
Morrison plans to post the currently vacant part-time civilian position early next year, with input from the community, according to Adam Silverman, public information officer for Vermont State Police. Nasreddin-Longo’s co-director and police counterpart Sgt. Daniel Bennett is leading the committee. Bennett did not respond to a request for comment.
In a Nov. 7 email to the Fair and Impartial Policing Committee, Morrison said she is focused on hiring a new co-director of FIP and more clearly defining the role of the FIP committee in consultation with longtime FIP committee members.
The committee, established in 2009, meets four times a year and acts as an advisory group to the Vermont State Police to address bias and hate crimes in policing, hiring and working with marginalized communities, and conducts law enforcement training, according to the website.
Other advocates of the FIP committee’s work also see Nasreddin-Longo’s sudden removal as an ominous sign of the times. 
With the federal government rolling back decades of civil rights progress and threatening states that fail to comply, Vermonters are right to question the motives behind the firing of one of the state’s most respected racial equity leaders, James Duff Lyall, executive director of the ACLU of Vermont, said in an email.
“The evidence is all around us that systemic racism is alive and well in our state and continues to perpetuate real harm in our communities — and the silence and inaction of so many state leaders is telling,” he wrote.
Vermont’s criminal justice system, Lyall added, still has some of the worst racial disparities in the country — from racial disparities in state prosecutions to the House and Senate judiciary committees failing for three years to advance a bill that could address pervasive racial profiling on Vermont’s roadways. 
“These are the kinds of injustices Etan Nasreddin-Longo worked to dismantle,” he said.  
“Until we know more, it’s difficult to see this as anything other than a slap in the face to Vermonters who are calling on state leaders to act with urgency and resolve in defense of our laws and our values,” Lyall wrote.
The Windham County NAACP also called for community support in the wake of “the perceived unfairness” of Nasreddin-Longo’s removal and offered its help.
Garces said it is sad to see a widely respected state employee removed from his role without a clear explanation. 
“Vermont has long benefited from his integrity, compassion and experience in equity work. My hope is that the commitment to fair and impartial policing remains strong and transparent moving forward,” she said.
Nasreddin-Longo said he is humbled by the community support he has received: “It’s nice to know that that’s there. I’m just sorry that things have worked out this way. I wish I had a reason.”
After years of work by the FIP committee, advocates are mostly worried that progress may be reversed or terminated.
Federal policies have no impact on the work of the committee, according to a Nov. 7 email from Morrison to the Fair and Impartial Policing Committee. Marginalized communities will continue to be heard, and there is “no intention of watering” the FIP down, she wrote.
Rep. Angela Arsenault, D-Williston, who serves on the House Judiciary Committee and the Joint Judicial Retention Committee, doesn’t have any information on the dismissal either and urged transparency from the department.
“I do think that the Department of Public Safety’s failure to provide a clear rationale — to a valued employee and a concerned public — could serve to uphold many of the harmful constructs that Etan was charged with helping to dismantle,” she said.
Nasreddin-Longo said he had volunteered on the committee since about 2012 and was hired as a co-director in 2020. When Birmingham hired him, he said: “Your job is not to be a yes man,” Nasreddin-Longo recalled, and said he took it to heart.
After years of helping to build relationships with communities of color and other marginalized groups, Nasreddin-Longo said he hopes the work continues with intention and better communication.

(Photo by Jay Waagmeester/Florida Phoenix)The Senate’s plan to address the school choice voucher system’s shortfalls was made public Friday. 
“A myriad of accountability problems” went on display this week when two legislative committees reacted to an independent audit showing “funding did not follow the child” to private schools or homeschool. Now, Sen. Don Gaetz, R-Crestview, has put out his chamber’s plan, co-sponsored by the chairs of both Senate education committees. 
‘Funding did not follow the child’: State audit displays school choice woes

In the nearly 150-page bill, SB 318, Gaetz, a former school district superintendent, touches concerns raised by school districts, parents, private schools, and scholarship funding organizations. 
“As the Auditor General has made clear, the architecture of our current funding system has scrambled together the funds for public schools, private schools, home schooling and unique ability scholarships and then the Department and the Scholarship Funding Organizations have to unscramble upwards of $4 billion and send the right amounts to the right places for the right students at the right times. No wonder there are problems,” the Senate president’s office said in releasing Gaetz’s bill.
The bill establishes:

 A categorical fund for the scholarship programs as opposed to the existing practice of lumping those funds together with all school funding; 
Requires a minimum of $250 million in a fund that offsets unexpected budgetary costs related to school choice scholarships;
And “clears up the timing confusion in the present system and establishes clear application and scholarship acceptance deadlines that occur prior to the funding of scholarships,” according to the Senate president’s office.

Additionally, the bill would provide the state access to scholarship funding organizations’ databases. After each verification of student locations, the list of students must be provided to the chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee, the chair of the House Budget Committee, and the office of the governor.

The Senate plan would require the Department of Education to investigate written complaints from parents, students, and schools regarding school choice laws and investigate fraudulent activity and overpayment, and refer them to the Department of Financial Services for potential criminal investigation. 
Private schools that do not properly attest that a child attends their school could be investigated for fraud and would have to repay the funds, according to the bill. 
During a committee meeting this week, Gaetz acknowledged his bill is not “perfect,” but said it fixes “issues, which, left unaddressed, will continue to worsen and threaten to disrupt and imperil school choice in Florida.”
The department would be required to develop a uniform reimbursement and invoicing process and create stricter application windows for scholarships, addressing a concern Rep. Toby Overdorf, R-Palm City, among several other representatives, shared last month. 
The bill would requires all students including those attending private schools, to be tracked with Florida Education Identifier numbers, unique to each student, to better check the location of students, a focal point for Reps. John Snyder, R-Stuart, and Fiona McFarland, R-Sarasota. Under the existing model, not all non-public school students were being tracked with those numbers, making verification of student information a heavier lift. 
The Phoenix reported this week the House and Senate, while both acknowledging the problems with the program, are not entirely on the same page, particularly whether to separate the school choice programs from the school funding model.

(USDA Photo by Lance Cheung)Agricultural groups and environmental groups combined to file a lawsuit against the state’s Department of Natural Resources and Conservation alleging the state’s exempt well laws allow unregulated groundwater development outside the state’s permitting system.
According to the DNRC, small groundwater developments that use 35 gallons per minute or less and do not exceed 10 acre-feet per year, are known as “exempt wells.”
There may be as many as 141,000 exempt wells authorized between 1973 and 2023, the lawsuit says. 
“By authorizing unregulated groundwater development, the Exempt Well Law undermines these constitutional protections afforded to senior water right appropriators and threatens the integrity of Montana’s water resources,” the lawsuit says.
The coalition bringing the lawsuit against the state is broad, including the Montana League of Cities and Towns, Association of Gallatin Agricultural Irrigators, Clark Fork Coalition, Montana Environmental Information Center, Montana Farm Bureau Federation, and Trout Unlimited.
A DNRC spokesperson said they could not comment on the suit due to litigation being active.
“From rapid growth to ongoing drought, Montana’s water resources and water users are facing unprecedented challenges,” Andrew Gorder, legal director of the Clark Fork Coalition, said in a press release. “The cumulative impact of over 100,000 exempt groundwater wells can no longer be ignored. We’re asking the court to conserve our limited water resources and ensure that the constitutional protections afforded to senior water rights, including instream flow rights, are preserved.”
The lawsuit goes on to say that some of Montana’s fastest growing areas have been “fueled” by individual exempt wells. The issue was heavily discussed during the legislative session, with some home developers and realtor associations pushing to keep rules as they are now.
Advocates against exempt wells have said developers have exploited the exempt well rule to build new homes and try to solve the state’s housing crunch. 
“Exempt wells facilitate a housing development model and pattern that is unsustainable,” Mark Runkle, a Montana housing developer said in a press release. “It transfers many of the developer’s responsibilities to future homeowners and taxpayers. This model undermines responsible development on municipal services with infrastructure completed and undermines the affordability of housing.”
One bill last session — Senate Bill 358 — would have restricted usage of exempt wells in some high-growth areas of the state. 
“The State knows that exempt wells adversely affect senior water rights,” the lawsuit states. “Yet, legislative attempts to address the exempt well loophole have been unsuccessful in multiple sessions, including the 2025 session, demonstrating the legislature’s unwillingness or inability to bring the Water Use Act into constitutional compliance.”
The suit seeks to end the exempt well “loophole.”
“The exempt well loophole forces cities and towns to shoulder the consequences of unregulated groundwater use,” Kelly Lynch, executive director of Montana League of Cities and Towns, said in a press release. “Municipalities are already struggling to ensure reliable water supplies for growing communities. We need a consistent, lawful permitting process that protects existing users, not a system that leaves Montana’s communities and taxpayers to clean up the mess.”

Gov. Phil Scott submitted the appeal Friday and believes the state has bolstered its case for why it needs federal assistance, his office said.

Gov. Phil Scott on Friday formally appealed President Donald Trump’s rejection of a state application for federal disaster aid stemming from flooding that struck the Northeast Kingdom in July this year. 
Scott and his top deputy for flood recovery, Doug Farnham, had previously said the administration was working on an appeal of Trump’s decision, which came in October. 
The state is asking the feds for a major disaster declaration, which in this case, would allow towns in Caledonia and Essex counties to unlock Federal Emergency Management Agency funding to cover the costs of repairing critical infrastructure and starting new projects to halt the risk of future flooding, among other possible expenses.

In a press release Friday, the governor’s office said its appeal pointed to how it can be expensive for towns to rebuild their infrastructure in accordance with modern flood resilience guidelines. It also pointed to “the cumulative economic effect on the state and communities that have seen catastrophic floods in each of the last three years.”
Some towns in the rural region experienced flooding in 2025 on the same day they experienced flooding in 2024 and 2023.
“After submitting our disaster declaration request, we learned about more damage that wasn’t included in our initial submission,” Scott added in the release. “This information significantly increases financial burden for repairs which we believe strengthens our appeal.”
Officials said previously that recovery costs were proving to be higher in the Caledonia County town of Sutton — seemingly the worst hit this year — than they previously thought. Sutton suffered more than $1 million in damage, according to Scott’s office.
Friday’s appeal was sent to FEMA, according to the press release, which will review it and then send a recommendation to Trump, who will approve or deny the request.
It’s far from a guarantee that Trump will change his mind after seeing Vermont’s appeal, though. At least two other states — Maryland and Michigan — had appeals for disaster aid stemming from major weather events rejected by the White House this fall.
Trump’s decision to reject Vermont’s initial request for aid for the 2025 flooding came on the same day he also denied aid requests from several other states that are largely Democratic, but he approved requests from several Republican-leaning states. 
A spokesperson for the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, of which FEMA is a part, contended previously that Trump’s decision was not politically motivated and was instead due to a determination that Vermont could pay for its recovery needs on its own.
An analysis last month by the Pew Charitable Trusts found that without federal assistance after the most significant disasters, many states would see their reserves depleted. Vermont is among the most vulnerable states to such federal funding cuts, according to the analysis.
Trump’s rejection of disaster aid had no recent precedent for the state. Vermont received the major disaster declarations it sought following the flooding in 2023 and 2024, when President Joe Biden was in office.
Its 2025 request is for federal aid for towns; the state did not seek aid for individuals this year, as it did the previous two years.

(Photos courtesy of the Department of Agriculture and Natural Resources)As a public debate begins about agriculture and water pollution in South Dakota, a new report shows the effects of a $3 million effort to mitigate the problem. 
South Dakota’s top state Senate Republican and the governor sparred this week over whether the state should tighten agricultural regulations to address water pollution. Senate President Pro Tempore Chris Karr, R-Sioux Falls, told a legislative committee that with most monitored rivers and streams in the state too polluted to support at least some uses, such as swimming, fishing or boating, the state can no longer “dance around” the idea of more regulations on agriculture.
Gov. Larry Rhoden, a rancher, blasted those comments as “misinformation” made “out of ignorance” and said Karr would be “set straight.” 
With so much polluted water, SD lawmaker says state can no longer ‘dance around’ ag regulations

Meanwhile, a final report quietly emerged about an effort to keep cattle waste out of lakes and streams and reduce chemical and sediment runoff from farms. Karr was the prime sponsor of the bill that created the 2021 initiative. The state Department of Agriculture and Natural Resources managed it. It paid $3 million to help landowners contain livestock waste or plant grass and other vegetation along streambanks in the Big Sioux River watershed.
Jay Gilbertson, manager of the East Dakota Water Development District, said the enrolled vegetated strips, called buffers, filter pollution and stabilize stream banks. Livestock are required to be kept out of the areas for part of the year, except during limited times and circumstances when grazing and haying are allowed. 
According to the report, 67 projects created 83 linear miles of buffers, protecting 1,219 acres. The project contracts last for 10 years. They prevent an estimated 1,484 pounds of phosphorus, 6,415 pounds of nitrogen and 953 tons of sediment from entering the Big Sioux River watershed each year.
Payments increased after low interest
The program started slowly. Nobody had signed up for it by January 2023, two years after it was approved. 
“The feedback that we got back was that we’re not paying enough to really move the needle,” Hunter Roberts, secretary of the Department of Agriculture and Natural Resources, told lawmakers at the time.
So, the department began paying more.
Governor says lawmaker will be ‘set straight’ on suggestion to regulate agricultural water polluters

DANR materials say that under the original cash-incentive program, a 50-foot, half-mile buffer under a minimum 10-year contract would have yielded a total payment of about $5,000 for cropland and $1,300 for pastureland over 10 years. Under a new formula Roberts outlined, the rates for the same examples increased to about $13,000 for cropland and $3,400 for pastureland.
Additionally, the department allowed the funds to be spent on livestock waste containment systems. Two of those were installed, involving 69 cattle. The department also allowed landowners to “stack” their program payments on top of payments from the federal government’s Conservation Reserve Program, which pays landowners to take marginal land out of agricultural production. That meant landowners could receive both federal and state payments for eligible acres, plus another incentive if those stacked acres are enrolled in a Game, Fish and Parks program that pays landowners to allow public access for hunters. 
“Everybody seems to like free money or at least additional money,” Gilbertson said. “And these activities got the ball rolling, and it turned out to be pretty popular.”
Gilbertson credited lawmakers, including Karr, for launching the initiative.
“It was a great example of the Legislature stepping forward, stepping up and saying we need to invest in our natural resources here in South Dakota,” he said.
Benefits and worries beyond 10 years
Sushant Mehan is an assistant professor and water resource engineer at South Dakota State University. He and a team are quantifying how the buffer initiative changes vegetation and downstream water quality.

He said buffers are often on flood-prone, low-yield acres, and the research already shows enrolled acres are more productive during the times when grazing and haying are allowed than they would be under year-round grazing.
“So, if people go that route, ultimately, it’s a win-win situation for them,” Mehan said. 
Mehan frames the benefits of buffers as both direct for landowners and indirect for everyone paying a water bill. He said filtering out contaminants is a costly business for water systems, and those costs are passed along to customers. 
Mehan said the next step is figuring out where buffers will do the most good. The team’s ongoing work is about mapping which enrolled acres are “truly critical” to maximize water-quality gains.
Gilbertson worries that maintaining the buffers after the 10-year contracts expire could be difficult if landowners expect a similar payment.
Paul Lorenzen administers the state’s watershed protection program for the Department of Agriculture and Natural Resources. He said the program included cost-sharing for fencing and alternative water sources. He said once those investments are in place, landowners may choose to keep the buffers even after the checks stop. 
Lorenzen said other programs with similar 10-year commitments have seen producers stick with the practices once they experience the benefits, and he hopes buffers will follow the same pattern.

(Pool photo by Tanner Ecker/Bismarck Tribune)The North Dakota Supreme Court has upheld North Dakota’s abortion ban as constitutional after the court failed to meet the supermajority required to overturn the law.
The Friday decision reverses a lower court’s ruling from last fall that struck down the law and found that women have a right to seek abortions until the point of fetal viability. 
Three of the five justices found the law unconstitutional: Daniel Crothers, Lisa Fair McEvers and Daniel Narum, who sat on the case in place of Douglas Bahr, who recused. Chief Justice Jon Jensen and Justice Jerod Tufte found the law constitutional.
North Dakota Supreme Court hears arguments over abortion ban

The ruling followed more than two years of litigation over an abortion ban signed into law by then-Gov. Doug Burgum in April 2023. The law bars abortion in all cases except rape or incest if the mother has been pregnant less than six weeks, or when the pregnancy poses a serious physical health threat. Psychological conditions do not count as serious health risks under the ban.
The state’s Republican-dominated Legislature passed the 2023 law with overwhelming support from both chambers just weeks after the North Dakota Supreme Court struck down its previous abortion ban.
A group of reproductive health care doctors and an abortion clinic sued the state over the new policy, arguing that it did not fix any of the problems the high court identified with the prior ban. The plaintiffs said the law endangered the lives of pregnant women and denied doctors due process by not specifying when an abortion may be performed for health reasons.
The state of North Dakota maintained that the ban was not vague and was necessary to protect unborn children.
This is a developing story and will be updated.

(Photo by Christopher Shea/Rhode Island Current)A teddy bear. Colorful beads. A Disney princess jewelry kit.
They were displayed on a table at a downtown Providence shop Friday afternoon in a collection of popular toys families might be considering purchasing for their kids this holiday season. 
But they’re also among the most dangerous, according to the latest “Trouble in Toyland” report recently published by the Public Interest Research Group (PIRG), a Denver-based consumer rights nonprofit. 
It’s the 40th year the group has published its annual list of toys that could be dangerous to children, Henry Welch, a campaign associate for the Rhode Island chapter, told reporters gathered outside Craftland Friday afternoon.
In the past, Welch said the biggest dangers with toys were choking hazards and lead.
“A lot of the toys that we found that were dangerous are no longer available,” Welch said. “However, some of these dangers are still out there, including some toys that seemed like a dystopian science fiction of the past that are now available.”
Exhibit A among those dystopian toys is that teddy bear on the table. 
Sold for $99 by Singapore-based FoloToy, “Kumma Bear” uses OpenAI models to hold “both friendly chats and deep conversations to stimulate curiosity and learning,” according to its now-gone product page.
But the PIRG report found Kumma’s programming had very few guardrails in place.
Kumma told researchers where they could find knives in a household, Welch said. It also said where matches could be found, along with directions on how to light them.
“One thing that we found that was really disturbing was that Kumma the teddy bear would talk about sexually explicit content with our researchers,” Welch said. “That obviously is not appropriate for children.”
Kumma has since been removed from the market, CNN reported Wednesday. But Welch warned that AI-powered toys will remain a problem if the market continues to be unregulated.
“These toys aren’t really tested well enough,” he said.
AI may be the biggest issue of the day, but choking hazards continue to be a big issue in toys — in particular, the tiny water-absorbing polymer beads next to Kumma bear. 
Dr. Stephanie Ruest, an assistant professor of emergency medicine and pediatrics at Hasbro Children’s Hospital, told reporters the beads remain a persistent problem for the emergency department.
Beads start off small, roughly the size of a peppercorn. But when exposed to liquid, they can grow to the size of a cherry tomato. That includes bodily fluids, which makes them really dangerous if swallowed, Reust said.
“It can cause blockage, which is a surgical emergency,” she said.
Welch noted that the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission has issued new standards, setting a maximum size of 9 millimeters in diameter, but that parents should continue to be careful when purchasing the product.










One thing that we found that was really disturbing was that Kumma the teddy bear would talk about sexually explicit content with our researchers. That obviously is not appropriate for children.


– Henry Welch, campaign associate for the Public Interest Research Group’s Rhode Island chapter


The Disney Princess jewelry kit magically changes gel into jewelry within minutes. But the Consumer Product Safety Commission recalled it in March because it contains a resin that can cause skin, eye and respiratory irritation if inhaled, touched or ingested when still in liquid form. The resin contains an acrylate (hydroxyethylmethacrylate “HEMA”) in amounts prohibited in children’s products by the Federal Hazardous Substances Act. 
“But I was able to buy it on eBay and received it after a couple of days with no warning,” Welch said.
Welch and Reust recommend parents and guardians keep tabs on which toys have been recalled by visiting recalls.gov.
Among Ruest’s biggest fears for children is ingesting button batteries.
“This is truly a medical emergency,” she said. “They can burn holes through the esophagus. They can burn any place a child may lodge them.”
Really any small toy continues to pose a choking hazard, depending on the age of a child. A good way to test its chokability is through a toilet roll or by comparing it to the size of your child’s fist, Reuset suggested.
“If you have a toy that can freely pass through a toilet paper roll without getting stuck, or the toy — or pieces of the toy — is smaller than a child’s fist, those are toys a child may choke on and you may want to avoid those,” she said.
Another way to prevent choking is to properly store toys.
“A lot of things we see in the emergency department are young children who get into things that weren’t meant for them,” Reust said. “They find them lying around the house as their sibling was playing with it.”

(Photo by Emma Murphy/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY – Oklahoma residents may get to vote to eliminate property taxes for homes they live in.
Two lawmakers and a former legislator on Friday filed papers with the Oklahoma Secretary of State to circulate an initiative petition to let voters decide to gradually reduce some property taxes and end them in 2029.
State Question 841 would not apply to bonded indebtedness incurred by schools, counties, municipalities or other political subdivisions prior to Dec. 31, 2026.
The change would be effective Jan. 1, 2027, when an amount equal to about 33% of the full assessed value of the homestead would be exempt. The next year, it would increase to nearly 67% before being eliminated in 2029.
The measure would reduce ad valorem revenue by $400 million in 2027, $800 million in 2028 and $1.2 billion in 2029, according to the petition.
The proponents of the petition are former Rep. Mike Reynolds, R-Oklahoma City; Sen. Shane Jett, R-Shawnee; and Rep. Jay Steagall, R-Yukon.
It would be a statutory change and require 92,263 signatures.
Schools, cities and counties rely on property tax revenue to purchase equipment, build facilities and maintain infrastructure.
Reynolds said he expects some criticism of the measure.
One of those critics is Oklahoma County Commissioner Jason Lowe, a former Democratic lawmaker.
“That would destroy county government,” he said, adding that it would eliminate jobs and services.
Oklahoma County does not receive revenue from sales tax, he said. Property tax is its only form of revenue, he said.
“That is a scary proposition,” Lowe said, adding that it is irresponsible.
Reynolds said it will be up to the Legislature to determine how the funds will be replaced, adding that it will have three years to do so.
“For years, Oklahomans who live in a home here and take up primary residency have never truly owned their home and property taxes are evidence of that,” Steagall said.
Even if the home is paid off, the owner will still have to pay property taxes to the government or have their property seized by the government, Steagall said. 
The measure won’t cut off property taxes for businesses or people that rent homes, Reynolds said.
It will encourage homeownership because payments will be less, Reynolds said. 
“Businesses that are apparently buying houses all over the nation will have a harder time competing against local residents,” Reynolds said.
Steagall said the timeframe gives the entities receiving the property tax revenue time to address replacing those streams.
“The initiative petition does not have the intent of making it impossible for cities or counties to collect revenue necessary to run critical operations that they are responsible for,” Steagall said. “It just puts into perspective here that property taxes are going to be a revenue source that is off limits.” 
A new state law being challenged at the Oklahoma Supreme Court makes it more difficult for people to get issues on the ballot.
But Reynolds believes the petition will be successful.
“I think that this will be popular enough that we shouldn’t have a problem getting the necessary signatures anyway,” Reynolds said.
Steagall said elimination of property taxes is widely supported.
Supporters hope to get it on the November 2026 ballot.

“In recent years, we have had students who are very interested in learning about semiconductors. They take our courses, and the job opportunities have opened up, especially since the chip shortage happened after the pandemic,” Pandey said. “A lot of companies are recruiting, and they want students with advanced skills in semiconductors.”
Described by the Semiconductor Industry Association as “the brain of modern electronics,” the association’s website states semiconductors are materials created from pure elements and an incredibly important component of electronic devices like medical equipment, computers, smart phones and more.

Traditional educational paths to the semiconductor industry can include the completion of a master’s or doctorate degree, Pandey said, which takes too long with current and projected employee shortages. According to the team’s grant application abstract, the talent gap in the industry is growing, and by 2030 there are predicted to be more than 61,000 unfilled positions.
The new program will get students the training they need at an accelerated pace, Pandey said, with the support of faculty mentors and industry experts.
“That was the whole motivation, to ramp up the formal education process and to condense it, to give it in a package form,” Pandey said.
Aiming for future growth
In its inaugural year, Pandey said the program will admit around seven students. Plans are to expand enrollment to nine students in the next year and then to 12 students in the next, for a total of 28 students for the length of the grant.
Community colleges are a crucial part of this initiative, Pandey said, as students attending two-year institutions are one of the targeted demographics for enrollment in the program. ISU will partner with Iowa Central Community College, Iowa Western Community College and Eastern Iowa Community Colleges to offer their students a chance to apply, as well as certain ISU students.
Students need to have physics and math courses listed on their transcript in order to qualify, Pandey said. Those interested in applying will submit their transcripts to a National Science Foundation portal that is set to open over the college’s Thanksgiving break at the end of November.
Pandey said selections of the first cohort will take place in January and the program will kick off in February, starting with virtual instruction until summer arrives. This is when students will get hands-on experience in the ISU Microelectronics Research Center and at PowerFilm Solar, an Ames-based company focused on solar cells and other power solutions.
“In the first year, we will see what is the retention of the materials that we are teaching, how good the students can absorb the material, and can they actually line up internships and job opportunities after they graduate,” Pandey said.
Students to receive expert training, mentorship
Six U.S. semiconductor companies, including PowerFilm Solar, Collins Aerospace in Cedar Rapids, Western Digital in California, Wolfspeed in New York, Canon Nanotechnologies in Texas and Analog Devices in Massachusetts, are partnering with Pandey and his team for the program. The companies are helping to steer what students will study, Pandey said, as well as planning to give talks and interact with students.
As these companies have told Pandey they’re looking for hires who already have hands-on experience, he said students participating in the program will also have a faculty member to act as a mentor and work with them on research projects. Students will also train in leadership skills and have access to the ISU campus and its resources, including peer mentors, study groups and more.
“There is a critical shortage within the country for advanced skills in this area, and we want to be the leaders to provide that, at least within Iowa,” Pandey said.

(Photo by Dana DiFilippo/New Jersey Monitor)Gov. Phil Murphy submitted nearly 100 nominations to a slew of state boards and commissions Thursday in what is likely to be the grandest tranche of nominees before he leaves office on Jan. 20.
Many of the 97 nominations referred to the Senate Judiciary Committee Thursday would extend the terms of individuals already sitting on a range of state bodies, though others would install individuals in new and consequential positions and keep them there at least partway through Gov.-elect Mikie Sherrill’s term.
Micah Rasmussen, director of Rider University’s Rebovich Institute for New Jersey Politics, said Murphy’s lame-duck move is “not unusual at all.”
“Lame duck is an opportunity to clear the deck, and that’s going to be true of any outgoing governor,” Rasmussen said. “I guess the thing that makes it a little unusual for New Jersey standards is that you have a Democrat who’s succeeding a Democrat.”
Sherrill is the first Democrat to succeed a two-term Democratic New Jersey governor in more than 60 years, and her pending ascent as the state’s chief executive could complicate some nominations, though other positions can be filled or emptied at the governor’s say-so.
The list of new Murphy nominations is long and varied, and includes some of the governor’s top advisers.
Mahen Gunaratna, Murphy’s communications director and a close longtime aide, was nominated to a seat on the Horizon Blue Cross Blue Shield board of directors. The part-time post comes with an $82,000 salary.
Gunaratna, who has led the administration’s messaging on public worker health benefit reforms, would fill the seat currently held by former Assemblyman Ralph Caputo.
“I think his nomination in this case may have more to do with his involvement in the subject matter and his interest in the subject matter,” Rasmussen said.
Murphy nominated his chief counsel, Kate McDonnell, to a seat on the Rowan University-Rutgers Camden Board of Governors, along with Community Affairs Commissioner Jacqueline Suárez.
Hudson County Democratic Chairman Craig Guy received a nomination to the board of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, and Kevin O’Toole, the board’s chairman, was nominated for another term.
Murphy nominated Republican former state Sen. Kip Bateman, Democratic State Committee vice chair Peg Schaffer, and Brian Woods, chief of staff to the 8th Legislative District’s GOP lawmakers, to the State Parole Board. Schaffer is also Somerset County’s Democratic chairwoman.

The Idaho Legislature during the 2025 session approved House Bill 345, which moved oversight of Idaho’s entire Medicaid program to a managed care organization, added work requirements for some people, and required cost sharing of services for participants, among other sweeping changes. 
Idaho governor signs bill to privatize management, add work requirements to Medicaid program

The Idaho Department of Health and Welfare is seeking public comment through a statewide survey that’s open through Dec. 31, according to a press release from the agency. The survey is aimed at Medicaid members, providers, managed care organizations, and pharmacy benefit managers. 
“Our goal is to build a managed care system that truly reflects what Idahoans need from their health care,” Health and Welfare Director Juliet Charron said in the release. “We want to hear directly from the people we serve and from those who deliver care. Your voices will help us build a system that supports better access, strong outcomes, and long-term sustainability.”
The agency is also hosting in-person listening sessions around the state to hear from people currently using Medicaid, family members or caregivers of those on Medicaid, health care providers, and other community partners. 
The listening session schedule is:

Dec. 15, 2025 | Rexburg
Jan. 6, 2026 | Caldwell
Feb. 3, 2026 | Virtual only
March 10, 2026 | Gooding

Idaho health officials have said it will take years to shift Idaho’s Medicaid program to managed care, the Idaho Capital Sun previously reported. 
Idaho Medicaid to be privately managed in 2029, health officials expect

Many of Idaho’s Medicaid services had been provided what’s called a “fee-for-service” model, by which health care providers give the care to participants and then get reimbursed by Medicaid. Around 256,000 Idahoans use Medicaid services, according to numbers reported in September by Health and Welfare. 
The state briefly went to a new model in which services overseen by local doctor-led organizations, in a unique-to-Idaho system called value-based care, which is expected to end in 2026. 
Under managed care, a private contractor, or MCO, will oversee all services, such as doctor visits, prescriptions and hospital stays. 
The work requirements under the new program will affect patients in Medicaid expansion, a program approved by Idaho voters in 2018 to open eligibility to those who fell in the gap between earning too much for traditional Medicaid and not enough to qualify for federal premium assistance to afford private health care through the state marketplace. 
As of September, there were 89,881 people using Medicaid expansion services in Idaho.

(Photo by Michael Achterling/North Dakota Monitor)The North Dakota State Investment Board on Friday delayed approval of roughly $1.3 million in bonuses to 12 Retirement and Investment Office employees intended to reward strong performance of the state’s investment funds.
Seven of the bonuses exceed $100,000, with the top one exceeding $293,000. If the bonuses are ultimately accepted, it would be the first time the agency awards them.
Bonus pay is common in other states’ investment programs, said Retirement and Investment Office Executive Director Jodi Smith, though the agency didn’t implement the pay structure until 2024.
It introduced the new compensation plan to encourage investment managers and other staff at the Retirement and Investment Office to bring in more money for the state. The Legislature gave the agency the authority to create the pay program in 2023.
The Retirement and Investment Office invests state money on behalf of the State Investment Board, some of which is managed by in-house investors. The top four funds are the Legacy Fund, the Public Employees Retirement System, the Teachers Fund for Retirement and Workforce Safety and Insurance. 
Smith said offering bonus pay helps make jobs at the agency attractive, and incentivizes employees to make as much money for North Dakota as possible.
“We’re not here to support a typical state agency,” she said.

For employees to get the bonuses this year, the State Investment Board’s top four funds had to exceed certain earnings benchmarks between July 1, 2024, and June 30, 2025.
The benchmarks are meant to represent standard market performance, Smith said, so that employees are only rewarded if the state’s investments do better than average. Employees can also get additional bonus pay based on individual performance. Smith noted that a third-party consultant was hired to set the performance benchmarks.
The funds outperformed the benchmarks by more than $191 million.
Compared to that sum, a roughly $1.3 million reward for employees is a “modest and reasonable payout,” Smith wrote in a Friday memo to the State Investment Board.
According to Smith, most other states dole out bigger bonuses.
The bonuses don’t come from taxpayer money, they’re funded by earnings on the agency’s investments.
Most of the 12 employees recommended for bonuses are eligible for awards of up to 50% or 75% of their salaries, according to the memo. Top officials can receive up to 90% or 100% of their annual pay.
If the awards are approved, the largest bonus — $293,280 — would go to the chief investment officer, representing 94% of their annual salary of $312,000. The second highest bonus would be $170,726 to the deputy chief investment officer, who has a salary of $197,600.
Smith is not among those up for a bonus this year, since she only became the permanent executive director of the Retirement and Investment Office in June, she said. She said she will be eligible for a bonus in the future.
The State Investment Board on Friday delayed voting on the approval of the bonuses to address some unresolved legal questions raised by board members, Smith said. A board member had asked a question about the state law that created the bonus pay program and legal staff did not have the time to answer it before the meeting, she said.

Gov. Kelly Armstrong, chair of the State Investment Board, said Friday he has some reservations about the bonuses. He said he thought the state intended for it to be more difficult for the funds to meet their investment benchmarks.
Still, Armstrong said he doesn’t want to “pull out the rug” from underneath employees who were promised bonus pay.
Office of Management and Budget Director Joe Morrissette also said he has concerns about the program. Morrissette voted against adopting the pay plan in 2024 when he was on the State Investment Board as a Public Employees Retirement System appointee.
He said that the Bank of North Dakota and North Dakota Mill also offer employees bonuses, but that they’re not as large as those proposed by the Retirement and Investment Office. Other agencies can offer performance bonuses of $1,500 annually, he added.
“Generally, bonuses are very limited in state government,” said Morrissette, who still serves on the board as Office of Management and Budget director.
Morrissette said that while he supports offering the bonuses to investment managers, the awards are also available to some employees in more administrative and operational roles. He said he’s not sure that’s fair when people in similar positions in other state agencies don’t get those kinds of bonuses.
The State Investment Board on Friday also voted to keep working with a consulting firm, Funston Advisory Services, on a plan to restructure the State Investment Board.
The firm in a presentation to the board highlighted that the Retirement and Investment Office is under-staffed compared to similar state agencies, among other findings.
Smith pointed to this as another reason why her staff deserves the bonuses. She said it’s noteworthy that the state’s funds made so much money given the agency’s staffing constraints.
“Despite all these things that are kind of stacked against the agency, they’ve still been able to succeed,” Smith said.

Derek Kitchen said Thursday he’s joining the race to represent a newly drawn Utah congressional district favoring Democrats.,"Former state Sen. Derek Kitchen is pictured at the Utah Capitol in this undated photo. (Utah Senate Democrats)Former state Sen. Derek Kitchen said Thursday he’s joining the race to represent a newly drawn congressional district that is Utah’s first to lean Democratic in more than 20 years. 
Kitchen’s announcement follows two other Democrats — state lawmaker Katheen Riebe and former congressman Ben McAdams — in announcing a bid for the U.S. House seat ahead of the 2026 midterm elections. 
“Now, Utah has a newly drawn district — a strong, solidly Democratic district — and for the first time in a generation, we have the chance to elect a progressive leader who reflects the values of the people who live here and who has what it takes to fight back against Donald Trump and the MAGA Republican agenda,” Kitchen said in his announcement.
Utah Democrats likely to win congressional seat in 2026 if judge’s map order stands

“I’ve always fought for the issues that matter, even when it’s tough,” Kitchen continued. “I’m ready to carry that fight all the way to Congress.”
He is known in Utah for being one of the plaintiffs who sued the state in 2013, successfully overturning Utah’s ban on same-sex marriage. Kitchen went on to serve on the Salt Lake City Council and won election to the state Senate in 2018, where he served one term before losing in the Democratic primary to now-Sen. Jen Plumb.  
As Democrats work to recapture a majority in the U.S. House, they see the new district in Utah as an opportunity to help accomplish that goal. 
“Every seat counts,” Ken Martin, chair of the Democratic National Committee, said in a statement earlier this month. 
Utah’s new map comes after a yearslong court battle that reached the Utah Supreme Court before landing back before a judge in Salt Lake City. A coalition of voting rights groups and voters sued after the state’s GOP-controlled Legislature in 2021 chose its own congressional map, instead of adopting new boundaries created by an independent, voter-approved commission. 
The state’s Republican legislative leaders have said they intend to appeal and keep fighting for their preferred maps.
While in the Utah Legislature, Kitchen noted he was in a minority of openly LGBTQ+ lawmakers nationwide and learned how to work with colleagues across the political aisle. 
In 2023, he was appointed by President Joe Biden’s administration as senior vice president at the federal Export-Import Bank, which aims to support U.S. jobs by encouraging the export of American goods and services. 
He’s also a restaurant owner who said running a small business taught him valuable lessons in serving people and building community.

“Of course I’m ordering mediation and I’m asking you all to get that mediated as soon as possible,” Gaines said to the attorneys.

Attorneys for the state and the AHSAA did not have comment after the hearing. Ivey and Ledbetter said in a joint statement Friday that they will continue to advocate for CHOOSE Act student-athletes.
“With today’s court decision, the temporary restraining order remains in place, allowing our CHOOSE Act student-athletes to continue competing,” the statement said. “We look forward to finding a permanent solution.”
A message seeking comment was left with the AHSAA Friday.
The CHOOSE Act is a voucher-like program that allows families to claim up to $7,000 per qualifying child for non-public education expenses, including private school tuition. The AHSAA considers the funds to be financial aid and requires CHOOSE Act recipients who transfer to another school to not participate in athletics for one year.
Ivey and Ledbetter allege that AHSAA’s eligibility requirements discriminate against student athletes who receive CHOOSE Act funds.
Gaines granted a temporary restraining order against AHSAA on Sept. 5. Ivey and Ledbetter added another plaintiff, Jaclyn Hall, parent of a CHOOSE Act recipient, in September.
AHSAA says the regulation is meant to ensure fairness. Attorneys representing the AHSAA  said in a filing last week Ivey and Ledbetter had no standing to file the lawsuit.

Since Oct. 2, the state health department has reported 52 measles cases related to an outbreak in the Upstate, plus three unrelated cases. Of the eight new cases reported this week, four came from exposures to known measles patients. It is unknown how the remainder contracted the disease, according to the health department.

Under 5: 10
5-17: 31
18+: 6

Most of the 137 people in quarantine Friday were students and staff at three public schools in the Upstate. The state health department did not say how many of the active measles cases came from each of the schools. When a student at a school tests positive, the schools send home every unvaccinated student to prevent spread, health officials previously said.
Lyman Elementary has 57 people in quarantine, Boiling Springs Middle School has 55, and D.R. Hill Middle School has one, according to the health department. The department did not specify how many unvaccinated people were students versus staff.
One person with an active case worked at Greenville Spartanburg International Airport and may have exposed travelers and fellow employees to the virus between 9 a.m. and 7 p.m. on Nov. 10 and 11. Another attended Way of Truth Church in Inman the evening of Nov. 7 and the morning of Nov. 9, according to the health department.
Anyone who visited the airport or church on those days should monitor themselves for measles symptoms and call a doctor if they get sick, according to the health department.
Symptoms of measles typically begin between a week and 12 days after exposure with a cough, runny nose and red eyes, along with a fever. Cases can then cause a red, blotchy rash that appears first on the face and spreads to the rest of the body.


Where to get vaccinated
From noon to 3 p.m. on Monday, Nov. 24, the mobile vaccination clinic will stop at Mt. Moriah Baptist Church in Spartanburg.


The best way to keep from getting and spreading measles is to get vaccinated, state epidemiologist Linda Bell has said.
Typically, children receive two doses of the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine, which is about 97% effective in protecting from the virus. All but two of the people who contracted measles were unvaccinated. The two who had their vaccines only had one dose, which is less effective than the full two doses.
After Monday, the state health department will stop routinely operating the mobile vaccine clinics is has run since mid-October.

El Senor Cactus, 1534 S. Gilbert St., Iowa City – During a Nov. 13 visit, a Johnson County inspector observed that the internal temperature of the restaurant’s grilled chicken reached only 152 degrees. The chicken was immediately removed from service and recooked to the required internal temperature of 165 before being served. In addition, house-made “Cancun sauce” had been held beyond the seven-day limit and had to be discarded.
The inspector also noted that several containers of prepared foods and sauces stored in a kitchen cooler did not have the required date-markings to ensure freshness and safety, and the vacuum-sealed frozen fish was being thawed while still sealed, creating a risk that any spoilage would go undetected.
Also, two containers of raw chicken were left out to thaw at room temperature on a food-prep table, a container of cooked beans was stored on the kitchen floor, and the inspector noted “excessive debris” that had built up in the microwave ovens and the interior of the kitchen’s two-door cooler.
La Mich Grocery, 1215-1221 Franklin St., Waterloo — During a Nov. 13 visit, a Black Hawk County inspector cited this establishment for 12 risk-factor violations, an unusually high number, and noted that the three-bay sink used to sanitize dishes did not have the required amount of sanitizing solution. Also, the establishment’s “food safety certification” had expired, and food items prepared several days earlier were holding at 45 to 48 degrees — too warm to ensure safety — and had to be discarded.
In addition, the salsa in the retail cooler was not date-marked to ensure freshness and safety, and a designated handwashing sink in the meat-deli area had meat debris in it, indicating it was being used for purposes other than handwashing. The inspector also noted, without elaborating, that the business “was not date-marking items correctly,” and that enchilada sauce and maize de pozole were being held past their maximum seven-day shelf life. Also, cooked food items were being cooled in large, sealed containers, a process that slowed the cooling process.
St. Ambrose University Cafeteria, 518 W. Locust St., Davenport — During a Nov. 12 visit, a Scott County inspector noted that access to handwashing sinks was blocked by a garbage can and a pail of detergent, and that food items — including homemade raspberry filling, fruit dip and lemon cream — were dated Oct. 24, a full 19 days prior to the inspection, indicating they had been held beyond the maximum of seven days.
Also, an open bag of lettuce was not date-marked to ensure freshness and safety; raw chicken was stored over ready-to-eat food items, risking cross-contamination; the food-prep coolers in the main kitchen and a cooler at the pizza station were marred by excess food debris, as were the pop dispensers and the salad station’s prep cooler.
The inspector also noted that there were no date-markings on food items inside the walk-in cooler or on opened bags of spinach in the “allergy food station,” or on the homemade salad dressing. In addition, the large stainless-steel mixer in the salad-prep area was marred by rust and peeling paint, and the floor underneath the kitchen equipment in the main kitchen was peeling and coming apart.
Jersey Grille, 5255 Jersey Ridge Road, Davenport — During a Nov. 10 visit, a Scott County inspector noted that kitchen employees were not following accepted handwashing practices, and that multiple unspecified food items were being held past their discard dates.
Also, the ice machine and fountain-drink machine each contained “debris and gunk,” there were no paper towels at four of the handwashing sinks in the kitchen and restrooms, the walk-in freezer’s compressor was leaking fluid onto “food and packaging” inside the cooler, food was being stored on the floor, and several food items were missing labels bearing the date of their opening or preparation.
In addition, soy sauce was being stored at room temperature rather than being refrigerated, apples were “discolored and rotting,” and heavy whipping cream that was dated Aug. 26, 2025 – 10 weeks prior to the inspection – was still being served. Also, vacuum-sealed frozen fish was being thawed while still inside its packaging, creating a risk that any spoilage would go undetected, and the floor below the fryers, the surface under the grills, the oven trays, the kitchen ceiling and the vent hoods were all marred by “debris, dust and gunk.”
La Leona, 2075 John F. Kennedy Road, Dubuque — On Nov. 7, a City of Dubuque inspector visited the establishment for a preopening inspection and cited the establishment for nine risk-factor violations. The inspector denied the business a license until a reinspection could take place at a later date.
Among the violations: The ice machine was marred by a layer of dust and debris and needed “a thorough cleaning before it is used,” there were no handwashing sinks in the ware-washing area or the women’s restroom, all of the handwashing sinks lacked soap, and all of the food-contact surfaces needed a more thorough cleaning, with all of the equipment noted as having a layer of dust. “Entire restaurant needs a more thorough cleaning,” the inspector observed.
Gordie’s Bar & Grill, 108 13th St., Centerville — During a Nov. 6 visit, an inspector for Appanoose, Davis, Lucas and Monroe counties found lettuce dated Oct. 17, 2025, and a can of Raid Ant & Roach Killer, unapproved for use in a commercial food establishment, in the kitchen. The inspector also reported finding sliced cheese and diced tomatoes that were not dated to ensure freshness and safety. “No thermometer to check food temperatures,” the inspector reported.
Izumi Sushi & Hibachi, 941 E. San Marnan Drive, Waterloo — During a Nov. 4 visit, a Black Hawk County inspector cited this establishment for 14 risk-factor violations, an exceptionally high number. Among the issues: sushi rice that was being prepared and then held was not marked with the time it was to be discarded; there was an unspecified “buildup” of some kind in the ice machine; raw meat was stored above ready-to-eat sushi ingredients, risking cross-contamination; and a food handler rinsed their hands while they were still gloved after being instructed to wash their hands.
In addition, a food handler breaded shrimp and other raw food products and then, without washing their hands, began handling ready-to-eat crab rangoon; fish to be used for sushi was not first removed from vacuum-sealed packaging before thawing, creating a risk that any spoilage would go undetected; a thermometer for checking food temperatures could not be located; gnats were found by the beer taps; the business was reusing soy-sauce buckets for food storage, and there was a buildup of ice inside the walk-in freezer.
Buchona’s Sports Bar & Grill, 229 16th Ave. SW, Cedar Rapids — During a Nov. 3 visit, a Linn County inspector cited this establishment for failing to sanitize dishes after washing and rinsing, and for failing to date-mark any of the food in the kitchen to ensure its freshness and safety.
The inspector also noted that while some food stored in the coolers and refrigerators was covered, many items were stored without lids or covers, exposing them to the risk of contamination. “Evidence of mold on shredded cheddar cheese,” the inspector observed.
Legends American Grill, 1425 W. 19th St., Newton — During a Nov. 3 visit, a state inspector made note of expired food items, including au jus with a discard date of Nov. 1, and sauteed onions and salsa that each had discard dates of Oct. 31. Also, equipment and utensils were not being sanitized as required, and the ice machine was unclean, with debris in the interior.
Baxter’s Grocery & Grill, 108 E. Main St., Fremont — During an Oct. 29 visit, a state inspector noted that all of the items in the coolers lacked date-markings to ensure freshness and safety. “Establishment does not appear to have a date-marking policy in place,” the inspector observed.
In addition, the interior of the ice machine was unclean, and food items in hot-holding — including marinara sauce measured at 120 degrees and beans measured at 127 degrees — were not hot enough to ensure safety and had to be placed on the stove and reheated to at least 165 degrees.
In addition, chicken was being thawed in a pot of standing water and the coolers lacked thermometers to help maintain safe food temperatures. “Floors, walls and ceiling in kitchen area not clean,” the inspector observed.
S & K Gas and Food, 18820 Bellevue Cascade Road, Zwingle — During an Oct. 29 visit, a state inspector cited this establishment for 10 risk-factor violations, an unusually high number for a convenience store that offers ready-to-eat sandwiches and limited food service. The inspector reported finding a bucket labeled “transmission oil” that was air drying in the kitchen along with various utensils and noted there were no date-markings on containers of commercially precooked hamburgers, sausages and egg patties.
Also, the handwashing sink was being used to store items and there were no records on file related to a certified food protection manager being on staff. The person in charge agreed that there would be at least one certified food protection manager on staff by April 29, 2026.
The business was last inspected in October 2020, according to state records.
The Corner Lounge, aka TNT Services, 207 E. Main St., Belmond — During an Oct. 27 visit, an inspector noted that cooked roast beef was being held at room temperature, with no heat source, and was measured at 97 degrees. The roast beef was then discarded.
Also, access to the kitchen handwashing sink was blocked, and the refrigeration unit of the kitchen’s make-table was not working, which meant that ham was being held at 58 degrees and sliced tomatoes at 63 degrees. In addition, the walk-in cooler was not working properly so cooked beef was holding at 46 degrees and cooked chicken at 45 degrees.
“Many foods were voluntarily discarded today,” the inspector noted. “Several prepared foods in the walk-in cooler were not date-marked.”
The inspector concluded the person in charge was not monitoring food and equipment temperatures, employee handwashing, food-cooling procedures, or ensuring that the food placed in storage was protected from contamination. “Dead insects” were observed throughout the kitchen and dishwashing areas, and containers of cooked food were “sitting directly on the floor in the walk-in cooler.” The stove, oven, kitchen walls and kitchen floor were not clean, the inspector added.
Jack Trice Stadium, Iowa State University, 1800 4th St., Ames — This inspection took place on Oct. 25, during the ISU vs. Brigham Young University football game. During the visit, a state inspector noted that the ice machine for the Sweet & Savory concession was visibly soiled, the sanitizing solution used by Campbell’s Corndogs had no detectable amount of sanitizing fluid in it, and Tom’s Coffee in the northeast section of the stadium was storing items in the designated handwashing sink.
Several concessionaires were holding hot food items below 135 degrees, including taco meat in the main kitchen that measured 79 degrees, pizza at Thirst Quenchers that measured 113 to 116 degrees, and pizza at Sweet & Savory that measured 110 to 120 degrees. The items were either discarded or reheated to at least 165 degrees.
Also, the Carlos Quesadillas outlet in the northeast section of the stadium had no hot water at the beginning of the inspection. Some concessionaires — including the median-floor skybox and Thirst Quenchers in the northwest section of the stadium — were not writing down the internal temperatures of food items or the time when the items were removed from temperature control so the staff would know when they  needed to be discarded. At the Victory Bell in the stadium’s northeast area, hot dogs were thawing out at room temperature.

This is Stories From The States. I’m Chris Fitzsimon. Here at States Newsroom, we know there’s a lot going on around the country every week, in every state. This week, we’re talking about mid-decade redistricting. Texas and California have grabbed most of the headlines in the battle. Now, GOP led states like Indiana are facing pressure from the president to redistrict. All while some states like Missouri, North Carolina, Ohio and Utah already have enacted new maps for the 2026 midterm elections. But Utah’s case is unique. That redistricting fight was spearheaded by Utah voters who ultimately won. Firstm that’s where we’re heading, and we’ll hear from one of the plaintiffs in the case.
Katharine Biele  
All you have to do is make a map that is fair to everyone. Everyone’s voice should matter.
Chris Fitzsimon  
Then we’ll check in with the Brennan Center for Justice to find out if all this mid-decade redistricting business is actually normal. Up first is a Utah News Dispatch reporter. We’ll hear from her in just a moment.
Chris Fitzsimon  
A Utah judge recently approved a redistricting map that would give Democratic candidates a good chance at winning one of the state’s US House seats in the 2026 midterm elections. This redistricting dispute started back in 2018 though, way before the Trump administration started pushing for mid-decade redistricting to rig the maps to try to keep control of the US House in 2026. Katie McKellar, a senior reporter from the Utah News Dispatch, has been closely covering this for years. She joins us now. Hi, Katie.
Katie McKellar  
Hi. Thanks for having me.
Chris Fitzsimon  
Thanks for being with us. All right, let’s jump in. Tell us about this. This case, it nowhere near started just this year. Give us a little bit of background on what’s at stake here.
Katie McKellar  
Oh yeah, there’s a long history here in Utah. So back in 2021, that year, the Republican majority Utah legislature repealed and replaced a ballot initiative that was narrowly approved by Utah voters in 2018. And that ballot initiative  driven by anti gerrymandering groups called Better Boundaries, sought to implement an independent redistricting process here in Utah, meant to guard against gerrymandering, and they argued that there were too many Democratic, independent and even more moderate Republican voters here that were being dispersed or cracked through the redistricting process. And so they put Proposition 4 on the ballot for voters to decide whether it should become law, and it passed. But Republican leaders here have long believed that they have the final say when it comes to ballot initiatives, and so they repealed and replaced Prop Four with a law known as SB 200 and essentially, what that law did was water down Prop Four and turn the independent redistricting commission that was supposed to draw the state’s maps into an advisory body that could ignore those maps.
Chris Fitzsimon  
So basically, the voters decided they wanted to do this with the independent commission. The Republican legislature said, ‘No, thanks’. We’re going to turn this into an advisory commission, even though the voters didn’t want that?
Katie McKellar  
Exactly, exactly. And so instead, they repealed and replaced that law with one that that turned into an advisory body that they could ignore. And so even though that independent commission drew a set of maps that year, lawmakers do their own and they adopted those maps and that congressional map and that set created four solidly Republican congressional districts, and that prompted pro democracy groups like the League of Women Voters of Utah, Mormon Women for Ethical Government and a handful of Salt Lake County voters who felt disenfranchised by that new congressional map to get together and sue. And they alleged that that 2021 map was a blatant gerrymander, and that lawmakers violated their rights to reform their government through a ballot initiative.
Chris Fitzsimon
So really, the lawsuit was about the ballot initiative as much as it was the districts. Sounds like.
Katie McKellar  
Absolutely it was about both. It was about gerrymandering and lawmakers overstepping on a ballot initiative. And so after that case spent several years winding through the courts. Ultimately, the Utah Supreme Court, on an appeal, sided with the plaintiffs on the claim that lawmakers violated their right to alter and reform their government, and that led a district court judge to deem the 2021 map the result of an unconstitutional process. So she didn’t rule, she didn’t weigh in on whether it was a gerrymander, but she did say it was an unlawful map because it was the result of repealing and replacing a ballot initiative. And so she she voided that 2021 map and ruled that Utah must go through a court ordered redistricting process to put in place a lawful congressional map to be used next year in the 2026 elections, and that’s how we got where we are today.
Chris Fitzsimon  
Thank you. It’s not a simple topic. I think you did a great job explaining it for us. And so tell us when the Trump administration got involved and people thought that they were going to have some role in this.
Katie McKellar  
So while mid, mid decade redistricting is is a debate happening all over the country right now, Utah’s mid-decade redistricting process right now is unique, because this was court ordered this was a judge saying Utah lawmakers overstepped, we need to fix it. And so it’s very unique compared to the other conversations happening in states like California and Texas.
Chris Fitzsimon  
Right. And so now tell us what happened. The map that was chosen does appear to give Democrats a chance at winning one of these districts. From what I’ve read, a lot of this revolves around Salt Lake County, which is the most populous county in the state.
Katie McKellar  
Yeah, so over the last several a couple of months, really, this court ordered process took a long time. The judge took several weeks to hear from both sides, the legislative attorneys and attorneys for the plaintiffs and each side. She gave an opportunity to submit some maps to consider. So the legislature voted on a map known as map C that lawmakers contended abided by Proposition Four’s criteria, and that would be fair. And you know, looking at that map compared to the 2021 map, it is true that it was a bit more competitive for Democrats, but it would still result in four pretty solidly red congressional districts, and then the plaintiff submitted two options. One map was a lease change map based off of the map that the lawmakers approved to just kind of tweak the boundary so it didn’t split as many cities. Or they also submitted another one that was drawn with an algorithm that was created based off of Proposition Four’s criteria, and that map is the one the judge ultimately picked. And in that map, there’s the first congressional district is concentrated around the northern part of Salt Lake County, which is a very populated part of Utah. And the result is three pretty, like, really safe Republican districts, and one pretty safe Democratic district.
Chris Fitzsimon
Somebody described to me that the old maps that they were under and some of the proposals that weren’t adopted look like a pizza cutter had done them that they divided up most of the population into into pizza slices so the Republicans could maintain control.
Katie McKellar  
Oh yeah, that has been a strategy for a long time. And you know, the plaintiffs in the lawsuit alleged was blatant gerrymandering Republicans here, they like to describe it as pizza slice, or mixing urban and rural voices, so that urban and rural voices in each district are represented on the federal level. Well, the plaintiffs allege, you know, that’s just cover to crack Salt Lake County into four different pieces so that there would not be a Democratic district.
Chris Fitzsimon  
And what was the reaction there, when the court chose the map that gives the Democrats a chance to claim one of the districts?
Katie McKellar  
Oh, the the plaintiffs in the case were thrilled. They thought that was a great win, because that map, to them, was based wholly off of Propositions Four’s criteria. Democrats were thrilled, Republicans were angry. There’s been a ton of backlash from Republicans. I mean, even before the judge picked that map, some Republican lawmakers began saying, if she didn’t pick their map that they submitted to the court map see that they would argue it would amount to malfeasance, because they still firmly believe, despite all the court rulings, that the Utah constitution ultimately gives them and only them, the ability to pick maps in the redistricting process. And so couple of things have been happening. Republicans and a group called Utahns for Representative Government are pursuing another ballot initiative to repeal Proposition Four to go on the ballot in 2026 for voters to consider. And in the meantime, I think we can still expect plenty of court appeals, legislative attorneys saying they’ll be willing to take it all the way to the US Supreme Court if necessary. But you know, barring some crazy upset, because we’ve already hit the deadline for a map to be used in 2026 even if they went on appeal. I don’t know if there’s even time to put a different map in place for 2026 but 2028 who knows? We’ll just have to see.
Chris Fitzsimon  
The judge has been attacked, right? And there’s even been like talks of impeaching the judge. It really has gone to a new level it seems like.
Katie McKellar
We’ll have to see if those threats are just threats, or if, if lawmakers actually try to carry that out. One lawmaker has said he’s open a bill file to do articles of impeachment, but I haven’t been able to get the senate president or the house speaker on record solidly saying yes, we’re going to try to impeach her, so we’ll have to see.
Chris Fitzsimon
Right. Well, we will check back with you. Katie, thanks for all your great reporting there, and thanks for being with us. Thanks. Chris. Katie McKellar is a senior reporter at the Utah News Dispatch. That outlet is a part of state’s newsroom. Since chatting with Katie, the Utah judiciary has issued a statement addressing threats to Judge Diana Gibson, who ruled on the maps. They addressed the heated political reaction as well as the threats of violence to Judge Gibson saying, “threats of violence against judges or court personnel are unacceptable, dangerous and may violate state of federal laws”. As Katie mentioned, the approved map drawn by the plaintiffs of Utah’s redistricting lawsuit was a collective effort of nonpartisan groups, faith based organizations, a legal center, and a handful of Salt Lake County voters who all said they just wanted fair maps. In a moment, we’ll meet one of the plaintiffs from that case. We’ll be right back.

After almost seven years of a legal battle against a GOP led state legislature in Utah, a broad coalition of plaintiffs finally had their congressional district map approved by federal judge. It wasn’t easy, and has involved a referendum that lawmakers ignored, legal machinations and now calls to impeach a judge. Joining us now with one of the people who was part of this redistricting fight, Katharine Biele is the President of the League of Women Voters of Utah. She joins us now. Hello, Katharine. Thanks for being here.
Katharine Biele  
Thank you so much Chris.
Chris Fitzsimon  
So Katharine, your group was one of the plaintiffs in this case, and now a judge has approved the maps you and other Utahns had sought, right.
Katharine Biele  
They did. I mean, we were thrilled.
Chris Fitzsimon
You were thrilled. I was gonna ask your reaction. Were you surprised?
Katharine Biele  
Not completely. We had very good arguments. I mean, our arguments were based in the Utah State Constitution, Article One, Section two, which gives the citizens the right to change the form of government. So we had a very good argument. We were never trying to leave the legislature out of it. We totally expect the legislature to draw the maps. All we require is that they draw them fairly.
Chris Fitzsimon
Just to be clear, the maps that had been drawn or that were drawn by the General Assembly, or the ones that they were were promoting, really, I always hear it as an outsider to Utah, hear it described as like pizza slices, which keeps sort of all the parts of Salt Lake City separated in effect.
Katharine Biele
And it’s not just Salt Lake City, but Salt Lake Salt Lake County. This is where the hub of the population lives. They divided the county into four slices going down to the very tip of Southern Utah, St George, so we in urban Salt Lake have the same representative as those down in southern Utah.
Chris Fitzsimon  
And what was the reaction from the legislature and the proponents, or the I guess the people who wanted to continue to draw the maps the way they had been drawn.
Katharine Biele  
The legislature is up in arms. They will not stop this should have been easy. I mean, how hard is it to draw a fair map? It’s not a partisan thing. It is. Just look, this is these are communities of interest. Salt Lake County is one community of interest. Southern Utah is another. The rural, rural areas are another. So it’s just really not that hard. They were furious because they thought we were taking away their responsibility, which we are not.
Chris Fitzsimon  
You know, Utah has a reputation, I think, from afar, and I think I’m sure it feels that way a lot of times in Utah you have Republican governors in the past have reached across the aisle. There’s been a lot of national publicity. They’ve been the leaders in sort of a different kind of campaigning. So I think there’s a perception that politics in Utah hasn’t gotten to the bitter level that we’ve seen around the country. And yet it feels like in this case, maybe that has changed some.
Katharine Biele  
I will say that it may be changing a little. This is all based around the national politics and the kind of national politics that are coming down to Utah. There are many people here, many legislators who think that whatever Trump says and whatever he does, they should do however. We also have enough. I mean, we respect the legislature, and the legislators do have good intentions. They just have to get away from the whole idea that only Republicans can be in charge of everything.
Chris Fitzsimon  
Do you have trouble as a citizen activist or a member of an organization, getting some voters to understand really what’s at stake. I think sometimes, even when I’m talking to folks about redistricting battles, and we’ve had a lot of them in states that I’ve been in, people sometimes their eyes glaze over and they want to talk about a lot of other issues. But this feels like a in some cases, a technical thing.
Katharine Biele  
Well, and this is it’s hard, it is very difficult, and I think the legislature has made it even. More difficult on purpose. They want the citizens to be confused and to say, ‘Okay, we’re going to leave it to the legislature, because we don’t get it.’ It’s not that hard. All you have to do is make a map that is fair to everyone. Everyone’s voice should matter. We don’t all win. We just need to have a voice. I have heard as a league of women voters. We register voters all the time. What they say to us is, why should we vote? We know what the outcome will be. This at least gives those voters a chance. Is it over? No, it probably will never be over. I mean, the legislature has talked about appealing. You know, if they appeal to the Supreme Court, that is really a delaying tactic, because our Supreme Court ruled unanimously in our favor. So it’s unlikely that they would do anything different. But I can’t say I’m not a lawyer. They have talked about running an initiative, which is ironic, a citizens initiative to overturn a citizens initiative. And that is exactly what you said. It’s because people are confused, and they think, Oh, well, we can confuse them more, and they will just vote our way to get rid of Proposition Four.
Chris Fitzsimon  
Well, I really appreciate you being with us, and thanks for all your efforts for democracy there in Utah. Thank you very much.
Katharine Biele
Thank you too.

This week, a federal court blocked Texas from using their new congressional maps for the 2026 election. Texas was the first state pushed by the President to take part in this unusual mid-decade redistricting scheme. This move has led state lawmakers across the country to talk about redistricting when they only discuss it every 10 years. Is all this mid decade redistricting now going to be the new normal nationally? Coming up, an expert from the Brennan Center for Justice will help us figure that out. Then Evening Wrap newsletter author Danielle Gaines will join us about the story she’s looking out for. We’ll be right back.

Congressional district maps are generally redrawn every decade after the US Census, unless a court intervenes and orders state lawmakers to redraw them to settle a lawsuit. But the Trump administration has been pushing GOP led states to redistrict this year, purely for political reasons, to make it harder for Democrats to take over control of the House in the 2026 election. What are the long term effects of the break from precedent, and what happens if it becomes the new normal and maps are drawn every two years instead of every 10? We spoke with Kareem Crayton. He’s the vice president of the Brennan Center for Justice’s Washington DC office, and he has a doctorate in political science. Just a note. We spoke with Kareem before the news broke in Texas this week where a federal court blocked Texas from using their new congressional maps for the 26th election. Now they have to go back to their 2021 maps, which, by the way, are already gerrymandered by the Republican controlled General Assembly. He joins us now, Kareem, thanks for being here. Delight to be with you. Thank you. Well, what do you make of this overall? I think if we were sitting here a year ago, it’s hard to imagine the pressure being brought on so many states to dramatically change the way they draw district lines.
Kareem Crayton
Yeah, about a year ago, I think most of us thought that the only movement was going to be in the courts, with things that were already on the table. I think it is hard to have predicted such a massive number of states jumping into the pool and that most of the disruption and chaos is coming really at the instigation of the White House.
Chris Fitzsimon  
It puts a good government advocates like folks at the Brennan Center in a bit of a tough place at the beginning of all this national mid-decade redistricting discourse, after Governor Greg Abbott announced that he was doing that in Texas, there was a lot of discussion about, should states that have commissions or states that are committed to trying to drawing on gerrymandered districts also play what did you make of that sort of the machinations there?
Kareem Crayton  
Well, I would say the tough position that we’ve been in is actually one that preceded Governor Abbott’s move, and it is where the Supreme Court of the United States failed to adopt a national standard. In the absence of that, notwithstanding the fact that the Supreme Court said it had no particular opinion about political gerrymandering, number of states saw that as an invitation. And I think what we’re seeing is the result of that. So both. For what Texas has done, and California and other states have done, in reaction, is in some ways not surprising, if also quite lamentable.
Chris Fitzsimon  
To have a legislature, for example, Texas, who already gerrymandered the districts with their own majority come back and, in effect, re gerrymander them. Is this? What is this unprecedented? Had you seen anything like this before?
Kareem Crayton  
I think, writ large, it is unprecedented. It is fair to say that states have gone back to the well in the past, first time where we’ve seen, you know, the legislature in Texas at least go back and say, Oh, we didn’t gerrymander enough. And certainly, when you add to that, the National reaction where some states are going back to say, the public, we want to do a re gerrymandering of this state, is that okay, in light of all the other things that you’ve seen, and in California, the people said, Yes,
Chris Fitzsimon  
I covered redistricting in North Carolina for a long time. And what do you make of this? For the voters? I think it’s already sort of hard to explain to folks who don’t do this for a living, who are just living their lives trying to make ends meet, and now they can’t vote for the person they used to their districts are different. How do you communicate this effectively, the importance of this to folks who aren’t really involved in the political process.
Kareem Crayton  
The people that are supposed to be served by the redrawing of districts are the people who are supposed to be represented, and those are voters, and not the electeds. And what you see with these changes, in the absence of a national standard is that people who live right next to each other, who share the same city, who understand the same sets of issues that affect them all are now divided by essentially arbitrary lines, and they’re done really for no other purpose than to serve a political interest, and in fact, an interest that might not even be in the state that’s supposed to be represented. So I think all of these, you know, line drawing and re line drawing efforts are bringing people farther and farther away from power and democratic system. People aren’t supposed to be, particularly in elections, the source of power, and that’s of real concern.
Chris Fitzsimon  
We also had some news recently from the Indiana Capitol Chronicle, despite visits from the vice president and pressure from the president, many Republicans there are choosing not to participate in this mid cycle redistricting.

Well, we’re seeing a lot of folks, I think, look at this and say, one, what does it cost us to try to do this? Yes, maybe the White House really wants us to do it, but what do we lose by going back to the will and redrawing the map? And frankly, it is probably not off of anybody’s mind. The fact that we had elections in November that I think, surprised a lot of people. And so if you’re doing these redraws, you’ve got to think about the world, not just as it exists right now, but what it’s going to look like a year from now and beyond. And in places where, if you’re a Republican you’re looking at, you know, what was pretty much a clean sweep behind the Democratic Party. And you got to wonder, is there a line at which and pardon the pun, but yes, if you cross that line in drawing new district maps, do you make yourself less likely in a democratic wave year to be competitive? Again? This is sort of done from the perspective of partisanship. But what is lost in all of this is the people ultimately are going to want to choose. And I think the real challenge that a lot of people are grappling with is, well, look, we might want a certain political outcome, but if the public overwhelmingly sees us as grabbing more power than we’re due, it might be that there’s a wave so big that we can’t gerrymander our way out of it.
Chris Fitzsimon
You mentioned a national standard. Is there some, some world, ideal world, where all this publicity and frustration leads us back to a conversation about how everybody should do redistricting in some fair and open and honest way?
Kareem Crayton
Well, I certainly hope so. The Congress of the United States still has the ability to say to the public, you know what? We hear you. And there should be a national standard, and we’re going to carve one. To carve one out that might not be true, that may or may not be true of this existing Congress, but the public is frustrated enough. It’s entirely possible that, you know, the public votes for people who will step into the breach. And by the way, it’s important to note you now hear both Republicans and Democrats, often, many of them on the losing end of a redistricting fight. Say, though there should be a national standard. So I think the more that becomes, as you point out, a priority for the public as a whole, but also for the elected to recognize. You know, in the main, this may or may not be a matter of whether or not I gain from a particular line drop, or whether the country gains overall from a system that makes sure that people at the forefront of how districts get drawn

Coming up. We’ll check with evening rap newsletter writer Danielle Gaines, stay with us.
Chris Fitzsimon  
Joining us now is Danielle Gaines. She writes States Newsrooms, daily newsletter called The Evening Wrap Danielle, it’s great to see you. Let’s let’s jump in. Talk about the big things this week and what’s coming up. First of all. What big stories Did you notice this week?
Danielle Gaines
Well, we’ve had some coverage about the changes that are coming to programs in the United States who have typically assisted refugees when they arrive here, and so our reporter in Rhode Island spent some time at the refugee Dream Center there, and she was talking with women in a class that’s meant to improve their English skills, but it’s also about so much more for them. So it’s like cultural, emotional, social. It was a really beautiful story just getting to know the women, but it also kind of touched on the fact that this was a place that is meant to be filled with love help these people feel at home, and instead, a lot of the emotion there has been replaced with fear, which is all too familiar to this group of people and uncertainty the folks who go there are among hundreds of 1000s of lawful immigrants who will soon lose food benefits in the US, as provisions of the one big, beautiful Bill act take effect. And in addition to food benefits, there are other things coming up that are big changes for programs that we established to help people get on their feet so the work requirements and Medicaid are going to be a problem. These are folks who aren’t working because they’re trying to gain proficiency in English so they can work, and they’ll lose support during that process. The story also had an economic analysis of refugees and immigrants in Rhode Island that I found really interesting. So 15% of the state are immigrants, and $5.5 million in annual food benefits will be gone under these provisions, and soon child tax credits will be gone as well, to the tune of $30 million so it’s a big shift on a family level, but also, you know, on a state economic level,
Chris Fitzsimon  
Yeah, I think that bill still feels like it’s hanging over so many people. When the when those provisions take effect?
Danielle Gaines  
Yeah, one of the coordinators there said that’s going to be, quote, disastrous, once it all kind of takes shape together.
Chris Fitzsimon
What about coming up next? What about things to look for?
Danielle Gaines  
Yeah, so this week, I’ve been featuring a special mini series from our reproductive rights reporting team on the state of state shield protections for abortion medications. And so there’s a lot that has been going on with that, and a lot that is going to be going on with that. So over the series of stories, our team looked at the status of state shield laws as well as efforts to puncture them, as well as challenges to mifepristone in lawsuits and the federal regulatory level. So there is an ongoing lawsuit related to the federal regulations The ACLU is seeking information, kind of just looking at what is the Trump administration’s FDA actually looking at with these long established medications, and who are they talking to as they’re looking at it. So that’s a lawsuit to be on the lookout for. And then on the state side of things, shield laws that protect abortion providers have been established in lots of states to protect them from out of state lawsuits, but a new bill is taking effect in Texas, and that aims to kind of puncture the durability of those laws. It’s was described as the first bill in the country to explicitly target shield laws and shield providers, and it gives any Texan the power to sue anyone involved in mailing an abortion pill to the state. So we’ll have to see what unfolds there.
Chris Fitzsimon  
It seems like then, I mean, it’s been ongoing, but the next frontier of the whole abortion debate seems like the battle over these, this medication and access to it. Yes, agreed. Well, what about one last thing? What shall we leave us together with?
Danielle Gaines
Well, just a time for Thanksgiving. I figured that we’d talk about food waste, not to be a downer, timely, but our friends at the Iowa capital dispatch covered a study by the State Department of Natural Resources, and that study found that Iowans throw away, on average, 200 pounds of food each year. When you account for industrial food waste. On top of that, it’s about 300 pounds. Wow. And that’s actually less than what the EPA estimates for the country as a whole, which is between 492 pounds and more than 1000 pounds. So this study was just a way to look at how to cut down on food waste, how food waste can be diverted, how to avoid it in the first place. So I thought I’d share some of the tips that I gleaned from it. You know, the first one is to purchase your food thoughtfully, and then, in terms of disposal, you can seek ways to donate something that you don’t want, share it with a neighbor, a friend, compost it instead of sending it to the landfill. My personal favorite is to just immediately freeze. So if you have a veggie tray at Thanksgiving, like, don’t just shove it the back of your fridge to let it waste away. Cut it up right away, put it in a baggie, and then some night, you’ll want soup, and it’ll be right there, ready cut up for you.
Chris Fitzsimon  
That’s a great idea. It does seem at every party, the veggie tray is the last to go.
Danielle Gaines  
I know it’s such a shame. I also think you could waffle iron just about anything. From Thanksgiving, which is a great way to use up leftovers.
Chris Fitzsimon  
Wow, I haven’t thought of that one. I might try that. Do I really appreciate you as always you being with us.
Danielle Gaines  
Yes, thank you so much.

Credit: Related DigitalA handful of environmental advocacy groups on Thursday submitted a petition to intervene as energy regulators review contracts for one of the state’s largest energy companies to supply energy for an incoming data center in Saline Township. 
The Sierra Club, Michigan Environmental Council, Natural Resources Defense Council and Citizens Utility Board of Michigan are calling on the Michigan Public Service Commission to initiate a contested case proceeding in reviewing DTE Energy’s contracts, arguing that this type of proceeding is needed for the groups to properly evaluate the company’s proposal and advocate for Michiganders who will be impacted by the project.
At the end of October, DTE filed an ex parte request with the commission, which oversees Michigan’s energy companies. This type of request does not require public hearings, nor does it allow interested parties to conduct discovery and file testimony for the commission to review before making its decision on the contracts. 
Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel filed her own request asking the commission to treat the matter as a contested case to ensure customers aren’t left to foot the bill on energy costs tied to the project.
While the public service commission has since announced plans to hold an online session for public comments, Nessel argued that taking comments without hosting formal hearings on the matter or declaring a contested case, amounted to “performative listening rather than thorough public scrutiny.”
Michigan regulators to host public hearing on DTE contracts for Saline Township data center

As of Tuesday, Nessel’s office said the commission had not responded to her request. Matt Helms, a public information officer for the public service commission, declined to comment Friday when asked if the regulatory body had responded to either Nessel’s request, or the environmental organizations’.
In a statement to the Michigan Advance, Ryan Lowry, a DTE spokesperson, said the contracts under review by the public service commission ensure that its customers rates will not increase as a result of the data center project, which is being developed by Chat GPT creator Open AI, Oracle and Related Digital. 
“DTE, like the Attorney General and the [public service commission], is focused on customer affordability, which is why we have taken additional steps in our contracts with Oracle to ensure the data center will absorb all costs associated with the storage assets that are being developed as part of this project,” Lowry said.
However, both Nessel and the environmental intervenors argue the company hasn’t provided enough evidence in its request to prove that residents will not be impacted by the deal. 
“Transparency is not optional. Under Michigan law, the [commission] cannot approve utility requests that will result in increased costs for ratepayers without giving other interested parties an opportunity to fully participate in the proceeding,” Elena Saxonhouse, a managing attorney with the Sierra Club’s Environmental Law Program, said in a statement. “With so many data center proposals on the way, and so many questions about how each project will impact already high utility bills for Michiganders, the [commission] cannot allow utilities to rush through contract approvals without scrutiny.”
In their filing with the public service commission, the environmental groups pointed to the body’s decision in March to deny Consumers Energy, another major energy provider, ex parte approval in seeking to revise its terms of service for large energy customers like data centers, with the commission noting “The electric load of new data centers presents unique and significant cost implications, and the development of an evidentiary record to consider the… application is prudent and reasonable.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Related-Digital-Rendering-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-21 15:58:07.991553

Chris Murphy said he’s ‘never seen anything like’ Trump's posts. Sen. Richard Blumenthal said the president was 'normalizing violence',"U.S. Sens. Chris Murphy and Richard Blumenthal slammed President Donald Trump for calling a video published by Democratic lawmakers “seditious behavior, punishable by death.”
“I’ve never seen anything like what the president said yesterday,” Murphy said during a press conference in Hartford on Friday morning. “The president made a threat of execution against his political opponents.”
On Thursday, a video posted to X featured six Democratic lawmakers — all veterans of the military and intelligence services — addressing U.S. service members and encouraging them to protect the Constitution, even if that means defying orders.
“Americans trust their military, but that trust is at risk. This administration is pitting our uniformed military and intelligence community professionals against American citizens,” the lawmakers said in a video montage. “No one has to carry out orders that violate the law or our Constitution. We know this is hard and that it’s a difficult time to be a public servant.” 
The legislators featured in the video were Sen. Elissa Slotkin of Michigan, Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona, Rep. Jason Crow of Colorado, Reps. Chris Deluzio and Chrissy Houlahan of Pennsylvania and Rep. Maggie Goodlander of New Hampshire. 
While the video did not point to any specific “illegal” order, it came in the wake of Trump’s deployment of National Guard troops to U.S. cities, and in the midst of U.S. military airstrikes on vessels allegedly carrying drugs in the Caribbean and Pacific, which the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights said violated international law. 
Trump on Thursday responded with a slew of posts on his social media platform, Truth Social. “Insurrection. TREASON!” read one post. “This is really bad, and Dangerous to our Country. Their words cannot be allowed to stand. SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR FROM TRAITORS!!! LOCK THEM UP???” read another. 
The president also reposted a comment by another user that read, “HANG THEM GEORGE WASHINGTON WOULD !!”
During an appearance on Fox News on Friday, Trump walked back those comments, saying he wasn’t calling for the lawmakers’ execution. “I’m not threatening death, but I think they’re in serious trouble,” Trump said. 
Connecticut Senate Minority Leader Stephen Harding, R-Brookfield, said he didn’t agree with the president’s comments, but he believed people on both sides of the aisle have contributed to the growing political violence in the country.
“I would not say those comments. No one should be calling for anyone’s death,” Harding said. “We need to tamp down the rhetoric on both sides. Period.”
Blumenthal said Trump’s irresponsible comments stood in direct contrast to the sentiments he expressed after the murder of Charlie Kirk, when there were bipartisan calls to bring down the heat on political rhetoric. The senator also said he was worried Trump’s comments risked inciting violence among his most loyal supporters.
“It isn’t just that he is threatening public officials with death and violence. He is inflaming and encouraging his extremist followers,” Blumenthal said. “He is normalizing violence in this country. That is reprehensible for any public official, but particularly for the leader of the United States.”
On Thursday, Murphy posted a strongly-worded video to X calling on the wealthy and powerful who have “been sitting on the sidelines” to take a stand. “If you’re a person of influence in this country, maybe it’s time to pick a [expletive] side,” Murphy said.
On Friday morning, he reiterated that stance. 
“This is a moment to put your country and your democracy before your financial wellbeing,” Murphy said. “I don’t want to be in a world where death threats from the president of the United States become normalized and become background noise.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/TRUMP-SEDITION-1121-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-11-21 15:58:07.991553

Ned Lamont tapped Josh Hershman, a former deputy commissioner at the Connecticut Insurance Department, to succeed Andrew Mais.","Andrew Mais, who has led Connecticut’s Insurance Department for nearly seven years, announced Friday he is retiring from the position next week.
Gov. Ned Lamont tapped Josh Hershman, CEO of Immigrant Life Insurance Company of America and a former deputy commissioner at the insurance department, to succeed Mais.
“I’ve been at the department for almost seven years through some interesting times — the externalities we’ve had to face — everything from COVID to the federal government issues this year,” Mais, 66, said in an interview. “It’s been a demanding position.”
He declined to share his next move, other than to say he looks forward to spending time with his family.
Mais has overseen the department during several turbulent years, as insurers have persistently requested large increases on long-term care insurance plans and on health care coverage.
Department leaders faced criticism from residents over their approval of many sizable rate hikes for long-term care insurance.
A Connecticut Mirror investigation found the annual cost of maintaining those policies has leaped for many due to miscalculations by insurers on how long people would live, the price of care and how many would need it. Consumers face large rate increases, often exceeding 50% and, for a few dozen people, as high as 174%, according to a CT Mirror analysis.
A review of rate hikes from January 2019 to October 2024 shows that more than 17,000 people with long-term care policies have gotten hit with increases of 50% or more. Some of the biggest companies in the market, including Genworth Financial, Metropolitan Life Insurance Company and Transamerica Life Insurance Company, requested hikes for five years in a row beginning in 2019.
Lawmakers introduced more than a dozen pieces of legislation this year aimed capping increases, increasing transparency around rate hikes and other consumer protection measures. Some called for audit of the insurance department’s rate review process. The insurance sector opposed many of the bills.
Last week, NBC Nightly News published a report on long-term care insurance rate hikes in Connecticut that followed CT Mirror’s coverage.
“It’s all about consumer protection in what is often a difficult environment. We’ve had a team here … that has been steadfast in their commitment to that, so I feel good knowing we have done everything we can,” Mais said Friday.
“I believe there comes a time when somebody new should take over, somebody new should take the helm. I think I’ve done as much as I could for at this department. I spent the last almost seven years working with everyone to try to protect consumers. It’s simply time to pass the torch.”
Insurers in recent years have also requested steeper rate increases on health care plans, including seeking a 23% average hike on individual policies this year and 20.4% in 2022. The department approved average increases of 16.8% this year and 12.9% in 2022.
While running the insurance department, Mais focused on “ensuring that Connecticut consumers have the resources they need to adequately protect themselves and their properties and mitigate their risk,” officials with Lamont’s office said in a statement. That included the establishment of the Connecticut Severe Weather Mitigation and Resiliency Advisory Council in 2024, which aims to help homeowners and businesses maintain more resilient properties.
He worked previously for Deloitte’s Center for Financial Services and as a director at the New York State Insurance Department. Mais also led conversations on race, diversity and inclusion at the state level and within the insurance industry.
Mais’ last day is Nov. 28. Hershman will begin work on an interim basis Dec. 12. Lamont said he will formally submit his nomination to the legislature at the start of the 2026 regular session in February.
From 2019 to 2022, Hershman was deputy commissioner and chief operating officer of Connecticut’s insurance department, where he led projects that explored AI’s impact on insurance and championed data-driven regulatory modernization. Before that, he practiced law with a focus on complex business planning and litigation, officials said. He lives in Guilford.
“Focusing on consumer protection is the top priority of the insurance commissioner; consumer protection from the top down to the bottom will be my No. 1 priority,” he said in an interview.
“Having innovation in [insurance], trying to bring more opportunity for consumers, will help mitigate some of the cost issues that exist. Affordability is a huge issue in the state of Connecticut when it comes to health insurance, homeowners’ insurance — every insurance is expensive — and I’m going to do my very best to try to alleviate the affordability issue in Connecticut.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/2024_1021_SR_CommissionerMais_032-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-21 15:58:07.991553

Mike Rogers’ bid for the upper chamber of Congress has formally entered the race.
Former Michigan Republican Party Co-Chair Bernadette Smith launched her campaign to seek the GOP nomination for the U.S. Senate on Thursday, and with a campaign ad detailing her background and values.
Michigan Advance was the first to report that Smith had resigned this month from her state party post with ambitions to launch a Senate bid. It was an open question on whether she planned to run against Rogers, who is positioned as the party’s frontrunner in the race, or if she was eyeing an independent bid to forge an easier path to the November 2026 general election ballot.
A message seeking comment from Rogers’ campaign was not returned at the time of publication.
Smith made those rumors a reality when she formed a campaign committee with the Federal Election Commission.
In an email to donors, delegates and the party’s voters, Smith officially launched her campaign.
“America is at a critical point. Families are carrying heavy burdens. Freedoms are being challenged. Far too many elected leaders have forgotten who they serve,” Smith said in the email. “I am stepping forward because it is time to return to the principles that shaped this nation. Faith. Family. Freedom. These principles will direct every effort I make as we work to protect our liberties, strengthen our communities, and rebuild trust in public service.”
The Michigan Democratic Party responded to Smith’s campaign in a statement.
“Mike Rogers underperformed Trump by over 100,000 votes and lost as Trump carried the state. Now, his flailing second campaign is struggling to earn the confidence of Michigan Republicans,” party spokesperson Joey Hannum. “Warning signs are flashing for Republicans in Michigan because of Rogers’ anemic campaign and toxic agenda. His harmful missteps on the campaign trail, feeble support from the GOP base, and out-of-touch agenda will lead Michiganders to reject him at the ballot box once more in 2026.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-12-163257-1024x798.png,,,2025-11-21 15:58:07.991553

'We get to close our case successfully and on a happy note,' a DCF case worker said.","Cherie Yopp turned to her 11-year-old niece, Sherray Fortes, in a New Haven courtroom Friday, ready to finalize her adoption. After four years and 32 court dates, Sherray was finally legally hers.
“This is definitely a special day for our family,” Yopp, a special education teacher and case manager in Bridgeport, told relatives and state Department of Children and Families personnel gathered in the courthouse. “I know she has a bright future and I’m just here to guide her along the path.”
Sherray was placed with Yopp on an emergency basis four years ago amid worries about her parents’ mental health and substance use, according to DCF spokesman Peter Yazbak. Eventually, Sherray’s relatives and DCF decided it would be in her best interest to remain under her aunt’s care, and licensed Yopp for relative foster care.
Sherray has since made the honor roll with high honors and developed her love for art, music and the step team.
Addressing Yopp in the courtroom Friday, Sherray said, “Cherie, you’ve had me for such a long time and you love me even though I’m bad sometimes. … But you still love me within.”
Sherray was one of over 40 children who were adopted across Connecticut on Friday to mark CT Adoption Day. DCF has completed nearly 220 adoptions in the state in 2025 so far, according to Yazbak.
Sherray’s adoption by a member of her family is the type of placement Connecticut aims to achieve. DCF prioritizes reunifying children with their biological parents. But when that isn’t possible, it emphasizes kinship adoptions, where children are placed with another member of their family.
Over the last six years in Connecticut, around half of children placed in care outside their homes have been put with some member of their family, according to Yazbak.
John Rogers, program supervisor at the DCF office in New Haven, said the department has observed that kinship placements tend to have better outcomes. He said children are usually most comfortable with family members, especially immediately after they’re removed from their biological parents’ care.
“I’m not raising her by myself,” Yopp said of Sherray. “My kids are helping raise her. My sister’s helping. My dad who’s 90 has words of wisdom who’s helping raise her.”
Sherray’s adoption was four years in the making. The process for legal adoption is lengthy, and is especially prolonged if a biological parent protests the adoption. That’s what happened in this case.
“When it’s a family adoption, there’s a whole lot of family dynamics. Our family is very, very, very close-knit,” said Marie Barnes, Yopp’s sister.
The court is bound to consider protests by biological parents, and always prefers reunification if it would be safe for the child.
“Every bio parent has a due process,” Rogers said. “We respect that effort. Our goal is in every case to get a child home safely to their bio parent.”

Melissa Hodges, the social worker for this case, said that Yopp stepping up to care for Sherray has done “amazing things” for the child.
After a child is legally adopted, DCF has no further mandated involvement with the family.

The Trump administration in June announced plans to revamp the program, remove “burdensome regulatory requirements” and institute changes aimed at lowering costs. West Virginia revised its application down from connecting 110,000 locations to nearly 74,000 locations across the state. 
NTIA administrator Arielle Roth said in a news release Friday that “Benefit of the Bargain” reforms brought the plan’s cost down from $959 million to $545 million, a savings of 43%. 
“Congratulations to West Virginia on the approval of its BEAD Final Proposal — an important milestone in the state’s path toward universal connectivity,” Roth said.
The state’s approved plan includes nearly $546 million for 142 deployment projects that will connect 73,044 unserved and underserved locations throughout West Virginia. The federal agency is reviewing other allowable uses for additional funds and will issue updated guidance in the future, Morrisey said in a news release.
The build out phase of the project will take four years, through 2029, to complete, Morrisey said. 
Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, R-W.Va. praised the announcement in a news release Friday morning, saying that it brings West Virginia closer to deploying the largest amount of broadband funding for the state to date. 
“I am thrilled that West Virginia’s BEAD plan has been approved by the Department of Commerce,” Capito said in the release. “This means West Virginia is another step closer to better-connecting our homes, businesses, and classrooms across the state. I have had dozens of conversations with the Administration and our state officials, and while there is still a long road ahead to getting more West Virginians connected, we are well on our way with today’s announcement. I look forward to continuing to help our state in any way that I can as the plan moves its way through the approval process at NIST.”
In a news release Friday, Sen. Jim Justice, R-W.Va., who submitted the state’s initial proposal for the funding in November 2023 when he was governor, said he made sure the state was in the best position possible to receive the funding so it could keep modernizing its broadband infrastructure. 
“This funding is an absolute gamechanger and will cover thousands of locations throughout the state, fostering new opportunities, jobs, education, and investment,” Justice said. “This doesn’t get done without the Trump Administration, the NTIA approving West Virginia’s final proposal, great partners like Sen. Capito, and the countless state and federal stakeholders who made this possible. This historic investment in broadband technology and infrastructure will have a tremendous impact on West Virginia.”",https://westvirginiawatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/unnamed-2-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-21 15:58:07.991553

(Photo by John Normile/Getty Images)As corporate ownership of residential property across the country rises nationwide, researchers from the Lincoln Institute of Land Policy and the Center for Geospatial Solutions, which is housed at the institute, warn this rising trend has complicated the housing market for first-time buyers.
According to a joint “Who Owns America” report, nearly 9% of residential parcels in 500 U.S. counties are owned by a corporation. The concentrations exceed 20% in some cities, including St. Louis, Missouri; Harrisonburg, Virginia; and Franklin, Ohio. 
Researchers told Stateline they define “corporate ownership” as any rental property held under a formal business entity, whether a single-property LLC or large institutional investors such as Blackstone. They also track three factors: whether the owner is a business entity, whether it is based in- or out-of-state, and the size of its housing portfolio.
Roughly 2% of residential lots are owned by out-of-state investors. Investors have shifted their capital to older industrial metros such as St. Louis, along with Buffalo, New York, and Akron and Toledo in Ohio, where rents are rising and vacancy rates are extremely tight.
Can states, and a little bit of faith, convert church land into affordable housing?

Although corporate owners currently hold a modest share of all residential parcels nationwide, their footprint is expanding steadily, said Reina Chano Murray, associate director at the Center for Geospatial Solutions.
“Corporate ownership may look small on paper, around nearly 9% across the counties we studied, but that share is steadily increasing,” said Chano Murray. “Even if corporate owners don’t make up a huge percentage right now, the trend line is clear. They’re growing.”
This past year, states took a major step in attempting to use legislation to rein in corporate ownership of rental homes. According to an August report by the conservative think tank American Enterprise Institute, lawmakers in 22 states have introduced such legislation in 2025, including in California, New York and Texas. Cities in Indiana have capped the percentage of single family homes that can be rented in a neighborhood. 
AEI, however, believes the issue of corporate land ownership is a “narrative [that] is not supported by empirical evidence,” highlighting that less than 1% of institutional investorship is in residential property, according to its report. 
Earlier this year, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul, a Democrat, proposed a 75-day moratorium on institutional or corporate investors buying single- and two-family homes to disincentivize those groups from buying up housing stock at the cost of individual buyers.
Washington state lawmakers have floated caps on how many units a single investor may own. In 2024, Colorado enacted a law that gave cities a right of first refusal on some multifamily property sales. Locally, some redevelopment authorities in Cincinnati and Minneapolis are using their own capital to compete, by directly acquiring and preserving single-family homes for low- and moderate-income buyers.
The impact of corporate residential ownership, researchers at the Lincoln Institute say, is most severe for first-time buyers, who are increasingly outbid by cash offers from well-endowed investors. 
“For first-time homebuyers, it’s a double whammy. Units are being removed from the marketplace, and investor competition is driving up prices,” said George McCarthy, president and CEO of the Lincoln Institute. “Cash-only transactions make up nearly a third of single-family sales this year, and those aren’t families with briefcases full of cash.”

(Casey Smith/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Municipal elections cost Indiana significantly more per vote than midterm and presidential contests, according to a state study released Thursday.
The analysis, conducted by the Voting System Technical Oversight Program at Ball State University, also found traditional precinct systems carry higher per-vote costs than newer vote centers setups.
“Transparency is one of our top priorities,” Secretary of State Diego Morales said in a Thursday news release. “By making this report available, it’s evident how hard our team is working to strengthen elections and serve every Hoosier with integrity.”
Hoosier voter turnout down, but better than before

House Enrolled Act 1633, approved in April, directed Morales to consider whether changing up municipal elections timing or mandating vote centers statewide would save money. Turnout was another factor.
During debate, lawmakers from both parties revealed distrust of his spending decisions and his penchant for self-promotion.
The law required Morales’ office to conduct at least three public hearings, but he held five. The results were submitted to the General Assembly’s Legislative Council ahead a Nov. 1 deadline, according to the news release.
No policy recommendations were made, however.
Municipal elections under the microscope
In an analysis of elections held from 2018 to 2024, municipal elections were about as expensive to administer as midterm elections, but brought in fewer voters — resulting in higher costs per vote.
In the 2022 midterm general elections, for instance, the cost per vote was about $5.26, while the 2024 presidential general contest was $5.47.
But it was $15.62 for the 2023 municipal general election.
Aligning municipal elections with larger cycles could “modestly” increase participation in the midterms and presidential elections, according to the study, which noted several thousand voters who cast ballots in local races abstained from the even-year contests.
The move “would lead to significant increases” in the number of Hoosiers participating in municipal contests, however.


The boost in turnout would “more than mak(e) up for” those lost through “ballot fatigue.” That’s when voters lose interest in lengthy lists of choices or become overwhelmed by the options.
VSTOP recorded 74 comments related to municipal election timing, with 60 in opposition and 14 in favor. Hoosiers against changes feared national issues would drown out local ones, while supporters cited cost savings and turnout gains. Local election administrators said it should be a choice.
Vote center push evaluated
In precinct-based systems, voters must cast their ballots at one assigned precinct location. The vote center model has fewer polling locations but a voter can cast their ballot at any location within their counties of residence on Election Day.
VSTOP found that vote center counties have spent less, on average, per voter than precinct counties during midterm and presidential elections since 2014. Precinct counties spent less in the first year studied, 2012.
The pandemic-era 2020 election was excluded from the analysis of vote centers and precincts because its administration was “abnormal.”


Staffing is likely the primary driver of savings, per the study. Fewer locations generally means lower staffing requirements.
On average, vote center counties spent $15,912 on poll worker pay — compared to $28,325 average for precinct counties.
Those that transitioned to vote center systems between the 2018 and 2022 midterm elections used 22% fewer poll workers, according to the study. And those that made the change between the 2016 and 2024 presidential elections used 19% fewer poll workers.
VSTOP cautioned, however, that data limitations “make it challenging to draw firm conclusions about differences in staffing needs between the two models.”
The study made no findings on equipment-related savings, citing a lack of reliable data and the complexity of both use and contracting.
Discussions with county election officials, however, indicated that most deploy comparable amounts of equipment regardless of voting model.
Transitioning could even cost more, because of the technology purchases or upgrades that could be involved.
There was little evidence that vote centers impact turnout, according to the report, or voter experience.
VSTOP logged 88 comments related to the potential vote center requirement, with 61 Hoosiers opposed and 27 in support. Most didn’t object to the concept of vote centers, but didn’t want the model to be mandated for all counties. Local election administrators also said it should be a choice.
Lake County got a shout-out for its “unanimous” opposition. Commenters argued the aging population would lack the transportation needed to get to the more sparsely located vote centers.

New estimates released Thursday put the total tab for the Oct. 5 rampage at $623,000 to $914,000 excluding taxes. The biggest cost driver is damage to a historic chenille rug nearly a century old in the state reception room, according to the Department of Enterprise Services.
It could cost $100,000 just to move the rug and affected drapes to another location for the repairs, the agency said. It will require storing them in a climate-controlled space at an estimated $750 per month, which doesn’t count toward the total estimate. 
Repairing the unique rug, which suffered smoke and fire damage, will cost from $443,000 to $719,000 while estimates for restoring historic mohair drapes that were burned are between $19,350 and $34,200.

The state reception room will be open for the 2026 legislative session beginning in January, according to the agency. It is used for public tours, class visits, press conferences and bill signings by governors. 
In the Oct. 5 break-in, Gunnar Schubert allegedly parked his car on the sidewalk of the campus flag circle, broke into the Capitol through a window, set fire to county, state and U.S. flags, tipped over busts of George Washington and Martin Luther King Jr., burned a piano and tried to light the carpet on fire, among other damage. The episode lasted about 10 minutes.
Schubert, 29, faces two criminal charges, second-degree burglary, a felony, and third-degree malicious mischief, a gross misdemeanor. He has yet to be arraigned as he awaits an evaluation to see if he is mentally fit to stand trial. A hearing on his competency is set for January.
Schubert played baseball at Gonzaga University and is a former minor league player. 
The incident has stoked concerns of politically motivated violence locally, after the killings this year of Minnesota state House Speaker Melissa Hortman and her husband, as well as Republican commentator Charlie Kirk. 
The state has already spent about $34,000 to replace damaged flags and broken glass, not to mention staff time and materials. Another $30,000 in repairs for the busts, marble and teak flooring and piano is in progress. 
Currently, the funding is coming from the Department of Enterprise Services budget, but the state has filed insurance claims.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/George-Washington-bust-tipped-1-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-11-21 15:58:07.991553

“Clients can expect their total benefit balance to be available as soon as today,” the agency said in a press release. 
The slowdown was the result of a software system issue. December benefits are expected to be issued on time. 
The nation’s largest food assistance program was paused beginning in November after the federal government said it would not use emergency funds to pay for the program, even though benefits have continued to flow to states in past shutdowns. 
Confusion ensued after more than a dozen states sued the Trump administration for its refusal to issue benefits. Mississippi said it would begin issuing partial benefits Nov. 10 in accordance with guidance from the United States Department of Agriculture, the federal agency that administers the program.
The state Department of Human Services announced that food assistance benefits were set to resume as normal on Nov. 13 after the longest federal government shutdown in U.S. history came to an end. 
About 1 in 8 Mississippians — over 350,000 people — receive food assistance through SNAP. More than 67% of participants are in households with children, and about 41% are in households with older adults or adults with a disability. In four Mississippi counties, over a third of residents rely on the program to purchase food, according to a report from WLBT.
The state Department of Human Services awarded a contract to Deloitte Consulting LLP to improve the agency’s software system in May. Most MDHS eligibility systems were created over 35 years ago, according to the press release announcing the award. The software upgrades are set to be complete in 2027, according to Jones.
MDHS encourages SNAP clients to check their account balance to confirm receipt of benefits.

(Photo by Sean Rayford/Getty Images)North Carolina is putting another $2 million toward out-of-school programming for children and families impacted by Hurricane Helene, Gov. Josh Stein’s office said Thursday, expanding access for western summer camps that provide mental health resources.
Trillium Health Resources, headquartered in Greenville, will use the money to send children and families to the Henry’s House program — a camp for children ages 6 to 16 designed to aid with post-disaster trauma, as well as a broad swath of physical and medical needs.
“This program will be a lifeline for parents and children who are still healing from Helene,” said Matt Calabria, who leads Gov. Josh Stein’s office for western recovery, in a news release.
The new money builds on an already established state program, WNC Thrive, that provides after-school, weekend and summer programming for children in western counties affected by Helene.
Earlier this year, the NC Department of Health and Human Services sent $1.75 million to Vaya Health, which serves 32 western counties, to establish the program. More than 1,000 children attended the program’s camps across multiple locations this past summer, according to the governor’s office.
The new camps put on by Trillium will be located at Victory Junction — a camp in Randleman founded by former NASCAR driver Kyle Petty. In a July announcement of the program, NC Division of Mental Health director Kelly Crosbie called it “a much-needed respite option for families and caregivers.”
DHHS and Trillium will release further details about the programs, including eligibility guidelines for families, by spring 2026, according to the governor’s office.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/GettyImages-2206279806-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-21 15:58:07.991553

Patrick Morrisey announced his appointment to the West Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals on Friday. (Photo courtesy of the West Virginia Office of Gov. Patrick Morrisey)Gov. Patrick Morrisey appointed Charleston attorney Gerald Titus III to the state Supreme Court of Appeals on Friday.
Titus — who most recently worked at the law firm Spilman Thomas & Battle — will fill the seat previously held by Justice Tim Armstead. Armstead died in August after a year-long battle against cancer.
Armstead was elected in 2020 to a 12-year term on the state’s highest court. Titus, as an appointee, will serve in the seat until the May 2026 election. The winner of that election — which is a nonpartisan race — will serve out the remainder of Armstead’s term, which ends in 2032. Titus said he intends to run for the seat.
Titus said Friday that, while on the Supreme Court, he would be “committed to the rule of law” and apply that law “as it is written.”
“I believe it’s critical that the court remain impartial and ensure fairness for all parties,” Titus said. “… Judges are called upon to make difficult decisions, and I look forward to applying my full legal abilities and training to reach the right result under the law. I am committed to the rule of law and ensuring fairness for all parties.”
In his role at Spilman Thomas, Titus focused on “broad-based” legal work, including corporate litigation, acquisitions, criminal defense and environmental and regulatory issues, among other topics.
On the state Supreme Court, Titus — along with the body’s four other justices — will be responsible for deciding numerous cases, including those brought against and by the state of West Virginia through the attorney general.
According to campaign finance reports with the Secretary of State’s office, Titus and his wife, Meredith, contributed a combined $3,800 to West Virginia Attorney General J.B. McCuskey in the 2024 election cycle. Titus also gave $2,800 to Supreme Court Justice Haley Bunn’s 2024 election campaign.
Titus was one of four candidates provided to Morrisey by the Judicial Vacancy Advisory Commission to fill the vacant seat on the Supreme Court. The other finalists for the seat were Eric Hudnall, a staff attorney at the Supreme Court; Steven Redding, a circuit court judge for Berkeley and Morgan counties, and Robert “Booster” Ryan, a former circuit court judge in Grant, Mineral and Tucker counties who currently serves as prosecuting attorney in Hardy County.
Titus said he was “especially honored” to be selected from among the other “excellent candidates.”
This is the second Supreme Court appointment made by Morrisey over the past few months. In August, he appointed Fayette County Circuit Court Judge Thomas Ewing to take the seat formerly held by Justice Beth Walker. Walker announced in April that she would retire in June.
In addition to his work at Spilman Thomas, Titus also previously served as an assistant U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of West Virginia’s violent crime division. He holds a bachelor’s degree in politics and American history from Washington and Lee University. In 2003, he received his law degree from the same school.",https://westvirginiawatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/unnamed.jpg,,,2025-11-21 14:57:53.193667

Randy Feenstra, running for Iowa governor, answered questions during a campaign meet-and-greet event at The Breakfast Club in Des Moines Nov. 21, 2025. (Photo by Robin Opsahl/Iowa Capital Dispatch)U.S. Rep. Randy Feenstra proposed freezing property taxes at a gubernatorial campaign meet-and-greet in Des Moines Friday as he told supporters about his vision for making Iowa more affordable.
The Republican from Hull told supporters at the Des Moines event early Friday about his role in crafting the “big, beautiful” budget reconciliation bill alongside Trump and Republican leaders. The tax cuts passed in the measure, like the increased estate tax exemptions and preserving tax credits for certain small businesses and research and development efforts, will help Iowa’s economy, Feenstra said.
Feenstra said important work has already been done in Congress to make the U.S. and Iowa economies more competitive, but added, “Here’s the deal: We need somebody to sell it,” as well as further Republicans’ goals in providing more opportunities for business to succeed at the state level.
As a fourth-generation Iowan who has worked with the Trump administration, Feenstra said he was the right person for the job.
Feenstra, considered a frontrunner for the Iowa GOP nomination, officially launched his campaign for governor in late October, following months of having an “exploratory” campaign that began shortly after Gov. Kim Reynolds announced that she would not run for reelection.
He held his campaign kick-off in Sioux Center earlier in November, and has said his campaign will focus on working with President Donald Trump to enact an “America First” agenda in Iowa while vowing to take the state to “new heights.”
If elected, Feenstra said Friday, his mission as governor would be to make Iowa “the most business- and ag-friendly state in the country,” improve the state’s education system, and lower costs for Iowans. He highlighted property taxes as a top concern, saying this will help Iowans deal with higher costs of living and incentivize more businesses to create jobs in the state.
“We’ve got to be the business state, we got to sell it,” Feenstra said. “We have to dramatically lower our property taxes, we’ve got to continue to reduce regulation. We got to cut property taxes, lower and freeze them.”
Reducing property tax costs has been a major goal for Iowa Republicans at the Statehouse for several years. Reynolds signed a law in 2023 aimed at limiting the growth of property tax costs, and in 2025, Republican legislative leaders introduced a new proposal, which ultimately did not make it to the governor’s desk, to change Iowa’s property tax system from a “rollback” to a “revenue-restricted” system in an effort to reduce costs.
Reynolds has stated multiple times that in 2026, her final legislative session as governor, she plans to introduce legislation on property taxes — though she has not said what her approach may be to lowering costs. The governor has held meetings with local government and community leaders throughout the state in recent months focused on the subject as she and her team plan to draft legislation.
Though many Iowans are in favor of lowering property taxes, local government officials and advocates say cuts could lead to reductions in the local government services residents rely on. At an event in Davenport Tuesday, Reynolds said Iowans will “have to be open to having your services maybe delivered differently,” the Quad-City Times reported.
“If you want everything to stay the same, then it’s probably going to be very hard to reduce your property tax burden,” Reynolds said, according to the Times. “Is there ways that we can provide centers of service? Is there a way … two or three or four counties (can) work together more collaboratively when it comes to EMS? Is there ways that we can utilize our hospitals in rural Iowa more efficiently than we are right now with public health services?”
When Feenstra was asked what impact cutting — or freezing — property taxes would have on government services, he said he believed there was a “new way” essential services can be delivered.
“Whether it be law enforcement, EMS, all these things — there’s a new way to do this,” Feenstra told reporters. “There’s a new way to do this, to be transparent on what property taxes look like, what’s being paid …” and what property tax rates could be frozen or lowered.
“I plan to create that vision, and make sure that gets done,” he said.
Feenstra did not share specific policy proposals or property tax changes he would enact as governor, but said he believed a property tax freeze could be implemented by starting with a specific group, like senior citizens. However, he said he believed lowering property taxes was important for all groups, pointing to property tax costs as a major consideration for small businesses seeking to start or stay in Iowa.
“It’s the number one cost when it comes to small business. Before you even turn on the lights, you’re paying property taxes,” Feenstra said. “So we’ve got to figure out a solution to lower them, to make sure that they can grow and stay successful and keep their doors open.”
He also said he would work to lower health care insurance premiums as governor.
“You (think) about the two biggest things, the two costliest things of small business and families — it’s usually health care, and it’s usually property tax, things that they got to pay,” Feenstra said.
The cost of rising health insurance premiums has been a major discussion in federal politics as one of the main drivers of the government shutdown that ended last week. Senate Democrats resisted passing a federal spending bill without the extension of Affordable Care Act enhanced tax credits set to expire at the end of 2025, but this goal was not met as seven Senate Democrats and one independent voted to approve the stopgap funding measure without ACA tax credit language.
While Senate Majority Leader John Thune agreed to hold a vote in December on a bill related to the ACA tax credits, House Speaker Mike Johnson has not agreed to do the same. If the tax credits are not extended, Democrats and health care advocates say premiums are expected to double for people receiving health coverage through Health Insurance Marketplaces.
Feenstra said, as a member of the House Ways and Means Committee, he has been looking at multiple proposals on lowering premium costs. Trump has said he would only support a measure to provide direct health care payments, while some Republicans, including U.S. Rep. Zach Nunn of Iowa, have said they would support a temporary extension of the enhanced ACA tax credits.
“We want to come out with a new plan that dramatically lowers premiums for families and for small businesses when it comes to health insurance, and that’s what hopefully we’ll roll out here very shortly,” Feenstra said. “… There’s some exciting proposals, again, how we can directly give money to the small business, or give directly money to the family, to lower that premium cost. So that’s what we’re looking at right now.”
The Des Moines meet-and-greet was one of the first stops on a statewide tour, with more events scheduled next week in Dubuque, Denison, Council Bluffs and Sioux City.

New federal guidance received Oct. 31 will cause some green card holders in Vermont who arrived as refugees or asylum seekers to lose food benefits at the end of the month, state officials said Thursday. 
Meanwhile, State Attorney General Charity Clark and colleagues from 20 other states sent a letter Wednesday to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, requesting corrections to what they argued are incorrect legal interpretations in that guidance.
“It’s really unfortunate that the feds changed the rules,” said Tracy Dolan, director of Vermont’s State Refugee Office. “These folks didn’t do anything wrong — they didn’t fail to meet conditions that other people were meeting.”

The USDA’s October memo was intended to clarify eligibility changes to the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, laid out in July’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act. Vermont already announced a number of related rule changes in recent months, including expanded work requirements for eligible households to receive benefits, and a loss of access for some noncitizens, including a group of immigrants who assisted the U.S. military overseas.
Previously, Vermonters who entered the country as refugees or asylees were still eligible for 3SquaresVT, the state’s version of SNAP, provided they had a green card. Many do, Dolan said, since those humanitarian programs provide the opportunity to apply for a green card shortly after arrival. Though wait times can be long, applicants are generally successful.
But the USDA is now telling states that the new law means these groups are subject to a five-year waiting period in order to be eligible, according to the Vermont Department for Children and Families. As of Dec. 1, according to officials, 22 households of legal permanent residents will lose partial or total access to federal food assistance. Minors will not be affected by the change, state officials said.
The state’s previous alterations to noncitizen eligibility had already cut off or decreased benefits for 119 households in the program.
Miranda Gray, a deputy commissioner with the Department for Children and Families, said the Oct. 31 memo had “clarified for us that we had another group” of households who are not eligible for the program under the new law.
“SNAP is a federal program … that we have to adhere to,” Gray said. 
The State Refugee Office will be providing grants totalling roughly $108,000 as a temporary relief measure for affected families, Dolan said. The original figure before the latest guidance was $106,000, Gray said, but officials have slightly increased the amount of the grant as more than 20 more households were hit by new rule changes.
The funds will be dispersed gradually to especially vulnerable households via the Vermont office of the U.S. Committee for Refugees and Immigrants, or USCRI, and the Ethiopian Community Development Council. Payments will end in January, and are intended to provide a “ramp down” for those affected by recent rule changes, Dolan said.
Nonetheless, she said, the need will inevitably outstrip these resources. Though some impacted households are more vulnerable than others, everyone has had to “scramble,” Dolan said, by adding more hours at work to an already tough schedule or finding other ways to make ends meet.
Sonali Samarasinghe, the director of USCRI Vermont, agreed in an interview late last month discussing the original allocation. The state’s grant, while “very welcome,” will not solve the problem.
“What we want to do is provide as much help as possible to the most vulnerable of households,” she said, adding “a lot of them are single moms.”
The joint letter to the USDA from the attorneys general of 20 states and the District of Columbia argued that President Donald Trump’s administration incorrectly interpreted some groups’ eligibility for benefits, including refugees, asylum seekers, and Special Immigrant Visa holders who worked with U.S. forces in Afghanistan. State officials also have concerns about how the five-year waiting period is being defined. 
Authored by New York State Attorney General Letitia James, the document also criticized USDA’s four-month delay in issuing guidance and its immediate deadline for implementation.
“We request that the USDA correct the mistakes in the Guidance’s interpretation of (The One Big Beautiful Bill Act) … and hold States harmless for any errors resulting from the delayed, misleading, and inaccurate Guidance,” the letter stated.
“The Federal Government is failing states and our citizens and leaving us in an awful position of trying to comply with confusing laws and an incredibly poorly timed guidance,” Clark said in an emailed statement Friday.
Gray said she was aware of Clark’s joint letter and that her team would continue to seek additional federal clarification as it becomes available.
USDA did not respond to requests for comment.

(Courtesy photo)The Bipartisan Public Lands Caucus, which was co-founded by Montana Rep. Ryan Zinke and New Mexico Rep. Gabe Vasquez in May, made its first official endorsement of a bill.
Zinke’s introduced his Public Lands in Public Hands Act in 2024 and reintroduced it for the current congress early this year.
The bill is aimed at keeping public lands under the management of public agencies and prevent the selloff of land — a major flashpoint during budget discussions in Washington this year that led to the formation of the bipartisan caucus.
According to the bill’s text, it would ban the sale or transfer of most public lands managed by the Department of the Interior and U.S. Forest Service except under specific conditions and where required under previous laws. Transferring publicly accessible federal land tracts over 300 acres and for public land tracts over 5 acres accessible via a public waterway would require congressional approval.
Zinke did not respond to a request for comment on the caucus’ endorsement of his bill by publication. However, when he introduced the bill, he said conservation bills are a critical part of the Montana way of life that ensure the ability to pass that on to future generations.
In a press release put out by Rep. Vasquez, the Caucus emphasized that “Public lands power rural outdoor economies, support cultural traditions, and strengthen communities.”
“Like so many New Mexicans, I grew up hunting, fishing, and camping on public lands. Those experiences shaped who I am today,” Vasquez said. “These lands don’t belong to one party or to a handful of wealthy interests—they belong to all of us. This endorsement is a meaningful step as the Public Lands Caucus works to ensure our lands stay in public hands for generations to come.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/2025-05-07_mbo_0683-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-21 14:57:53.193667

(Photo by Jennifer Shutt/States Newsroom)  There’s officially less than a year to go before the 2026 midterm elections where the balance of the U.S. House will hang in the balance and could come down to just a few seats.
While a Democrat hasn’t been elected to the U.S. House in the state since Rep. Pat Williams finished his ninth term in Congress as the state’s sole representative in the late 1990s — two Democrats have launched primary campaigns for the chance to go head-to-head with Western. Rep. Ryan Zinke.
Matt Rains, of Simms,  and Russ Cleveland, of St. Regis, have similar backgrounds in agriculture and as veterans.
Cleveland enlisted in the Navy and served as an aviation electrician until 2009, according to his website’s bio. Simms attended West Point and served as a Blackhawk helicopter pilot for the Army.
Zinke, meanwhile, is well known for his three decades as a Navy Seal and was the first of the elite special force team to serve in the House.
Cleveland announced his run for Congress this spring, touting his roots in Montana.
He grew up in Stevensville before attending school at Montana Tech in Butte. After the Army, he and his wife founded a startup company focused on quality child care in Colorado that during the COVID pandemic turned into a remote learning organization serving thousands of children.
Cleveland and his family moved back to Montana in 2021 to a ranch in St. Regis.
Matt Rains, who announced his campaign last month, has tried his hand in the Montana political world before.
In 2020 he ran in the Democratic primary for the state’s then-at-large congressional seat, but withdrew and endorsed eventual Democratic nominee Kathleen Williams. Rains subsequently pivoted to campaign for a state House District seat representing Cascade County, but lost in the primary.
Rains is a fourth-generation rancher and worked as Chief of Staff at the Montana Farmers Union, until announcing his campaign.
Montana’s two congressional seats are rated as “Solid Republican” for the eastern seat held by Rep. Troy Downing, and “Likely Republican,” for Zinke’s seat, according to the Cook Political Report.
Zinke won his two most recent races in 2024 and 2022 with 52% and 49.6% of the vote. He has been endorsed for re-election by President Donald Trump.

The board unanimously expanded what constitutes a “development of regional impact” to explicitly include data centers. The addition of a category called “technological facilities” was needed because DCA’s 12 regional councils weren’t in agreement on how to treat data centers, facilities that house servers and other computer equipment increasingly needed to support artificial intelligence.
DCA Deputy Commissioner Rusty Haywood Credit: Mary Landers/The Current GA
“If you take the submissions that we have received specific to data centers, some regional commissioners, some regional commissions were processing those as industrial, some were processing them as commercial, and some were not processing them at all because they didn’t seem to fit within the definitions of either of those two categories,” DCA Deputy Commissioner Rusty Haywood said. “So what we have done is created a technological facilities category that would encompass that type of development.”
DCA paused the review of data centers in June. The new rules apply outside of the Atlanta region to data centers of at least 500,000 square feet — equal to the area covered by about nine football fields. Within the Atlanta Regional Commission’s territory, that threshold applies only to rural areas. Data centers in Atlanta’s urban and suburban areas areas are subject to a lower threshold of 300,000 square feet.
The DRI process allows “those in proximity to a proposed development of significant scale have the opportunity to comment and weigh in before a development occurs,” DCA Deputy Commissioner Rusty Haywood told the board.
The developers of data centers, which use massive quantities of water and electricity, will be required to estimate how much of each they’ll need for a new facility.
The DCA doesn’t give projects a thumbs up or down, however.
“The regional commissions are not weighing in positive or negative,” Haywood said. “This board is not weighing in positive or negative. That’s entirely a local decision. This process does not infringe on the local government’s decision-making authority. If they want to approve such a development, they have that right do so. If they wish to oppose it they have that right.”
DCA received 16 written numerous public comments on the proposed changes to the DRI process. Most were in support of the new classifications and modifications, Haywood said. Some urged the board to adopt the more stringent 300,000 square foot threshold for all data centers. The Georgia Water Coalition was among the public commenters weighing in.
“The Georgia Water Coalition is excited to have a clear statement of when data centers must participate in the DRI process,” Amy Sharma, executive director of Science for Georgia and the coalition’s data center committee chair, told The Current GA Thursday. “DRIs are often one of the only windows that planners and the public have into a very opaque process. Since the pause, everyone has been flying blind. While we would have preferred for the DCA to adopt our more stringent definitions and guidelines, we cannot let perfect be the enemy of good. We look forward to continuing the conversation and increasing transparency into this unprecedented development boom.”
 Solar farms process added

The DCA board also approved the DRI process for solar farms of 300 acres in urban areas and 500 acres in rural areas.
“We added (solar farms) as a category because some regional commissions said those are developments that are occurring at a large scale and having an impact within the state,” Haywood said.
Solar supporters are taking a wait-and-see attitude about the change.
“We hope it facilitates transparency and more solar farms,” said Jennette Gayer, director of Environment Georgia.
Other changes to the DRI categories include the addition of a traffic element for commercial developments; those expected to generate 10,000 or more vehicle trips per day will require the DRI process.
“If you just take a general Publix grocery store, that’s probably going to be about 4,000 trips a day,” Haywood said. “So it’s not something that a grocery store would qualify as a development of regional impact. It’s got to be something of a larger scale to hit that threshold.”

The seven-term congressmember is running on protecting Californians from the Trump administration and from rising prices. While he’s developed a reputation as a professional GOP antagonist, the challenge will be proving he has what it takes to deliver on the elusive affordability promise.


Rep. Eric Swalwell, a former Democratic presidential candidate who helped lead the second impeachment of President Donald Trump, has officially entered the fray to succeed California Gov. Gavin Newsom in next year’s gubernatorial race.
His core message? “Prices are too high and people are scared.”
Swalwell, 45, a prominent Trump antagonist on social media and a cable news darling who ran a short-lived bid for the White House in 2019, made the announcement Thursday night at the tail end of a nearly 10-minute interview with late-night host Jimmy Kimmel. 
After joking that California was “the greatest country in the world,” to laughs from the Los Angeles studio audience, Swalwell grew serious and decried how Californians have been disproportionately targeted by a second Trump administration, whether through vengeful immigration raids or the cancellation of critical cancer and health research. 
“This great state needs a fighter and a protector,” Swalwell said.
In a video posted to his campaign website, which went live shortly before his appearance on “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” aired, Swalwell says “no one will keep California safer” than he will. He name-drops Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi — the San Francisco titan of Democratic politics who recently announced her own retirement — and points to her decisions to appoint him to the House Intelligence Committee and as one of four Trump impeachment managers following the Jan. 6, 2021 attack on the U.S. Capitol. 
Swallwell’s announcement comes a day after billionaire liberal activist Tom Steyer announced he is running to replace Newsom when he terms out in 2027. At least six other high-profile Democrats are also running, including former Rep. Katie Porter, former Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra and former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa. Prominent Republican challengers include Riverside County Sheriff Chad Bianco and former Fox News contributor Steve Hilton. 
The challenge for the seven-term congressman, who said recently he was among the latest of Trump’s political enemies to be targeted for investigation by the Justice Department, will be proving he can govern for Californians at home in addition to sparring with Republicans on the national stage. 
“We can say that we’re the fourth largest economy in the world — and we are, and I love to brag about that — but what does that mean if you can’t afford to live here?” Swalwell told Kimmel on Thursday. 
On that front, Swalwell offers no concrete policy promises in his initial launch, but instead cites his experience as a planning commissioner and city councilmember for his hometown of Dublin, the Bay Area suburb nestled east of Hayward and west of Livermore. He represents the same region in Congress.
“I’ve worked as a planning commissioner and city councilman in a place of low income and low expectations and helped lead my hometown to become one of California’s most prosperous cities,” Swalwell’s campaign site says. “I’ll take that approach to the whole state.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/112125-Eric-Swalwell-WM-Getty-01-CM.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-11-21 13:57:43.101816

Here, Cleanup workers try to scoop up all the toxic globs on Pensacola Beach. (Photo via Florida Sea Grant)Gov. Ron DeSantis warned Friday that President Donald Trump’s push to drill off the Florida coast could “weaken” environmental protections and interfere with military training.
DeSantis referred to the U.S. Department of the Interior’s plan to reinvigorate oil drilling off of Florida and Southern California for the first time in decades. The federal government has not allowed drilling in federal waters in the eastern Gulf since 1995 because of oil spill concerns, the AP reported.
“We supported the 2020 decision that the Trump administration made at the time, we worked very closely with them. I thought it was very thoughtful policy in 2020,” DeSantis said during an unrelated Crystal River press conference Friday morning.
“Now what the Interior Department is proposing to do is really to go back off that policy, and I think that would weaken protections that we worked very hard to establish offshore.”
Those protections reflect environmental fears of damaging Florida’s coastlines and marine life and the military’s ability to train in the Panhandle. Florida has multiple military bases in Panama City and Pensacola.
“[The military says] it’s really important to be able to have that access to be able to do key training,” the governor continued. “We hope that they double down on the 2020 policy and not push ahead with what Interior wants to do now.”
This is one of the rarer instances of DeSantis breaking with Trump since the 2024 elections. The tension between the two ahead of and throughout the presidential primary had been replaced with a quieter complacency. Both Trump and DeSantis have been tightly aligned on most conservative issues, especially immigration, while public disagreement has stayed at a muted minimum.
‘Dead on arrival’
According to the Associated Press, the proposal targets six offshore lease sales between 2027 and 2030 along the California coast. It would also spur drilling at least 100 miles offshore of Florida in South-Central Gulf region and compel more than 20 lease sales off the Alaskan coast.
Backlash has been swift in all targeted states. In Florida, DeSantis became the latest Republican to add his voice to join a bipartisan outcry at the plan, joining lawmakers like U.S. Sen. Ashley Moody and U.S. Rep. Jimmy Patronis. U.S. Sen. Rick Scott, a leading Trump ally, helped persuade the president in 2018 to drop a similar offshore plan when he served as governor.
Trump agreed at the time to maintain a drilling moratorium until 2032. Earlier this month, Scott and Moody co-sponsored legislation to codify that moratorium.
In 2010, the Gulf was rocked by a massive oil spill caused by an explosion on the Deepwater Horizon drilling platform. Eleven men were killed, the rig began to sink, and a catastrophic oil leak sprouted from the well, NOAA reported. It would take three months to cap the spill, allowing roughly 134 million gallons of oil to seep into the ocean in the largest such spill in the nation’s history.
Politicos aren’t the only ones concerned about the new proposal.
Sierra Club Florida called the plan “unacceptable” and potentially detrimental to both the state’s environment and the economy.
“President Trump and his administration may be eager to hand out blank checks to oil and gas companies, but it will not be at Florida’s expense,” Javier Estevez, the group’s political and legislative director, said in a written statement. “We refuse to allow our coastal economies, quality of life, and irreplaceable natural resources to be sacrificed for corporate profit.
“Any such proposal is dead on arrival, and we will work tirelessly to ensure our coasts are protected.”

The U.S. is trying to facilitate a total financial support package of up to $40 billion for Argentina, but only $20 billion comes from U.S. government funds.
The deal includes a $20 billion currency swap between the U.S. Treasury and Argentina’s central bank. That was authorized in October and was heavily criticized in both countries, especially after President Donald Trump initially tied support to President Javier Milei’s performance in the October election in Argentina. Critics argue that using financial assistance to influence foreign elections sets a dangerous precedent.
The remaining $20 billion was originally expected to come from private banks and sovereign wealth funds, coordinated by the Treasury Department to invest in Argentine debt. But in November 2025, a group of banks backed out of a plan for the matching $20 billion package, instead opting to explore a smaller, short-term loan deal, according to reports.

(Andrew Roth | Michigan Advance)A political action committee that works to elected pro-Israel Democratic candidates up and down the ballot has thrown its weight behind U.S. Rep. Haley Stevens of Birmingham.
On Thursday, the Democratic Majority for Israel PAC, or DMFI, endorsed Stevens and three other candidates in various races across the nation.
Stevens is one of a handful of Michigan U.S. Senate candidates on the Democratic side of the race, which also features state Sen. Mallory McMorrow of Royal Oak, Abdul El-Sayed, former director of the Wayne County Department of Health, Human and Veterans Services, and research health specialist Rachel Howard.
DMFI PAC said it was endorsing Stevens because she was one of several incumbent electeds who have “stood firm against extremism, antisemitism, and efforts to undermine America’s alliances.”
“DMFI PAC is proud to support these exceptional candidates, and we’re firmly committed to helping them win their races,” DMFI PAC Chair Brian Romick said in a statement.
Stevens said she was honored to garner the endorsement of DMFI PAC.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
“As a proud pro-Israel Democrat, I believe America is stronger when we stand with our democratic allies, confront antisemitism and extremism, and keep our promises to our friends abroad and our working families here at home,” Stevens said in a statement. “In the Senate, I’ll keep fighting to protect our democracy, support Israel’s security, ensure the ceasefire holds in Gaza, and deliver for Michiganders in every corner of our state.”
McMorrow and E-Sayed have both said they will not take money from corporate PACs and that includes money from the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, or AIPAC. Both candidates have called Israel’s actions in its war against Hamas in Gaza a genocide of the Palestinian people.
In a statement to Michigan Advance, El-Sayed campaign spokesperson Roxie Richner said that 33 Palestinians were killed in Gaza on Thursday, and that American tax dollars paid for it.
“Meanwhile, our kids’ schools are crumbling, and they tell us we don’t have money to fix them,” Richner said. “Taking an endorsement and campaign money from those that defend this misappropriation is disqualifying.”

(Photo by U.S. Department of Agriculture)After an unnecessary, weeks-long disruption, more than 1.4 million Ohioans should have their federal food benefits for November, a spokesman for the Ohio Department of Job and Family Services confirmed on Thursday. 
Even though a federal judge ordered him to disburse the funds, President Donald Trump held up the payments to 42 million Americans starting on Nov. 1. 
Trump blamed the disruption on the partial shutdown of the federal government. But the government had money to temporarily fund the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP. Federal courts ordered him to do so as other presidents have done so in all previous federal shutdowns.
The suspension of benefits sparked a crisis, with many Ohio food pantries reporting record demand.
After the government reopened last week, the state agency that administers SNAP started working to get food benefits out the door.
The Ohio Department of Job and Family Services “has distributed benefits to over 95% of all SNAP recipients in Ohio,” spokesman Tom Betti said in an email Thursday afternoon. “We expect to be at 100% by tomorrow. 
Because of the way that funds flow through the system, there are a small number of cases that require manual activity on our part to push them through to the beneficiaries and is a common occurrence that happens every month.”

(Photo by Michael Salerno/Rhode Island Current)The Centurion Foundation, the Atlanta nonprofit trying to buy Roger Williams Medical Center and Our Lady of Fatima Hospital, appears undeterred by the state’s pursuit of an alternative buyer.
At least, that’s the image it presents in federal bankruptcy court hearings and media statements. 
But internal emails to state regulators obtained by Rhode Island Current reveal the foundation’s distress over potential competitor Prime Healthcare, and its unhappiness  with the state for allegedly standing in the way of the deal.
In a Nov. 7 email to the Rhode Island Attorney General’s Office and the Rhode Island Department of Health, Centurion CEO Ben Mingle asked the state to cease its discussions with Prime, which Mingle claims are making it harder for the foundation to close the deal. He also blamed the state for its “continued lack of support” in easing the financial conditions needed to secure its purchase.
“Over the course of much of 2025, we repeatedly requested direct financial support from Rhode Island and unfortunately that support did not materialize,” Mingle wrote. “We strongly believe that a show of meaningful financial support from the State during our prior financing attempts would have made them successful.”
Mingle’s letter set off a series of tense exchanges with Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha, whose office has played a key role in regulating the sale of the state hospitals, including in federal bankruptcy court since January, when Prospect filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy.
“Since approval, first by the State and then the Bankruptcy Court, the State and others have shown extraordinary patience and flexibility as Centurion has attempted to secure financing to complete the acquisition,” Neronha wrote in a Nov. 10 email response to Mingle. “The reasons for your inability to secure committed financing are irrelevant to the primary need to get the hospital transactions closed and to mitigate the current losses at the hospitals.”
Centurion received conditional approval to buy the hospitals from their now-bankrupt owner, Prospect Medical Holdings, in June 2024. But Centurion, and its local subsidiary, CharterCARE Health of Rhode Island, has struggled to secure the investor-backed bond financing needed to close the deal, despite multiple revisions by state regulators and the state’s quasi-public financing agency meant to ease the financial requirements. 
Amid delays, Rhode Island Health and Human Services Secretary Richard Charest reached out to Prime, his former employer and owner of Landmark Medical Center in Woonsocket, to gauge the company’s interest. Gov. Dan McKee’s office condoned the courtship as a “Plan B” focused on keeping the safety net hospitals afloat, especially after Prospect signaled its intent to shutter the hospitals by the end of the year because of growing operating losses.

True feelings exposed 
Centurion has repeatedly shifted questions about Prime back to its own commitment to the hospital sale. But Mingle’s email does not hold back in his criticism of the California hospital chain operator.
“Prime Healthcare has a very clear track record across many years in its ownership and management of hospitals, regardless of whether they are technically for-profit or ‘non-profit,’ Mingle wrote. “Rhode Island residents can expect another operator that calls the shots from California, one that will reduce the scope of services at [Fatima] and [Roger Williams,] and one that will significantly dwindle access to high quality physicians.”
Leaders with the union representing 1,200 hospital workers at the facilities have also expressed concern with Prime’s record, citing a trio of Justice Department settlements and cost-cutting measures at other hospitals nationwide.
Noel True, a spokesperson for Prime, touted Prime’s recognitions for safety and care at Landmark in an emailed response on Friday.
“As a nonprofit public charity, Prime Healthcare Foundation is honored that state leaders turned to us, recognizing our mission-driven work saving Landmark Medical Center from bankruptcy in 2013 and transforming it into a hospital recognized for award winning care with eight consecutive Healthgrades Patient Safety Excellence Awards, Leapfrog ‘A’ ratings, and the distinction of being ranked #1 in Rhode Island for social responsibility by the Lown Institute,” True wrote. “Our mission has saved hospitals across the nation, created thousands of jobs, uplifted communities and has never led to a single hospital closing — even in the most challenging times.”
In a rare moment of alignment, McKee and Neronha separately defended the state’s ability to consider alternative proposals.
“You, however, seem to think that conditional approval precludes the State from responding to interest expressed in the Rhode Island hospitals from other entities, especially when your ability to close after all this time remains speculative,” Neronha wrote. “Nothing in Rhode Island’s decisions or law provides you with the exclusive right to purchase the hospital or to be the only party with approval to do so or limits Rhode Island’s obligation to evaluate alternative transactions in accordance with the exercise of its regulatory authority.”
Backing up Neronha, McKee said the state’s precautionary steps were “the right and responsible course of action.”
“Waiting and doing nothing is simply not an option and would pose an unacceptable risk to the well-being of our health care system and the Rhode Islanders who rely on it,” McKee said in an emailed response Friday.
Neronha also underscored the urgency, concluding his letter by noting that “time is running out.”

Out of time
Avoiding the dire consequences of closing the hospitals appears to be one point of agreement between the feuding sides of the deal. 
The hospitals offer 500 beds between them, including 104 beds for behavioral health patients, which represents more than one-fifth of the state’s behavioral health beds. They saw a combined 50,000 emergency room patients last year, while employing 2,400 people. Roger Williams houses the only fully accredited bone marrow transplant unit in the state. 
“We strongly believe that Centurion and CharterCARE are best positioned to support the health care needs of these communities — truly nonprofit health care, locally controlled and in partnership with local physicians,” Mingle wrote in a second email to state regulators on Nov. 14.
With that in mind, Mingle proposed two “alternative scenarios,” with timelines, to close the deal, both of which extend beyond the Nov. 30 short-term financing plan for the hospitals, and may also require more leniency from state regulators.
In the first option, Centurion would still rely on investor-backed bond financing to buy the hospitals, closing no later than Jan. 15, 2026. The proposal relies upon the state and Prospect agreeing to share the tab for hospital operations until closing.
Alternatively, Centurion could close by Dec. 15 using a short-term loan from Bank of America, using the state-controlled hospital fund and other cash on its balance sheet as collateral. Bond financing finalized “on or about” Jan. 15, 2026, would pay off the bank loan and release the collateral.
“We are diligently pursuing both of the above Scenarios to bring this transaction to closure as soon as possible,” Mingle wrote. “In addition, we are willing to consider other proposals from the State or others to ensure that CharterCARE Health of Rhode Island’s ability to ensure that the health care needs of the communities that it will serve are fully preserved and maintained.”
Neronha was unpersuaded.
“It does not appear that you have any more certainty with respect to financing under either of the scenarios described in your November 14th letter than you did a week ago,” he wrote in a Nov. 17 emailed response. 
He also noted that even if the state agreed to put up more money to keep the hospitals open until Centurion can close a deal, Prospect, and the federal bankruptcy court must also be convinced.
And he again made clear that Rhode Island is not locked in on Centurion as the only potential buyer until it satisfies the conditions tied to its approval.
“Rhode Island cannot give and has never given you any exclusivity because as regulator it reacts to requests for, or changes in, ownership or other changes based on the State’s evaluation of the facts relevant to the changes being requested and from the perspective of Rhode Island’s residents and their need for health care.”
Neronha’s office met with representatives from Prime Healthcare on Thursday, according to news reports. A spokesperson for Neronha’s office did not immediately respond to requests for comment Friday on the outcome of the meeting.
A spokesperson for the Rhode Island Department of Health did not respond to requests for comment Friday.
Progress on Prime
However, attorneys for the AG and Prospect are scheduled to offer an update on the sale proceedings in federal bankruptcy court on Tuesday, Nov. 25. At a status conference earlier this week, Thomas Califano, an attorney for Prospect, said there was “progress” toward a deal, but did not offer specifics. Califano also indicated that Prospect and the AG’s office had tentatively agreed to extend their cost-sharing agreement for hospital operations through December to allow more time to finalize a buyer.
The existing agreement, which funds hospital operations through November, requires that whoever buys the hospitals repay Prospect’s bankruptcy estate and the state for money spent on hospital operations — about $6 million in total for November.
That’s roughly the same amount of money Centurion is seeking to recoup from Chartercare Foundation, a charitable foundation tied to the hospitals until 2014. But so far, Centurion’s requests to “return” donations made to the Chartercare Foundation have been rebuffed.
Mingle also sought Neronha’s help in forcing the Chartercare Foundation to relinquish assets which Mingle said were intended to support Roger Williams and Fatima, and can now be given back under the return to nonprofit status. 
Neronha did not want to get involved.
“Centurion’s inability to persuade the Foundation to invest in its acquisition effort speaks for itself,” he wrote to Mingle. “The Attorney General’s regulatory role is limited to situations where the charitable funds are not properly used.”
Paula Iacono, the Chartercare Foundation’s executive director, declined to comment in an emailed response Friday.

States are passing laws to target private equity transactions of health care facilities, such as hospitals. (Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images)As more private equity firms buy health care physician practices and facilities, states are pushing back on acquisitions that some critics say could potentially gut health care infrastructure. 
This year alone at least seven states, including California, Indiana, Massachusetts, Maine, New Mexico, Oregon and Washington, have enacted laws requiring more oversight over private equity acquisitions in health care. Private equity involves pooling resources from pension funds, endowments, sovereign wealth funds and wealthy individuals to buy controlling stakes in companies and boost their value — often with the goal of selling at a profit within a few years.
Private equity firms argue that their role in upgrading technology and increasing efficiency helps health care access, especially in rural and other underserved areas.
‘Shell game’: When private equity comes to town, hospitals can see cutbacks, closures

Private equity interest in health care has been around for a while, but really started to grow in the past decade, said John McDonough, a professor of public health practice at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. Now there are private equity interests “in every imaginable iteration of medical care,” from hospitals to nursing homes, hospice care, physician practices and even veterinary care, he said. 
This year, several states have passed laws to increase oversight and transparency of private equity’s continuing acquisitions. 
Massachusetts and California enacted laws requiring more groups that were not included under previous reporting requirements, such as private equity firms, real estate investment trusts and management service organizations, to now notify the state if they make a health care acquisition and to give the attorney general more power to investigate the transactions. Indiana passed a law that gives the attorney general authority to investigate market concentration. 
Oregon passed an oversight law that not only limits how much private equity firms can buy up a health care market, but also bars private equity firms from having any control over clinical operations. The law also gives the state power to block any pending transitions that violate the law. California also enacted another law that prohibits private investors from interfering with the judgment of physicians and dentists. 
New Mexico passed a law that strengthened its 2024 Health Care Consolidation Oversight Act, which temporarily gave the state regulators more oversight over transactions. The new law makes that oversight authority permanent and more expansive, while also establishing penalties for non-compliance with reporting requirements. And Washington state passed a transparency law creating a registry of all health care entities. 










The purpose of the dealmaking is to enrich the owners as quickly as possible, and then get out and move on to your next conquest.


– John McDonough, Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health


Maine passed a law to impose a one-year moratorium on all private equity or real estate investment trust purchases of hospitals. 
“The purpose of the dealmaking is to enrich the owners as quickly as possible, and then get out and move on to your next conquest,” McDonough said. “And so there’s a fundamental conflict there between duty to patients as a primary obligation and return on profits to shareholders.” 
According to researchers from the University of California, Berkeley, the number of acquisitions of physician practices rose from 816 in 2012, to 5,779 in 2021. Researchers also found that some single private equity firms captured 30-50% of specialty practices in local markets.
With limited congressional oversight on private equity actions in health care, states play a critical role in reining in predatory practices, said Michael Fenne, senior policy coordinator at the Private Equity Stakeholder Project, a watchdog group that monitors private equity activity.
“There’s not really federal law that targets private equity acquisitions in the same way [as laws] that states have been passing recently,” he said.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-11-21 18:00:00+00:00,CT Mirror,Surging CT surplus approaches $2 billion,Keith M. Phaneuf,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/11/21/surging-ct-surplus-approaches-2-billion/,"The sharpest growth comes in income tax receipts tied to quarterly filings, a category dominated by capital gains and other investment-related earnings.","One week after Connecticut reserved $500 million from last year’s surplus to potentially replace vanishing federal dollars for human services, surging revenues already have replenished much of the state’s coffers.
Gov. Ned Lamont’s administration this week projected an updated surplus of nearly $2 billion for this fiscal year, up $213 million from last month. And that huge cushion, equal to 8% of the General Fund, would be even larger had President Donald Trump and Congress not extended federal corporate tax cuts otherwise set to expire. Connecticut links its corporate tax system to the federal code — as do several other states.
But that corporate tax revenue hit, estimated at slightly less than $140 million, is more than offset by surges in state income and other business tax receipts. The sharpest growth comes in income tax receipts tied to quarterly filings, a category dominated by capital gains and other investment-related earnings.
State officials had been expecting good news since Nov. 10, when fiscal analysts for the legislative and executive branches upgraded revenue projections by $1.1 billion from a joint forecast issued April 30. Legislators already had anticipated some of that growth in the latest state budget, which they adopted last June.
Advocates for greater social services and health care spending say a $213 million bump upward to an already enormous state surplus means Connecticut is well positioned to help its most vulnerable residents as federal funding shrinks.
An omnibus measure Trump and Congress passed in July would curb funding for: health insurance subsidies; grants to combat homelessness; and Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program or SNAP benefits for immigrants, young adults, veterans and people experiencing homelessness.
The Connecticut Department of Social Services estimates the latter cut could affect as many as 36,000 residents here between Dec. 1 and March 31.
Advocates for free and reduced meal services in Connecticut schools expect the SNAP cuts will trigger a reduction in federal aid for subsidized school breakfast and lunch programs.
Lamont, whom legislators gave sole discretion to propose what federal cuts, if any, Connecticut should reverse by tapping this $500 million state fund, has not said yet what he’ll do.
But while that response fund is temporary — expiring in early February — the federal cutbacks that social service advocates worry about would continue indefinitely. In other words, if Connecticut taps the $500 million reserve to help combat homelessness or help provide health insurance, groceries or school meals in December and January, advocates would expect Connecticut to continue dedicating state funds indefinitely — meaning likely for years to come.
State legislators and Lamont likely won’t resolve that larger question until after the regular 2026 General Assembly session, which starts on Feb. 4.
“I do worry about using short term monies to pay for long term obligations,” the governor said this week. “I think that’s something that’s gotten us in trouble in the past. [But] we’re going to take care of people in need.”
But Connecticut’s state finances haven’t been “in trouble” for quite a while.
State budget surpluses have averaged about $1.8 billion per year since 2017, when aggressive budget caps were installed to force big savings. And given that only roughly one quarter of state spending is discretionary, leaving $1.8 billion or 8% unspent is huge.
“The chaos in Washington D.C. is made worse by inaction or delayed action here at home,” said Emily Byrne, executive director of Connecticut Voices for Children, an economic policy and advocacy group. 
“While the government shutdown may be over, the harm is not gone,” Byrne said. “The Congressional mega-bill kicked off thousands of Connecticut residents from food assistance and tens of thousands more are struggling to meet the new, rigorous work requirements to receive SNAP. Over one hundred thousand residents are wondering how they’re going to afford health coverage next year and many more are worried about the new rigorous work requirements placed on beneficiaries of Medicaid.”
Byrne added, “Connecticut must be vigilant and proactive so that our residents are protected. We’re talking about people’s lives. The state must act now.”
CT For All, a progressive coalition of more than 60 faith, labor and other civic organizations, has argued for years that state surpluses don’t honestly reflect excess, unneeded dollars. Rather they involve vital resources siphoned away from core programs. Lamont and the General Assembly have used more of these surpluses, about $10 billion since 2020, to accelerate paying down Connecticut’s hefty pension debt.
“To call this money ‘a surplus’ is a lie,” said CT For All Director Norma Martinez-HoSang. “Year to year we underestimate the money available for spending, while public education institutes and social services are underfunded and policies that would improve our lives are taken off the table.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/BOND-COMMISSION-0801-SR-10-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-11-21 13:57:43.101816

Tryouts and recruiting for the inaugural roster are expected to ramp up over the next year, with the first group of Lightning flag football players set to take the field in fall 2026.
WILMINGTON, Del. — Women’s flag football is quickly becoming one of the fastest-growing varsity sports in college athletics — and Goldey-Beacom College is betting big that Delaware should be part of the first wave.
Goldey-Beacom announced Oct. 16 that it will launch a women’s flag football program for the 2026–27 academic year, making the Lightning one of the first colleges in Delaware to sponsor the sport at the varsity level and positioning the school as a regional leader in a rapidly expanding game.
The move comes as women’s flag football gains momentum nationally, pushed by NCAA recognition, investment from the NFL and the sport’s upcoming debut in the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics.
A national trend meets a local opportunity
In February 2025, the NCAA Committee on Women’s Athletics recommended women’s flag football for inclusion in the Emerging Sports for Women program, a key step toward full championship status once at least 40 schools sponsor the sport.
The NAIA officially sanctioned women’s flag football in 2020 and held its first championships in 2021. The NJCAA followed in 2023, widening the pipeline for two-year college athletes. Today, more than 65 NCAA schools sponsor women’s flag football at the club or varsity level, with at least 20 more expected by 2026.
Colleges are adding programs for several reasons:

It is less equipment-intensive and generally safer than tackle football.
It attracts new female athletes, many of whom did not play traditional high school sports.
It offers a fresh way to boost campus spirit, enrollment and alumni engagement.

With flag football set to be an Olympic sport in 2028, athletic directors see a rare chance to build a new women’s program at the ground level — and to offer scholarships in a sport that is only going to grow.
Goldey-Beacom “gets in on the ground floor”
That is exactly how Goldey-Beacom’s athletic leadership views the opportunity.
Director of Athletics Jeremy Benoit has framed the decision as a strategic move that aligns the college with a sport on the rise, noting that Goldey-Beacom is “getting in on the ground floor” just as interest in girls’ and women’s flag football is exploding at the high school level and drawing support from the NFL.
The 2026–27 season will mark flag football as the college’s 15th varsity sport and is expected to fold into competition within the Central Atlantic Collegiate Conference, where a conference championship could be in place as early as 2027.
By acting now, Goldey-Beacom aims to become a destination for female athletes from Delaware, Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Maryland who want to keep playing flag football beyond high school.
Tim Griffiths, the college’s Academic Interventionist Coach for the past four years, was named the inaugural head coach
A coach built for a startup program
To lead the new program, Goldey-Beacom turned to someone who already knows its student-athletes and has a record of building teams from scratch.
Tim Griffiths, the college’s Academic Interventionist Coach for the past four years, was named the inaugural head coach. Griffiths is a former Division II football player at Mansfield University and a past captain of the U.S. National Rugby Team. He has extensive experience launching athletic programs in public education — a background that translates directly to starting a new varsity sport.
Griffiths calls flag football the “ultimate team sport,” and says his vision is for the Lightning “Bolts” to be a force not just on the field, but in life.
He stresses that the program will be built on leadership, sportsmanship and self-confidence as much as playbooks and playcalling, and that academics will remain central. Goldey-Beacom recently celebrated a 91% NCAA Academic Success Rate and 57 student-athletes named to the Central Atlantic Collegiate Conference All-Academic Team.
Delaware’s chance to lead in a new women’s sport
For Delaware, Goldey-Beacom’s decision marks a significant step. The college becomes one of the state’s first institutions to commit to women’s flag football at the varsity level, giving local high school athletes a nearby option to continue in the sport without leaving the region.
With the college’s proximity to the Philadelphia Eagles and the NFL’s growing investment in girls’ and women’s flag football, Goldey-Beacom officials believe there will be opportunities for clinics, joint events and exposure that few campuses can match.
As colleges across the country race to add women’s flag football, Goldey-Beacom is betting that an early start — and a clear focus on both academics and leadership — will make the Lightning a flagship program in the Mid-Atlantic.
Tryouts and recruiting for the inaugural roster are expected to ramp up over the next year, with the first group of Lightning flag football players set to take the field in fall 2026.",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-21-123234.jpg,,,2025-11-21 12:57:20.887893

You can read more about the section here.

On my first day of school in Mississippi, a boy pinned me to the ground and made me eat dirt. I was a California kid dropped into the Deep South in the 1980s and learned quickly that I didn’t belong. That moment set the tone for the rest of my years there.
My family was multiracial. My sister had been adopted from Korea. Back home, that didn’t raise eyebrows. In Mississippi, people would ask where we “got” her, as if she were something that came with a label. I saw people living in tarpaper shacks just down the road from our home in Madison.
Even as a kid I could feel something settled in the ground and in the air. A weight. A history. A tension that told me everything I needed to know without anyone saying it out loud. I understood early that the place was not built for someone like me.
When I finally left after seventh grade, I made myself a promise: I would never set foot in Mississippi again. And for almost 40 years, I’ve kept that promise. I planned my life around avoiding the state, even once choosing to vacation in Europe so I wouldn’t have to attend a company retreat in Biloxi. Mississippi was a closed chapter. A place I ran from and never looked back.
Then came Lane Kiffin.
The irony is obvious. I grew up in a UCLA and San Francisco 49ers household. Lane Kiffin is USC and the Raiders. He survived getting fired on an airport tarmac while coaching the University of Southern California football team. He survived Raiders owner Al Davis publicly dressing him down like he had no business holding a headset.

Yet, he looks calmer in Oxford than anywhere he has ever been. Maybe he has found his elusive peace in Mississippi. And I respect that deeply. Peace was not something Mississippi ever offered me.
Kiffin and I are opposites, but we share one thing. We have lived like vagabonds. Always on the move. Always trying to outrun something. For him, it was pressure, expectations and the shadow of his own potential. For me, it was a childhood I wanted to forget and a place I refused to return to. Mississippi wasn’t my place, but maybe it’s his. And there is something admirable about seeing a man find a home in the last place anyone expected.
He has made me rethink things I didn’t think were up for reconsideration. I find myself rooting for him to stay, and in a strange way, rooting for the people of Mississippi to win this one. LSU and Florida can circle all they want. I hope he stays right where he is.
I’m not saying I’m ready to book a ticket back or retrace the streets of my childhood. But I can say that I no longer feel the hard line I once drew. Mississippi will probably never be my place, but I can appreciate that it has become someone else’s. And in watching Lane Kiffin settle into the life he has built there, I’ve felt something I never expected.
A softening. A shift. A recognition that even the places we leave can still hold something worthwhile.
So, yes, I’m rooting for him to stay. I’m rooting for Ole Miss to keep its coach. And for the first time in my life, I’m rooting for Mississippi, too.

,DC,2025-11-21 17:07:11+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,New federal student debt rule seen as tool to enforce Trump agenda,Shauneen Miranda,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/new-federal-student-debt-rule-seen-tool-enforce-trump-agenda,,"WASHINGTON — A new U.S. Department of Education regulation to narrow eligibility for a key student debt relief program for public service workers has drawn strong opposition from advocates who argue the regulation is an attempt to target organizations whose missions do not align with President Donald Trump’s agenda. Under a final rule slated to take effect in July, employers that participate in “unlawful activities such that they have a substantial illegal purpose” would be excluded from the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program, which is meant to encourage college graduates to pursue careers in public service.The language of the final rule, which focuses on issues such as gender-affirming care and illegal immigration, has also raised concerns it meant to enforce the Trump administration’s priorities.At least three lawsuits from Democratic attorneys general, cities, labor unions and nonprofit advocacy groups argue that the regulation is overly vague and exceeds the department’s authority. The rule would hurt not only the institutions that benefit from the program, but the public service workers themselves, Winston Berkman-Breen, legal director at the advocacy group Protect Borrowers, told States Newsroom.“It’s not just about the macro effect of whether these organizations, including governments, will be able to do the work they do,” he said. “It’s also the individual financial health and security of borrowers and their households that will be really, really detrimentally affected by this rule, and we’re already sort of seeing that happen.” The organization is representing a coalition of cities, nonprofit advocacy groups and labor unions in one of the lawsuits over the regulation. Here’s a closer look at the policy and what it would mean for borrowers and employers: What is Public Service Loan Forgiveness?Congress created the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program, or PSLF, in 2007 via the College Cost Reduction and Access Act to incentivize people to take on public service careers. PSLF forgives the remaining student debt for borrowers after they make 120 qualifying monthly payments while working for an eligible employer. How will the regulation work? The department’s final rule — which stems from a March executive order — is only forward-looking, meaning workers would not lose any credit earned prior to the July 1, 2026, effective date. Under the policy, the Education secretary can determine “by a preponderance of the evidence” that an employer has taken part in “illegal activities such that the organization has a substantial illegal purpose.” Affected employers can either reapply to serve as a qualifying employer after 10 years or try to regain eligibility in a quicker timeframe if they enter into a “corrective action plan” that needs the secretary’s approval. The activities that could disqualify employers, according to the department, include: “Aiding and abetting” illegal immigration or “illegal discrimination”Providing gender-affirming careSupporting terrorism or “engaging in violence for the purpose of obstructing or influencing” federal government policyTrafficking children across states “for purposes of emancipation from their lawful parents”Violating state lawsWhat’s the debate about?Though the administration has framed the rule as an effort to punish “criminal activity,” advocates and Democratic officials see it as a way to target organizations that are not aligned with the administration’s goals.“The bases for the disqualification that are in the final rule for the secretary of Education are pretty clearly just proxies for being engaged in activities that this administration doesn’t agree with or that don’t align with its agenda,” Berkman-Breen said.He pointed to supporting immigrant communities, gender-affirming care, transgender rights, diverse hiring, teaching an accurate portrayal of racial history in this country and the right to peaceful protest as examples. Berkman-Breen said these activities are “very clearly things that this administration in other parts of the government has already attacked in civil society and in the states and local communities, but they’re now bringing that sort of attack into the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program.”In response to a request for comment, the department shared a statement from Under Secretary of Education Nicholas Kent, who said “it is unconscionable that the plaintiffs are standing up for” what he describes as “criminal activity.” “This is a commonsense reform that will stop taxpayer dollars from subsidizing organizations involved in terrorism, child trafficking, and transgender procedures that are doing irreversible harm to children,” he said. “The final rule is crystal clear: the Department will enforce it neutrally, without consideration of the employer’s mission, ideology, or the population they serve.”How will employers be affected? Michele Zampini, associate vice president for federal policy and advocacy at the Institute for College Access & Success, said the final rule will divert nonprofits’ ability to focus on their mission and impede their ability to keep staff on and attract new workers.The final rule “will have the effect of putting a lot of nonprofits doing a lot of really important work in their communities in a defensive position, whether they’re being preemptively defensive to try and avoid running afoul of the administration, or whether they’re already kind of in a position where the administration has identified them as a target,” she said. Zampini, whose group aims to advance affordability, accountability and equity in higher education, added that the program was crucial in attracting talent to service-oriented work. “PSLF is a big part of what ... enables people to take on what may be lower-paying jobs in exchange for being able to manage their debt over time,” she said. “If people don’t have that option, or even if they feel like they don’t have that option or are afraid they won’t have that option, it becomes a lot harder to kind of attract people to those roles.” What legal challenges have come out against the policy? The administration is already facing a handful of lawsuits over the final rule, with critics urging federal courts to vacate the policy and deem it “unlawful.”The challengers include a slew of cities, labor unions and nonprofit advocacy groups who filed suit in a Massachusetts federal court Nov. 3. Another lawsuit was brought the same day in the same federal court from Democratic attorneys general in Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, the District of Columbia, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington state and Wisconsin. Four nonprofit advocacy groups also filed a suit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia on Nov. 4 against the administration over the rule.",,,,2025-11-21 12:57:20.887893

in a 181-page opinion issued Thursday evening, the three-judge panel dismissed claims brought by the North Carolina NAACP, Common Cause, and individual voters against districts used in the 2024 election 
In those lawsuits, which were brought in 2023, plaintiffs claimed that congressional and state Senate districts in the Piedmont, Mecklenburg County, and eastern counties were drawn to dilute the power of Black voters. 
Republican legislators said they did not use racial data in creating the districts. 
The judges, all Republican appointees, held a six-day trial last summer. Their opinion said Republican map-drawers “did not act with discriminatory purpose,” and that opponents failed to prove any of their claims. 
“After considering all the evidence, we find that Plaintiffs have failed to prove that the North Carolina General Assembly drew state Senate or federal congressional districts with the discriminatory purpose of minimizing or canceling out the voting potential of black North Carolinians. The racial data necessary to execute such a discriminatory purpose was not used in drafting the 2023 Senate or congressional plans,” the judges wrote. 
“The circumstances surrounding the plans’ enactment and the resulting district configurations and composition are consistent with the General Assembly’s non-racial motivations, which included traditional districting criteria, North Carolina law, and partisan performance,” the opinion continued.
The judges did not rule on the claims against the newly drawn 1st Congressional District, which Republicans reconfigured last month in order to elect another GOP member of the U.S. House. A hearing on those claims was held Wednesday. Opponents have asked the judges to prevent the new districts from being used in the 2026 election.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/IMG_4636-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-11-21 12:57:20.887893

Also of note

Former state legislator and first Black Political Director of the Michigan Democratic Party Fred Durhal Jr. passed away late Wednesday, prompting incoming Detroit Mayor Mary Sheffield to eulogize Durhal, saying she was “deeply saddened” by the passing of a “remarkable leader and tireless advocate for Detroiters.”
Among the many messages of remembrance and condolence, was a statement from Curtis Hertel, chair of the Michigan Democratic Party.
“Fred Durhal Jr. is a giant of Michigan politics, and his impact on the city of Detroit and the entire state of Michigan will be felt for generations to come. He was a state House representative, the Chairman of the Michigan Legislative Black Caucus, and the first Black Political Director of the Michigan Democratic Party. As a state legislator, when Detroit was in bankruptcy, Durhal fought to protect pensions for city workers—saving countless families from poverty in one of the city’s darkest chapters,” Hertel said. “Throughout his entire life, Fred Durhal Jr. was a fighter, dedicating his life to helping others through public service. His loss is felt deeply by this party and across the state, and our thoughts are with his children and grandchildren.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Advance-at-a-glance-political-roundup-v2-1024x662.png,,,2025-11-21 12:57:20.887893

That’s created a dilemma for some members of the Black community: Should they actively join protests against the crackdown, or sit this one out?

William Dickens, a member of the Raleigh chapter of American Descendants of Slavery, doesn’t think Black people should get involved. Dickens said he doesn’t recall Latinos supporting Black people during their struggles.
“People just try to turn us into the mule for everybody, while at the same time, we’re suffering, we’re drowning,” Dickens said. “Who’s supporting us?”
American Descendants of Slavery is an Atlanta-based grassroots group that, among other things, advocates for reparations for the descendants of slaves. Dickens said he isn’t speaking for the organization.
Dickens noted Trump made gains with Latino voters in the 2024 presidential election. According to the Pew Research Center, Trump garnered 48% of the Latino vote compared to Kamala Harris’ 51% share. Trump won 36% of the Latino vote in the 2020 presidential election.
“They [Latinos] voted for him and now they get what they get,” Dickens said, a sentiment also shared by other Black people across various social media platforms.
Dickens said Black men are harmed most by illegal and legal immigration. They lose out in the competition for jobs, which also keeps their wages lower than they should be, he said. 
“So, what you’re looking at is a direct impact of immigration, leaving us jobless, homeless, leading to us going to prison,” Dickens said.
But other Black people see Latinos as allies who must be supported. In Durham, for example, the Union of Southern Service Workers has been a staunch supporter of Latino causes and present at recent immigration protests.
“In the Union of Southern Service Workers, we know that joy and solidarity is the best antidote against fear and division,” Mama Cookie Bradley, a union member, said in a statement. “We stand united with working people and communities across North Carolina in declaring that there is absolutely no emergency that justifies the presence of federal immigration forces in Durham.”
Jovita Lee (Photo: NC Black Alliance)
Jovita Lee, a program director for the NC Black Alliance, said whether Black people know it or not, they should be concerned about what’s happening to Latinos in North Carolina and across the country.
The Alliance is opposed to federal immigration agents being in North Carolina as part of Trump’s mass deportation efforts, Lee said.
“I won’t decide if folks are right or wrong in regard to their personal opinion [about immigration], but I will speak to fact – and the fact of the matter is these practices are indeed harming both brown communities and Black communities,” Lee said. 
She compared immigration agents to “slave patrols” in the antebellum South that had the authority to stop and question enslaved people and to search homes without warrants.
“This narrative around that it has nothing to do with us, I would disagree with,” Lee said. “The discriminatory practices and the racism that it is rooted in is very reminiscent of what we saw in our own history.” 
While President Trump initially said federal agents would target the “worst of the worst” undocumented immigrants, including violent criminals and gang members,  Lee said the administration can’t be trusted to “stick to the script.”
“Folks are being picked up or identified strictly based on appearance, color of skin, how they may look, how their accent may sound, and that is absolutely rooted in discrimination,” Lee said. 
Some African Americans are likely sitting out protests out of fear of being mistaken for a Black immigrant, Lee said. And historically, African Americans and Black immigrants have viewed immigration differently, she said.
“I think all of that is kind of influencing that opinion that some Black Americans may have when it comes to immigration not being a topic they want to engage or talk about,” Lee said.
Sen. Floyd McKissick (File Photo)
Floyd McKissick is a former state senator who now chairs the Durham Committee on the Affairs of Black People, an influential political action committee and advocacy group. McKissick said the committee has not met since federal agents arrived in North Carolina, but any member could bring it up at next month’s meeting.
“I think that to the extent to which organizations want to become involved as allies …  today, it may be Latinos, tomorrow it may be African Americans,” McKissick said. “You know, who’s going to be next on the hit list?”
The committee, he said, is concerned about the “totality of the tone of the current administration” and the divisiveness occurring in the country as a result of it. 
“It’s exacerbating fears and prejudices, rather than bringing people together,” McKissick said. “We might not have a dog in this particular fight, but this fight is part of a total messaging that’s going on that’s not positive, and it’s something that we should be deeply concerned about.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_4648-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-21 11:57:22.380779

(Whitney Downard/Indiana Capital Chronicle)After a week of swatting attempts on his colleagues, GOP Sen. Andy Zay on Friday confirmed a bomb threat at his vehicle rental business.
“Yesterday, my business in Huntington was targeted with a bomb threat, which is part of the recent troubling pattern against lawmakers in Indiana,” he said in a news release.
“It’s unfortunate that my family and I continue to be threatened for my work as a public servant and state senator,” Zay continued. “This is no way to weigh in on any public issue, even if you do not agree with my stance. My office is always open, and I encourage constituents with any concerns to reach out.”
Zay is supportive of a controversial proposal to redistrict Indiana’s congressional boundaries — and make Indiana’s two blue districts red — ahead of the 2026 midterm elections.
Four fellow Senate Republican caucus members have been targeted in attempted swattings this week, with another reporting unspecified “violent threats,” but they are all against redistricting or are undecided.
“Swatting” involves hoax calls or reports to emergency services intended to trigger armed responses — and can have lethal consequences for unwitting victims at the swatted location.
“I want to be clear: I strongly condemn these acts, which have no place in our political process,” Zay said. “While the intent behind these intimidation threats seems to be to instill fear in public officials, I can assure my constituents that I remain committed to serving our district, being your voice and continuing my work at the Statehouse.”
The Indiana State Police is investigating the string of incidents.
Zay thanked police and said, “I am hopeful that state and local law enforcement will be able to find those responsible and hold them accountable for their actions.”

The margin of error is 3.95% for the overall sample and 6.38% for the Hispanic sample.

Democrats and unaffiliated voters in Colorado were significantly more likely to have said the state of politics in the U.S. is in crisis, with 84% of Democrats saying so and 78% of independent voters saying so, while 49% of Republicans said so. 
(Colorado Polling Institute)
Just under half of the respondents, 47%, think Colorado is headed in the right direction, and those who think the state is going in the wrong direction, 44% of respondents, think so more intensely, Lori Weigel with New Bridge Strategy said. While only 7% of those who think the state is going in the right direction say it definitely is, 28% of those who say it is going in the wrong direction say it definitely is. 
Democrats are more likely to think the state is going in the right direction while Republicans are more likely to think it is going in the wrong direction. Democrats control all statewide elected offices in Colorado and have majorities in both chambers of the Colorado Legislature. 
Concerns about immigration, cost of living and housing affordability are the top issues voters said they want the state government to address, followed by homelessness, health care and mental health, and schools and education. 
The majority of respondents also have concerns about the state budget or believe it is in crisis, with fewer people saying the budget is in good shape than in a March poll CPI conducted. Most respondents think the economy in Colorado will get worse over the next year.
Consumer spending
More Coloradans cut spending on non-essential items over the last year compared to voters nationally, which CPI determined by asking a question used in a national poll Quinnipiac University conducted in September. In Colorado, 61% of respondents said they have cut spending compared to 42% nationally. 
(Colorado Polling Institute)
“It’s a notable distinction from where the American electorate is right now in terms of that perception,” Weigel said. “And it could be that some of the higher cost of living, cost of housing, all those related things might be bearing a little more of a burden here in Colorado.”
Favorability of state officials including Gov. Jared Polis and U.S. Sens. John Hickenlooper and Michael Bennet has decreased slightly since CPI’s poll in March. While 51% of voters found Polis favorable in March, 45% did in the November survey. For Hickenlooper, a Democrat, 49% found him favorable in March, while 43% found him favorable in November. In March, 45% of voters found Bennet, also a Democrat, favorable, while 41% found him favorable in November. 
Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser, who is running against Bennet in the Democratic primary for governor in 2026, has less name recognition among Democrats but slightly higher favorability. Among Democrats, Bennet has a 3-to-1 favorability ratio while Weiser has a 4-to-1 favorability ratio. 
National politics
Colorado voters’ opinions on Trump have not changed much since a March poll: 58% of voters said they had an unfavorable opinion of him then while with 59% say so now. Of the Hispanic oversample, 66% view Trump negatively, Kevin Ingham of Aspect Strategic said. 
Almost three quarters of Coloradans think Congress should extend Affordable Care Act tax credits for people who purchase health insurance through the individual marketplace, on par with what voters nationally said in a September KFF poll. Extending the tax credits was a primary point of debate around the shutdown, as most Democrats refused to vote for a funding package that did not extend the credits. The average increase in Colorado for ACA consumers is estimated to be 170% when the credits expire this year. Democrats are more likely to support extending the tax credits, while more Republicans support letting the credits expire. 
(Colorado Polling Institute)
A majority of Colorado voters, 54%, said the Trump administration is going too far on deporting immigrants. Of the Hispanic voters polled, 59% said Trump has gone too far. A quarter of Coloradans think the administration’s immigration enforcement is about right, and 19% say it hasn’t gone far enough. 
Half of all voters think local law enforcement should be allowed to cooperate with federal immigration enforcement, while 37% of Hispanic voters think so. A Colorado law prohibits local law enforcement from cooperating with federal immigration operations.  
Hispanic voters were nearly twice as likely to know someone who has been detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement — 8% of all voters know someone, while 14% of Hispanic voters do. The poll also asked if respondents have seen ICE in their community or have heard of ICE presence even if they haven’t seen them personally. Thirteen percent of Colorado voters have seen ICE, while 15% of Hispanic voters have. More than half of respondents, 55%, said they have heard about ICE in their community but haven’t seen its presence, while 47% of Hispanic voters have. 
“Voters do have some concerns about how ICE is behaving. When we ask, 64% of all Coloradans and 73% of Hispanic voters were concerned that ICE was detaining people who should not be detained,” Ingham said. “And those concerns were quite intense, because half of all Coloradans and 56% of Hispanic voters said that they were very concerned about this.”

(Courtesy of Union Omaha)OMAHA — Union Omaha soccer and the City of Omaha are planning to build a 6,500-seat sports stadium to anchor a new 20-acre mixed-use entertainment and housing district in the downtown of Nebraska’s biggest city.
The campus — proposed to rise on a largely unused area north of Cuming Street, near where the College World Series is played — comes after an earlier downtown site fell through for the state’s first and only professional soccer club.  
As planned, the City of Omaha would own the estimated $140 million open-air stadium on the tract of land east of the Millwork Commons area and is in the process of buying the land from Union Pacific Railroad.

Financial and other details are contingent on various city and state approvals. The first step is securing the property, said Deputy City Attorney Jennifer Taylor. A land purchase agreement is on the City Council agenda for Tuesday. 
But progress of the project also could hinge on the city and soccer club’s ability to access a bottlenecked state incentive for sports complexes that requires approval from Gov. Jim Pillen.
 24-7-365 village

Union Omaha officials foresee a 24-hour village with an estimated 500 residences occupied in part by athletes. Shops, dining and offices would surround the sports complex that also would be home to a new women’s soccer team and feature various community and sporting events.
“It’s been a long and winding circular road, but we’re very happy,” said Larry Botel of Alliance Sports, which owns Union Soccer. He anticipates up to $400 million in development on the 20 acres, beyond the stadium investment.
If all goes as hoped, construction would start next year, and Union Soccer would be playing at its new home stadium in the 2028 season. 
For its upcoming 2026 season, the two-time USL League One champions will play at Creighton University’s Morrison Stadium in downtown Omaha.
Botel described the new soccer stadium campus — along with nearby Charles Schwab Field of the men’s College World Series and the CHI Health Center arena and convention center — as a stadium district.
Concerts are a staple at CHI Health Center Omaha, which would be walking distance from a new mixed-use soccer stadium development imagined by Omaha leaders and Union Omaha. (Aaron Sanderford/Nebraska Examiner)
“They’re all within a 10-minute walk of each other,” he said “We’re going to be sharing amenities like parking and things like that. It’s all coming together to create a very robust stadium district for the city — it’s exciting.”
The plan has been evolving for about a year, Botel said, after the earlier site became financially unfeasible. He said the venture would be funded by both private and public dollars.
At least one difference in the current plan is a larger role by the city, which would own the sports facility. It would have 6,500 fixed seats, with overall capacity reaching about 8,500 fans who could also be in the berm and standing-room spaces. The estimated $140 million includes infrastructure costs as well.
 Potential headwinds

One source of anticipated funding to assist with construction expenses would be the “turnback” state sales tax revenue available through the Sports Arena Facility Financing Assistance Act, he said.
Tax-increment financing also will be requested, as well as an occupation tax and possibly direct city financing using tools such as capital improvement dollars, according to a statement from the city and Union Omaha.
Omaha Mayor John Ewing called the vision “huge” and said it would be a draw for jobs and urban living.
“The stadium and surrounding district would offer another reason to live, work and play downtown, strengthening our urban core,” he said. “It demonstrates what’s possible when public and private partners share a vision for growth that benefits the entire community.”
Heath Mello, president and CEO of the Greater Omaha Chamber of Commerce, called the project “catalytic.”
“It adds energy to our urban core, helps recruit and retain the workforce of the future and creates a professional sport destination that strengthens Omaha’s competitiveness with other growing U.S. cities.”
The plans come to light on the heels of statements by Pillen, who has been skeptical about the use of a turnback tax via the Sports Arena Facilities Financing Assistance Act.
Under the related law, for an applicant to tap into the incentive, the governor has to be among a majority vote of the SAFFAA board. He said he would not consider approval of any project until next June. 
“I stand with Nebraska taxpayers, and against more special interest carveouts to our sales tax base when the Legislature has not yet closed the loopholes necessary to deliver lasting and transformative property tax relief to Nebraska homeowners, farmers and ranchers,” he reiterated Friday on social media.
This is a developing story.

(Photo by Amanda Brown for New Jersey Monitor)The special election for Gov.-elect Mikie Sherrill’s vacant seat in the House will take place April 16, the governor announced Friday. 
Gov. Phil Murphy (D) issued a writ of election to fill Sherrill’s House vacancy after her resignation from Congress went into effect at 11:59 p.m. Thursday. Sherrill (D) becomes governor on Jan. 20.
Murphy directed that a special primary election be held on Thursday, Feb. 5. The deadline for primary candidates to file nominating petitions is Monday, Dec. 1, at 4 p.m.
Democrats jockey to replace Gov.-elect Mikie Sherrill in Congress

The race to succeed Sherrill in the House is already a crowded one. At least 10 Democrats and one Republican have already announced campaigns, including Essex County Commissioner Brendan Gill, former Rep. Tom Malinowski, and Lt. Gov. Tahesha Way. 
The person elected by voters on Thursday, April 16, will fill out the remainder of Sherrill’s current term, which ends Jan. 3, 2027.
The 11th Congressional District includes parts of Essex, Morris, and Passaic counties.
In-person early voting for the special primary will run from Jan. 29 through Feb. 3, and for the special general election from April 6 through April 14.
National Republican Congressional Committee spokeswoman Maureen O’Toole blasted Murphy’s special election timeline as “blatant political corruption designed to protect Democratic insiders and silence voters.” 
“By setting a ballot deadline to just after the Thanksgiving holiday, he’s denying access for anyone outside the political machine to qualify and give voters a real choice at the ballot box,” she said in a statement Friday.
Sherrill, who will be New Jersey’s 57th governor, defeated Republican Jack Ciattarelli by a 14-point margin in the gubernatorial race earlier this month.

Gavin Newsom signed Assembly Bill 30 into law Oct. 2, immediately legalizing the year-round sale of E15 in California. (Stock photo via Getty Images)Farm state politicians have been trying for more than a decade to pass legislation that would allow E15 — gasoline containing 15% ethanol — to be sold year-round across the country. While E15 can be sold from Sept. 15 to June 1 each year, an antiquated glitch in the Environmental Protection Agency’s fuel regulations prevents gas stations from offering it each summer when America’s roadways are the busiest.
When I served in Congress, we got close and for his part, President Donald Trump tried to use administrative powers to remove that glitch during his first term in 2019. But, threatened by the competition of more ethanol, oil refiners sued to stop Trump — and they won. The courts found that only Congress can permanently remove the summertime E15 barrier.
So, with the 2025 congressional calendar ticking away, year-round E15 remains stuck in the mud and Big Oil’s ethanol barricade remains in place. Meanwhile, corn farmers are harvesting the largest-ever crop in history, corn prices are plummeting, farm bankruptcies are on the rise, and grain is piling up across the Midwest. Year-round E15 would provide an immediate demand boost and brighten the otherwise grim prospects in farm country.
E15 typically sells for 10-30 cents less per gallon than regular gasoline, meaning the summertime barrier prevents consumers from accessing a lower-cost, cleaner-burning option that includes a higher content of American-made fuel.
But here is the ironic twist. On Oct. 2, with the stroke of a pen, California Gov. Gavin Newsom did what President Trump and Midwest lawmakers haven’t been able to do. He signed Assembly Bill 30 into law, immediately legalizing the year-round sale of E15 in California, the nation’s second-largest gasoline market.
In signing the bill, Newsom stated, “While we continue the critical work to stabilize our state’s fuel market, we’re cutting red tape to provide consumers with more options as we continue our transition to cleaner transportation.” He also cited a recent study by the University of California, Berkeley and the United States Naval Academy, showing E15 “could lower gasoline prices by up to $0.20 per gallon and save Californians as much as $2.7 billion annually.”
Because California has its own unique gasoline specifications, the seemingly immovable EPA summertime barrier that bedevils states across the country simply doesn’t apply in the Golden State. California retailers can now sell E15 fuel 365 days a year.
Newsom’s move to allow year-round E15 could boost demand for ethanol by 600 million gallons, providing a sorely needed increase in corn demand. If California gas stations adopt E15 statewide, over 200 million bushels of additional corn — equivalent to the entire annual corn crop in Texas or Kentucky — will be needed to satisfy the new demand.
Adding to the intrigue is the fact that Trump and Republican lawmakers continue to promote the idea that Newsom and California have “waged war on liquid fuels.” Yet, the allowance to sell E15 year-round in the state would cement California as the single largest market for corn ethanol in the country.
All of this leads to some natural questions. Are Trump, Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins and GOP lawmakers really trying hard enough to secure year-round E15 and open new markets for farmers? If California, the bastion of electric vehicles, can get it done, why can’t our leaders in Washington? If the president and his fellow Republicans want to “Make America Great Again” doesn’t that start with supporting American workers and helping all Americans save money?
While farmers are caught in Trump’s trade war, the president and Republican lawmakers appear headed for yet another round of bailout payments, rather than creating new demand opportunities for our nation’s corn and soybean growers. If they really want to help America’s farmers, they should simply follow California’s lead and do whatever it takes to allow year-round, nationwide E15 sales as quickly as possible.",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/biofuelnozzle-1024x673.jpg,,,2025-11-21 11:57:22.380779

Filing in the United States District Court for the Western District of Michigan, the groups Beyond Nuclear, Don’t Waste Michigan, and Michigan Safe Energy Future argue that the plant, which was previously under decommissioning status, is legally barred from resuming operations. 
By granting Holtec an exemption from those regulations the three groups argue the commission violated the Atomic Energy Act, the Administrative Procedure Act and the commission’s own regulations. They asked the court to find the commission’s decision in violation of the law, and to bar the commission from approving Holtec’s exemption request.
“This lawsuit alleges that the [commission] and Holtec didn’t just bend the regulations. They both broke the law to resurrect a reactor that was fifty plus years old, poorly maintained and could not compete in the open market. Palisades is not needed, way too expensive even with massive public subsidies, and unsafe,” Wallace Taylor, co-counsel for the groups bringing the suit said.
Prema Chandrathil, a public affairs officer for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission said the body does not comment on ongoing litigation.
However, Chandrathil reiterated that the commission has been conducting “methodical, thorough and independent reviews of licensing actions and conducting real-time inspections of the plant’s maintenance, testing and repairs of systems and components required for plant startup.”
“The plant can only startup when this work is completed and the [commission] determines that plant systems, components and programs meet federal requirements,” Chandrathil said. 
While the organizations filing the suit have raised several concerns about the conditions of the plant and the safety of a restart, Patrick O’Brien, Holtec’s director of government affairs and communications, said the commission’s approval to reauthorize operations at the plant “followed a rigorous, independent review under the agency’s existing regulatory framework.” 
“As we move toward the plant’s historic restart, our top priority is ensuring the plant is prepared to return to long-term safe and reliable generation,” O’Brien said.

In this image, Davids speaks during a Feb. 28, 2025, news conference in Kansas City, Kansas. (Photo by Anna Kaminski/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — U.S. Rep. Sharice Davids of Kansas joined five dozen colleagues requesting a House vote on legislation extending federal tax credits set to expire at the end of December that were implemented to moderate Affordable Care Act insurance costs.
In the letter signed by 59 lawmakers and sent to House Speaker Mike Johnson, the coalition said a bill preserving the tax credit would allow more than 24 million Americans in the ACA to avoid substantial premium increases in 2026. Sky-high premiums could prompt as many as 4 million people to drop health coverage.
Davids said 160,000 Kansans relied on federal tax credits last year to save an average of $700 annually on health care premiums.
“Families in Kansas and across the country are staring down massive health care price hikes because Congress hasn’t done its job,” said Davids, the Democrat representing the 3rd District in the Kansas City area. “Republican leadership in the Senate has already promised a vote to extend ACA tax credits. There is no excuse for the House to stall any longer.”
Davids said a bipartisan majority in the House support action to mitigate rising health care costs. While Democrats have sought a tax-credit extension, Republicans complained the credits were costly to the government and helped boost insurance company profits. The Congressional Budget Office estimated it would cost the $350 billion in the next decade if the subsidy were extended.
“Inaction here will decimate millions of Americans’ budgets and force impossible decisions between receiving necessary care and other basic needs,” the letter said.
 
Moran: Aviation shutdown
U.S. Sen. Jerry Moran, chairman of the Senate Aviation, Space and Innovation Subcommittee, said the 43-day government shutdown inhibited operation of the Federal Aviation Administration, caused widespread flight delays and interrupted an estimated $6 billion in travel spending.
Moran convened a Senate hearing to lay the groundwork for legislation capable of shielding the industry during government shutdowns.
“We convened this hearing because of the importance of the aviation and travel industry, a vital component of our nation’s economy,” Moran said. “We must do our part to enable the FAA and the Department of Transportation to make certain that America remains the standard for aviation and air safety.”
In March, the Kansas Republican introduced a bill that would insulate the FAA by making emergency funding available for critical operations and to pay air traffic controllers.
“When Congress fails to act, the FAA and the aviation industry suffer,” Moran said. “The people who work in the airports and in aviation cannot further afford the instability and chaos.”
The U.S. Travel Association reported more than $6 billion in travel spending was lost because of the inability of aircraft to fly as a result of the shutdown.
Moran said he was pleased the problem with flight delays had eased ahead of the Thanksgiving holiday. A record 31 million passengers were expected to fly from Nov. 21 to Dec. 1. The busiest days were expected to be Sunday Nov. 30 and Monday Dec. 1.
 
Estes: CBO transparency
U.S. Rep. Ron Estes, a Kansas Republican serving the Wichita area, said transparency and accuracy of the Congressional Budget Office was essential to the federal legislative process.
During a House budget committee hearing, Estes told CBO director Phillip Swagel that reports issued by the office had a dramatic impact on bills in the House and Senate. CBO, which operates as designated budget scorekeeper, influenced public perception of legislation, Estes said.
“We need to make sure that CBO works to improve scores, to actually make sure that they align with reality,” Estes said. “Unfortunately, as we’ve talked about previously in the committee room, CBO sometimes falls short of making those good estimates that help us make decisions.”
Estes said an example was the CBO’s estimate on the 2022 Inflation Adjustment Act, which focused on health care, climate and taxes, and was signed by President Joe Biden. Estes and GOP U.S. Reps. Tracey Mann and Jake LaTurner of Kansas voted against the bill. Davids voted for it.
Estes said the CBO’s initial report said the energy and climate provisions of the bill would cost $391 billion. Credit Suisse concluded the cost was closer to $800 billion, he said.
“My struggle, and I think a lot of our struggle, is that we’re literally making trillion-dollar decisions based on this information, so we want to make sure it’s the best possible,” he said.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/250228_davids-p02-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-11-21 11:57:22.380779

The Missouri National Education Association is seeking to stop the state from distributing more tax dollars to private schools, saying the $50 million appropriation of general revenue to the MOScholars program is illegal.
Currently, the state has used $38.1 million of the $50 million allocated by the legislature for scholarships, according to the deposition of Trent Blair, program manager for the State Treasurer’s Office. 
The MNEA is asking a judge to stop the outflow of the remaining funds and bar the state treasurer from creating new rules for MOScholars that revolve around the use of general revenue.
“The General Assembly has far overstepped its authority and violated five provisions of the Missouri Constitution by using an appropriations bill to construct out of whole cloth a scheme to divert general revenues to what are essentially vouchers for the payment of private school tuition for elementary and secondary school students,”Loretta Haggard, the teacher’s union’s attorney, wrote in a September court filing.
A month prior, Judge Brian Stumpe denied the MNEA’s request to issue a temporary restraining order that would bar the state from using any of the $50 million while the court case plays out. Stumpe did not elaborate on the denial and simultaneously denied the state’s request to dismiss the case.
The MNEA contends the appropriation of general revenue to MOScholars is not authorized in state statute. It frequently cites the 2021 law that set up the MOScholars program, which uses nonprofits as funding administrators.
The law describes the program as donation-based. Donations are eligible for a tax credit equal to 100% of the contribution up to 50% of an individual’s tax burden. But funding MOScholars directly through state revenue, as was done in the fiscal year 2026 budget passed in May, lacks “statutory framework,” Haggard argues.
Missouri teachers union asks judge to freeze private-school-voucher payments

Statutory silence on whether a program can use general revenue does not mean the state is barred from doing so, William Seidleck, principal deputy solicitor general, told Stumpe in August.
“The pertinent question… is not whether the underlying statute allows beyond doubt an appropriation from the treasury — it is instead whether it obviously prohibits the General Assembly’s action,” Seidleck wrote in a September filing.
Joining the defense of the $50 million voucher program is EdChoice, an Indiana-based advocacy group representing three families who say they benefit from the state’s funding of MOScholars. The group’s attorney is Todd Graves, a prominent Kansas City lawyer and chairman of the Herzog Foundation — which has an affiliated nonprofit that is one of six organizations soliciting donations for and administering MOScholars scholarships.
The trial is likely to revolve around the interpretation of state law, with few exhibits and witnesses listed in pre-trial filings.

In the U.S., close to half of families with children 3 and under struggle to purchase diapers. In Connecticut, it would take 38,136,000 diapers each year to fill the diaper gap, according to a study published by the Urban Institute in September. And in the past few months, this “diaper disparity” has only gotten worse.
“The phones are ringing,” Janet Stolfi Alfano, the CEO of The Diaper Bank of Connecticut said. 
According to the Urban Institue, the average monthly cost of diapers for one child is $100. The median American family could only afford to spend $65 per month. 
Alfano, who has worked at the bank since 2007, said the current need in Connecticut is “great.”
“We can’t keep up with the emails and phone calls lately,” Alfano told the CT Mirror in late October. “Over the past few months, it feels as bad as COVID at least.”
November was no different. As families struggled without SNAP benefits during the government shutdown, Alfano said there was a bit of an uptick in need from October.
The Diaper Bank of Connecticut alone distributed 24,139,948 infant and toddler diapers from 2021 through June 30, 2025. But this still wasn’t enough, and Alfano worries the need will just continue to grow as benefits and social services are cut for residents across the nation.
According to the study, the Capitol Region Council of Government is the most vulnerable to the diaper disparity. This region includes Hartford.
Black and Hispanic residents in Connecticut are also disproportionately more likely to experience this need than white residents.
The effects of this disparity go beyond families, the study found. While not having enough diapers can increase a child’s risk for diaper rash or urinary tract infections, it can also force a parent to miss work or school. The National Diaper Bank found that, nationwide, one in four parents missed work or school because they could not afford to purchase diapers.
And personally, parents or caregivers who cannot afford diapers are twice as likely to report feeling depressed, and one in four reported skipping meals to afford diapers. 
Along with the withholding of SNAP funds earlier this month, Alfano said that issues like the recent formula recall can also put a large burden on families. 
“Folks who are already close to the breaking point are there,” Alfano said. “Everyone is trying to piece it together.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/96G4Q-where-are-families-struggling-the-most-to-purchase-diapers--1024x809.png,,,2025-11-21 11:57:22.380779

Sheila Cherfilus-McCormick (via U.S. House)U.S. Rep. Sheila Cherfilus-McCormick was indicted this week by a grand jury in Miami for allegedly stealing $5 million in federal disaster funds and laundering them toward her 2021 congressional campaign.
Cherfilus-McCormick, D-Miramar, according to a news release from the U.S. Department of Justice, laundered funds from an overpayment from a contract between her family’s health care company and FEMA for COVID-19 vaccination staffing.
According to the indictment, Cherflius-McCormick and other defendants routed the money through several accounts, as well as to friends and relatives, who then donated to her campaign.
“Using disaster relief funds for self-enrichment is a particularly selfish, cynical crime,” said U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi in the news release. “No one is above the law, least of all powerful people who rob taxpayers for personal gain. We will follow the facts in this case and deliver justice.”

The DOJ says the representative could face up to 53 years in prison if convicted.
The case is being investigated by the FBI Miami office and the IRS-Criminal Investigation Florida Field Office.
She also, and her tax preparer, were charged with conspiring to file a false federal tax return.
Among the defendants is the representative’s brother, Edwin Cherfilus.
In a social media post, Cherfilus-McCormick called it “an unjust, baseless, sham indictment — and I am innocent. The timing alone is curious and clearly meant to distract from far more pressing national issues.”
Cherfilus-McCormick stepped down from leadership on the House Foreign Affairs subcommittee Thursday.
U.S. Rep. Greg Steube, R-Sarasota, called the alleged behavior “one of the most egregious abuses of public trust I have ever seen.”
“Stealing $5 million in taxpayer disaster funds from FEMA of all places is beyond indefensible. Millions of Floridians have relied on FEMA after devastating hurricanes, and that money was supposed to help real disaster victims,” Steube wrote on social media.

The spending bill now on Gov. Maura Healey’s desk includes language critical to the overhaul of the former Naval Air Station South Weymouth, which supporters say could unlock thousands of units of new housing plus plenty of space for commercial activity on a site that has been mostly idle for nearly 30 years. 
Sen. Patrick O’Connor, a Weymouth Republican whose district includes the property, called the proposal that cleared the Legislature “the last step” necessary to allow development to resume after a series of delays. 
“We feel confident that this is going to be the last time that we’ll have to go to the Legislature and the last time we’re going to have to act on this,” O’Connor told CommonWealth Beacon in an interview before the final vote. “We really have a very reputable development team that the community has bought into, and we just want them to have the runway to start getting to work.” 
The 1,400-acre site, which also reaches into neighboring Rockland and Abington, was first commissioned in 1942. During World War II, it served as the home base for a blimp patrol squadron and assisted with recovering test torpedoes for the US Navy.  
After the war, the base went through several transformations. It stored naval aircraft, offered flight training, and hosted what a town history called a “secretive research and development outfit.” The facility closed in 1997.

Efforts to redevelop the property, which offers ample space for housing just 15 miles south of Boston with access to the MBTA’s commuter rail network, have gone through a series of stops and starts over the past 15 years with several different developers and changes in ownership.  
A proposal to build a megamall was shot down. An earlier attempt at extensive mixed-use development under developer LNR collapsed during the 2008 Great Recession. In 2013, Connecticut-based Starwood Property Trust purchased LNR, and in the following years, another company called LStar bought the site, then ran into financial trouble and sold off parcels of the land to different owners. 
 At that point, O’Connor said, the project “looked like a really complicated puzzle” with “five different landowners” who each had separate interests.  
“I’ve been working on this project for almost 20 years, and every time that we get momentum, something crazy happens, like the financial crisis of 2008,” said O’Connor, who also served on the Weymouth Town Council before joining the Legislature. 
The outlook has improved over the past half-decade. Global investment firm Brookfield Properties became the master developer in 2020, responsible for managing the overall vision of the project, and a series of agreements have once again tied the parcels together. 
But project leaders say Beacon Hill needs to get involved because the state law that created the Southfield Redevelopment Authority to oversee the project is still based on prior zoning and planning that predates the most recent changes. 
O’Connor said the language tacked onto the Legislature’s fiscal year 2025 closeout budget would formally “combine all those properties” and bring the project into alignment with the most recent zoning plan approved by the three towns. 
Some construction has taken place, erecting about 1,000 housing units on one corner of the parcel, but locals expect that a full project could provide up to 6,000 units and millions of square feet of commercial space.

O’Connor said New England Development, a Boston-based real estate development firm plans to lead the on-the-ground work with financing from Brookfield. 
It’s been a personal project for House Speaker Ron Mariano of Quincy, whose district includes the base.  
“The language included in the supplemental budget is a meaningful step towards realizing the decades-long goal of revitalizing a community through the development of thousands of new units of housing, and through the creation of commercial and recreational space, that will benefit the residents of Weymouth, Abington and Rockland,” Mariano said in a statement to CommonWealth Beacon. “As a lack of housing continues to drive folks out of Massachusetts, this project is a blueprint for how the Commonwealth can address the housing crisis head on and bolster economic development at the same time.” 
Although O’Connor is optimistic the bill will achieve development liftoff, there’s still one more major to-do looming on the horizon: access to water. 
One of the chief issues impacting plans over the year has been the lack of a permanent water source to the site. There’s enough water availability right now to start the project, according to O’Connor, but in the long term, he expects the only viable solution is to add Weymouth and potentially its neighbors to the Massachusetts Water Resources Authority network. 
Last year, the House sought to provide $1 billion toward expansion of the MWRA — which provides sewers but not water to Weymouth — as part of a housing bond bill, but the measure did not survive negotiations with the Senate. 
In August, the Healey administration awarded a $32 million infrastructure grant to Weymouth to cover costs of water, sewer, and roads at the base. The funding got rave reviews from locals, with Weymouth Council President Michael Molisse calling it a “major milestone.” 
Healey dubbed the proposed redevelopment “game-changing” in a press release 
O’Connor said the state grant will allow both the town and the base to get “ready for the potential expansion of the MWRA.” But he stressed that more action will be needed down the line. 
“At some point in this development, it will stall if the MWRA is not brought in there, because there is no other permanent water source,” O’Connor said. “We’ve explored almost every single option, and really, there’s nothing outside of MWRA that would be feasible at that site.”",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/weymouthtower-scaled.jpg?fit=1024%2C705&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-11-21 10:58:25.743795
,Connecticut Mirror,2025-11-21 15:51:35+00:00,CT Mirror,What to know about Trump’s draft proposal to curtail state AI regulations,Associated Press,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/11/21/trump-ai-regulation-executive-order/,"Trump and some Republicans say the limited regulations already enacted by states, and others that might follow, will hinder innovation.","President Donald Trump is considering pressuring states to stop regulating artificial intelligence in a draft executive order obtained Thursday by The Associated Press, as some in Congress also consider whether to temporarily block states from regulating AI.
Trump and some Republicans argue that the limited regulations already enacted by states, and others that might follow, will dampen innovation and growth for the technology.
Critics from both political parties — as well as civil liberties and consumer rights groups — worry that banning state regulation would amount to a favor for big AI companies who enjoy little to no oversight.
While the draft executive order could change, here’s what to know about states’ AI regulations and what Trump is proposing.
What state-level regulations exist and why
Four states — Colorado, California, Utah and Texas — have passed laws that set some rules for AI across the private sector, according to the International Association of Privacy Professionals.
Those laws include limiting the collection of certain personal information and requiring more transparency from companies.
The laws are in response to AI that already pervades everyday life. The technology helps make consequential decisions for Americans, including who gets a job interview, an apartment lease, a home loan and even certain medical care. But research has shown that it can make mistakes in those decisions, including by prioritizing a particular gender or race.
“It’s not a matter of AI makes mistakes and humans never do,” said Calli Schroeder, director of the AI & Human Rights Program at the public interest group EPIC.
“With a human, I can say, ‘Hey, explain, how did you come to that conclusion, what factors did you consider?’” she continued. “With an AI, I can’t ask any of that, and I can’t find that out. And frankly, half the time the programmers of the AI couldn’t answer that question.”
States’ more ambitious AI regulation proposals require private companies to provide transparency and assess the possible risks of discrimination from their AI programs.
Beyond those more sweeping rules, many states have regulated parts of AI: barring the use of deepfakes in elections and to create nonconsensual porn, for example, or putting rules in place around the government’s own use of AI.
What Trump and some Republicans want to do
The draft executive order would direct federal agencies to identify burdensome state AI regulations and pressure states to not enact them, including by withholding federal funding or challenging the state laws in court.
It would also begin a process to develop a lighter-touch regulatory framework for the whole country that would override state AI laws.
Trump’s argument is that the patchwork of regulations across 50 states impedes AI companies’ growth, and allows China to catch up to the U.S. in the AI race. The president has also said state regulations are producing “Woke AI.”
The draft executive order that was leaked could change and should not be taken as final, said a senior Trump administration official who requested anonymity to describe internal White House discussions.
The official said the tentative plan is for Trump to sign the order Friday.
Separately, House Republican leadership is already discussing a proposal to temporarily block states from regulating AI, the chamber’s majority leader, Steve Scalise, told Punchbowl News this week.
It’s yet unclear what that proposal would look like, or which AI regulations it would override.
TechNet, which advocates for tech companies including Google and Amazon, has previously argued that pausing state regulations would benefit smaller AI companies still getting on their feet and allow time for lawmakers develop a country-wide regulatory framework that “balances innovation with accountability.”
Why attempts at federal regulation have failed
Some Republicans in Congress have previously tried and failed to ban states from regulating AI.
Part of the challenge is that opposition is coming from their party’s own ranks.
Florida’s Republican governor, Ron DeSantis, said a federal law barring state regulation of AI was “Not acceptable” in a post on X this week.
DeSantis argued that the move would be a “subsidy to Big Tech” and would stop states from protecting against a list of things, including “predatory applications that target children” and “online censorship of political speech.”
A federal ban on states regulating AI is also unpopular, said Cody Venzke, senior policy council at the ACLU’s National Political Advocacy Department.
“The American people do not want AI to be discriminatory, to be unsafe, to be hallucinatory,” he said. “So I don’t think anyone is interested in winning the AI race if it means AI that is not trustworthy.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/AP25113797609746-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-21 10:58:25.743795

A Lombardo-Ford contest, in keeping with Nevada gubernatorial campaign tradition, promises precious little in the way of a policy debate. Instead, each campaign — again, keeping with tradition — can be expected to spend most of their campaign war chests puffing up micro-scandals (that by the way have nothing to do with lowering the cost of anything) so as to cast the other as History’s Greatest Monster, a stinky poophead, etc. 
And neither have begun spending much money doing that yet.
In other words, early days.
But one noteworthy result in the survey finds Lombardo ever so slightly upside down — 34% approval, 36% disapproval, and 30% in the “neutral or no opinion” camp.
On the one hand, roughly a third of those surveyed neither approving nor disapproving of the governor sort of makes sense, because neither Lombardo’s achievements (given more time and application I’m sure I could think of one) nor his blunders (like the recent epic floperoo of a special legislative session ha ha) have attracted the attention of casual voters.
On the other hand — but relatedly — barring salacious scandals or inescapable crises like a pandemic, for most people, governors are rather out of sight and out of mind. Governors tend to enjoy positive approval ratings nationwide if for no other reason than when when asked if they approve of their governor, many polling respondents say yes, even though what they might really mean is “Governor? Yeah, I guess there should probably be one.”
So if the poll’s accurate and more Nevada voters disapprove of Lombardo than approve of him, it probably doesn’t reflect the considered judgment of a citizenry who have been carefully tracking Lombardo’s performance and know his chief accomplishment as governor is not actually accomplishing anything, but setting veto records. 
Rather, Lombardo’s disapproval rating could just signify the default sentiment of owly contemporary voters toward elected officials: they all suck.
It could also reflect that Lombardo has an “R” after his name, which means his neck is adorned with an albatross by the name of Trump; 39% of Nevada voters surveyed approve of Trump, 54% don’t.
As attorney general, Ford’s public profile is even more obscure than Lombardo’s. That’s why it’s quite unfortunate the Emerson poll did not also pit Lombardo against Alexis Hill, the Washoe County Commission chair who is challenging Ford in the Democratic primary. 
Yes, Hill’s profile is even lower than Ford’s. But it wouldn’t be surprising if she, or virtually any lightly known Democrat, performed as well in a poll a year out from the election as Ford does. Lombardo vs. virtually anyone not named Lombardo might also be a dead heat right now.
Emerson is also assuming Ford is the likely Democratic nominee. True, almost immediately after announcing his candidacy, Ford was endorsed by all five Democrats in Nevada’s congressional delegation and nearly every Democrat in the state Legislature. 
At the time it seemed one point of the mass endorsements was to yell “don’t even think about it” at former Democratic Gov. Steve Sisolak, who had been publicly mulling a candidacy. 
The endorsements also seemed to assume that other than Sisolak, no other viable Democratic candidate for governor was on the horizon.
That assumption, like the one Emerson evidently made when excluding Hill from its poll, might turn out to be right.
It also might prove to be premature.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/governor-office-sign-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-21 10:58:25.743795

As plans and announcements for new AI data centers proliferate across Michigan, a Howell Township trustee is telling people that the parent company for Facebook and Instagram is behind another project planned on more than 1,000 acres of agricultural land.
Bob Wilson, a member of the Howell Township Board of Trustees, confirmed with Michigan Advance on Thursday that Meta was pushing the project. But Wilson said he and members of the board have known about the development for months now. 
Messages seeking comment from Meta’s public affairs and press office were not returned at the time of publication.
In September, Wilson took to Facebook, ironically, to say that he was one of several people in the Howell area who took a bus to New Albany, Ohio, to tour the community, which has become a hotspot for data centers, the Livingston Post reported. 
Meta has a data center in New Albany, Ohio.
Wilson said then that he believed a Meta data center could possibly land at the facility when completed with a $9 billion investment. It was his estimation that the center, if approved, would take up at least 20% of the 1,000-acre space with the remaining space for the data center.
On Wednesday, the Livingston County Planning Commission heard from locals about a decision to rezone the farm land to build the data center. The commission ultimately rejected the project and recommended that the Howell Township Board of Trustees reject the project, as well.
The board met Thursday evening to discuss the project and unanimously voted in favor of a six-month moratorium on data center applications. However, members of the group Stop the Data Centers Livingston County say that the moratorium as passed does not apply to the current developer and that a December 8 meeting of the Howell Township board will decide that project.
Local governments should serve residents, not corporations. Data centers do the opposite.

“The public overwhelmingly asked for a moratorium on rezoning applications to pause the current data center proposal. Instead, the attorney drafted a moratorium that only applies to site plan applications, a completely different stage in the process,” Breanne Green, one of the group’s leaders, told the Advance. “Because of that narrow definition, the moratorium does not apply to the developer’s rezoning request. The developer is still allowed to move forward, and the Township Board can still approve the rezoning next month. This means the most consequential decision — whether to rezone hundreds of acres for a hyperscale data center — is not paused.”
Green noted that Trustee Tim Boal made a motion to expand the moratorium to include rezoning approvals, which she says would have aligned with the community’s request. However, Green said no one seconded his motion and it died without discussion.
“Technically, if the rezoning is approved, later steps such as site plans would be on hold under the moratorium — but the critical gateway decision remains fully open. In practice, residents asked for a hard pause across the board, and the board delivered the opposite. There is also concern that if the Township later amends its ordinances to require data centers to be located in Industrial zoning (as many communities do), developers could pursue legal action if they’ve already secured rezoning under the current rules. In short: the moratorium does not pause the current project. It only delays later stages, not the rezoning decision the public is most concerned about,” Green said.
MLive also reported Thursday that Wilson confirmed Meta was behind the project. Wilson further told MLive that he met with a Meta “land crew” both in person and over a Zoom call, and that they didn’t hide the ball that they worked for Meta.

In an interview with the Advance, Wilson said that it was possible the developer on the project would build the center and then sell it to a third-party, like Meta or others exploring AI, much like Google. He did say, however, that it was his understanding that Meta builds its own projects and doesn’t usually play the middle man.

The incident happened when Mark Avent of Escondido, Calif.,  was helping build out the cultivation and manufacturing facility at 5401 Bulwer Ave. in St. Louis, which is owned by Blue Arrow Missouri LLC. 
Blue Arrow hired Avent in 2022 through a one-year, $100,000 contract to procure the necessary equipment to grow and manufacture marijuana products and train employees on the machines. 
During that time, a lab technician accidentally mishandled a commercial vacuum which was used to clean the lab equipment. The vacuum blew fine marijuana dust particles into the air, and Avent suffered a severe asthma attack that led to a heart attack.
The jury unanimously found that Blue Arrow was at fault for 85% of Avent’s injuries, and Avent carried 15% of the fault. 
“We’re very pleased with the verdict,” said William Meehan, Avent’s attorney. “We think that the jury was very perceptive and that they realized my client had life-threatening, life-altering injuries and that he’s never going to be the same.” 
Blue Arrow’s attorneys had argued that Avent was partially responsible because he wasn’t wearing a mask even though he knew he had issues with asthma.
“Mr. Avent was a highly intelligent, highly skilled individual who knew how to set up new labs,” said David Simmons, Blue Arrow’s attorney, in his closing argument Thursday. “And he also knew how to protect himself.”
During the trial, one cannabis expert said the only mask that could have protected Avent from the amount of fine dust particles blown into the air that day was an industrial face respirator, not a surgical mask. 
Lisa Avent, Mark’s wife, said the jury may have missed the significance in the difference in types of masks necessary to prevent such a medical emergency.
The jury awarded $2.5 million in damages to Mark Avent and $500,000 to Lisa Avent for distress. 
In their closing arguments, Meehan had suggested the jury award $5 million to the couple, and Simmons suggested the awarded amount be $325,000.
“We’re not happy with the 15%, but I could live with it,” Meehan said. “The number is big enough, so we’re happy. And now it’s a matter of getting this company to pay.”
A separate lawsuit is ongoing to determine which of the company’s three insurance plans may need to cover Avent’s claim. 
Blue Arrow’s attorneys declined to comment on the verdict, or whether or not the company will appeal the decision. 
In the meantime, Meehan said his clients will begin a “multi-front collection effort,” to get the claim from insurance companies and possibly garnish the company’s accounts. 
John Wilbers, founder and chairman of Blue Arrow, was not present at the verdict because he was attending his mother’s funeral. Wilbers, a personal injury attorney in St. Louis, started Blue Arrow with his mother, Kathy, who was the majority owner of the two cultivation, one manufacturing and one dispensary licenses the state awarded them in 2019, according records obtained from the Missouri Division of Cannabis Regulation.
Wilbers told The Independent Tuesday said he intends to take care of Avent. 
“If somebody’s injured, we’re going to help them,” he said.
After the lab accident, Avent was taken to the emergency room and lost consciousness in the ambulance. Doctors inserted a stent in his heart to save him, Meehan said, and he still hasn’t fully recovered four years later. 
On top of his ongoing medical bills, Meehan said Avent has lost at least $130,000 a year in income because he can no longer work in the marijuana industry.
Mark and Lisa Avent said after the four-day trial that they were exhausted but relieved. They initially filed the lawsuit nearly three years ago.
“We’re just glad it’s over,” he said.",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Avents-scaled-e1763735962357-1024x698.jpg,,,2025-11-21 10:58:25.743795

SPP applied for federal permission to fast-track applications to add power to the grid, saying it is necessary to maintain grid stability. (Submitted: Southwest Power Pool)TOPEKA — An environmental organization is challenging a federal decision that allows the Southwest Power Pool to fast-track applications to bring new utility generation online.
In May, the Southwest Power Pool announced it had applied to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, or FERC, for permission to implement an Expedited Resource Adequacy Study, or ERAS, process, the organization said in a news release.
SPP is a regional transmission organization that covers 14 states, including Kansas, and is one of seven approved by FERC as nonprofit member agencies that oversee transmission infrastructure, ensure utility system reliability and manage the wholesale electricity market.
“SPP developed ERAS in collaboration with its stakeholders and in response to an imminent and growing need to bring new generating resources online before the region’s generating capacity is outpaced by its electricity needs,” the news release said.
The ERAS process allows its members to nominate qualified generation projects for fast-track review, which could mean SPP will grant generator interconnection agreements to ERAS participants by March 2026, a news release said.
In July, FERC approved the ERAS process.
The Sierra Club, a national environmental organization, filed a lawsuit last week to stop ERAS. In a news release, the organization cited concerns about fast-tracking “the interconnection of mostly fossil-fueled generation to the power grid.”
Sierra Club also filed a lawsuit against a similar plan that FERC approved for the Midcontinent Interconnection System Operator.
“The lawsuit challenges FERC’s approval of the Expedited Resource Adequacy Study (ERAS) process, which allows the fast-tracked projects to pass significant upgrade costs to residential customers, and to skip over and also pass significant upgrade costs to clean energy projects that have been waiting for years to connect to the grid,” Sierra Club said in a news release.
SPP officials are reviewing the Sierra Club’s filing, said spokesman Seth Blomeley.
“We remain confident in the merits of our plan, which was approved by FERC,” he said.
SPP’s senior vice president of engineering, Casey Cathey, said recently that energy needs within the SPP’s region are expected to nearly double in the next decade.
The Sierra Club doesn’t believe the expedited process is needed, the organization’s news release said.
“In fact, SPP has suggested in other regulatory contexts that its other reforms to the standard interconnection queue will address any resource shortfalls for the grid it manages,” the organization said.
Sierra Club also pointed to Duke University research that shows new demands for electricity, such as from data enters, can be managed through load flexibility.
“FERC’s approval of SPP … line-cutting proposals will only add to the disruption that has prevented hundreds of gigawatts of clean energy from coming online to serve projected resource needs,” said Greg Wannier, Sierra Club senior attorney. “The result will be higher monthly bills for tens of millions of people by locking in new gas-burning power plants ahead of cheaper, shovel-ready clean energy projects. If FERC will not enforce its own fair market rules, the courts must do it for them.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/SPP-Corporate-Office-3-1024x581.png,,,2025-11-21 10:58:25.743795

(Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)Federal authorities say they arrested 14 people suspected of being in the country illegally during the raid on paper distributor Bro-Tex in St. Paul earlier this week.
The Department of Homeland Security, in a statement on Thursday, said those arrested include an individual with past domestic abuse charges and a person suspected of illegally reentering the country, a felony. The statement did not provide more information about those arrested.
“Worksite enforcement remains a cornerstone of our efforts to protect public safety, national security, and economic stability while rescuing individuals who may be victims of labor trafficking or exploitation,” an unnamed spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security said in a statement sent to the media Thursday evening.
News of a raid in St. Paul quickly circulated online, drawing a large crowd of protesters who attempted to interrupt the operation by blocking the vehicles of masked agents from the Drug Enforcement Administration, Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s Homeland Security Investigations and the FBI. Agents used chemical irritants and physical force to remove the protesters.
The action drew condemnation from local elected officials and immigrant advocacy organizations.
“This raid did not make Minnesota safer. This raid did not protect workers. This raid tore 14 people away from their families and destabilized an entire neighborhood,” the Immigrant Defense Network, a coalition of immigrant, labor, faith and community organizations, said in a statement.
At least three of the workers have been publicly identified by their families.
Erik Godinez Alarcon told Sahan Journal that his uncle, Camilo Morales Sanchez, and cousin, Jamie Solano Godinez, were detained while working at Bro-Tex.
In an online fundraiser, Karla Alarcon Hernandez said her father, Carlos Alberto Alarcón Avila, had also been detailed. She said he has lived in the St. Paul area for many years.

Mike Rogers, now a Republican candidate for U.S. Senate, called for President Donald Trump to accept a peaceful transition of power and condemned election denialism by Trump and his allies. 
“The president and some in his party are refusing to accept the outcome of the election, instead sowing doubt and conspiracy,” Rogers wrote in a Washington Post op-ed one day prior to the Jan. 6, 2021 attack on the U.S. Capitol Building. “This was an election that multiple independent observers, the courts and both parties have found to be free and fair. To imply otherwise is self-serving and stokes further discord in our country.”
“President Donald Trump’s attempts to influence the electoral processes in Michigan, and elsewhere, is cause for both concern and alarm, and should be roundly rejected by both Democrats and Republicans alike,” he wrote in a Detroit News op-ed about a month earlier urging Michigan officials to certify the results. “It is well past time that the president accepts that he lost and begin the peaceful and orderly transition of power to President-elect Joe Biden.”
Now, Rogers, endorsed by Trump in his second Senate election in two cycles, is espousing his own election denial about his 2024 Senate bid — saying in October, without offering evidence, that a van of ballots was delivered to a polling place in Detroit. He embraced similar rhetoric during the 2024 campaign as well.
Rogers says he didn’t violate voter registration law he helped to pass 

As he heads into 2026, Rogers is surrounding himself with a campaign full of those who also repeatedly questioned the results of the 2020 election. 
Meshawn Maddock and Kenneth Thompson, for example, were both granted federal pardons by President Trump earlier this month for their alleged role in the “false electors” scheme that sought to cast Michigan’s electoral votes in 2020 for Trump, despite the state voting for former President Joe Biden. 
Both Maddock and Thompson are now county co-chairs on the Rogers campaign, in Oakland County and Ionia County, respectively.

“Mike Rogers has either lost every last photon of sanity,” wrote Jeff Timmer, a former executive director of the Michigan Republican Party and the Chief Operating Officer of the Lincoln Project, “or he’s a lying pr**k who is cynically exploiting mushy MAGA minds in his desperation and thirst to be liked by them rather than normal American Michiganders.”
Rogers’ campaign did not respond to a request for comment from the Advance.
Rogers’ switch up demonstrates a greater trend in Republican politics — that it is increasingly hard to be a GOP candidate with a national or statewide profile without taking part in some level of election denial.

In 2022, for example, PBS tracking showed that of GOP gubernatorial candidates, 28 flat-out denied or fueled denial of the 2020 election compared to just eight who defended the results, and in secretary of state races, 19 Republicans denied or doubted the results while seven upheld Biden’s victory. Both GOP candidates in Michigan, Tudor Dixon and Kristina Karamo, respectively, fell in the category of expressly denying the results. 
“Something we’re seeing nationally as well as in Michigan, is general mis- and disinformation that really undermines public trust,” said Alexa Solis, a Senior Communications Manager for All Voting is Local. 
Maddock and Thompson are not the only election deniers on Rogers’ team. Nearly a dozen of the other county co-chairs named by Rogers in June had made statements online promoting conspiracy theories on the presidential election or the Jan. 6 riots. Norm Shinkle, one of the co-chairs in Ingham County, was the sole member of the State Board of Canvassers who refused to certify the 2020 elections, even as the other Republican on the board certified them. 
“Looking ahead into 2026 there are definitely risks of election sabotage,” Daniel Rivera, Michigan senior campaign manager for All Voting Is Local, said. “Especially since these pardons happened and these folks are back out in the community, I would say it could serve as a blueprint to undermine and challenge election results, but we’re ready to fight back for those future attempts.”
Rivera works to ensure public trust and confidence in elections, emphasizing that election officials, regardless of party, are largely committed to ensuring that elections run smoothly and are free and fair. 
“What we see as another challenge, are these partisan attempts to overturn the will of the American people,” he said.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Facetune_04-10-2024-08-19-56-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-11-21 09:57:54.237209

(Screenshot)A confirmation hearing for President Donald Trump’s pick to fill a judicial vacancy in Alaska was largely uneventful on Wednesday.
Aaron Christian Peterson was nominated by Trump this month after getting support from U.S. Sen. Dan Sullivan, R-Alaska, and on Wednesday, the U.S. Senate’s judiciary committee held a hearing on Peterson’s nomination and two other prospective judges bound for other states.
Senators’ attention largely focused on the other two men — David Fowlkes for a judgeship in Arkansas, and Nicholas Ganjei for a seat in Texas — and senators frequently used their time in the hearing to discuss their own views, rather than seek information about the nominees.
“Here I am asking the questions and giving the answers — it’s like the bar exam, except I’m giving the answers,” said Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Missouri, at one point in the hearing.
Peterson, who lives in Eagle River, is a natural resources attorney for the state of Alaska and has extensive experience as a criminal prosecutor.
Speaking to the committee, he said he has “a deep familiarity with the laws that are specific to Alaska,” naming the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act as one example.
“I have a wide variety of experience in the arenas that are likely to come before the district court, and hopefully I’ll be able to preside over those matters if I’m fortunate enough to be confirmed,” he said.
Sen. Mazie Hirono, D-Hawaii, asked all three nominees if they had ever been accused of sexual harassment or made unwanted sexual advances toward someone. 
All three said no.
Alaska’s most recent pick for the U.S. District Court, former Judge Josh Kindred, was appointed during the first Trump administration but resigned and was disbarred after an investigation found had committed significant sexual misconduct while in office. 
Sen. Adam Schiff, D-California, asked all three nominees whether they believe Congress is prohibited from imposing a code of ethics on the U.S. Supreme Court.
Peterson, answering third, echoed his potential colleagues and said it would depend on the circumstances, but that he does have concerns about whether such a thing would violate the U.S. Constitution’s separation of powers doctrine.
Currently, the U.S. Supreme Court is closely aligned with President Trump, and members of the court have repeatedly accepted financial and physical gifts from people affected by issues before the court. 
Republicans generally oppose new ethics restrictions on the court; Democrats generally favor them. 
Hawley asked the judicial nominees whether they believe a district court judge has the ability to issue injunctions that can halt nationwide actions.
Many of the Trump administration’s programs, when challenged in court, have been at least temporarily halted by local injunctions, and Peterson said the issue is in flux, in part because of a new U.S. Supreme Court ruling.
Sullivan, who does not sit on the judicial committee, read a prepared statement introducing Peterson. 
“Aaron is a lifelong Alaskan. He knows and understands our great state and the federal laws that reflect on Alaska. I think he will be a great federal judge. I urge his nomination be sent to the Senate floor with positive votes from all the members of this committee,” Sullivan said.
Peterson was one of several people suggested to the president by a committee formed at Sullivan’s behest to consider nominees for two current vacancies on the federal bench in Alaska.
That committee deliberated in secret, and the list of applicants — and of proposed nominees — has never been revealed.
Murkowski used a more traditional process to propose nominees to the president, relying on advice from the Alaska Bar Association. Peterson’s name did not appear in that application process, and the Bar Association did not respond to a request for comment on Thursday.  
Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Nebraska and chair of the judiciary committee, said members of the committee will submit written questions to the nominees by Nov. 26.
After that, the committee is expected to vote on the nominees and send them to a vote of the full U.S. Senate for confirmation.

BRATTLEBORO — Brattleboro Memorial Hospital CEO Christopher Dougherty, on an unexplained leave of absence the past seven weeks, won’t be returning to his job.
“The parties agree that under the current circumstances it is best for Chris to depart and for the hospital to bring in new leadership,” the not-for-profit facility said in a written public statement Thursday night.
The 500-worker hospital, one of Brattleboro’s three largest employers, named Dougherty as its chief executive officer in spring 2022. In the past year, he faced an operating budget shortfall and related questions from state regulators before announcing Oct. 3 that he was taking leave.
Dougherty, who previously led Shriners for Children Medical Center in Pasadena, California, hasn’t commented publicly. In its statement, Brattleboro Memorial Hospital said, “Chris is proud of his accomplishments and grateful for the opportunity to have led the hospital.”
“BMH would like to thank Chris for his service over the past three-and-a-half years and wish him all the best in his future endeavors,” the statement said.
The 61-bed hospital will search for a new CEO, Chloe Learey, its acting board chair, said in a Facebook video. Until another leader is hired, doctors Elizabeth McLarney, an orthopaedic surgeon, and Tony Blofson, a primary care physician, will continue as acting co-CEOs.
Past and present administrators have blamed the hospital’s fiscal problems on everything from too many unpaid patient bills to their own staff’s rising health insurance costs. In response, they have launched a hiring freeze, let go of six administrators and hired two outside advisers — Ovation Healthcare, a national support organization, and David Sanville, a former chief financial officer at Windsor’s Mt. Ascutney Hospital.But regulators at the Green Mountain Care Board have questioned the accuracy of the budget numbers and ordered the hospital to revise them or risk becoming the first Vermont health care facility to receive state intervention under a new law.

The chain of California nursing homes owned by Shlomo Rechnitz has faced state scrutiny for years, including an unsuccessful effort by then-Attorney General Kamala Harris to stop him from acquiring more facilities. Now, a series of recent lawsuits has brought renewed attention to his companies. 
Elder care advocates say Rechnitz’ companies are Exhibit A in how regulators at the Department of Public Health fail some of California’s most vulnerable citizens.
Rechnitz’ companies have denied allegations in all of these cases, which include several that are scheduled to go to trial next year and two in 2024 that resulted in multimillion-dollar judgments against the companies. 

Mark Johnson, an attorney for the facilities and their holding company, Brius: “It is accurate that nursing homes are the target of abusive lawsuits that accomplish nothing but depleting resources for patient care.”

Wendy York, a Sacramento attorney specializing in nursing home abuse, said that watching elderly and disabled residents repeatedly suffer the same types of injuries in these facilities “feels like a broken record. It feels like Groundhog Day.”
In 2021, a CalMatters investigation found that the state Department of Public Health allowed Rechnitz and his companies to operate 18 nursing homes while delaying a decision on granting licenses to them. The state had kept the license applications in a “pending” status after he acquired them. Rechnitz and his companies were allowed to continue operating five additional homes even after the state denied licenses for those facilities.
Gov. Gavin Newsom signed a law meant to address the issue, but state regulators in 2023 granted Rechnitz’ companies the licenses to operate the homes just before the measure took effect.
Now, some of those facilities are the subject of patient lawsuits, including one that resulted in a $2.3 million judgment against Country Villa Wilshire.

CA law seeks to preserve civil rights in K-12 schools

A new California law aims to expand civil rights protections in K-12 schools while the federal administration under President Donald Trump moves to shut down the U.S. Department of Education and its Office of Civil Rights, reports CalMatters’ Carolyn Jones.
In October California lawmakers passed a measure to create an Office of Civil Rights within the California Department of Education. The office includes an antisemitism coordinator, who will investigate complaints and train school districts on how to prevent antisemitism. The office is also required to submit to the Legislature an annual discrimination report, which would include information such as the number of complaints.
Before Trump’s return to the White House, most K-12 anti-discrimination enforcement fell on the federal government’s Office of Civil Rights. But in March the Trump administration began laying off nearly half the staff at the federal education department, closing numerous branches of the Office of Civil Rights, including the one in California. On Tuesday the administration also unveiled a plan to spin off the education department’s key areas of oversight to other federal departments.

Lieutenant governor votes against UC tuition hike

The University of California Board of Regents voted Wednesday to continue its annual tuition hikes, despite pushback from some regents and undergraduate students, writes CalMatters’ Mikhail Zinshteyn.
The tuition model allows the public university system to increase undergraduate tuition and systemwide fees by as much as 5% annually. But what undergraduates pay for tuition once they enroll doesn’t change, since their rate would be locked in that year for up to six years upon enrollment. Graduate students, who are not on the same tuition model, would continue to see annual tuition increases. 
The regents voted 13 to 3 to approve the plan, which begins in 2026-27. UC officials say the plan ensures the system can collect more revenue as the costs of educating students increase. 
Lt. Gov. Eleni Kounalakis, one of the regents who voted against the move, said the decision to increase tuition continually should be reviewed at least annually, not left alone for years at a time. Undergraduates also denounced the plan. About half of in-state undergraduate students at UC live in households with incomes below $120,000.

Diego Emilio Bollo, president of the undergraduate student association at UCLA: “The students are not the UC’s backup budget plan.”

,Mississippi Today,2025-11-21 14:00:00+00:00,Mississippi Today,"Regulators say Jackson’s notorious Rebelwood is habitable despite mold, leaks, faulty electricity – and lots of bullet holes",Molly Minta,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/11/21/rebelwood-living-conditions/,Bullet holes represent just a sliver of the grim housing conditions plaguing some of the more than 400 residents of this federally subsidized complex.,"Bullets came flying through the walls of teenager Kamia Feazell’s south Jackson apartment shortly after she moved there with her mother.
The ninth grader was standing in her bedroom in their second-floor unit early one morning when a bullet whizzed past her neck and through a wooden door, sending splinters into her face.  
She screamed and dropped to the floor, thinking she’d been shot. 
“Those bullets came right through my bedroom walls and ricocheted throughout the place,” said Latisha Feazell, a resident of Pine Ridge Gardens Apartments, better known as Rebelwood, in south Jackson, Tuesday, Oct. 15, 2025. Credit: Vickie D. King/Mississippi Today
At first, she had trouble sleeping after the incident. But Feazell has since adjusted to routine gunfire at Pine Ridge Gardens, better known as Rebelwood – one of the most troubled apartment complexes in Jackson.
“I’m not scared anymore,” said Feazell, who recently graduated high school. “I hear a shot, ‘Oh they’re shooting in the back.’ That’s it.”
But she does wish management would patch the other bullet holes in their walls: in the kitchen cabinet next to where they keep cereal boxes, a foot away from their living room window, beside the front door. 
These scars represent just a sliver of the grim housing conditions plaguing some of the more than 400 residents of this federally subsidized complex. Mold and mildew. Electrical problems. Broken windows. Rusty appliances. Water leaks. 
These hazards are not a secret. City, state and federal officials who oversee Rebelwood know the complex is plagued. They’ve documented the issues in police reports and physical inspection forms.

But their oversight has so far failed to result in lasting improvements to the perennially troubled complex – a result, experts say, of low inspection standards and weak enforcement. 
The deficiencies persist even as regulators have required Rebelwood’s owners to make repairs. 
In 2023, Rebelwood passed its most recent routine inspection by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development with a score of 78 out of 100. HUD records show the inspection identified life-threatening issues with the complex, but a spokesperson for the agency would not provide information about the violation. 
“Does it look like a 78?” said Bridgett Simmons, an attorney with the National Housing Law Project.
“These cabinets were just like this when I moved in here,” said Pine Ridge Gardens resident Stephanie Taylor, Tuesday, Oct. 14, 2025. “I keep asking and nothing gets done.” The complex is better known as Rebelwood. Credit: Vickie D. King/Mississippi Today
The complex is also overseen by the Mississippi Home Corporation, a state housing finance authority that awarded affordable housing tax credits to a previous owner of the complex. During Rebelwood’s last routine inspection in 2018, the agency gave the complex three tries and six months to correct the issues, such as a burned floor, broken window panes and roaches. 
Based on the authority’s inspection cycle, Rebelwood should have been reinspected by now. But Scott Spivey, the Mississippi Home Corporation president, said work pauses during the COVID-19 pandemic created a backlog. Two days after Mississippi Today submitted a public records request for inspection and audits, Mississippi Home Corporation scheduled an inspection for later this month. 
Even if the inspection finds problems at Rebelwood, Spivey said his agency lacks the ability to take stronger action for older complexes like Rebelwood because the greatest enforcement capability it has is to ban them from seeking future tax credits – something owners may have no intention of pursuing, anyway.
“Our tools for enforcement, our arsenal, is vastly compromised,” Spivey said.
Jackson is far from the only city to struggle with upkeeping its affordable housing stock. But Simmons said that is no excuse when “people, in particular the tenants at this property, are being harmed.” 
Mayor John Horhn created a housing task force in July, soon after he took office. His action was spurred in part by water shutoffs at complexes where landlords had failed to pay their water bills. 
“No landlord should put a family in harm’s way,” Horhn declared during his State of the City address in October.

This is how he ‘fixed’ it and this is how it’s been,” Sawyer said. The complex is better known as Rebelwood. Credit: Vickie D. King/Mississippi Today


Jennifer Welch, a rental property owner who chairs the task force, said the city intends for its rental registry, created by ordinance in 2022, to help ameliorate some of these problems by using it to track landlords throughout Jackson. The city does not have any active code enforcement cases against Rebelwood, according to a public records request. 
But while the city works to get the registry going, conditions at Rebelwood continue to deteriorate. 
Last year, its previous owner, a New Jersey-based affordable housing behemoth called the Michaels Organization, sold the complex along with 10 others in Mississippi to another New Jersey company. The buyer and current owner, Treetop Companies, did not respond to repeated requests for comment. 
“People just talk about it and keep talking about it and nothing has happened,” Tonia Cowart, a housing navigator with Stewpot Community Services, said about the dire problems at apartment complexes in Jackson. “It kills hope. It makes you feel like well, ain’t nothing ever gonna change.”

Continued violations
Rebelwood is a collection of brick-and-tan buildings tucked off Terry Road, down a hilly, wooded driveway. On the sunny October day that Cowart visited the complex, no security could be seen. The gate was open, plywood covered several unit windows, and a gray door to the front office was locked. Dogs slept under trees, so still they seemed dead.
It felt as if Rebelwood had no landlord at all. 
As Cowart walked to a courtyard near the front of the complex, looking for tenants to talk to, a tall, sinewy man named Calvin Williams emerged from his apartment and insisted on sharing his story. 
A 63-year-old painter and maintenance worker, Williams said he’s been surrounded by squalor since he moved to Rebelwood two and a half years ago. The outlets in his bedroom don’t work, so he’s had to squish his belongings into his living room and use a MacFyvered system of electrical cords to power his heart monitor. 
In recent weeks, he’s been distracted by a more pressing issue: hot water falling from the light in his kitchen ceiling. 
“It’s hot as hell because it dropped on my shoulder and burned it,” Williams told Cowart. 
Cowart has helped tenants secure units at Rebelwood and hears about problems like this regularly. But her ability to take action as a navigator is often limited to what she can see: Before she places a client in an apartment complex, she will undertake her own inspection to ensure the unit is up to code. 
Rebelwood’s regulators are supposed to catch a fuller picture.

During Mississippi Home Corporation’s 2018 routine inspection, records show the agency examined 22 out of 160 units, flagging issues at 15. In the unit that would eventually become Williams’, the inspection found that a smoke alarm was “chirping.” 
Mississippi Home Corporation deemed the complex out of compliance, Spivey said. It would take three more inspections before the agency recorded that Michaels had made all the repairs.
Each time the housing agency followed up at Rebelwood and found it noncompliant, though, invoices show they levied a fine against Michaels.
That fine – the agency’s standard fee for noncompliance – was $110. The maximum fine for failing to file annual paperwork on time? $3,000.
By mid-2022, Michaels had racked up $3,330 in fines and begun trying to sell Rebelwood.
That same year, HUD flagged the company for defaulting on the terms of the contract that allows it to draw down federal funding for Rebelwood, according to a lawsuit filed in Hinds County last year. 
“Default means something serious is happening and now you are subject to the enforcement mechanisms,” Simmons said. 
HUD did not answer questions from Mississippi Today about why the company defaulted. But the plaintiff, another out-of-state investment company that was seeking to buy Rebelwood from Michaels, alleged the complex suffered from widespread issues, including fire damage to multiple units, a lack of carbon monoxide detectors and “major housekeeping and infestation problems.”
Within six months, HUD had deemed the property back in compliance, the lawsuit says. The complex would pass its HUD inspection the following year. 
But its new owner, Treetop, is repeating some mistakes of past owners. While Rebelwood is currently in good standing with Mississippi Home Corporation over its physical condition, it is out of compliance after failing to submit its 2025 annual report on time.

Paralyzed by distrust 
Williams has tried his best to make his apartment home, decorating it with posters and a Dallas Cowboys-themed pendant light. But he can’t hide the smell: His unit reeked of mold and bleach, and his kitchen floor was slick with water. Cowart asked if she could get closer to take a video of the ceiling leak.
“It just ain’t no light up in there,” he said. 
When regulators can’t improve a property, Cowart said tenants need to stand up for themselves. It’s a lesson she learned from her mom when they lived at Rebelwood in the 1990s, their first apartment in Jackson. 
“We had to go hard,” she said. “It’s like, you’re being bullied and you finally have to say, ‘OK, what you gonna do?’”

But the violence at Rebelwood makes it hard for people to trust each, let alone work together. News articles regularly feature the complex for shootings and killings. A social media creator dedicated an entire Facebook page to videos of fights there.
Williams says he trusts his dog, Peanut Butter, more than any human at the complex. Earlier this year, he said he was sitting on his bed when a man walked past his window, a bag of meat in hand, calling out to see if anyone would help him cook it. Williams said he looked at his red charcoal grill and decided to help. 
“By the time I got the cornbread out, I heard the gunshots,” he said. The man with the meat had been gunned down.
“There’s mold been growing in here all over the place. And the toilet isn’t halfway attached to the floor anymore. I’ve asked to get this stuff taken care of and it’s still not taken care of,” said Latisha Feazell, Tuesday, Oct. 14, 2025. The apartment complex is better known as Rebelwood. Credit: Vickie D. King/Mississippi Today
Mississippi Today interviewed the homicide victim’s mother, Henrietta Cooper-Middleton, who said the complex should be shut down.
“I had told him that he needed to be careful about going over there, because I had heard it was dangerous and people were getting killed,” she said. 
Multiple tenants told Mississippi Today that they are withholding rent because the landlord has not made repairs to their units. But this step, a common tool for tenants, lacks force so long as Rebelwood continues to draw down federal funds. The average rent a tenant pays at Rebelwood is just $145, while HUD pays $1,010 per filled unit, according to data from the agency. 
Residents also may not know who to complain to: While some residents across the state take initiative to identify that Mississippi Home Corporation has some oversight and submit complaints, the agency hasn’t recorded any recent complaints from Rebelwood. 
When it feels no one is looking out for them, Cowart said some residents find their time is better spent trying to leave. 
Feazell’s brother, 20-year-old Keymone Feazell, says he goes to work at a steel fabricator and comes home and tries not to talk to anyone. The family, which is from Jackson, moved to Rebelwood after a stint in Texas, they said, because it was the only affordable unit they could find.
“We don’t belong out here,” he said. 
Often perplexed by what they witness at the complex, the siblings are biding their time until work or school takes them elsewhere. Their mom, Latisha Feazell, is on a waiting list for another affordable housing complex, but it’s in Vicksburg, and she doesn’t want to move there. 
Keymone plans to become a truck driver. He wants to get paid to see the country – and to get as far away from Rebelwood as he can.

,California,2025-11-21 13:30:00+00:00,CalMatters,A spate of new studies gives the lowdown on California’s sky-high living costs,Dan Walters,,,,,https://calmatters.org/commentary/2025/11/california-high-living-costs-studies/,How costly is it to live California? Let us count the ways with new studies comparing everything from mortgage payments to a gallon of gas.,"We Californians know, or should know, that while living in this state has many positive aspects, we are paying through the nose for the experience.
A flurry of recent studies drives home how deeply California residents must dig to meet costs of living that are either at or near the highest of any state.
One comes from the Legislative Analyst’s Office, the Legislature’s advisor on the state budget, delving into the astronomic costs of buying a home.
The LAO study found  “California home prices far exceed the rest of the country.” Mid-tier homes, those roughly in the middle of the price range, are more than twice as expensive as the typical mid-tier home elsewhere in the U.S. Monthly payments for such homes run about $5,500 in California, 74% more than what they were 25 years ago.
The study also found that the annual household income needed to qualify for a mortgage on a mid-tier California home in September  was about $221,000 — more than two times the median California household income in 2024, which was $102,000. 
For a bottom-tier home, about $136,000 in annual income is needed to qualify for a mortgage — about 33% higher than median household income was in 2024.
The data illustrate why California has the second lowest rate of home ownership in the nation. Just 55.3% of Californians live in homes they or their families own, slightly higher than New York’s ownership rate.
It’s not surprising that hundreds of thousands of California residents, unable to aspire to home ownership, have decamped for more affordable states, such as Texas, where home prices are a fraction of California’s.
Those who do migrate to other states find not only are houses much less expensive but fuel for their cars and utilities to light, heat and cool their homes are markedly less expensive.
The Center for Jobs & the Economy, an offshoot of the California Business Roundtable, continuously monitors energy costs in California and other states. Its latest report says gasoline, averaging $4.64 a gallon in California, is as much as $1.50 a gallon higher than in Texas and other states. California’s electrical power rates are roughly twice as high.
Another take on California living costs comes from the Transparency Foundation, a conservative economic think tank.
It gathered a wide variety of factors and calculated living costs for an upper-middle class California family with a $130,000 annual income. It concluded the family would pay $29,753 more per year than the national average for housing, utilities, health care, taxes and other costs of living.
“This report should be a wake-up call to all Californians, that they are being unfairly punished by the bad policies imposed on them by their politicians — and they are literally paying the price for it,” Dave McCulloch, the foundation’s chairman, said in a statement about the report.
A new poll by the Public Policy Institute of California confirms that Californians worry about living costs. Nearly a third of those polled said they, or someone in their household, have reduced food purchases to save money.
The California Farm Bureau revealed this week that a traditional Thanksgiving dinner for 10 people next week will cost a California family $72.61, well above the national average of $55.18.
Finally, there’s a new report from WalletHub, a website devoted to personal finance,  implying that Californians are taking on more debt to pay their rising bills.
In this year’s third quarter — July through September — the average California household added  $880 in new debt, increasing the total owed to $259,773, second only to residents of Hawaii.
All together, Californians’ personal debt increased by $11.8 billion during the quarter. Now it’s nearly $3.2 trillion, just a bit lower than their $3.6 trillion in annual personal income. 
A truly staggering number.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/071223_San-Francisco_SN_CM_16.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-11-21 08:59:02.660949

It stems from a surge in antisemitic incidents in California following the Israeli attacks on Gaza in 2023.,"In summary
The new law aims to educate school staff and investigate discrimination complaints. It stems from a surge in antisemitic incidents in California following the Israeli attacks on Gaza in 2023.


At a time when the federal government is dismantling civil rights protections in K-12 schools, California is expanding them — although some wonder how far the state will go to combat discrimination in schools.
A new law, signed by Gov. Gavin Newsom last month, creates an Office of Civil Rights within the California Department of Education. The office will have a staff of at least six, including an antisemitism coordinator, who will educate school districts about the harms of bias and investigate discrimination complaints. 
“I think it’s a good idea and the state of California will pull it off. The risks are small and the possibility for good is large,” said Gary Orfield, co-director of the Civil Rights Project at UCLA. “But for it to be successful, it has to have real responsibility and real power.”
The new law stems from a surge in antisemitic incidents in California last year following the Oct. 7, 2023 attacks in Israel and the ensuing conflict in Gaza. Authored by Assemblyman Rick Zbur and Assemblywoman Dawn Addis, the law is intended to eliminate anti-Jewish and other bias in the classroom and ensure that students of all ethnicities and religions feel protected.
But the road to Newsom’s desk was not smooth. The bill faced tough opposition from the California Teachers Association, the state’s largest teachers union, which argued that the law would limit teachers’ right to free speech by curbing their ability to discuss the conflict in Gaza or other topical issues. The union declined to comment for this article.
Zbur, a Democrat from Los Angeles who was among the law’s authors, said the new Office of Civil Rights and the antisemitism coordinator are not intended to punish teachers. The idea, he said, is to help schools stamp out bullying, discrimination and other acts targeting specific groups of students. 
“The idea that this law is about policing is hogwash,” Zbur said. “It’s intended to be productive, to provide districts with resources so they can prevent students from being harmed in school.”
Federal layoffs and closures
Discrimination has long been illegal in California schools. Individuals who feel they’ve been discriminated against can file complaints with the state’s Civil Rights Department or with their local school district. But much K-12 anti-discrimination enforcement has fallen on the federal government’s Office of Civil Rights. Created in the mid-1960s, the office investigates complaints about a range of issues, such as school segregation, unfair discipline practices and whether students with disabilities or English learners are receiving the services they’re entitled to. 
In March, the Trump administration announced it was laying off nearly half of the U.S. Department of Education workforce and closing numerous branches of the Office of Civil Rights, including the one in California. That’s meant a steep decline in the number of cases and long delays for those the office investigates. In the three months after the Department of Education cuts, for example, the office received nearly 5,000 complaints but investigated only 309. 
On Tuesday, the Department of Education went even further, spinning off some of the agency’s largest responsibilities to other federal departments — including much of the administration of  elementary and high school funding. Project 2025, the Heritage Foundation’s conservative vision for the country that so far Trump has followed, calls for the Office of Civil Rights to become part of the Department of Justice and for it to “reject gender ideology and critical race theory.”
The U.S. Department of Education didn’t respond to a request for comment.
‘Cutting off funding, that’s what works’
California’s new Office of Civil Rights will have a director and several coordinators who will oversee anti-discrimination cases based on race and ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation and religion. The director and anti-discrimination coordinators will be appointed by the governor and confirmed by the Legislature, likely after Jan. 1.
The office will provide schools with materials about preventing discrimination, and work with districts that have been the subject of complaints from students, families or the public. In serious cases, the office will recommend more intensive assistance to the state Department of Education to correct problems. For districts that persistently flout anti-discrimination laws, “the department may use any means necessary to effect compliance,” according to laws already in place. That may include cutting funding for textbooks or other materials found to be discriminatory.
The office will also submit an annual report to the Legislature on the overall picture of discrimination in schools, including the number of complaints, how they were resolved, and their outcomes.
But to be successful, the office will have to be nonpartisan, transparent and fair, Orfield said. Cases against a school should include strong evidence, and schools should have the opportunity to defend themselves and appeal a verdict if they believe it was wrongly issued. 
And the office should not shy away from cutting funds to schools that don’t comply, he said. In the 1960s and ‘70s, the federal Office of Civil Rights cut funds to more than 100 schools in the South that refused to desegregate — a move that may have been the only way to force compliance, Orfield said.
“Cutting off funding, that’s what works,” he said. “Although if you’re going to have sanctions, there must be due process.”
Photo ops and reports?
Mark Rosenbaum, senior special counsel for strategic litigation for the public interest law firm Public Counsel, agreed that enforcement will be the key to whether the new office is effective.
“If the office just issues reports and does photo ops, we don’t need another one of those,” Rosenbaum said. “The issue is whether or not they can enforce these rights across the board.”
He’d also like to see the office take a more proactive approach instead of only responding to individuals’ complaints. Education itself, he said, is a civil right, and too many students are not receiving the high-quality lessons in safe, well-equipped schools that they’re entitled to. Rosenbaum’s firm recently sued the state over substandard school facilities.
Still, he’s happy to see the office get off the ground, particularly in light of the federal cuts to civil rights enforcement.
“There’s an urgency for California to fill a void,” Rosenbaum said. “It should have happened decades ago, but it’s a good start.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/021125-ICE-Schools-Salinas-LV_CM_30.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-11-21 08:59:02.660949

A New York Times investigation recently revealed that California Insurance Commissioner Ricardo Lara struck a secret deal with insurance companies, giving them regulatory favors while allowing them to dump tens of thousands of policyholders. 
It was a bombshell. But for those of us living through this crisis, it wasn’t news. 
As survivors of the Los Angeles fires, we’ve spent 10 months inside the collapse of California’s insurance system. In a survey of  insured L.A. fire survivors, 70%  report their recovery has been impeded by delays and denials. 
A system that should be a safety net has become a wrecking ball, destroying our finances, our health and the futures we’ve worked so hard to build for our kids. California’s recovery is being dragged down by the collapse of its insurance system and by one official’s failure to stop it. 
California has some of the nation’s strongest consumer protection laws. Insurance Commissioner Ricardo Lara simply hasn’t enforced them. Even after survivors submitted more than 400 reports of delays and denials, he approved a billion-dollar rate hike for State Farm in May while delaying scrutiny of its misconduct. 
There’s a name for this: regulatory capture. It’s when an official charged with regulating an industry ends up serving that industry instead. In California, that concept is embodied by Ricardo Lara. 
For nearly 10 months, we’ve called on Lara to fulfill the duties of his office. In August we gave him a clear roadmap outlining five urgent actions he could take immediately to end the illegal delays and denials. Among our recommendations: that he freeze insurers’ rate hikes until fire survivors are made whole, and that he require insurers to be transparent in their loss estimates.  
So far, he has failed to act. 
The situation is critical. More than 8 in 10 Los Angeles fire survivors remain displaced, and most will lose their housing coverage within months. Each day of inaction pushes more families into housing insecurity and despair. 
Two crises now define California’s insurance system: Families can no longer buy or renew coverage, and those who still have it often can’t access the benefits they’ve already paid for. 
Lara has failed on both fronts. 
As the New York Times reports, Lara’s secret 2023 deal let insurers dump tens of thousands of policyholders in exchange for future rate hikes — and insurers did, just months before the L.A. fires. Families were left scrambling for coverage or were pushed into the state’s high-cost, low-benefit FAIR Plan. 
The deal was sold as a way to keep people out of the FAIR Plan. Instead, enrollment has doubled. And for those who still have insurance, a different disaster begins the moment they try to use it. FAIR has been sued for denying smoke damage claims, and consumers have complained for months about customer service, payment delays and slow response times.

We know what happens when insurance fails. California’s five most destructive fires, between 2017 and 2020, destroyed 22,500 homes and, as of this year, only 38% have been rebuilt. The data is clear: when insurance pays promptly, communities recover. When it doesn’t, families are broken forever. 
That is where the Los Angeles recovery is headed. Progress has stalled because the system meant to protect us has become the obstacle. 
As insurance erodes, California’s housing market is starting to show strain. Without coverage, homeowners can’t buy, sell or refinance. Lenders are retreating, property values are falling and construction is stalling. 
What began as an insurance crisis is rapidly becoming a credit and housing crisis that threatens the stability of the entire state economy. 
Lara has failed to stop illegal insurer delays and denials, and he has encouraged the mass dumping of policyholders. Whether his failure stems from intent or incompetence is a matter for the investigations now examining his conduct. 
What matters urgently is that he leaves — now.  We call on Gov. Gavin Newsom and other state leaders to urge his resignation and appoint new leadership at the Department of Insurance.
 Californians deserve a functioning insurance system that protects us all.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/010824_Eaton-Fire_JH_CM_55.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-11-21 08:59:02.660949
,Connecticut Mirror,2025-11-21 13:30:00+00:00,CT Mirror,"Trump allows more foreign ag workers, eases off ICE raids on farms",Tim Henderson | Stateline,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/11/21/trump-allows-more-foreign-ag-workers-eases-off-ice-raids-on-farms/,"To ease labor shortages on farms and ranches, the administration made changes to the H-2A visa program, which allows foreign workers for temporary agricultural jobs.","In a tacit admission that U.S. food production requires foreign labor, the Trump administration is making it easier for farmers to employ guest workers from other countries.
At the same time, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in recent months appears to be refraining from conducting agricultural workplace raids, even as it scours Democratic-led cities for immigrants who are in the country illegally.
“We really haven’t seen agriculture targeted with worksite enforcement efforts, and early this year we did,” said Julia Gelatt, associate director of U.S. immigration policy at the Migration Policy Institute, a nonpartisan think tank.
The shifts come as many Americans are concerned about the rising cost of food, creating political problems for a president who campaigned on lowering them. Last week, the administration also announced it would lift tariffs on some foreign food products, including bananas, beef, coffee and tomatoes.
To ease labor shortages on farms and ranches, the administration last month made changes to the federal H-2A visa program, which allows employers to hire foreign workers for temporary agricultural jobs when there aren’t enough U.S.-born workers available. Under the new rule, the Department of Homeland Security will approve H-2A visas more quickly.
“Our immigration system has been broken for decades, and we finally have a President who is enforcing the law and prioritizing fixing programs farmers and ranchers rely on to produce the safest and most productive food supply in the world,” the U.S. Department of Agriculture said in an email to Stateline.
But the move to increase the supply of foreign agricultural workers conflicts with a July statement by Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins that “the promise to America, to ensure that we have a 100% American workforce, stands.”
Rollins also said the administration was committed to the mass deportation of immigrants who are here illegally, but that it would be “strategic so as not to compromise our food supply.” Ultimately, she said, the solution would be increased automation of agricultural jobs.
The government has issued about 420,000 H-2A visas for agricultural workers every year since 2023, which amounts to about half of the 812,000 agricultural worker jobs. They are concentrated in states that grow fruits and vegetables as opposed to grains, which are increasingly planted and harvested using machines. The government expects an additional 119,000 visas to be issued under the new rule.
Almost half the H-2A visas in the 2025 fiscal year were in Florida (60,000), Georgia (44,000), California (37,000), Washington state (36,000) and North Carolina (28,000).
Lower wages
The new H-2A rule also includes new hourly wage guidelines that vary by state but are lower than previous wages, and allows employers to charge workers for housing that used to be free. In North Carolina, for instance, the new rate is $11.09 for unskilled workers compared with $16.16 last year. In California, the rate is $13.45 for unskilled workers compared with $19.97 last year, though minimum wage laws in California and some other states would apply to those jobs, according to a Cornell University analysis.
In North Carolina, farmers are looking forward to lower labor costs, said Lee Wicker, deputy director of the North Carolina Growers Association, a trade association that brought 11,000 guest workers to the state through the H-2A guest worker program last year.
“If you think farmers are making more money in these conditions, you’re wrong. They’re going broke,” Wicker said. Workers will take a pay cut under new guidelines and will have to pay for housing, but that may help farmers stave off bankruptcy, he said.
“I’m not saying the workers are going to be happy about this, but I think they’ll come back. Wages have gone down before and they kept coming,” he added.
Jeffrey Dorfman, an agricultural and resource economics professor at North Carolina State University, said the changes will be a boon to the state’s farmers.
“The move to lower the H-2A wages by the Trump administration will be very well received by growers in North Carolina and will save farmers tens of millions of dollars statewide,” Dorfman said. “For many farmers, it will turn money-losing crops into money-making crops, if prices stay about where they are now.”
Unionized California farmworkers are opposed to the pay cuts and loss of free housing in the new guest worker visa plan, said Antonio De Loera-Brust, a spokesperson for the United Farm Workers, which represents about 10,000 workers in California.
The union sued the administration over ICE raids in the fields earlier this year, but recently “it’s been pretty quiet,” he said.
“For us it’s been really a one-two punch,” De Loera-Brust said. “First came the raids, which hurt workers, and now in order to appease business interests, they make all these concessions on wages and the guest workers program.”
Fewer raids
The administration quickly walked back a June directive to avoid raids on the agriculture and hospitality industries. Nevertheless, ICE raids on those employers have been more infrequent in the months since.
In June, ICE raided a dairy farm in New Mexico and a meatpacking plant in Nebraska. Since then, the agency has raided only a handful of food and agriculture employers, such as a July raid on a California marijuana grower and an Arizona restaurant chain, and a September raid to arrest Wisconsin dairy workers.
Earlier this month, ICE agents descended on an onion farm in Northern California, arresting four immigrants on charges of illegally selling farmworker visas.
Even as ICE ramps up its activity in North Carolina cities such as Charlotte and Raleigh, Wicker, of the growers trade group, said farms in the state have not been targeted.
Gelatt, of the Migration Policy Institute, said that’s been true of farms and ranches in many states since June.
“In past administrations we’ve seen a very quiet de-emphasis of immigration enforcement at farms. You don’t need to make an announcement. You don’t need to fight in the courts,” Gelatt said. “It is possible just to direct enforcement activities away from farms. It’ll be hard to know if that’s happened now, but I would not be surprised.”
While farmworkers in California are seeing some relief from raids, life is still uneasy for them, De Loera-Brust said.
“Overall, they have clearly slowed down [raids] in ag areas, but that’s not policy. They could resume at any time. People are living with uncertainty,” he said.

Corrections spending is still over budget,Cayla Mihalovich,,,,,https://calmatters.org/justice/2025/11/prisons-budget-overspending/,"California's $17.5 billion prison system is over budget, contributing to a projected state deficit. Some groups want him to close more prisons.","In summary
California’s $17.5 billion prison system is over budget, contributing to a projected state deficit. Some groups want him to close more prisons.


Some of the red ink in California’s budget deficit is coming from unplanned spending in state prisons, according to a new report from the Legislative Analyst’s Office.
The California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation is on track to exceed its budget by roughly $850 million over three years despite recent cuts that include four prison closures and some labor concessions that trimmed payroll expenses. The state budget included $17.5 billion for prisons this year.
The office attributed the corrections department’s shortfall to both preexisting and ongoing imbalances in its budget. The analyst’s annual fiscal outlook projected a nearly $18 billion deficit for the coming year, which follows spending cuts in the current budget.
The corrections department last year ran out of money to pay its bills. In May, it received a one-time allocation of $357 million from the general fund to cover needs including workers’ compensation, food for incarcerated people and overtime. 
Democratic Sen. Scott Wiener of San Francisco in a June 17 letter to the Department of Finance said he was “shocked and disappointed that (the corrections department) overspent its budget by such a significant amount” while the state faced a $12 billion general fund shortfall that resulted in cuts to key health care and social service programs. 
“These were dollars that could have been used to provide basic services to some of our most underserved communities,” wrote Wiener. “While this year’s budget included measures requiring departments to ‘tighten their belts’ and reduce state operating expenses by up to 7.95%, (the corrections department) did the opposite, and overspent by nearly three percent.”
Without having any new dedicated funding to align its actual costs with its budget, Wiener warned, deficits “will likely persist” and put additional pressure on the general fund in years to come.  
That’s despite Gov. Gavin Newsom’s attempts to save the state money through prison closures. Newsom in May moved to close the state prison in Norco in Riverside County next year, the fifth prison closure under his tenure. 
Newsom’s administration estimates it saves about $150 million a year for each prison closure, which lawmakers and advocates regard as the only way to significantly bring down corrections spending. A spokesperson for Newsom’s Finance Department declined to comment on the analyst’s projection. Newsom will release his next budget proposal in January.
“We are allowing wasteful prison spending to continue while Californians are being told to tighten their belts and brace for deep federal cuts to core programs,” said Brian Kaneda, deputy director for the statewide coalition Californians United for a Responsible Budget in a statement to CalMatters. “We are spending millions on prisons that could be safely closed. That is government waste, not public safety.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/072623_San-Quentin_SN_CM_33.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-11-21 08:59:02.660949

(Photo by alacatr/Getty Images)Utah’s data centers would have to report to the state how much water they’re using every year under a proposal advancing at the state Legislature. 
The vast centers housing rows of servers would have to pay up if they don’t disclose water use, said Rep. Jill Koford, R-Ogden. The bill she’s sponsoring would fine them $10,000 for every day they’re out of compliance. 
“We’re very serious about protecting Utah water and making sure that we’re using it wisely,” Koford said.

A legislative water development panel agreed, voting unanimously Thursday to send the proposal to the full House for consideration. State lawmakers convene for the 2026 legislative session in January. 
More data centers are cropping up in Utah and around the country to power artificial intelligence and other digital services. The construction is drawing attention to the massive amounts of water it can take to cool servers, with some using up to 5 million gallons of water in a day — more than 12,000 times the average use for a household of four.  
Koford said the National Security Agency’s data center in Bluffdale uses more than 23 million gallons a year, while Novva, a low-water-use data center in West Jordan, uses about 85,000. 
If the Utah bill passes, officials in the Division of Water Rights will get to see which data centers use the most water, but the public won’t. When it posts the numbers online, the state will remove identifying information to try to protect the companies’ intellectual property, Koford said.  



Let us know what you think...


 


“We have some really great partners who are bringing in economic development to the state, and they are reinvesting in our communities and in water,” Koford said of the data centers while speaking with reporters. 
But she has questions, she added: “What are you diverting? What are you consuming? What are you discharging? So that we can get a handle on it and plan for the future.” 
The bill has support from the Great Basin Water Network, a conservation group. No one spoke up to oppose it Thursday. 
Koford said the proposal won’t cap how much water the centers can use. Whether the state would impose limits in the future is “a reasonable question to ask,” she said. 
To date, the main source of information on data centers’ water use comes from cities’ permitting processes, Koford said, “but our state engineer and our state water division has been left out of that conversation.”
Similar bills have surfaced in at least six states, including Oregon, Indiana and Georgia, according to the National Caucus of Environmental Legislators.

(Anna Barrett/Alabama Reflector)TUSCALOOSA — Daniel DiDonato says he’s been passionate about elections since he was a young child. He remembers watching the 2016 presidential election as a fourth grader. 
That’s why DiDonato, an 18-year-old political science major at the University of Alabama, worked late at night and used a free redistricting app to draw six new Alabama Senate district maps, and submitted them, unsolicited, to a federal court in a lawsuit over potential Voting Rights Act violations in Alabama’s state Senate districts.
On Monday, U.S. District Judge Anna Manasco ordered that one of DiDonato’s maps be implemented in the case. 
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
“You can be the change you want to see in policy. You can be the change you want to see in government. Literally, you can do anything you set your mind to,” DiDonato said in an interview in Tuscaloosa on Thursday. “It’s extraordinarily cliche, but I did that.”
Whether the map remains in place is uncertain. Richard Allen, a special master charged with overseeing the new maps; Alabama Secretary of State Wes Allen, and attorneys for a group of plaintiffs who challenged the original Senate districts as racially discriminatory have all leveled criticisms of the map. The state may appeal Manasco’s order, though no appeal had been filed as of Thursday afternoon. 
DiDonato identifies as a Democrat but said his affiliation did not influence his decisions. He said he was not familiar with the racial or partisan makeup of Montgomery and did not “turn on” the partisan and race filters on the software until he finished all six maps.
“I don’t possess more than a passer-byer’s familiarity with the area. My understanding is limited to that,” he said.

The case

Manasco, a Trump appointee, ruled in August that Alabama’s Senate maps violate Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act. That provision prohibits voting laws or procedures that purposefully discriminate on the basis of race, color or membership in a language minority group. 
Manasco ordered new district lines to be drawn in Senate Districts 25 and 26, currently represented by Sens. Will Barfoot, R-Pike Road, and Kirk Hatcher, D-Montgomery, respectively. She ordered a second district in Montgomery that had a 50% Black voting age population, or something close to it. 
Gov. Kay Ivey said in September that she would not call a special session to redraw the map, citing a pending decision in the U.S. Supreme Court, Callais v. Louisiana, in which the justices are considering whether majority-minority districts are constitutional. A ruling is expected by next summer.
Manasco ordered the implementation of Remedial Plan 3 Monday. The map was drawn by 18-year-old Daniel DiDonato. (Map from court documents)
Manasco then appointed the same team that redrew the state’s congressional districts in 2023 to remedy the state Senate issue. Richard Allen, the special master, submitted three maps, with two being what he thought was best to remedy the VRA violation. The special master only submitted Remedial Plan 3, DiDonato’s map, to strengthen his case for Remedial Plans 1 and 2.
“The special master puts forward Remedial Plan 3 because, while it weakly remedies the Section Two violation, the comparison of Remedial Plan 3 to Remedial Plans 1 and 2 demonstrates the impact of modifying a third district (District 30) on the effectiveness of the remedy,” Allen wrote in an October court filing. “Additionally, given the small region in which the remedy is being effected, the special master lacked a third remedial plan that would modify only three districts, would more adequately remedy the Section Two violation, and would materially differ from Remedial Plans 1 and 2.”
Remedial Plan 3 extends Senate District 25 into southern Montgomery and extends Senate District 26 into Elmore County, which is currently in District 25. 
It changes the Black voting-age population from 29% to 51.1% in Senate District 25 and 66.1% to 43.9% in Senate District 26.

DiDonato’s process

DiDonato said he used Dave’s Redistricting, a free online app, to create the maps. All of his work was done late at night either in his dorm room or in a common study area in Martha Parham Hall East, a male community-style residence hall located near Bryant-Denny Stadium.
He often worked over the course of a few days until 3 a.m., snacking on Trolli sour gummy worms or Starburst, but absolutely no caffeine.
“No caffeine late at night. That’s my policy,” he said. 
In the redistricting software, DiDonato was able to hide partisan and racial information, allowing him to draw the districts without intentional gerrymandering. His goal was to create population equality between the districts. In the end, the districts differ by two people.
“The legal standard is that with state legislative districts, plus or minus 5% is acceptable,” he said. “They try to keep the population deviation between districts as low as possible. One thing that my plan did is I did my best to achieve exact population equality.”

According to correspondence between DiDonato, the special master and Manasco’s staff, DiDonato submitted his plans to the team on Oct. 1. He was later invited to a hearing on the maps by Charles Singleton, a clerk at the Northern District of Alabama Federal Court, on Oct. 27. DiDonato could not attend due to lack of transportation.
Messages seeking comment from Manasco’s staff were left Thursday afternoon, but no response had been received by publication time.
Secretary Allen objected to all three of the plans the special master submitted, but said Plan 3 was “the least bad of several bad options.”
“I guess the state was right,” DiDonato said. “They claim mine was the least objectionable, because it achieved the required remedy in a way that left more of the current plan intact relative to the special master’s Remedial Plans 1 and 2.”
The plaintiffs in the case said that the map was the “weakest remedy” to Manasco’s August ruling and requested Remedial Plan 2 to be implemented because it gave Black voters a near-guarantee to elect a candidate of their choosing. 
Messages seeking comment were left with Allen on Thursday. Davin Rosborough, an attorney representing the plaintiffs, did not comment Thursday afternoon.
Manasco told the plaintiffs in her Monday ruling that a guarantee is not required to remedy the Section 2 violation. DiDonato argued the same.
“I found the assertion that my plan didn’t provide two districts in which African-American voters had an opportunity to elect a candidate of their choice … I found it a bit rockheaded,” DiDonato said. “The court found that the plaintiffs weren’t entitled to two districts in which Black voters would elect a candidate of choice, only that they have an equal opportunity to do so.”
DiDonato does not expect any financial compensation. The special master and his team will bill for their work and legal costs. In 2023, the special master billed the state for more than $500,000 for the redrawing of the state’s congressional districts.
“The best I can get is a thank you,” he said. “They are going to bill hundreds of thousands of dollars, and this time, one of their maps wasn’t picked. I find that deeply hilarious.”

Political implications

DiDonato’s plan does not favor either Hatcher or Barfoot should they run for re-election in 2026. Using votes from the 2024 Presidential election, Senate District 25, which is currently held by Barfoot, becomes solidly Democratic.
According to the redistricting software, DiDonato said Senate District 25 would have elected Democratic nominee Kamala Harris by double digits. In reality, 64% of the district chose President Donald Trump.
“It goes from being a safe red district to a reliably blue district,” he said.
A message seeking comment from Barfoot was left Thursday afternoon.
The same principle applies to Senate District 26, held by Hatcher. The software showed the district turning in Republican candidates’ favor by about four percentage points. In 2024, 75% of the district chose Harris.
“This is a district that was invincibly blue, like, 75% Democratic at the last election. Now it voted for Trump,” DiDonato said. “Neither incumbent is favored in a vacuum to win re-election. And I’m like, ‘Oops, I did that.’ I guess this was an unintended partisan impact.”
Hatcher declined to comment on the changes in a text message Thursday afternoon.
These political implications is why DiDonato chose to be anonymous in court documents, since the age of majority in Alabama is 19. 
“I wanted to proceed with discretion, with privacy,” he said. “While the process was playing out, I didn’t want it to get tainted by games from outside forces, if you will.”

‘Your passions mean something’

As a 2024 graduate of Russell County High School in eastern Alabama, DiDonato said he would not have the confidence to pursue his dream without his teachers and guidance counselor. 
“In the most literal sense, they were the ones who pushed me to be where I am now. I’m eternally grateful to be a Russell County High School Warrior,” he said.
DiDonato’s father Anthony said in an interview Wednesday that he was shocked his son’s map was selected, but proud.
“When he gets into politics, he’s in his own little world. That’s his thing,” DiDonato’s father said. 
DiDonato turned 18 after the 2024 Presidential election, so he has not had the chance to vote yet. But that did not stop him from trying to make an impact on his government.
“There will be the things you are passionate about that have meaning,” he said. “I want this to be a reminder that you can change things for the better. Even if you’re just some person who has a passing interest in something. It is important somewhere to someone for something.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/DSC_0284-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-21 08:59:02.660949

The trucking industry is a major economic driver supporting multiple sectors, but lately it is facing challenges due to a lack of freight to haul and labor constraints.


The Missouri Department of Transportation estimates that over 985 million tons of goods pass through Missouri annually, with a net worth of $1.1 trillion. About 87% of these goods are moved by trucks.


“If we’re doing our job right, you don’t notice us,” Tom Crawford, president and CEO of the Missouri Trucking Association, said. “The shelves are full, and life is good.”


Crawford said that the economy has a direct impact on the trucking industry due to its integral role in the supply chain.


“Our industry is a reflection of the economy,” Crawford said. “A few years ago, the economy was running and gunning — everybody was spending like it was. So we got a lot of demand for goods.”


Consumer spending across the United States surged between 2021 and 2022, rising about 9%, and then about 5.9% from 2022 to 2023, according to data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Meanwhile, inflation remains elevated as the consumer price index rose approximately 3% on an annual basis since September 2024.


“You’re buying less than you did in 2022,” Crawford said. “You’re probably spending the same amount of money, but you’re not buying as much.”


Crawford explains that these economic changes are usually reflected back in the trucking industry’s demand for freight hauling. When there is an increase in consumer spending, there may be the challenge of finding more drivers to haul goods. While when the economy is facing a downturn, there might be a challenge of finding freight loads to haul.


One area where Crawford said this is often apparent is in the construction industry.


“When you see construction starting, with the ground being worked and foundations being set, you are also seeing a spike in freight demand,” Crawford said. “All of the raw materials, like concrete, gravel, and lumber, have to be delivered by truck. So changes in construction activity directly drive the volume of loads the trucking industry handles, especially in segments like flatbed trucking.”
 Labor challenges 



There have been nationwide concerns from trucking organizations about the shortages of truck drivers. Representatives from the American Trucking Association, the largest trucking organization in the U.S., testified before Congress in July to address the issue of a driver shortage, among other challenges.


Labor shortages have been an ongoing issue for the trucking industry, which caused the Biden administration to introduce the Trucking Action Plan in 2021.


One of the Trucking Action Plan’s main goals was to reduce barriers for individuals seeking commercial driver’s licenses. As part of this effort, the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration provided over $30 million in funding to help states expedite the commercial driver’s licensing process.


The CDL process involves first obtaining a learner’s permit by passing a knowledge test and meeting age and medical requirements. Drivers then complete training and pass a skills test, which includes vehicle inspection, basic maneuvers and on-road driving.


The current Trump administration has sought to reverse the Biden administration’s efforts to reduce barriers for the CDL licensing process. To do so, it has made the English Language Proficiency aspect of the test an out-of-service violation.


“It’s really all about safety, because, you know, if you think about it, if someone cannot understand what a road sign means, then that could be a real issue,” said Sicily Waters, director of communications for the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration. “And that’s really why I think everybody has really galvanized and supported this issue. The actions that this administration has taken are rooted in safety, and that’s not a partisan issue.”


Reporting from Missourinet indicates that 484 commercial drivers have been cited and pulled from driving on Missouri roads as of Oct. 21 because they are not fluent in English, according to information from the Missouri State Highway Patrol.


Crawford acknowledged that many drivers in Missouri’s trucking industry speak English as a second language. However, he stressed that it is the responsibility of employers to verify English proficiency during the hiring process.


“I know several members who have drivers for whom English isn’t their first language, but they are conversant,” Crawford said. “That’s what the law requires, and that’s a safe driver.”

U.S. Rep. Haley Stevens of Birmingham was noted as the most effective Democrat in terms of technology-based legislation, whereas U.S. Sen. Gary Peters of Bloomfield Township earned a spot as most effective in several different areas of legislative policy, the report showed.
For Peters, he was listed as being most effective on education, energy, government operations, immigration, macroeconomics, trade and transportation. Of all the Democratic senators listed in the report, Peters was one of three lawmakers to hold the top spot in multiple policy areas, followed only by U.S. Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois and U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, an independent who caucuses with the Democratic Party.
“Consistent with his pattern of lawmaking effectiveness in the 117th Congress, Sen. Gary Peters, Chair of the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Government Affairs, led the Government Operations and Technology policy areas (both of which had clear ties to his committee),” the report said.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The list did not cite a single member of the Republican delegation in the U.S. House of Representatives as being most effective in any of the given policy areas.
Peters is retiring from the upper chamber of Congress at the end of his term next year and is not seeking reelection, giving Michigan Democrats and Republicans an open race to replace him. But as the report shows, whomever wins the 2026 election will have big shoes to fill.
For Stevens, the designation as being most effective on the technology policy front could give her a good boost in her own campaign to replace Peters, as she is one of three Democrats vying for the party’s nomination in August. She currently faces state Sen. Mallory McMorrow of Royal Oak, former director of the Wayne County Department of Health, Human and Veterans Services, and research health specialist Rachel Howard.

Nearly half of the 46 families attending Agape Christian Academy World last spring lost access to Child Care Payment Program vouchers, which are essentially coupons that make child care affordable, Keyes said. Ten families left the facility as a result, and another 10 of the remaining families are not paying Keyes the full tuition. Keyes says she will keep serving her families until the day the center’s faltering finances puts her out of business. 
“I have been in the industry for close to 30 years now and never in my wildest dreams did I think that I would be going out like this,” Keyes said with tears in her eyes. 
She worries that day will be soon if the state doesn’t come up with money to plug the hole left by depleted pandemic funds that were enhancing the Child Care Payment Program.
Keyes’ situation is far from unique. Overall, 16,000 Mississippi families are on a waitlist for child care vouchers as a result of expired Covid-era funding, according to the Mississippi Department of Human Services. During the pandemic, the federal government gave states $52 billion to enhance vouchers that help working families afford child care. Since the money has dried up, that stability is withering away. Parents are losing their jobs, children are suffering inconsistent care, child care workers are being laid off and providers are going without pay or shuttering their facilities, according to advocates and industry leaders who spoke with Mississippi Today. 
“It’s a huge crisis for child care centers and parents, and we’re hearing from them every day,” said Carol Burnett of the Mississippi Low-Income Child Care Initiative. “This one center’s (Agape’s) experience times a thousand is really what’s happening in Mississippi right now.”
The Mississippi Department of Human Services (MDHS) has resumed vetting families coming up for redetermination – an annual review of eligibility, explained Mark Jones, chief communications officer at the agency. If families earn too much to qualify for the vouchers and fall off or leave the program, those families will no longer receive vouchers, and the department will begin working through the waitlist. 
For the first time during the last legislative session, Mississippi lawmakers appropriated $15 million of state funds to the child care voucher program. However, that was less than half of what the department requested. Thousands of families were left on the waitlist. 
Given the need, advocates hoped the Legislature would put more money toward the program this year. But in September’s Legislative Budget Committee hearing, MDHS did not ask lawmakers for money for child care. 
Instead, Bob Anderson, director of the Mississippi Department of Human Services, asked for $15 million to pay for the state’s Supplemental Nutrition Access Program (SNAP) after the so-called One Big Beautiful Bill, which Congress passed and President Donald Trump signed into law in July, gutted the program and turned much of the costs over to states. If received, that $15 million that Anderson requested will go toward administrative costs of implementing new federally-mandated bureaucratic requirements for checking if SNAP recipients qualify to receive those benefits. 
In the spring, the Legislature could choose to appropriate money for child care. But in light of Anderson’s request – and his silence on the need for more resources for child care despite ongoing waitlists – experts suggest the need to stop the bleeding after historic federal funding cuts has shifted the state’s priorities when it comes to making child care more affordable
Meanwhile, nurturing the state’s youngest citizens remains a burden for child care providers like Keyes, who is having a hard time keeping her center financially afloat. 
“I’m just handling it day by day by day by day right now,” she said. “And sometimes I feel like I’m underneath the water and just my face is up with my nose and I’m really trying not to come under because the community needs us.”
‘She grew up here’
Keyes said she has done everything in her power not to have to kick families out. She had to let six of her employees go, reduced four of her staff members from full-time to part-time and picked up the slack herself by taking on extra responsibilities such as bus driving and preparing lesson plans. She has also stretched resources further and offered discounted tuition to parents who offer work in exchange around the school, such as cutting the grass. She says that’s what community means to her. 
“Putting them out is not going to benefit me because I’m going to just be sitting up here wondering, ‘Where are they?’” Keyes said with a laugh. “What benefits me is knowing they’re in a safe place and then the mom or dad can continue doing what they need to do – working or going to school.”
Many of the children she serves come from households of young, single parents or are being cared for by grandparents. Nearly two-thirds of the school’s families are currently receiving vouchers or have in the past. 
Jazmine Donerson and her sister, Jalan Donerson, both have children who attend Agape and have accrued over $8,000 in unpaid tuition fees after losing their vouchers in June and August, respectively.

“I recently just lost everything in an apartment fire,” said Jazmine Donerson, a single mom who interns as a medical assistant full-time and works an evening shift at Family Dollar. “When I lost the voucher, it was hard for me to make payments. If my daughter wasn’t able to come to this daycare, I wouldn’t have anybody to watch her. I wouldn’t be able to go to school and try to better both our lives.”
She says the debt and the anxiety of getting kicked out or seeing the facility close weigh on her. But mostly, she said she is overwhelmed with gratitude for the consistency in care that Keyes has offered. 
“My baby started here when she was nine months, not walking, not talking. Now she won’t stop walking – or stop talking,” Jazmine Donerson joked. “She grew up here.”

Consistency is critical for young children, explained Biz Harris of the Mississippi Early Learning Alliance, and it’s often the first thing to go when care becomes too expensive. 
“To have to move around and have an uncertain child care situation, it causes anxiety and stress in the parents, and it causes anxiety and stress in the baby – even if you don’t see it, it’s there,” Harris said.
And it’s not just families or child care workers who are affected. Nationwide, the loss of pandemic funding for child care will cost states $10.6 billion in lost economic activity, according to a study conducted by the Century Foundation, an independent think tank in New York. 
Child care is more expensive in the U.S. than any other country explained Elliot Haspel, a nationally recognized child and family policy expert based in Colorado. Haspel said that is because there is no coordinated public child care system like there is for K-12 education,
“We treat child care in this country much more like a private, individual commodity like a gym or a restaurant than we do more of a public or social good like public schools or fire departments or roads or parks,” said Haspel. “So, there’s very little public money in the system, and the economics don’t work without it.”
Keyes has never thought of what she does as babysitting, or anything other than a public good. She views herself as an educator of her youngest charges. Research backs up that perception. The first few years of life are the most critical years for learning and development. 
“At the end of the day, we are an early learning institution,” Keyes said.
Getting creative
As of now, it’s not clear how long Keyes’ child care center will remain open or what approach state leaders will take to ensure funding. 
Advocates have called on the state in recent months to use unspent welfare money to fund the voucher program. But using Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) funds outside of what was allocated for the Child Care Development Fund is prohibited, according to federal guidance. 
The Child Care Development Fund is the federal block grant that primarily funds the voucher program. States can transfer up to 30% of TANF funds to CCDF, and Mississippi transfers the maximum amount. 
Other states, such as Ohio and Texas, have set up direct payment programs to use additional funds carried over from previous years for child care. Jones with Mississippi Department of Human Services said the agency is committed to following official federal guidance regarding conversion of TANF funds to the child care voucher program. 
The agency also has opened a Request for Proposals, Jones said, to use TANF funds for “work support” – programs that help those in low-income jobs remain employed. Proposals include child care, Jones said. The subgrantees will be announced in 2026.

Meanwhile, Gov. Tate Reeves asked lawmakers to provide $1 million this session to expand child care access for workers across the state. The program, according to his annual Executive Budget Recommendation, would be a public-private “tri-share model” in which employers, employees and the state government share the cost of child care. 
“Any revenue to child care is welcome and wonderful, so that’s that,” said Burnett of the Mississippi Low-Income Child Care Initiative. “But it is a small investment, and the other effort Mississippi has put forward that involved businesses participating was an employer tax credit they could get for investing in child care – and there has been practically no take-up on that.”
Without the promise of help from the state, Keyes plans to start delivering orders for DoorDash in the coming months to earn extra income. Keyes said she doesn’t have the heart to lay anyone off before the holidays, but she doesn’t know how much longer she can hold out. 
Keyes said she hopes that officials will get as creative as she’s had to get to stay open – and that they’ll follow through. She keeps praying because she believes care and education are the foundation to life. 
“It’s not about money for me – I don’t pay myself a salary,” said Keyes. “I do it because I want to see the children grow. When you have a great beginning, you have a great ending. In child care, we’re the beginning for everything. We pour into them what they need.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/19140229/3X0A5363.jpg,,,2025-11-21 08:59:02.660949

New maps open challenges to Darrell Issa,Deborah Brennan,,,,,https://calmatters.org/politics/2025/11/san-diego-redistricting-midterm-election/,"If Proposition 50 survives the legal challenges, the new voting map could lead to the lone Republican seat in San Diego - the 48th Congressional District represented by Darrell Issa - flipping to the Democrats.","In summary
If Proposition 50 survives the legal challenges, the new voting map could lead to the lone Republican seat in San Diego – the 48th Congressional District represented by Darrell Issa – flipping to the Democrats. 


Eleven Democrats are vying to unseat Rep. Darrell Issa, a San Diego Republican, after California’s redistricting measure turned his reliably red district into a slightly blue one that will be a key swing race in next year’s midterm elections.
Rep. Mike Levin, a San Clemente Democrat, can breathe easier, as Proposition 50 carves out new boundaries that make his swing district more safely Democratic. 
The new voting map reflects California’s bid to offset Texas’ effort to secure control of the House by adding five Republican seats in November. California voters approved the redistricting plan proposed in Proposition 50 by nearly 20 points in a special election this month.
Both redistricting efforts are embroiled in litigation. On Tuesday a federal court blocked Texas from using its new maps, finding that they would harm Black and Latino voters in that state. Last week the U.S. Department of Justice sued to overturn California’s maps, arguing that they unlawfully considered Latino voters in the new districts.
If California’s redistricting plan withstands that challenge, the new voting map could help Democrats flip the lone Republican seat in San Diego. The 48th Congressional District, represented by Issa, will switch from a 12-point Republican advantage to a 4-point Democratic lead, based on voter registration. 
A crowd of Democrats 
The more favorable odds have drawn a wide field of challengers, including Issa’s former opponent, Amar Campa-Najjar, who lost to Issa in a previous version of the district in 2020, San Diego City Council Member Marni von Wilpert, and several contenders from the Coachella Valley.
The passage of the redistricting measure triggered a statewide game of musical chairs, setting in motion the chairs as well as the players. 
The current 48th District covers conservative East County San Diego communities. The new district moves west and north, losing much of that backcountry and adding the North County San Diego cities of Escondido, San Marcos and Vista. It also includes ultra-liberal Palm Springs in Riverside County, where Democratic voters outnumber Republicans by more than four to one.
Those new lines absorb part of the current 41st District in Riverside County, represented by long-standing Republican Rep. Ken Calvert.  His current district will move entirely to Los Angeles and Orange County, so Calvert plans to run in the new 40th District in Riverside and Orange County against fellow Republican, Rep. Young Kim. 
Meanwhile, three Coachella Valley Democrats who were among eight challengers against Calvert for his Riverside County district have now jumped into the race against Issa.  Attorney Anuj Dixit, school board member Abel Chavez and entrepreneur Brandon Riker all switched gears to campaign for the new 48th District.  Another Palm Springs candidate, Marc Iannarino, a Navy veteran and bartender, threw his hat in the ring. Political observers note that the Coachella Valley candidates come from a smaller and more liberal portion of the new district.
“These are three candidates who really know Palm Springs, but they’ve got to reach out to moderate, purplish voters and to know who San Diego voters are,” said Dan Rottenstreich, campaign manager for von Wilpert.

“This is not a deep blue seat,” Rottenstreich said. “This is going to be among the top five heavily contested races in the country.”
Who can win the swing race?
Von Wilpert and Campa-Najjar, the two highest profile contenders, each argue they’re the best candidate to navigate the slim partisan advantage.
Both have prominent endorsements. Former Senator Barbara Boxer, numerous state and local leaders and the Democratic women’s political action committee Emily’s List are supporting von Wilpert. A slate of congress members including San Diego Reps. Mike Levin, Scott Peters and Sara Jacobs have weighed in for Campa-Najjar.

All the challengers face a well-established incumbent for a district that – despite its partisan shift – will still be a toss-up.
Von Wilpert, a former prosecutor in the San Diego City Attorney’s office, won her city council seat in 2020, running against a Republican opponent in a conservative-leaning district, Rottenstreich said
“With these new lines, CA-48 becomes one of the most competitive races in America, and a must-win seat to flip the House,” von Wilpert said in a statement on election day. “I’m the only candidate in this race who’s proven I can win tough elections, flip red seats blue, and deliver results for working families.”
Campa-Najjar, a Navy officer and former Obama campaign official, argues that his experience running against Issa in 2020 positions him to win Democratic and independent votes in the new district. 
“I see it as a rematch between me and Darrell Issa, with 10 other candidates,” he said. “I’m not running against them. I have great respect for them, but only one of us will win.”
Although he lost in 2020, Campa-Najjar said he gained a foothold in the conservative district, getting more votes than expected in the majority Republican district. 
Can Issa hold his seat?
Issa has served in Congress for more than 20 years in different districts. He originally held the 49th District – now represented by Levin – from 2001 through 2019, and retired when that district became competitive. In 2020, he won his current seat, holding it for the next two terms after it was redrawn during statewide redistricting in 2021.
Issa declined to answer questions from CalMatters, but in a statement he called Proposition 50 an “unprecedented purely partisan campaign that pitted neighbor against neighbor and divided the state as never before.”
Despite that, Issa said he plans to run again: “I’m not going anywhere. I’ll continue to represent the people of California — regardless of their party or where they live.”
The general election will reflect voter’s opinions about President Donald Trump; historically the president’s party usually loses ground in the midterms. Issa, a close Trump ally who has supported the president’s policies and nominated him for a Nobel Peace Prize, will have to lean into that record, Kousser said.
“He has to embrace him with his base and make the case to the middle that the Trump presidency has been good for their district,” he said.
The crowded field of Democrats could thwart some candidates in the primary, Kousser said. But it will likely benefit the party in the general election next November, forcing challengers to campaign early and gain traction with voters.
“Whoever emerges as the Democratic candidate is going to be battle-tested in that district,” he said.
A coastal swing district shifts left
The redistricting measure also shored up vulnerable Democratic seats, including Levin’s 49th District. It shifts south, adding coastal San Diego communities of La Jolla and Torrey Pines. Now 65% of the current district is in San Diego County; in the new district that climbs to 81%, Levin said.
With that come more Democratic voters, and even more left-leaning voters. The current district has a two percent margin of Democratic voter registration, which jumps to four percent under the new lines. But the Democratic advantage jumps to 12 percent when you compare the number of votes for former Vice President Kamala Harris vs. Trump in last year’s election.
That positions Levin more securely in his reelection race. He faces Republican San Diego County Supervisor Jim Desmond, along with two other Republicans and a non-partisan candidate.
“The southern shift of that district makes it more blue in terms of the democratic registrations, and the political leanings of the independents,” said Paul Mitchell, the political data expert who drew California’s new voting lines. “So that district for him is a big improvement.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/011724_Darrell-Issa_REUTERS_CM_01.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-11-21 08:59:02.660949

(Photo: Hugh Jackson/Nevada Current)A federal lawsuit alleges a Las Vegas real estate brokerage operated by George Kypreos, president of Las Vegas Realtors, conspired with Zillow to obtain clients, garner hidden fees, and steer prospective buyers to costly mortgage loans that were not in their interest. 
An amended version of the lawsuit, filed in a U.S. district court in Washington state, includes brokerage defendants in California, Florida, Oregon, and Nevada, and includes inside information from a dozen current and former real estate agents and loan officers who revealed the allegedly deceptive practices. 
Kypreos’ brokerage, GK Properties, along with others, is involved in “fraudulently inducing home buyers into using Zillow Flex agents and illegally steering buyers into using Zillow Home Loans,” the suit alleges. 
The practice also allegedly violates the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (RESPA), which prohibits kickbacks and referral fees.
Zillow and Kypreos did not respond to requests for comment. LVR, through a spokesman, declined to comment. 
The suit was amended on Nov. 19 to include allegations of conspiracy under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) Act. It reveals details of Zillow’s alleged practice of steering buyers to costly home loans brokered by Zillow Home Loans, where loan agents are inexperienced, the complaint says, and directed to churn as many loans as possible, without regard for the customer’s best interest. 
Prospective buyers searching homes on Zillow’s website are tricked into signing up with a Zillow agent, the suit alleges, with Zillow receiving 40% of the agent’s commission, “a payment on the back end that is undisclosed to all parties involved.”
Zillow’s listings on its website feature a blue button that invites the prospective buyer to contact the agent. 
“Buyers, however, naturally believe they are contacting the listing agent. Instead, they are routed to a Zillow-affiliated buyer’s agent, who arranges a tour of the home by getting the buyer to sign a “Touring Agreement,” which “promises the buyer that the agent’s services are ‘free,’ but this is deceptive and not true,” the plaintiffs allege.  
The practice increases the price of homes, the suit contends. “If buyers were directed to sellers’ agents, they would be better positioned to negotiate a lower purchase price, because the seller would not have to pay commissions to the seller’s agent and the buyer’s agent.” 
Henderson resident Dale Koger, one of two Southern Nevada plaintiffs in the suit, clicked on the “Contact Agent” button of a house he hoped to see, “believing that he was contacting the seller’s agent,” the suit says. “Thereafter, he felt compelled to stay with that person as his agent. Plaintiff Koger believes that, because he was unable to contact the buyer’s agent, he paid higher commissions because he had to pay his buyer’s commission (as well as the seller agent’s commission.)”
The lawsuit notes that according to its Zillow profile, “the George Kypreos Team has sold a total of 7,050 properties, including 397 in the past 12 months, with an average sales price of $453,000. As a result, its approximate total sales are $3.2 billion, with $180 million in the last 12 months alone.”
While all of the George Kypreos Team’s agents have a “Top Agent on Zillow” badge on the site, three agents had zero sales in the past year, and another had only one, the suit says.
Kypreos became president of LVR in January after its elected president resigned two days into his term, following allegations of election tampering.
In July, some members voiced concern that Kypreos was attempting to pave the way for the sale of LVR’s Multiple Listing Service to a private party, a move some say would be a financial boon to LVR, but render the organization irrelevant in the long run.  
Vulnerable homebuyers have no choice, the plaintiffs assert, but to rely on realtors to navigate the complicated buying process. 
“Zillow surveyed this landscape and only saw pots of gold,” the suit says. “Zillow’s practices and policies in the real estate industry are not simply indifferent to the agents’ duties to protect their clients’ interests; Zillow actively schemes to subvert them.”
Zillow’s policies are designed, the suit claims, “to monetize every step of the home buying process—even if illegally—and to encourage, incentivize, and ultimately coerce agents into violating their fiduciary duties by disregarding their clients’ interests.”
 Zillow promotes itself as “transforming the way people buy, sell, rent and finance homes,” but this “transformation” comes at a steep cost for home buyers.
Real estate professionals have struggled to keep pace with a changing market in which their services are no longer essential to some, given the ability to view homes on websites. 
Last year, the National Association of Realtors settled a lawsuit that resulted in the elimination of standard 6% percent commissions. In its place is an arrangement that requires agents for buyers and sellers to negotiate terms with their clients. 
The NAR has also been criticized for discriminatory practices. 
Local real estate agents have long been concerned about Zillow’s role in sales and lending. 
In 2020, Las Vegas broker Mark Sivek said he feared Zillow will do to real estate agents “what Travelocity did to travel agents. They are diabolical in their evil genius. They say they’re just marketing. An agent who is paying to advertise on Zillow is feeding the monster that’s going to eat it.”",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/LVrealtors-48x1301-1-e1763684308285-1024x630.jpg,,,2025-11-21 07:56:50.536187

(Leah Romero for Source NM)Two southern New Mexico state representatives on Thursday evening told their constituents that they view Project Jupiter, the massive data center for which elected county leaders approved $165 billion in government-backed bonds, as a transparency failure that “sidelined” the community.
Rep. Angelica Rubio (D-Las Cruces) and Rep. Micaela Lara Cadena (D-Mesilla) spoke at a Thursday event hosted by the nonprofit organization New Mexico Water Advocates and expressed apprehensions that Project Jupiter’s plans to generate natural gas and tap into the region’s troubled water utility will exacerbate regional pollution and strain a water system that’s already pushed to the limit. Rubio noted that she has seen several recent headlines questioning whether the nation is on the brink of an artificial intelligence bubble and said the decision to approve $165 billion for an OpenAI and Oracle data center was a “gamble.”
Project Jupiter pits demand for data against New Mexico’s finite natural resources

“When the industry itself is signaling instability…it’s reckless for public institutions to lock themselves into these long-term subsidies and abatements and these water commitments. New Mexico took this gamble at the exact moment the market is now wobbly,” Rubio said. “For New Mexicans, there has been this long history of being told that the next big thing is what’s going to save us, whether it has been Spaceport, whether it was Virgin Galactic, Facebook, film incentives pitched as these permanent engines…now it’s Project Jupiter.”
Although Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham announced the data center as a $5 billion project in February, lawmakers and some southern New Mexico residents have voiced concerns over how quickly the deal appeared to come together. They also question whether the project’s $360 million payment in lieu of taxes — spread out over 30 years — is a fair return for $165 billion.
“When I first heard that the payment in lieu of taxes was going to be $360 million, I assumed that was annually,” Lara Cadena, who also serves as vice chair on the House Taxation and Revenue Committee, said. “To see that our county commission signed a deal to receive so little, I was just stunned.”
Critics take issue with the data center’s energy source, in particular. Plans call for a natural gas generating “microgrid,” a system that can solely rely on its own power rather than drawing from an existing grid. Project representatives have touted that as a way to prevent the data center from increasing nearby residents’ energy bills. But critics say the 2025 law that governs microgrids appears to exempt them from complying with the state’s landmark Energy Transition Act — which requires that utilities use 50% renewable energy by 2030 and 80% renewable energy by 2040 — until 2045, when it would be required to use fully renewable energy.
Sen. Michael Padilla (D-Albuquerque), who sponsored the legislative language in question, has previously disputed that characterization to Source New Mexico and insisted that the development must comply with every aspect of the clean energy law.
“It was a process failure, it was a transparency failure, it was a democracy failure,” Rubio said. “The community was sidelined.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Jupiter1-1024x683.png,,,2025-11-21 07:56:50.536187

I want to start by saying that I am not an expert on Native history or Indigenous culture. I am an ally and an advocate. 
My goal is not to speak for anyone, but to stand with those whose voices are being overshadowed in this conversation.
At first glance, Vermont’s House Bill H.362 sounds like a step toward protecting Indigenous identity — a trap I admittedly fell for. But in function, H.362 does quite the opposite. To understand why, it’s important to look at what H.362 proposes to change, and what it threatens to undo.

READ MORE

What H.362 would change
H.362, introduced by Rep. Troy Headrick — the bill’s sole sponsor — proposes to overhaul Vermont’s process for recognizing Native communities and overseeing the Truth and Reconciliation Commission.
H.362 would:

Retroactively re-examine Native communities already recognized under existing law;
Add new genealogical verification requirements;
Create multiple oversight bodies and “expert” panels; and
Mandate consultation with the Odanak and Wôlinak First Nations: sovereign Nations that share geography with Quebec, Canada.

On paper, these provisions claim to promote transparency. In practice, H.362 invites extra-jurisdictional and adversarial influence into Vermont’s domestic policy and erodes trust in the state’s settled recognition process that evolved through collaboration and consensus.
What H.362 threatens to undo
Fifteen years ago, Vermont passed Act 107, the law that formalized how the state recognizes Native communities, and created the Vermont Commission on Native American Affairs.
Act 107 was the product of public dialogue, bipartisan cooperation and input from both Native and non-Native Vermonters, alike. Multiple co-sponsors from both sides of the aisle crafted Act 107 as a good-faith effort to bring clarity, accountability and respect to state recognition.
That framework became settled law in 2010.
Now, H.362 attempts to reopen that settled process. If passed, H.362 would not only duplicate the safeguards Act 107 already provides, but would also embed international consultation into Vermont statute.
That’s not reform. That’s destabilization.
State recognition decisions must remain in Vermont. Allowing a legislator to lobby the interests of a First Nation located outside of U.S. jurisdiction in Vermont’s legislative process blurs constitutional lines and undermines the principles of state sovereignty.
Federal recognition vs. state recognition
Part of the confusion around this debate comes from misunderstanding what “recognition” means.
Federal recognition creates a government-to-government relationship between a Native community and the United States, granting sovereign status and eligibility to participate in federal programs.
State recognition, on the other hand, operates within a state’s borders. State recognition acknowledges Indigenous communities that live within the state’s borders and ensures inclusion in education, culture, and policy.
By inviting Canadian First Nations into Vermont’s recognition process, H.362 collapses that boundary and transforms a state-level cultural acknowledgement into an international affair. Vermont cannot legislate through consultation with sovereign entities outside of United States jurisdiction.
Doing so risks violating the Foreign Affairs Clause and the Indian Commerce Clause of the U.S. Constitution, which reserve such relations to the federal government.
The colonial framework of “legitimacy”
But the issue runs deeper than just legal mechanics. H.362 perpetuates a colonial framework; one rooted in the federal government’s obsession with “legitimacy” and definition. 
The idea that identity must be proven through paperwork or verified by outside authorities is a framework created by colonization itself. It defines what something is, by what something is not — who belongs, and who does not — through systems that Indigenous cultures never built and often run directly counter to Indigenous ways of knowing and belonging.  
By emphasizing external verification over community continuity, H.362 revives that colonial logic under the guise of reform. It tells Indigenous communities that share geography with Vermont that their identities remain subject to external judgement — precisely what Act 107 sought to move beyond.
Why this matters
Act 107 represents the best of Vermont’s legislative character: collaborative, bipartisan, and inclusive.
H.362 disturbs that by replacing collaboration with suspicion, stability with confusion, and consensus with unilateral influence.
Vermonters deserve laws that unite, not divide — especially now when social division is so highly contagious. Recognition must be shaped by the people and communities who live in Vermont, not by foreign authorities or those seeking to rewrite settled state law.
A Call to Action
Let’s honor the process that was built together and protect a recognition framework that reflects Vermont’s values: truth, respect and self-determination.
Because unity — not division — is what moves Vermont forward.
Vote NO on H.362 and keep Act 107 strong.

(Francis Chung/POLITICO via AP Images)Marie Gluesenkamp Perez told voters in her 2022 campaign that she was “definitely not your typical candidate for Congress.” 
After winning two consecutive U.S. House elections in Washington’s Republican-leaning 3rd Congressional District, she’s proven it. 
Her willingness to cross up her party leaders and crossover to vote with the GOP majority was on display again this week in an episode that made some of her Democratic colleagues uneasy, others outright hostile.
Gluesenkamp Perez, of Skamania County in southwest Washington, authored a resolution reprimanding a retiring Democrat from Illinois for a political sleight-of-hand aimed at ensuring he is succeeded by his chief of staff. 
House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-New York, and pretty much everyone else in the Democratic caucus didn’t want the matter to reach the House floor.
It did. It wasn’t pretty. MGP — that’s how folks refer to her — found herself pitted against fellow Democrats enraged by her dogged pursuit of the public reprimand. 
The resolution passed 236-183, thanks to the votes of 213 Republicans.
Gluesenkamp Perez isn’t second-guessing her move.
“Everyday people here in Southwest Washington and nationwide want representatives who will seek to build rather than destroy, who will listen and do the work rather than bask in celebrity, and who will focus on substance, not slogans or sound bites,” she wrote supporters in a fundraising email Wednesday.
The Standard spoke with Gluesenkamp Perez on Thursday to hear if there’s been any fallout and if the experience might have her rethinking her relationship with the Democratic Party.
The following interview was lightly edited for clarity and length.
What conversations have you had with other Democrats in the caucus, members of leadership, or those who spoke during the floor debate?
You know, while it might not have been audible on the cameras, the heckling was pretty intense. I don’t take it personally. You can’t. It’s too easy to, you know, sort of condemn people. While we can condemn the actions, you do not condemn the person as an individual. That is a different question.
Have you spoken with any fellow Washington state Democrats about the events and what did they say?
Kim Schrier did also vote for this reprimand. I was really encouraged by that. Everybody’s got to make their own determinations about how they can best serve their district.
Given what transpired, have you entertained thoughts of leaving the Democratic Party and becoming an independent?
I’m a Democrat, and that’s why I feel it’s important to hold my party accountable. I feel I am more in line with democratic values on this than the other side. So this is not a signifier to me that I need to change parties. I think the party needs to change. But that’s different. That’s long work, right?
It’s not causing you to rethink your relationship with the party?
No, I’m a Democrat. Maybe I’m an old school one. Old school Democrats aren’t dead yet.
Former Republican Congresswoman Liz Cheney, last year, when she endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris, spoke of the importance of putting country over party. I was thinking that maybe you were channeling that vibe a little bit Monday. Were you?
No. I wouldn’t say that I was thinking about any political figures during that. I was thinking about my neighbors and friends. I actually saw my grandparents and my parents right after the news broke about Representative [Chuy] Garcia. My family and my neighbors all had such moral clarity. I said, ‘Well, some people think that I’m out of my lane here, that I should just be thinking about timber and sea lions. Do you feel like I’m derelict in my duty to local issues here, if I go after this?’ And they said, ‘No, no. That is the reason that we care about timber policy in our schools. This is a natural consequence of that. Being rooted in place and local values does not end with just the material questions. It’s married to the values, the deeper values. 
You’ve touched on this a little already. But what’s been the response of your constituents?
Look, people are not necessarily paying attention to Chicago politics, but they are broadly losing confidence in Congress. I mean, Congress’s approval rating is in the gutters. Part of my point in the debate is like what use is it to win an election at all costs, even your own integrity, when you destroy the thing itself? That there is a definition of a Pyrrhic victory.
What do you think would be different in the House if there were 218 Marie Gluesenkamp Perezes serving?
People were like, ‘Why are you picking this fight?’ And I was like, ‘Why are you picking this fight?’ Because the facts are pretty clear. I’m not here to condemn the character and the legacy of Chuy Garcia. I’m saying that it’s wrong to collect signatures and sign the petition for your chief of staff to run and withdraw after the deadline is over. That’s what I’m saying is wrong. Like, why do you need to pick this fight with me? The facts are the facts. 
Sounds like you’re trying to hold up a mirror for your colleagues to see what others see is going on.
Change does not happen because of just condemnation. And grace is not just turning a blind eye. It is accountability and grace. Those things, that is where change can happen. And I’m not going to hold any grudges for anyone in this. I just did what I felt my community would want me to do, and that’s all I can do, is be faithful and humble.
They’ve got your back. That’s what you said. 
I felt it. It’s been really awesome honestly. I know where my friends are, I know who elected me. That was a real encouragement to me that night after the debate, folks from back home texting me and knowing that people were praying for me. It was pretty necessary.
I did wonder, if you’re concerned that, given what’s happened, your party might not be on the right course to regain the majority and effectively lead.
I think it is an encumbrance on your ability to lead if you are not willing to hold your own accountable. I think the work at hand is too serious to move forward without addressing these failings, which is why I felt it was necessary to bring this resolution forward.
It was not fun, but I also think it’s important for the body. There were colleagues who were like, ‘She’s a lawmaker for God’s sake. Why didn’t she make a law?’ Well, I cannot think of every weaselly thing and make it illegal. What I can do is say that there’s a culture of accountability and that we’re willing to be honest brokers in upholding our values.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Marie-Gluesenkamp-Perez--1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-21 07:56:50.536187

Representatives from northeast Washington’s 7th Legislative District are opening a district office in Tonasket next week.
Reps. Hunter Abell, R-Inchelium, and Andrew Engell, R-Colville, announced the new district office earlier this week, stating they hope to serve constituents’ concerns and questions. This is the first district office for both.
“The idea really came about because our district is the largest, most rural district in the state. It’s actually larger than nine U.S. states,” Abell said. “So with a district that large, our belief was that it was really important to have a brick-and-mortar presence somewhere in the district and somewhere where we don’t live.”
Engell said they initially considered two offices, one in either Omak or Tonasket and another in Colville. However, with an annual budget of $9,000, they decided they needed to find a balance between costs, access and functionality.
“We found a great location for an affordable price,” Engell said. “It has this little sign on the front that says, ‘All roads lead to Tonasket.’ It’s right on the Main Street so I think it’s going to be a great little location.”
Abell added they wanted the office located somewhere other than Colville, where most previous district offices have been.
“This is part of my ongoing commitment to the western half of the district, to make sure that we are there regularly, that we’re listening to people,” Abell said. “With Colville, it’s where Andrew lives, so I think Colville is already pretty well taken care of.
“I really want to make sure that we’re listening and talking to folks who live in Okanogan and Douglas (counties),” he said.
Abell said they plan to hold events or town halls where constituents can stop by to discuss issues, such as agriculture, affordability and tax burdens.
“This is a lot about what we hear in other areas of the district. And you know, I would hope that we’re going to hear from folks on those issues when they come and visit us in the district office,” he said.
Engell, who worked for former Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers in her Colville office for eight years, said having a physical location can help remove barriers and build trust between constituents and legislators. He added that the office will also serve residents without internet access.
“They might look in the window, and you look friendly on the other side, and so they might walk in, and you find out they’ve got an issue that we can help with,” Engell said.
Located at 215 N. Whitcomb Ave., the new district office will be having a grand opening from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. on Tuesday. Both representatives will be present. Afterward, the office will be open from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., Monday through Wednesday, staffed by their legislative assistants.
The district office will close during the first two months of the 2026 legislative session and reopen in mid-March. The legislative session begins Jan. 12.

Board members voted to restrict library materials for minors referring to transgender people and ""gender ideology,"" which the board did not define. (Ralph Chapoco/Alabama Reflector)The Alabama Public Library Service Thursday voted to restrict books for minors that address “transgender procedures, gender ideology, or the concept of more than two biological genders.”
The changes — which do not define what “gender ideology” is — group any books that discuss transgender individuals with items considered obscene, sexually explicit or any material deemed inappropriate.
“I think today was an incredible day for the people of Alabama, because it took a major step forward in putting parents back in control of what their children are exposed to,” said John Wahl, chair of the APLS Board and Alabama Republican Party. “And at the end of the day, that is what the APLS priority is. We want to put Alabama families in charge. We want them to make the decisions for what is best for their families.”
In a joint statement, groups including Read Freely Alabama; PEN America; Every Library and the Alabama Transgender Rights Action Coalition criticized the changes, saying they were pushed by right-wing and anti-LGBTQ+ groups.
“This broad language will likely result in any books with trans representation–regardless of their age-relevance–moved to adult sections of public libraries in Alabama,” the statement said. “The language in the code change does not define “gender ideology,” a vague, undefined term often used as an anti-LGBTQ+ dogwhistle.”
Wahl also introduced other amendments that the APLS Board adopted to require local libraries that the library cards they issue to minors prohibit them from having access to books and other materials in the adult section unless they have explicit permission from their parents or legal guardian.
The board also approved adding language to the code that requires libraries “recognize and comply with all state code, rules, and definitions adopted by the APLS executive board.”
The changes were more expansive than the original proposal made in March by Amy Minton, an APLS board member, that would have only prohibited positive depictions of gender ideology and transgender procedures in library materials for minors.
Wahl argued that removing the word “positive” would also limit material critical of transgender people.
“I don’t think that was ever the intent that we should be allowing negative content and not positive content,” he said.
Thursday marked the second time in three years that the APLS voted to update its administrative code in three years. Board members enacted the first set of changes that dealt with materials in the children’s section of libraries. In the summer of 2024, the board  required libraries to adopt policies to prevent minors from having access to materials that are considered obscene, sexually explicit or otherwise considered inappropriate.
Several groups, including the Alabama Library Association, have criticized the process that led to the vote as unfair and lacked transparency.
“This was all a mechanism for which they could have the end result that they already predetermined,” said Angie Hayden, one of the founding members of Read Freely Alabama. “I think that there has been a conflict of interest in Wahl’s role as ALGOP chair and APLS chair. I think he used one to influence the other.”
It is an accusation that Wahl denied.
“I also want to highlight to those who have tried to make the statement that this is already done, the wording was done and finished before this happened, that is not true,” Wahl said. “And you can see it based on the edits, the amendments based on the public comment.”

Fairhope

While the APLS Board voted to modify its administrative code, members delayed a vote on Fairhope Public Library’s compliance with the administrative code, which would reinstate its state funding.
“I know I have been working very hard to review the material, the books that they submitted,” Wahl said.
In March, Minton requested that the APLS Board vote to suspend state aid to the Fairhope Public Library after a handful of residents spoke during the public comment period that they found several books in the teens’ section of the library that violated the APLS administrative code enacted in 2024.

The Board voted to suspend the library’s funding. The Fairhope Library Board then reviewed the 17 books that parents challenged. They eventually reshelved seven of the books but retained the remaining titles in the teens section.
During the meeting in September, the Board decided to wait until it had reviewed the books that parents challenged themselves. Thus far, Wahl is the only member of the board who said he plans on reviewing the books and will report his findings to the rest of the APLS Board who will then take a vote on the fate of the funding for the Fairhope Public Library.
“Are you becoming the censor in chief for Alabama, that you are reading these books?” said Ron Snider at the Thursday meeting, one of the APLS board members. Snider moved to have the Fairhope Public Library’s funding reinstated, but his request failed to get the necessary support.
Even prior to the discussion, Snider requested that Wahl apologize to the Fairhope Public Library after the library was forced to forfeit all its remaining state aid for 2025 that totaled about $22,000.
“The action of the board, in postponing a decision until you were going to review some books, clearly implied to them that their remaining funding, the $20,000, was going to be available to them subject to approval,” he said at the meeting Thursday. “When we found out that was not, in fact, the case, we owe them an apology.”
Wahl said the rule was already in place and that libraries, including the Fairhope Public Library, knew of the rule, and that other libraries had their state aid withheld. However, only the Fairhope Public Library had its funding suspended because of the administrative code pertaining to inappropriate books located in a section dedicated to minors.
“I am sorry for any misinformation or for people’s misunderstanding, and that is genuine,” Wahl said, but did not apologize for the rule that forced the Fairhope Public Library to forfeit its remaining state aid.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_7724-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-21 07:56:50.536187

(Getty Images)The long-simmering disagreement over an Indiana congressional redistricting has exploded into a political spectacle, with President Donald Trump warning Republican state senators of electoral retribution.
Gov. Mike Braun piled on this week, pledging to “support President Trump’s efforts to recruit, endorse, and finance primary challengers” against fellow Republicans who don’t abide by Trump’s edict to redraw the congressional maps so the state has more GOP-friendly districts.
“That certainly is unprecedented to have a governor and the president threatening to support a primary opponent, but it’s just part of the system, too,” Sen. Travis Holdman told the Indiana Capital Chronicle. “But I’m not surprised by it.”
Holdman, R-Markle, is the third-ranking Republican senator as majority caucus chair and made himself one of Trump’s targets this week by announcing: “The message from my district has been clear — they do not support mid-cycle redistricting, and therefore I cannot support it.”

Holdman, who has been in the Senate since 2008, has not yet drawn any Republican primary challengers for his reelection bid next year.
At least two other Republican senators who’ve expressed opposition to redistricting — Spencer Deery of West Lafayette and Jim Buck of Kokomo — already have GOP opponents who’ve seized on the redistricting issue.
Paula Copenhaver, a top aide to Lt. Gov. Micah Beckwith and the Fountain County Republican chair, announced her challenge to Deery on Tuesday, the same day Deery voted in favor of scratching a planned December redistricting debate and not starting the legislative session until Jan. 5.
“Hoosiers have watched weak leadership in the state Senate fail to deliver the redistricting plan needed to keep America on a path that will deliver affordability to American families,” Copenhaver said in her announcement. “District 23 deserves a senator who is unapologetically willing to take on the radical Democrats’ socialist agenda.”
Deery counters that he’s heard overwhelmingly from voters that they oppose redistricting, but said that “because of the D.C. influence, I suspect it will probably be a campaign rife with distortions about all kinds of things.”
Possible Republican primary landscape
The primary challenger threat from Trump and Braun, however, could be muted by the election cycle of senators who serve four-year terms.
Republicans now hold a 40-10 majority in the Senate, with 22 Republican-held and three Democratic-held seats up for election in 2026. Of those 22 Republican senators:

12 have announced support for redistricting.
Six have indicated opposition, but two — Eric Bassler of Washington and Greg Walker of Columbus — were already not seeking reelection next year.
Four haven’t announced stances on redistricting — Dan Dernulc of Highland, Greg Goode of Terre Haute, Rick Niemeyer of Lowell and Linda Rogers of Granger.

Senate President Pro Tem Rodric Bray, the principal target of Trump’s ire this past week, won a new term last year and his seat isn’t up for election again until 2028. Trump went so far as to label Bray “a Complete and Total RINO” — for “Republican in name only.”
Buck, a senator from Kokomo since 2008, has an announced challenger in Tipton County Commissioner Tracey Powell.
Powell maintained in a recent statement that redistricting was needed “to ensure that every voice in our state is heard and properly represented. Senator Buck has not been supportive of President Trump.”
Buck did not return a message seeking comment this week, but said in an August interview that he believed redistricting was unnecessary.
Sen. Kyle Walker is the other announced Republican redistricting foe up for reelection in 2026. Walker, however, represents one of the state’s few politically close state Senate districts, covering the northeastern corner of Indianapolis and the Fishers area in Hamilton County. He won the 2022 election with 55% of the vote. 
Beckwith says Senate ‘slapped’ Braun
Redistricting supporters want Indiana lawmakers to craft a map with all nine of the state’s congressional districts favoring Republicans. Those would be based on 2020 census data, like the current maps.

Those were drawn by Republicans in 2021 and maintained a 7-2 GOP majority — with Democrat Frank Mrvan holding the 1st District in northwestern Indiana and Democrat André Carson holding the 7th District, which covers much of Indianapolis.
Trump started the national redistricting fight by pushing Texas Republicans to redraw its congressional map this summer. The pressure on Indiana Republicans has included trips in August and October by Vice President JD Vance to Indianapolis.
Beckwith, who has had a contentious relationship with Braun as lieutenant governor, said he will be recruiting candidates to challenge incumbent senators after Bray “slapped” Braun in the face with last week’s announcement that the Senate wouldn’t take up redistricting in December.
“I was very offended by that. That was really uncalled for,” Beckwith told the Capital Chronicle. “I think that’s kind of what sparked it for me. I was like, ‘OK, if that’s what the Senate thinks of our governor, then we need a new Senate.’”
Beckwith presides over Senate sessions as lieutenant governor, but he has clashed before with the chamber’s GOP members. That included bashing “some squish senators” for scaling back Braun’s proposed property tax overhaul earlier this year.
Beckwith said he believes Trump’s political organization and groups allied with the president would provide financial backing and other campaign support for the primary challengers.
“We’re going to make people recognize, hey if you’re going to keep to the seat, you’re going to have to spend a lot of money to do it,” Beckwith said. “You’re going to have to work your butt off to do it.”
The campaign cash at play
Incumbent senators facing challengers can likely count on financial support from the Senate Republicans’ campaign committee, which ended last year with nearly $1.9 million in cash. It most certainly has more money now but an updated state Election Division report isn’t due until January.
Bray’s campaign fund, which can be shared with other candidates, had about $785,000 at the end of 2024.

Former Sen. Jim Merritt, who was a longtime member of the Republican leadership team before leaving the Senate in 2020, doubted the redistricting issue’s influence in the May 2026 legislative primary without Trump’s name on the ballot. 
“I think all the incumbents will be well funded. I think they’ll be able to raise money themselves,” Merritt said. “The Senate majority will back up these members who are with Senator Bray.”
Deery won his first term in 2022 after winning a four-way primary with 31% of the vote, with Copenhaver finishing third at 23%
Deery said he’s confident with his argument against mid-decade redistricting.
“I really find that strong conservatives understand that you don’t want to give the government a power that you wouldn’t want to give your worst political enemy,” he said. “What’s being suggested is that we give the power to establishment map makers, to choose their electorate before any election and not just once every 10 years. That is a power that should scare any conservative.”

Just like Jerry Maguire said way back in 1996, there’s an obvious conclusion brewing in Indiana’s redistricting fight: let’s stop trying to pin lawmakers down to vote for a fictitious map. Let’s put one on the table for everyone to see and debate.
This discussion has been going on for three months. At least 21 Republicans in the Indiana House and Senate have committed to voting yes on a map they either haven’t seen or is locked behind closed political doors. Others have come out against the very idea of redistricting mid-cycle, which would be unprecedented in Indiana.
But the majority are in the middle — taking the absolutely reasonable approach that they aren’t going to promise to vote for or against something they haven’t seen.
And for that reasonable approach, they are being attacked by President Donald Trump, who apparently has nothing better to do than threaten fellow Republicans in a flyover state with primary challengers.
“To this day, we have not seen a map we are being pressured to support. It’s probably in the desk drawer of some Washington, D.C. consultant,” said Sen. Sue Glick, R-LaGrange, this week.
Redistricting rift growing among Indiana Republicans

The national context is Trump is worried about the midterm elections, which historically result in big losses for the party in power. So, he is pushing Republican states to gerrymander their congressional maps to ensure the GOP picks up more seats.
So much for running on your accomplishments and letting voters judge you for your actions.
The Republican line of argument is that Democrats have gerrymandered current maps so badly it’s time for Republicans to do the same. If your son or daughter came to you and said kids in their class were cheating on tests and impacting the curve, would you tell them also to cheat?
It’s important to note that the maps in question — drawn by all 50 states after the 2020 census — have led to Republican majorities in the U.S. House in both 2022 and 2024.
Both sides lack integrity on the issue. Both sides should stick to their morals and values instead of abandoning them when power is at stake. And this also applies to Democrat-led states that have championed nonpartisan map-making only to reject that now. I’m talking to you, California.
Indiana lawmakers loved our 2021 maps. In fact, some of those now wanting a rewrite voted for them, or even helped create them. I have asked several legislators what is wrong with Indiana’s maps — and the answer is never about Indiana but other states.
The fight over redistricting is showing the best and worst of Hoosiers, depending on where you sit. It is tearing the Republican Party apart and could lead to a separation of powers fight as Gov. Mike Braun promises to find ways to “compel” senators to abide by his special session call.
Of course, he can’t “compel” them to vote the way he wants, but I do agree that the Senate has taken a dreadful approach by ignoring the governor’s constitutional right to call a special session. It’s a smack in the face of the highest order and I think is beneath what is supposed to be the more senior and respectful chamber of the General Assembly.
Whether you are for or against redistricting, showing up matters.
House Speaker Todd Huston says his caucus has the 51 votes necessary to move forward, and to keep the first two weeks of December clear — a wait-and-see approach. He could move the discussion forward by filing a proposed bill and map, holding hearings and voting.

(Photo courtesy of the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression)An Alloway school board member sued state Education Commissioner Kevin Dehmer and members of the School Ethics Commission, alleging they impermissibly limited her freedom of speech by interpreting a state ethics law to bar board members from discussing school matters with their constituents.
Gail Nazarene filed the lawsuit after another member of the Salem County township’s school board filed an ethics complaint over Nazarene’s Facebook posts that asked constituents’ opinions on school tax increases. The complaint alleged the posts had created confusion and concern among the public, and had “conveyed the impression that Ms. Nazarene was speaking on behalf of the Board without authorization.”
“I didn’t join the school board to be told to shut up,” Nazarene said in a statement. “New Jersey officials claim the authority to punish me simply for asking folks questions about important issues, particularly when it affects their wallets. I should be free to communicate with constituents and get their views without being censored by state officials.”
Voters first elected Nazarene to the Alloway school board in November 2024 for a term that ends in 2027.
New Jersey weighs biggest update of charter school rules in 30 years

The root of the dispute lies in the School Ethics Commission’s interpretation of the School Ethics Act. That law bars school board members from making promises on a school board’s behalf, requires that they keep confidential information private, and forces them to avoid conflicts of interest, among other things.
The law’s text does not explicitly bar individual school board members from discussing school matters with their constituents, but a 2022 advisory opinion issued by the commission says school board members who discuss school matters with stakeholders risk ethics violations even if they appended a disclaimer declaring their statements are theirs alone, and not the views of the board they sit on.
Even posting links to already public information could expose a board member to an ethics complaint, the advisory opinion says. School board members found in violation of the law could face sanctions ranging from a reprimand to removal from office.
A spokesperson for the Office of the Attorney General, which typically represents state bodies in court, did not return a request for comment. A Department of Education spokesman declined to comment.
One of Gail Nazarene’s Facebook posts that led to an ethics complaint being lodged against her.
Nazarene’s attorneys said that advisory opinion had impermissibly chilled her speech, noting she had stopped reaching out to constituents or commenting publicly for fear of sanctions, including on a school regionalization plan she fears will limit Alloway’s control over its schools.
“Americans deserve to know what their elected officials think about important issues,” said Daniel Zahn, an attorney at the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression, which is representing Nazarene. “New Jersey is muzzling elected officials and preventing them from talking with their community, the very people they were elected to represent.”
The state could face a high bar to maintain its limits on school board members’ speech. The commission’s interpretation of the law imposes a content-based speech restriction because it specifically targets statements related to schools, Nazarene’s attorneys argue.
Such restrictions draw the highest level of scrutiny, and the government must prove they are not unconstitutional.
To do so, the government must show a legitimate interest in limiting speech — perjury statutes that help ensure people tell the truth in court are constitutional, for example — and use the least restrictive methods available to achieve their end.
“The state has no compelling interest — and not even a legitimate interest — in prohibiting elected representatives from communicating with constituents,” Nazarene’s attorneys said in their complaint.
Nazarene’s attorneys asked the court to declare the commission’s interpretation of the School Ethics Act unconstitutional and requested injunctions to block the body from limiting speech under that interpretation.

For years, educators were often on their own when it came to helping students connect what they were learning in the classroom with where it might lead them in their careers.
Fortunately that’s changing, and November, designated as National Career Development Month, is a chance to commit to expanding career pathways in a more meaningful way – for our students, our workers, and our economy.
The stakes are high. Student test scores in Missouri remain below pre-pandemic levels, at the same time that technological advances like generative AI are threatening to upend the entry-level career pipeline. Succeeding in this more uncertain and dynamic future will demand greater resilience and flexibility than ever before.
A recent report issued by Gov. Mike Kehoe’s administration adds to the growing body of evidence that students need earlier and more meaningful career exploration to navigate this evolving economy. The DeBruce Foundation was privileged to be involved in this effort, which included input from experts, educators, business leaders, students and parents.
The final report issued this fall outlines a roadmap for improving career and technical education delivery systems in Missouri.
One major takeaway: Missourians overwhelmingly support career education — and want more of it. In a survey conducted in partnership with the Missouri Department of Secondary Education and the University of Central Missouri, 92.3 percent of Missourians expressed support for career and technical education (CTE), and more than 90% saw it as a pathway to higher education.
More good news came from business leaders, who also expressed a favorable view of CTE skills, as well as students, who the report found are generally aware of college credit transfer from CTE programs.
But room for improvement remains. One key priority: improve access to career exploration for elementary and middle school students, particularly in rural areas. The DeBruce Foundation’s own research backs this up, showing that students don’t consider enough career paths, and need earlier and more frequent exposure to career literacy skills.
The good news is that career literacy is gaining steam here in Missouri and across the country. Students in 1,480 school districts in all 50 states have used The Debruce Foundation’s free K-12 resources, designed to help students at the elementary through high school levels discover their work-related strengths and interests in ways that broaden their sense of what’s possible.
The foundation is also partnering with states like Maryland and Indiana to support career exploration in schools and embed career counseling tools and resources directly into local workforce centers, ensuring that individuals of all ages can access meaningful guidance and opportunity.
Our recent annual employment empowerment event featured powerful stories from Missouri and Kansas school districts leading the way in career literacy, including Blue Springs, Joplin, and Piper. Teachers in each district, across grade levels, are using our Agilities framework to help students identify their strengths and interests, and how those connect with the world of work.
The truth is, preparing students for empowered careers will take all of us.
For educators and counselors: Use this month to assess your career-exploration practices, and make sure you are helping students discover their strengths in ways that broaden their horizons, rather than limiting or labeling them. Ask: How can we encourage students to consider more career paths and understand the importance of network strength?
For employers and industries: Partner with schools and workforce centers — especially in rural communities — to help build career-literate workforce pipelines.
The Alliance for Healthcare Education in Springfield and the Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation’s initiative for Real World Learning in Kansas City are examples of successful collaborations that can and should be replicated. Employers should also take a hard look at their hiring practices: research shows that people may be well-suited for jobs that seem vastly different from the job they do today.
So now is a great time to assess your openness to applicants from nontraditional backgrounds and varied experiences.
For policymakers and funders: make career literacy a priority this month — and every month. The Governor’s Workforce Report recommends making DESE’s regional career advisor roles full-time, rather than part-time and hiring nine new advisors to focus specifically on the K-4 grade levels. It also suggests that the state develop a K-12 career exploration toolkit and website.
These are smart investments that will yield long-term returns for our communities and our economy.
Missouri’s economic future will depend on how well people can move through change, not just into the jobs that exist today, but toward the opportunities that emerge tomorrow. Here in Missouri, the playbook is clearer thanks to the leadership behind the Workforce of the Future Challenge Report and ready-to-use career exploration tools, like those developed by The DeBruce Foundation and offered at no charge as part of our charitable mission.
This month, National Career Development Month, let’s turn intention into initiative. Let’s elevate career development from a checkbox to a coordinated, statewide strategy. And let’s empower every young Missourian and adult learner to name their strengths, claim their path, and thrive.",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/student-loans-debt-money-roll-mortarboard-getty-1536x1200-1-e1726143026313-1024x614.jpg,,,2025-11-21 06:57:35.722883

(Photo by Baylor Spears)When Jacob Diener first heard that the status of hemp could be reviewed, he wasn’t too concerned. With his company, A Good Plug, the 32-year-old expected to continue producing small batch hemp products like gummies, brownies, and cheesecakes. 
“It seems around this time it happens every year that they want to re-assess the Farm Bill,” Diener told the Wisconsin Examiner. But 2025 was different and Diener, like others across the industry, was caught off guard when what amounted to a prohibition on his livelihood was discreetly attached to a deal to end the longest government shutdown in U.S. history. “It’s just weird and scary,” he said. 
Hemp businesses were allowed to flourish after the passage of the 2018 Farm Bill, which legalized the production and distribution of hemp products with no more than 0.3% THC on a dry weight basis. But under new rules that were included in the stopgap spending bill ending the federal government shutdown last week, products must contain no more than 0.4 milligrams of THC per container.

Steve Hampton, owner of the Eau Claire-based company Steve’s Hemp, says that standard is biologically impossible to meet. “[The] hemp plant struggles to grow to meet that guideline before it’s even harvested,” Hampton told the Wisconsin Examiner. “So, we’re seeing upwards to 99% of the industry get wiped out from this.” 
THC is the primary psychoactive compound in the cannabis plant. Although hemp and the psychoactive variety commonly known as marijuana are the same plant species, they have different chemical compositions. Many cannabis varieties are cultivated with high levels of THC for markets in states where the plant has been legalized medical or recreational. 
Hemp, with far lower concentrations of THC, is mostly used for rope, paper and industrial products. It is also offered in states that do not have legal cannabis markets as an alternative — a source for  products containing delta-9 THC, THCa, THCp and other derivatives. 
The law reopening the government, however, effectively bans those products and gives the industry until next November to adapt or fizzle out. Erin Kelly, owner of the Wauwatosa-based hemp goods store Kelly’s Greens, told TMJ4 that even CBD products contain trace amounts of THC which make them effective medicine, and that the new rules would render that medicine ineffective. Wisconsin’s hemp industry is estimated to be valued at $700 million and accounts for at least 3,500 jobs, according to the Wisconsin State Journal. 
“Everybody’s frantic, you know, we’re all worried,” Hampton told the Examiner. Without an amendment to the new rules or legislative intervention, Hampton says the nation’s $28.4 billion hemp industry won’t survive, and that most of his own store’s inventory would be banned. 
More than just a cash crop
When he was a teenager in Fond du Lac, Diener was introduced to cannabis through his grandmother, who used it to manage her pain and chronic illnesses. He began using it to help with his stress and the early signs of Crohn’s disease he was experiencing
After years of working in the restaurant industry, Diener realized he wanted more out of life. “And so I started to get permission from my chef to start making candy in the kitchen behind the scenes, just learning the basics, but with the intentions that I wanted to make infused candy, gummy worms, stuff like that,” he said. “Stuff that I didn’t see on the market at the time.”
Hampton also became involved in hemp after experiencing the medicinal value of the plant. “I was a college student at the time,” he said, “and was looking for some relief with some back pain, some sore muscles from the gym. And my dad had actually bought me some CBD oil to test out for my birthday. And it was from a local farm up here in northern Wisconsin. That helped me a ton with what I needed it for.”

Hampton realized that there were not many such products marketed to younger people like him. He grew his business online before opening a storefront during Small Business Week in 2021. Today Hampton, 29, owns and operates his business alongside his wife and five employees. People of all ages come into his store. “In-store, we have a lot of customers who come in just looking for relief,” he said. Many of the customers are seeking a remedy for anxiety, as well as “a large handful of customers that have chronic pain,” he said. 
Steve’s Hemp carries flowers, vapes, gummies, candies, topical ointments and other products. Diener, who specializes in culinary cannabis products, makes everything from Nerds-covered gummies (a popular product he calls “Stoney Bites”) to other sweets. Diener describes his customers as “such a community of oddballs and people who have unique personalities. And that’s what I’ve always hoped for, and that’s kind of what I come from and who I am a person. People authentic to themselves.” 
The cost of  prohibition
Before the federal ban on THC-derived hemp products was added to the bill to reopen the government, Republican lawmakers in Wisconsin were already working on bills to restrict or prohibit the industry in the state. Representatives Lindee Brill (R-Sheboygan Falls), Jim Piwowarczyk (R-Hubertus) and others introduced what they called “a common-sense corrective bill” to close the “loophole” that allowed what they called “dangerous, psychoactive THC-laced products to proliferate in Wisconsin.” 
The lawmakers pointed to health advisory warnings issued by federal agencies about the use of delta-9 THC, and issues with unregulated markets across the country. In Wisconsin, hemp products from CBD to delta-9, HHH, THCa, and others can either be found at dispensaries where employees are often knowledgeable about their products, or at gas stations and smoke shops where customers don’t receive information and guidance. Wisconsin lawmakers have raised an alarm about emergency room visits and poison center calls linked to delta-8 THC and similar compounds, as well as concerns that children could easily purchase the products.

Hemp business owners say they often applaud common sense regulation. They also support fully legalizing cannabis in Wisconsin —  ending prohibition. To address concerns about health consequences and children’s access to cannabis, “what would really help that is regulation, not prohibition,” Hampton said.
Everything from clear packaging guidelines to age restrictions, lab testing and education about where the product comes from and what it does could be part of a legal regulatory structure, Hampton argued. Rather than allowing any gas station to carry hemp products, Hampton would like to see licensed facilities staffed by people who care about what they’re doing. “Our main goal with this business was to educate our customers, and know what’s in our product, and recommend what would work best for our customer,” he said. 
One 2024 study analyzing national poison data systems found that between 2021 and 2022, reports of exposure to delta-8 THC increased by 79%. The study also found that poison center calls for delta-8 were significantly lower in places where either delta-THC was banned, or where cannabis use was already legalized. “Consistent regulation of delta-THC across all states should be adopted,” the study recommended. Other poison center data shows that since 2022, exposures to delta-8 THC have plummeted, a trend which has continued into 2025. 
Prohibition also creates economic stagnation,  advocates contend. Tim Frey, of Ignite Dispensary and Cigar calls it “Wisconsin’s half a billion dollar loss.”
Frey lobbied against state Republican bills to restrict hemp, and he argues that hundreds of millions are essentially handed over to Michigan and Illinois every year when Wisconsinites make the sometimes difficult decision to travel across state lines to obtain cannabis. 
“Now that Minnesota is opening up, with the largest border, we’re probably going to be losing approximately up to $200 million,” Frey told Wisconsin Examiner. “And then if they came up with a small tax on hemp-derived stuff, that’s easily $100 million there, if not more, give or take. So it’s going to be around half a billion dollars that Wisconsin could use to give to law enforcement, get fentanyl off our streets, reduce property taxes, invest in roads” and other uses.

Hampton fears that now customers will go to the black market or risk being pulled over after driving to a neighboring state. “I just don’t understand why they thought that prohibition would be the right answer,” he said. 
As some Wisconsin legislators are working to enact a new prohibition on hemp products, others are trying to legalize medicinal THC cannabis in the state. Earlier this year, two-thirds of registered voters polled by Marquette Law School said that cannabis should be legalized in Wisconsin. Meanwhile, Republican lawmakers have introduced what would be one of the country’s most restrictive medicinal cannabis programs. 
Frey is cautious of the medical-cannabis-only approach, however, “because it’s very hard to qualify with some ailments,” he told the Wisconsin Examiner. He added that if Wisconsin passed a restrictive medical cannabis program, then it would open the door for the state’s indigenous tribal communities, as sovereign nations, to open their own recreational programs. “So then we would be a recreational state without the control, or the revenue,” he said.  
Diener said that when conservative lawmakers talk about cannabis, they sound at least 10 years behind the times. “I think that right now there’s such extreme viewpoints on it that are outdated, and really just don’t line up with today’s market or today’s values with the plant,” he said.
Frey believes that it’s past time Wisconsin had a serious discussion about legalization. “Limit the licenses,” he declared. “Control this, tax it, get licenses out there to responsible people that are going to do things the right way —  that card people, that do truth-in labeling, that care about the quality of their products.”
In addition to strict regulation, Diener said parents can protect their children from hemp products instead of the government banning them. “You have the responsibility just the same as if you have a gun in the home to keep your things in a safe space that your children cannot access,” Diener said. “You wouldn’t have your alcohol bottle sitting just, like, within reach or in a cupboard that your kids know they can access. Even growing up as a teen, when my mom knew that I was starting to go to parties and stuff, she would start to hide her alcohol.” 
After the federal hemp laws were changed, Piwowarczyk, in a television interview, said unsympathetically of hemp business owners that “you guys took a gamble when you decided to open up your hemp business.” 
Hampton counters that lawmakers like Piwowarczyk should “open their eyes, and look around, and actually meet with the constituents of their districts” who are the consumers driving the industry. 
Uneasy months ahead
For now, hemp distributors and their allies have until next November to adjust to the new federal restrictions. Frey said Wisconsin could provide some protection for the industry by enacting its own regulations for hemp products, similar to the way states have legalized cannabis industries despite the ongoing federal prohibition. 
There are already state-level legislative responses in the works, he said. One bill, AB 503, would redefine the definition of hemp to prohibit THC-derived products. Another, AB 606, would add hemp to the responsibilities of the agency in the Department of Revenue that regulates alcohol. A bill authored by Senate Democrats, SB 644, would create a regulated framework and age limits for hemp products, though it lacks Republican co-sponsors. Sen. Patrick Testin (R-Stevens Point) is circulating a draft bill for co-sponsorship that also regulates hemp products.

“That bill is probably the best, most common-sense written bill that I’ve seen,” Frey told the Wisconsin Examiner. While the Democratic bill would be promising, he said, he thinks it won’t gain Republican support. 
“It’s more crucial to protect this industry in Wisconsin than it is to craft the most perfect bill,” said Frey, adding that he thinks the hemp industry will get behind Testin’s bill “full force”. 
At the same time, however, Frey wonders whether the federal regulations will change by next November. He points out that the new law gives the industry a year to adapt instead of imposing a ban immediately. 
Frey thinks that if Wisconsin passes hemp regulations but the federal laws remain the same, then the hemp industry would risk losing its federal task deductions and also lose the ability to conduct interstate commerce. 
If there is no change to save the hemp industry, a cascade of effects will ripple out. Earlier this year, Hampton  opened a new manufacturing facility just down the street from the Steve’s Hemp storefront. In the middle of next year, he will likely have to close that as well, he said. 
Once the new law takes effect, “our hands are pretty much tied,” said Hampton. “My wife and I will have to find new jobs for each other, continue to make ends meet. And then those families that work for us — those employees that work for us — will have to do the same.” Until then, Diener said, “I am going to continue to serve the people who need us the most and work to continue growing this dream and keeping this dream alive.” 
Hampton and his employees “are obsessed and passionate about this industry,” Hampton said. “We started this industry with hopes to run a legal dispensary out of Wisconsin, and hopefully transition into that. Now that plan is crushed. And so we don’t know what we’re going to do. We’re just going to try to keep our hopes up, and try to fight as much as we can to keep [hemp] legal, and if that isn’t possible, get recreational cannabis pushed through the state of Wisconsin.”

Critics warn the congressional action may have unintended consequences.
The post Congress advances effort to overturn Biden-era coal leasing ban in Wyoming appeared first on WyoFile .","Wyoming’s congressional delegation this week celebrated a major step toward invalidating the U.S. Bureau of Land Management’s Biden-era ban on new federal coal leasing in northeast Wyoming — home to one of the largest coal deposits and the most productive coal mines in North America.
But whether the effort will result in any new, major coal leases in the region is in doubt, and the congressional method to overturn the ban has infuriated conservation groups across the West who say it’s part of a larger GOP effort to upend decades of careful compromise to achieve “multiple use” on public lands.
Joint Resolution 130, introduced in October by U.S. Rep. Harriet Hageman and Sens. Cynthia Lummis and John Barrasso, passed the U.S. House and Senate this week. The measure would overturn the ban by employing the rarely used Congressional Review Act to invalidate the BLM’s Buffalo Field Office Resource Management Plan, which was updated in December.
Under the Biden administration, the BLM suggested the ban would have little impact on the flagging industry, which primarily provides fuel to the nation’s aging fleet of coal-fired power plants, noting coal mines in the region already have legal access to enough reserves to continue mining at the same pace beyond 2040.

But both Wyoming’s all-Republican congressional delegation and the Trump administration have pointed to unprecedented electrical demands for artificial intelligence and other data computations. 
“The Biden administration’s relentless war on American energy was waged at every level, including in Wyoming’s Powder River Basin, where it halted coal leasing,” Hageman wrote Tuesday on the social media platform X. “Passing H.J. Res. 130 will restore our national energy dominance, protect Wyoming jobs and prosperity and reassert Congress’s authority over an unchecked administrative state.”
Despite a bullish outlook and moderate upticks for the industry in recent months, a test run to resume leasing federal coal in the Powder River Basin failed — some say spectacularly — in October. The BLM received a single bid for a coal tract in the Montana portion of the Powder River Basin for an unprecedented fraction of a penny per ton of coal. Days later, the agency indefinitely postponed another coal lease auction on the Wyoming side of the basin.

“It’s a sham,” Lynne Huskinson said of the notion that the Powder River Basin coal industry is being held back by the Biden-era leasing ban.
Huskinson worked for decades as a Powder River Basin coal miner in Wyoming and serves as chair of the Sheridan-based landowner advocacy group Powder River Basin Resource Council. The $186,000 bid that Navajo Transitional Energy Company offered for the 167 million-ton federal coal tract in Montana was so low that it might not have even covered “a big repair on one of their motor graders,” she asserted.
Congress is using the CRA to override previously approved management plans elsewhere in the West. Because these plans are shaped by a formal public comment process, conservation groups say overriding them flies in the face of local input about how to best manage America’s public lands. It may even invalidate other uses permitted under BLM resource management plans, such as grazing and oil and gas leases, some conservation groups say.
“Senators heard one consistent message today: Multiple-use is hard,” Center for Western Priorities Policy Director Rachael Hamby said in a statement Thursday. “Finding the balance happens on the ground, with the residents, scientists and small-business owners who know the land the best. That’s why it’s so foolish for Congress to use a blunt instrument like the Congressional Review Act to impose land management decisions from Washington.”
Gov. Mark Gordon cheered the effort to overturn the “misguided” coal leasing ban, noting the potentially long-lasting implications of using the review act. 
“When signed by the President, this action ensures that no future federal administration can authorize the large-scale termination of coal leasing in the area,” Gordon said in a prepared statement.

A red-tailed hawk at the Teton Raptor Center takes his name from the family that once ranched the land.
The post Jackson Hole’s avian ambassadors appeared first on WyoFile .","At the Teton Raptor Center in Wilson, staffers say Hardeman, an 11-year-old red-tailed hawk, has an all-too-familiar story.
A car struck the male raptor in 2017 and blinded his right eye. After being rescued and treated at the Alabama Wildlife Center, he failed a live-prey test, a requisite for release into the wild.
So he became an ambassador at the Teton Raptor Center, where he loves flight training and shredding newspapers.
The hawk’s name comes from the Hardeman family, which for decades operated the Hardeman Ranch in Wilson. The landmark Hardeman Barn is a centerpiece on the Raptor Center’s campus, where visitors can see displays and hear scientists lecture in the renovated hay loft.
Hardeman was one of three ambassadors at a recent Masters of the Sky lecture. Horous, a peregrine falcon, and Aura, a turkey vulture, completed the cast.
Horous takes the name of an Egyptian god usually depicted as a falcon. He is a retired hunting falcon who also likes shredding newspapers.
Aura, a turkey vulture, came to the center after people unintentionally imprinted on her. Named through a community contest, her moniker derives from the scientific label Cathartes aura, roughly translated to “cleansing breeze” and referencing her species’ role in cleaning up carcasses.
The Raptor Center, a nonprofit focused on education, research and conservation, offers a suite of public programs. The center has conducted groundbreaking migratory research on red-tailed hawks and other birds.
It launched the international Poo-Poo Project that protects owls from entrapment in pit-toilet chimneys. Center scientists this spring mapped 1,019 raptor nests in the Converse County oil and gas field, a long-term monitoring effort that will also reveal the impacts of wind energy development.The center’s Sporting Lead-Free initiative seeks to educate hunters about the benefits of using non-lead ammunition.

Wyoming needs to live up to the Cowboy Code by taking care of our own and doing what has to be done to ensure our neighbors have stable housing, writes guest columnist Kirsten Prosenick.
The post Homelessness isn’t just an urban problem appeared first on WyoFile .","As a state that prides itself on “equality,” we, as Wyomingites, must ask: Can resources be accessed equally? To understand why many Wyoming families are struggling, start with housing. Rising rents and shrinking resources show that hard work alone can no longer keep pace. These growing challenges have led to increased homelessness, yet stigma frames it as a personal shortcoming instead of a focus on policy breakdown. That narrative contradicts the Cowboy Code’s spirit — where we “take care of our own” and “do what has to be done” by confronting problems head-on, such as homelessness and an inadequate social safety net. 

Opinion

To put this into perspective, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development estimated that in 2024, Wyoming had the highest rate of unaccompanied youth in the country (20%), and further reported over 500 individuals experiencing homelessness at that time. But advocates warn those numbers are likely low, because HUD does a point-in-time count of people staying at shelters, transitional housing programs, or places not meant for habitation, like their cars. What about those who fall into homelessness after that count or who are crashing on a friend’s floor. The problem could be worse than it seems. So, what does this mean for our future? Without a real understanding of the problem, homelessness rates are likely to increase and affordable housing is likely to be less of a priority.
The image of homelessness is often people living on the street in densely populated cities, which leaves the struggles of rural states hidden in plain sight. And as HUD points out, places like Wyoming are up against unique barriers; there are too few shelters, limited social services and resources spread thin across vast distances.
Additionally, homelessness in Wyoming is driven by multiple, overlapping pressures: high rents that outweigh wages, a shortage of affordable housing, and challenges such as mental health struggles and substance use. These hardships are only intensified by Wyoming’s brutal winters, which make life on the streets not just difficult but dangerous. According to Wyoming’s Administration and Information, rental costs in 2024 increased to more than $1,000 a month, which is a complex barrier for anyone earning Wyoming’s minimum wage. Yet cultural and political resistance to raising wages persists, often framed as a matter of personal responsibility. The truth is when full-time work can’t cover the basics, the problem isn’t personal failure — it’s a fixed system that refuses to match up with the cost of living. 
Addressing the homelessness crisis requires a multidimensional, prolonged approach, but with consistency and integration, it is a manageable task. 
First, promoting access to affordable housing is essential. Programs such as the Wyoming Community Development Authority and Housing First have proven effective for some Wyoming towns. Those programs could expand to benefit the homeless population statewide. 
Second, raising awareness and increasing funding for mental health services and addiction treatment is also extremely significant. The key here is to understand that while these services may be available, they may not be affordable. According to the National Alliance on Mental Illness, in 2021, there were 20,000 Wyoming locals who did not receive appropriate mental health care; 52.6% of this population did not seek care due to the cost. Keep in mind, these services aim to promote safety and stability within society. 
Lastly, collaboration with the state of Wyoming’s governing officials, nonprofit organizations and local advocates could help promote inclusivity and build a uniform understanding of the seriousness of such social problems.
Equally important, Wyoming must confront the stigma surrounding homelessness and start advocating policy change rather than isolation and marginalization. By investing in sustainable solutions and standing with those struggling, the Equality State could live up to its name in more than words, and more importantly, exemplify human decency toward those who are struggling.

A hallway in La Follette High School in Madison. (Wisconsin Examiner photo)Initial special education reimbursement payments to school districts this year will be about 35% of their costs — about 7 percentage points below the estimated rate approved in the state budget.
When the 2025-27 state budget was passed by the state Legislature and signed by Gov. Tony Evers in July, policymakers boasted that their investments would bring the special education reimbursement rate to a historic 42% in the first year of the budget and 45% in the second year. 
While school districts will still receive more aid for special education costs this year than in previous state budgets, it appears that the state funding set aside probably won’t be enough to reach the rate that was estimated when the budget was signed in July.
The Department of Public Instruction (DPI) announced in a bulletin on Monday that initial special education payments for November through March would reimburse schools 35% of their special education costs. While DPI uses a slightly lower rate to avoid overpayment and this is not the final reimbursement rate, Chris Bucher, DPI director of communications, said in an email that the agency has anticipated the rate falling below the estimate.
Special education reimbursement rates for public school districts can vary from the estimate because it is a sum certain allocation, meaning that payments come from a fixed pot of money.
During the budget process, public education advocates, DPI and Gov. Tony Evers called for that to change to a sum sufficient allocation, meaning that the amount of money provided by the state would be enough to meet the set reimbursement rate. Republican lawmakers rejected the request.
Bucher said having a lower reimbursement rate than what is estimated has been relatively typical with budgets, given that there is a fixed amount of state funding as well as a rising amount of unaided special education costs and a rising number of students with disabilities.
According to a Legislative Fiscal Bureau memo released Thursday, in 2024-25 the state had appropriated about $574 million to special education aid. When the 2023-25 state budget was passed, the appropriation was estimated to bring schools to a 33.3% rate in each year of the budget. In November 2024, DPI estimated a rate of 29.16%, and the final rate for that school year was 30.64%.
Based on cost increases in recent years, DPI projected costs would grow by 4% for its 2025-27 state budget request. It had estimated that aidable costs would be about $1.8 billion in 2025-26 and $1.9 billion in 2026-27. Those estimates were also used as Evers prepared his budget request and as the Legislature prepared the budget. 
According to the new memo, DPI now projects that aidable costs in 2024-25 increased by an estimated 9% — a rate more than twice the original projection when the 2025-27 budget was being drafted.
For the 2025-27 state budget, the DPI requested about $2 billion across the biennium to cover special education costs for school at a rate of 90% by the second year of the budget and to change the funding from “sum certain” to “sum sufficient.”
Gov. Tony Evers also requested the change from sum certain to sum sufficient, though he requested increasing it to a 60% rate by the second year. The Joint Committee on Finance denied those requests instead choosing to provide $207 million in the first year of the budget to cover an estimated 42% of costs and $297 million in the second year to cover costs at an estimated rate of 45%.
Advocates called attention to the reimbursement rate in statements this week, saying the funding system needs an overhaul.
Peggy Wirtz-Olsen, president of the Wisconsin Education Association Council, the state’s largest teachers union, blamed the rate on lawmakers, saying that they “turned their backs on our most vulnerable children, failing to deliver on promised special education funding and leaving our students without the supports they need to succeed in school.” 
“This shortfall will mean even more communities forced into holding school referendums in 2026 just to meet basic needs, causing uncertainty and hardship for students who deserve better from their elected leaders,” Wirtz-Olsen said in a statement. 
Wirtz-Olsen said lawmakers have been “caught lying about the scant resources they are providing.” 
“It’s time for these politicians to fix Wisconsin’s school funding formula and fulfill what the state Constitution requires,” she said. “Taxpayers have had enough of picking up the tab on our property taxes to make up for their refusal to fund schools. If they won’t take action for the students who most need help, educators and families will.” 
Beth Swedeen, executive director of the Wisconsin Board for People with Developmental Disabilities, called on the state to change the way it funds school districts. 
“It’s time to build a budget that is rooted in real costs and can provide budget certainty to schools and parents that the promises made by the legislature will translate into real dollars schools can use,” Swedeen said in a statement. “We should not be in this position cycle after cycle where students with disabilities and schools are undercut by accounting codes.”

The latest round of cuts by Magellan of Idaho would affect peer support specialists who help people navigate mental health treatment, and specialized mobile teams that treat patients with severe mental illness who have struggled in routine treatment settings. The cuts, which call to end the services on Dec. 1, stem from the state’s attempts to avoid a projected budget shortfall.
Mental health providers worry the cuts could spur more violent critical incidents as people with severe mental health issues lose accessible treatment, said Laura Scuri, who co-owns Access Behavioral Health Services in Boise and leads the Idaho Association of Community Providers’ behavioral health subgroup.
“We don’t see that with people who are in treatment, any even low-level treatment,” Scuri told the Idaho Capital Sun in an interview. “It’s the people who are not in treatment, who cannot engage in treatment. Those are the people that eventually become so psychotic that they engage and there’s a critical incident for the community.”

 Program cuts come as state attempts to avoid projected budget shortfall

After the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare cut pay rates by 4% for Medicaid medical providers and for private companies that run Medicaid benefits, which are called managed care organizations, Magellan announced plans to cut pay rates for Medicaid mental health services by 4-15%.
‘This perfect storm:’ How Idaho Medicaid cuts could affect everyone’s health care access

In a statement, Magellan Health spokesperson Kristen Durocher said the contractor doesn’t have many options for cuts. 
“Magellan understands and supports the State of Idaho in carrying out actions required to balance the state budget as required by the Idaho Constitution,” she said. “Given the limited available levers to reach budget targets, Magellan has worked with (the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare) to identify changes to optional programs that are allowable under the law. We will continue to partner with the state, providers, and members as we all navigate the changes before us.”
For the past two months, Health and Welfare has been working with managed care organizations to find ways to cut spending in their contracts, agency spokesperson AJ McWhorter said in a statement.
“The department and Magellan agree that there are no easy options to achieve the needed budget reductions,” he said. 
The state is planning to extend 4% Medicaid provider pay rate cuts for another year — after Idaho Gov. Brad Little permanently extended budget cuts. 
Even after the cuts, budget estimates released last week show the state is still on track to end this fiscal year in June 2026 with a $58.3 million budget deficit, the Idaho Capital Sun reported. Idaho’s revenues have dwindled the first few months of this fiscal year, months after the Legislature and Gov. Little approved $450 million in tax cuts.
The programs are likely being cut because there’s many services that Magellan “legally can’t touch,” Scuri said. 
“We have a constitutional requirement to balance that budget. And they walked out of there without that budget balanced last year. And this is the result of that,” she said. 
 What are the programs being cut?

One of the services Magellan is cutting is a program to treat patients with persistent, severe mental health issues who have struggled in traditional treatment options.
Through the program, called Assertive Community Treatment, doctors and nurses visit patients in their homes to help them stay on medication. By cutting the program, the state is shifting costs to jails and psychiatric hospitals, which are more expensive, said Tom Tueller, clinical director for Tueller Counseling Service in eastern Idaho, which runs a local team of providers on the program.

About 400 to 500 people across the state are on the program, he said. Many of them will end up homeless if the program ends, he said.
“It might cut the pot of money for the (Department of) Health and Welfare. But it’s going to add huge amounts of money to the hospitals and the jail systems, because that’s where these people are going to end up,” he told the Idaho Capital Sun in an interview. 
It could also risk more violent episodes in the community, Tueller said. 
In 2010, the man accused of shooting Ryan Mitchell in Pocatello was receiving treatment through the program — until it faced cuts, Tueller said. 
Mitchell was visiting a local coffee shop when a 54-year-old man with schizophrenia shot him at point-blank range in the back, the Inlander reported.
Mitchell survived, with several severe medical complications. A month later, he asked political candidates at a public forum why he got shot, the weekly newspaper reported.
“The fact of the matter is this was caused by recent budget cuts to our mental health program. My question is … What are you going to do to fix it?” Mitchell said, according to the Inlander. 
With Magellan’s move to end the program, Tuller said “we’re going to have more victims out there like Ryan Mitchell.”

Magellan also plans to cut peer support services, a program in which people recovering from mental illness help support people throughout treatment. 
Executive Director of the National Alliance on Mental Illness Idaho Beth Markley said the cuts will be devastating. 
In rural areas, she said some of the state’s hundreds of peer support specialists drive hundreds of miles each month to meet people.
“There’s just no replacement for the service,” Markley said in an interview. “I feel very strongly that this is like somebody just went down a spreadsheet and started crossing lines off until they got to the required cuts — and didn’t take a look at like, ‘What is the most efficient use of taxpayer money for the results that you get?’”
Some substance abuse rehabilitation providers are also facing a cut from Magellan: They can’t do programming in the same buildings they offer sober housing in.
The cuts — on top of the recent pay cuts announced earlier — are unlike anything providers have seen, said Jason Coombs, founder of Brick House Recovery, a substance abuse treatment center in Boise and Idaho Falls.
“Our rates are going down, the cost of hiring and salaries is going up. And it’s scary times. I wouldn’t be surprised to see some treatment providers fold up, and minimizing access to care over these changes,” Coombs said.

This week the Trump administration, with the most corrupt cabinet in the nation’s history, moved to gut the Endangered Species Act while the world is experiencing what’s been called the “Sixth Mass Extinction Event” with more than a million species facing extinction from human-caused impacts.  
Since Montana retains virtually all of the species that were here when Lewis and Clark’s expedition rolled through more than 200 years ago, it’s particularly bad news. A number of those native species already listed as threatened or endangered could now face extinction – which would leave our state much diminished simply to favor extractive industries.
This is nothing new from a president and administration that seem to live in the past.  But inexorably denying the ever-worsening climate crisis and the fact that you cannot infinitely exploit finite resources for the demands of continuous growth does not make it reality. 
The changes would leave species listed as threatened exempt from any “blanket” protections and require formulation of extensive species-specific plans that could drag out for years, perhaps outliving the species they were supposed to be protecting and restoring. 
Likewise, although the Endangered Species Act didn’t mention “climate change” specifically, the new rules would intentionally deny consideration of the impacts from the radically changing climate that are occurring far faster than previously predicted and across a much larger spectrum of land, sea and air. 
As is so despicably common for this administration, the “favors” would be handed out to specific industries. For instance, changing the definition of “harm,” which means “altering or destroying” habitat essential to a specie’s survival, could allow mining, logging, and oil and gas exploration and development in what is currently considered “critical habitat.”
None of this is good news for the environment, our already pounded native species, or the future of Montana or the nation.  
Moreover, most of it makes no sense at all. 
Gutting the Endangered Species Act to enable more production is the last thing the oil and gas industry needs since there’s already an “oversupply” of oil and gas – and that’s coming from OPEC, the industry, and Wall Street.  Projections are for $55 per barrel oil or lower, which is barely above the break even point for exploration and development and surely not worth forcing species to extinction to open more critical land and water habitat to oil and gas production.
Of course the administration will face immediate legal challenges, including the fact that the Supreme Court has already ruled that considering “harm” to habitat is part and parcel of the goal of the Endangered Species Act.  
Ironically, Trump’s Supreme Court may have already hamstrung the changes in its ruling that overthrew the Chevron v. Natural Resources Defense Council decision – namely, that government agencies should not be given broad deference in the formulation or enactment of administrative rules that go beyond the limits and specific language of the enabling laws.  While the decision was descried by environmentalists and conservationists when the decision was handed down because they thought government agencies would be on their side, it will now likely limit what Trump’s administration can do — when government isn’t on your side. 
Rest assured, this will engender a legal battle in the coming years as well as driving some of Montana’s struggling native species to extinction.  Adding insult to that injury, it’s worth noting that Bozeman’s Property and Environment Research Center and Missoula’s Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation have already gone to court in support of the changes – and should be held fully accountable for the ensuing damages they will inflict on Montana’s threatened and endangered native species.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Yellowstone-National-Park-Grizzly-bears-1024x621.jpg,,,2025-11-21 16:57:58.666732

(Photo courtesy of UFO)A Kanawha Valley organization that typically distributes food to a dozen area pantries during the winter months will start that work early this year in response to increased need. 
United Food Operations, an organization founded in 1981 by representatives of West Virginia labor unions, will partner with South Charleston plastics manufacturer Covestro to make an emergency food distribution to its 12 participating pantries on Friday morning at its Institute warehouse. 
The organization usually contributes to 12 independent food pantries in Kanawha and Putnam counties beginning each January through April.
“Because the need is extraordinary — the economy is worsening and food and utility prices keep rising — we felt this is urgent,” UFO Chair Elaine Harris said in a news release. “Once again, our sponsors and volunteers are stepping up to take action.”
Harris said Covestro reached out to UFO with the idea to do an emergency distribution.
Earlier this month, the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, which helps feed more than 275,000 West Virginians, was delayed two weeks during the federal government shutdown that also left thousands of federal workers in the state without a paycheck. The state of West Virginia contributed about $13 million to West Virginia food banks during the delay to help meet the increase in demand. 
Harris said the organization’s contribution to food pantries is not as big as it once was because the cost of food has increased. 
“We had volunteers down there [Thursday] morning putting the food on the pallets. And I’ll tell you, food on the pallets doesn’t look as great as it once did because of the cost of food,” Harris said. “So we’re getting it out. The pallets aren’t as high as I’d like for them to be. But we’re doing what we can do.”
United Food Operations was founded more than 40 years ago by union representatives under the West Virginia ALF-CIO umbrella. The organization is run by volunteers on voluntary contributions from employees and employers, area businesses and government. 
People can contribute to the organization at its website, unitedfoodoperation.org or by mail at Post Office Box 20441, Charleston, W.Va. 25362. Through Dec. 1, all locations of Green’s Feed and Seed are collecting food items for the organizations as well.
“There’s different ways that people can give, and if people want to volunteer, we love volunteers,” Harris said. “Our organization is 100% volunteer[-run]. Everything we bring in goes back out. Any money, it goes back out in the form of food, or if people want to donate food.”

John Rose took a dig at U.S. Sen. Marsha Blackburn, his opponent in the 2026 Repubian gubernatorial primary, over a clause she sponsored in a federal government funding measure. (Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)Tennessee gubernatorial candidate U.S. Rep. John Rose is taking a dig at the frontrunner, Sen. Marsha Blackburn, with a bill passed to keep senators from suing the feds for half-a-million bucks.
Rose, a Cookeville Republican, said in an X post Nov. 12, that the Senate sneaked a “poison pill” into the government funding measure enabling senators whose phone records were searched without their knowledge in the investigation of the Jan. 6, 2021 Capitol riot to file suit for $500,000 each.
“This is exactly why Americans despise Washington,” Rose said.
He added that it was “wrong” for the Department of Justice under former President Joe Biden to target Republicans over the Jan. 6 incident. “But that doesn’t make it right for any senator to cash in retroactively at taxpayers’ expense,” he said.
WBIR reported that Rose filed legislation to block the measure and that Blackburn planned to sue the government. The House approved a repeal this week, but the Senate isn’t expected to vote on it.
Blackburn was one of eight U.S. senators, including Sen. Bill Hagerty of Tennessee, who had their phone records accessed without notification when special counsel Jack Smith investigated the attack on the U.S. Capitol.
Asked for comment this week, Blackburn spokesperson Joey Chester pointed the Lookout to a post she made Nov. 13 on X, formerly Twitter, saying, “I support the effort to repeal the Arctic Frost provision in the government funding bill.” The name refers to the Department of Justice investigation into the riot.
“As I have said previously, this fight is not about the money. It is about holding the left accountable for the worst weaponization of government in our nation’s history.”
Asked whether Blackburn initially planned to use the new provision to sue the government over phone records, Chester declined to answer.
But Blackburn told Just the News, a conservative news site, she is planning to sue the Department of Justice and FBI for invasion of her free speech and privacy rights as a member of Congress. The move wouldn’t conflict with her opposition to the Arctic Frost provision, which allows the senators to seek monetary damages. 
Hagerty and Blackburn, who changed their stances five years ago and voted to certify Biden’s election after the Jan. 6 riot, called it a “shocking day of lawlessness” in which she and her colleagues “watched in horror as rioters breached the security of both Houses of Congress and inflicted significant property damage upon those historical halls.”
In a joint statement, they said the nation would “rise above the chaos” that took place at the Capitol. 
In March, Blackburn also said those who defended the Capitol should be recognized for heroism. Several Capitol law enforcement officers died as a result of the insurrection, one that day and four others who later committed suicide.
Yet Blackburn has said nothing about President Trump’s move to pardon those who stormed the building. Trump also went on a pardoning binge in recent weeks, letting former Tennessee House Speaker Glen Casada and his ex-chief of staff, Cade Cothren, off the hook for corruption convictions, keeping them from serving prison time.
Another Republican gubernatorial candidate, state Rep. Monty Fritts of Kingston, said he agrees with Blackburn that the Jan. 6 probe was a “horrible weaponization” of the federal government.
“But I think it was a horrible thing by those senators who put that language in that they could enrich themselves at the expense of the U.S. citizen because of the misdeeds of the Department of Justice,” Fritts said.
Sen. Lindsey Graham is the only one who said he would take advantage of the provision, though the others signed on. Fritts said he was glad to hear Blackburn and Hagerty won’t.
“Surely to goodness, they don’t need $500,000 of our money,” he said.
Don’t call me Shirley.
Saving a grassy cross
Longshot gubernatorial candidate Fritts appears to have saved a grassy cross cut into a Kingston interstate median by persuading the state not to mow it.
Kingston personnel had been cutting off-ramp exit medians along I-40 and left what Fritts described as a “discreet” cross in the landscape. Someone complained about it, and the Department of Transportation was about to cut the grass until city officials told them they didn’t want it mowed, according to Fritts.
The Kingston Republican recently posted a video on X, formerly Twitter, calling the state mowing plan the sign of a “godless” mind-set.
State Rep. Monty Fritts, a Kingston Republican and candidate for governor, raised concerns the state might mow a cross cut into the grass of a state median.
“After wiser minds came together, I think they realized they didn’t have any business doing that,” Fritts said. 
Fritts contended the cross is offensive only to “people who are lost” spiritually.
The candidate said a “centralized and overreaching” state government in Nashville is becoming “more and more like D.C.” and that one person with the Transportation Department told him the cross was comparable to graffiti spray-painted on bridges.
A spokesperson for the Department of Transportation, which is responsible for mowing interstate medians, did not respond this week to questions about the matter.
Figures didn’t add up
The Tennessee Registry of Election Finance is inviting former Franklin mayoral candidate Gabrielle Hanson to a January hearing to explain discrepancies in her campaign finance reports.
Hanson, who caused a stir by inviting a white supremacist group to intimidate people at a Franklin City Council meeting, is supposed to tell the Registry board why some of her reports from 2023 didn’t quite add up. 
The Registry initially referred the matter to the Williamson County District Attorney’s Office after Peggy Kingsbury of Franklin filed a sworn complaint alleging Hanson’s reports contained inaccurate information.
An investigation found campaign receipts and a personal loan totaling $132,753 on her reports but that her campaign expenditures, including repayment of a personal loan, totaled $158,830. That would have left her campaign nearly $27,000 in the red, but the reports showed a final balance of $73,363, according to documents.
Franklin official Gabrielle Hanson appears to launch mayor campaign sans legal filings

A Williamson County Election Commission official told the DA’s investigator the report Hanson filed was a “mess,” with white-out all over it. The campaign insisted on using paper, instead of filing online. Another staffer advised that the numbers didn’t compute.
Hanson appointed herself as treasurer in July 2023, which is allowable but can pose problems with documenting financials while campaigning, an investigator reported. Her attorney told the DA’s investigator that nobody would serve as her treasurer after her alleged connection to white nationalists was reported.
Other reports from January and March 2024, which weren’t filed with the state until July 2024 showed a forgiven loan balance at $18,810. But because of the sworn complaint, an accountant’s review and the “discovery of monies” that weren’t noted as received, a final report was amended and showed the forgiven loan balance as $49,197.
The Registry board, which also can be forgiving if folks throw themselves prostrate and beg for mercy, could levy a civil penalty against Hanson. But more than likely, all will be forgiven, only a waste of her money.
More late filings
Five years after paying a $22,000 settlement fee to the Registry for multiple shortcomings, state Rep. Joe Towns is set to appear again before the campaign finance watchdog to explain why his filings are late again.
Say it ain’t so, Joe: Rep. Joe Towns, a Memphis Democrat, is late for a second time filing his campaign finance disclosures. (Photo: Tennessee General Assembly)
Towns, a veteran Memphis Democrat, was fortunate in that the board agreed to reduce penalties totaling $66,000 when it voted via email to cut him some slack in April 2020, as the COVID pandemic hit. 
That came after Bill Young took over as executive director of the Bureau of Ethics and Campaign Finance and despite Towns’ declaration that he wouldn’t pay one more “copper cent” to the Registry. Towns described himself as the “prodigal son” coming home when he made his case to the Registry board that spring.
Yet he’ll have to pay a $250 civil penalty for a late filing from 2024, and he faces hearings for two other discrepancies.
Five years ago, Towns said he was protesting what he felt were heavy-handed decisions by the Registry board. It’s not clear why his filings are coming up late once more, though he said earlier this year he’d been short on staff after his longtime assistant left. He didn’t respond to a phone call or text message.

(Photo by Ariel Skelley/Getty Images)Rural Idahoans enjoy a distinct way of life. One benefit is living in a tight-knit community while also enjoying the freedom to easily access the open space around you. This lifestyle can also mean going without things you have access to in a bigger town, but health care should not be one of them. As we celebrate National Rural Health Day, let’s support and protect the hospitals that serve our rural communities. 
Twenty-seven of Idaho’s community hospitals serve rural areas, but all 51 of them treat rural patients. Half of our rural hospitals operate with razor thin margins of less than 1%. They strive to maintain crucial services, including behavioral health and maternity care. 
Those services are difficult to maintain in rural communities and are often the first to be cut when finances get tight. The recent decision to reduce provider payments by 4% for treating Medicaid patients will add to the financial vulnerability small hospitals experience. While other states experience hospital closures, Idaho has managed to combine strong fiscal stewardship with innovative solutions to avoid a devasting outcome.
Hospitals do not close without warning, but some warning lights are flashing in Idaho. About 98.2% of Idaho is designated as a Primary Care Health Professional Shortage Area, affecting 57.8% of the state’s population. Idaho ranks last in the nation for physicians per 100,000 residents, and we are well below the national standard for the number of registered nurses needed for our size. 
Shortages create barriers to health care, particularly in rural communities. Lack of health care professionals adds to the pressure on hospitals.
Without a local hospital, Idahoans are forced to travel further to receive care. This means delayed emergency services and added expense and travel time. Communities like Salmon, home to the most remote hospital in the lower 48 states, would suffer devastating effects if Steele Memorial Medical Center was forced to close. 
Benefits of a strong hospital are not limited to patient care; it also impacts the economic well-being of a community. They provide valuable jobs, make purchases from local businesses, and generate millions in local and state tax revenue. Today, rural hospitals employ over 8,000 Idahoans, and our communities would not thrive without them.
Health care providers are facing more cuts, including those in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. However, OBBBA also dedicated funding to rural health programs. 
U.S. Sen. Mike Crapo, R-Idaho, and chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, acknowledged the situation with a statement that explained, “Rural hospitals have faced ongoing issues for many years, including low patient volumes, inadequate workforces, crumbling infrastructure, outdated technology and changing reimbursement trends. The fiscal vulnerabilities they face are multifaceted and often unique to each facility. The $50 billion rural hospital fund is intended to provide immediate relief to rural hospitals while allowing facilities to establish the tools necessary to be successful in the long term.” 
Idaho seeking $1 billion in federal funds for rural health care from ‘One Big Beautiful Bill’ 

The state of Idaho has submitted a request for those rural health funds. By Dec. 31, we will know how much federal funding has been approved for programs in our state. Then, Idaho legislators will vote to decide whether to allow that federal money to flow through to our rural communities. 
Idahoans who rely on a strong health care system should urge to get that money out the door as quickly as possible and into the areas where it’s needed.
Many express their love of our uniquely Idaho way of life. Rural health care is a vital part of that life. Now is the time to dedicate the resources needed to preserve it.

Jared Polis in May 2019.
Democrats enacted the law, which required employers to list pay ranges for all job openings and to maintain detailed records of their pay rates, over the objections of the Colorado Chamber of Commerce and a long list of business groups, who argued that the new burdens on employers would end up hurting the workers the bill was intended to help.
But six years later, there’s no evidence that those unintended negative consequences have come to pass in Colorado, a new working paper released this week by the National Bureau of Economic Research found. On the contrary, the study suggests positive “spillover” effects have led to across-the-board wage increases for Colorado workers.

“Overall, we find evidence that pay transparency in postings increased competition in the labor market, leading to positive impacts on wages even for incumbent workers and firms that were always posting wages, neither of which were directly targeted by the policy,” wrote the study’s authors, economists David Arnold, Simon Quach and Bledi Taska.
The study examined self-reported earnings and quarterly federal wage data from the two-year period surrounding the law’s effective date of Jan. 1, 2021. Both data sets show that worker pay rose 1.3% higher in Colorado when compared to other states.
Those positive effects for employees occurred despite the fact that compliance with the law isn’t universal; the NBER study found the percentage of job postings disclosing salary data rose from 35% to 70% in the year following implementation. More recent analyses have estimated that 1 in 5 job postings in Colorado are still noncompliant with the law.
The vast majority of complaints about violations of the transparency law are resolved through voluntary compliance letters, according to Colorado Department of Labor and Employment data. In 10 cases, CDLE has issued citations that included fines against employers, including a $298,000 fine against DaVita this year and a $79,500 fine against Lockheed Martin in 2022.

– Authors of a study of Colorado's pay transparency law


The Colorado law, one of the first of its kind in the nation, made headlines after it went into effect in 2021, when The Wall Street Journal reported on a number of large national employers who were seeking remote workers but excluding applicants from Colorado. Conservative pundits seized on those reports as an example of big government and liberal do-gooderism making things worse.
“Many employers are avoiding hiring Coloradans altogether,” wrote Ben Murrey of the Independence Institute in a 2021 op-ed. “Rather than helping women in the workforce, the law is disqualifying them from certain jobs entirely and creating a new equal pay of $0.00 per hour for the Colorado workers — men and women — who are missing out on good jobs.”

Business groups have continued to lobby for changes in the law. In 2023, the conservative Common Sense Institute listed SB-85 among the labor and employment policies that were harming the state’s growth and competitiveness.
But the NBER paper, which analyzed a comprehensive data set of job postings from labor market analytics firm Lightcast, found no impact on the overall number of jobs posted in Colorado from 2020 to 2021. Nor did it find evidence that employers changed requirements pertaining to education, skills or experience in their job postings to offset the increase in wages.
“Extending to all policy changes in our study period, we similarly find no impact on aggregate employment measured in the (quarterly wage data),” the study says. “As a result, the pay transparency laws do not appear to have any negative impacts on employment.”
Finally, the paper addresses concerns that employers may be avoiding complying with the law’s intent by posting excessively wide salary ranges — increasing “pay dispersion.” There’s no evidence that pay dispersion increased in Colorado in the year following SB-85’s implementation, the authors found.
“We find that employers are not posting wider salary ranges in their vacancies,” they wrote. “The policy does not decrease the informativeness of job postings.”

(Getty Images stock photo)State officials recently prioritized reducing wait times for calls into Louisiana’s child abuse hotline, but achieving that resulted in hundreds of reports to its online portal going unhandled for days. 
They included “Priority 1” incidents, involving serious risk or harm that require immediate investigation from the Department of Children and Family Services. Those should be handled within 24 hours, but some sat for up to six days before supervisors assigned them to hotline staff. 
“At this point, we’re really jeopardizing the safety of children, and I feel like the public needs to know what’s happening here because that’s completely unsafe,” said Melanie Mann, one of the roughly 50 DCFS employees who staff the hotline. She said she has turned in her resignation, effective Dec. 1, after six years with the agency.

Interviews with other centralized intake staffers confirm Mann’s account of online reports piling up through the first half of November. The employees asked not to be identified because they fear repercussions at work. 
Emails and direct messages shared with the Illuminator lay out details of the decision to place online reports on the back burner and the scramble that followed to shrink the stack. 
As of Wednesday morning, the online portal backlog had been cleared. Hotline staffers were required to work overtime to accomplish the task. 
State Sen. Regina Barrow, D-Baton Rouge, has been among the more prominent voices calling for improvements in the state’s child welfare system. In an interview Thursday at the State Capitol, she said she was still gathering information on the extent of issues with the DCFS hotline and its backlog.
The senator said she has been monitoring a restructuring of the department its leaders launched last month that started with the centralized intake team.
“We are concerned about what’s happening with our children, with our babies, and the response,” Barrow said. “The restructure of the department: What does that really look like? I mean, I don’t think we have a really good handle on what that looks like and what the delivery outcomes are.”
Mann said there was never a specific directive from DCFS leadership for the hotline staff not to handle online reports during their shifts, but she said the lack of personnel and emphasis on handling calls made it inevitable that the digital portal would be neglected. 
Supervisors have to assign intake workers reports from the online portal, and they were told earlier this month they could not dole out any reports when call wait times were over five minutes. Mann and others said the hotline has been down for hours multiple days this month, including a 12-hour stretch on Nov. 9. Once the hotline was restored, the staff had to reach out to people who tried to dial in while also fielding new calls. 
This left minimal time for supervisors to assign backlogged reports to the staff during their shifts, which was no longer an option once department leadership decided Nov. 13 the backlog would only be handled through overtime. But even when the hotline was working, some staffers said hours would go by without a call, and supervisors would still not assign them online reports. 
Officials with Children and Family Services did not respond to an interview request made Monday, nor have they provided answers to questions about the backlog and hotline sent in emails. A reporter was instructed to make a public records request after asking for details Wednesday on how many neglected backlogged online reports had high priority status.    
The department did issue a news release Wednesday afternoon, saying it “has not directed staff to prioritize one reporting method over another.”
Employee interviews and internal communication shared with a reporter refute that claim, with staffers explicitly being told as recently as Tuesday they could not start working on backlogged portal reports until their shifts were over.

Who uses the online portal and why
The hotline is supposed to be the first option for the public to report suspected child abuse, along with law enforcement when a situation needs immediate intervention. 
The DCFS online portal was set up for mandatory reporters, which include first responders, hospital staff, daycare workers and others who frequently interact with children. Depending on the nature of the abuse, they are required to contact police or the Department of Children and Family Services — and in many instances both must be notified. 
See a list of reporting requirements below
Online reporting is also a preferred option for individuals who aren’t comfortable sharing sensitive, graphic details about child abuse with someone over the phone, Mann said.
Mandatory reporters are urged to call the DCFS hotline first when they feel a child is in imminent danger, but Mann said many of them turn to the online portal when they can’t get through. 
“No one’s going to sit on the phone for two hours and hope that they’ll get someone to answer the phone,” Mann said, adding that she typically sees three or four online reports during each a normal 8.5-hour shift that involve children who face imminent risk. Her colleagues shared comparable numbers. 
Hotline staffers said leadership set a goal earlier his month for calls to its child abuse hotline to be answered in under 5 minutes. Children and Family Services did not respond to questions about the average wait time. 
Louisiana child welfare agency shuffle raises questions over abuse hotline staffing

The most recent state audit from fiscal year 2022 found the average was just under seven minutes with nearly 1,200 calls abandoned each month when people chose not to wait. That was 16% of the more than 6,300 calls made monthly.  
Last week, the hotline staff was asked to volunteer for overtime to tackle the online portal backlog, though they could only be compensated with paid time off, rather than extra pay, according to DCFS emails. Overtime became mandatory Monday after the volunteer approach didn’t eliminate the backlog.  
Questions about the backlog from the news media also put pressure on DCFS leaders to devote more after-hours manpower to the task, Mann said.  
“Failure to comply could lead to a recommendation for disciplinary action,” a DCFS manager wrote in an email to the centralized intake staff. The potential consequences include termination, according to state civil service guidelines. 
Because the abuse hotline is staffed around the clock, it meant workers had to log extra hours well into the night and early morning  working on online reports. Some staffers said they had no advance notice of the required overtime, leaving them little time to arrange care for their children. 
Supervisors were also required to clear 10 reports after the end of their shift, which Mann said is the equivalent of five hours of work. They were expected to work 24 hours straight if necessary, she said.   
“I believe that was a cover-up for [leadership’s] poor decision-making,” Mann said.
State Rep. Stephanie Berrault, R-Slidell, sits on the Louisiana House Select Committee on Women and Children and the chamber’s health committee, both of which handle matters pertaining to child welfare. In an interview Thursday, she said she was aware of efforts being made to improve the DCFS abuse report intake process.  
“Sometimes in transition, transition can look a little messy,” Berrault said. “But we are all closely following to make sure that where we’re going is going to get us to a place where we’re better responding to any reports, whether that’s through a portal or on phone. We are all very concerned to make sure that that’s all being addressed.”

Backlog cleared, for now
The online portal backlog had surpassed 350 reports as of Nov. 13 when staffers were asked to volunteer for overtime. As of 10 a.m. Monday, there were 218 online reports that had yet to be assigned, leading to the mandatory overtime directive.
The backlog was around 100 late Tuesday afternoon when a DCFS manager sent a direct message to the intake staff telling them to notify her when their shift was over so she could assign them reports from the backlog. One hotline worker asked if they could process portal reports if they completed all their tasks before the end of their shift.
“You cannot begin your portals in your No ACD time,” the manager responded, referring to the last 30 minutes of a shift when workers don’t have to answer calls so they can complete required administrative tasks.
The backlog was eliminated as of 7 a.m. Wednesday, according to hotline staffers. The department’s news release in the afternoon said the same, adding there was “no wait time to speak with an agent.”
“I want to publicly thank the many hotline professionals who continue to take calls, process reports, and support their colleagues,” DCFS Secretary Rebecca Harris said in the statement. “Their commitment reflects the mission of this department.”
Mann said responsibility for the online portal backlog lies squarely with Harris and DCFS Assistant Secretary Bret Hanemann, who are restructuring centralized intake. Its staff is currently composed of remote workers, nearly all of whom will have to report to regional DCFS offices next month when they will likely be assigned to jobs handling cases in the field. The department is currently hiring to help staff a call center at the department’s offices in downtown Baton Rouge. These new employees will answer hotline calls and receive online reports.
Just because the backlog has been whittled down does not mean it won’t happen again, according to Mann, who predicted the reorganization and recent policy changes will adversely affect staffing at the department.
“They come in, they make these demands, they don’t understand what meeting those demands will entail, and the result is tragedy for children,” Mann said.

(Photo by Leila Navidi/Star Tribune)This story was first published by ProPublica in collaboration with the Star Tribune. It contains graphic descriptions of sexual abuse.
The girl pleaded not to go.
She fought with her father on the drive over, screaming and crying in his truck until they arrived at the office building for Bruckelmyer Brothers, a home construction company on the outskirts of Duluth, Minnesota. She was just entering her first years of grade school.
In the office, two men were waiting. One of them was Clint Massie, who the girl had recently told her parents had touched her genitals and groped her under her shirt. The other was Daryl Bruckelmyer, a preacher and leader of the Old Apostolic Lutheran Church down the road, where the girl’s family worshipped. Massie was a respected member of the congregation. Bruckelmyer had asked them all to the meeting, according to the girl’s account to police years later.
In front of the girl, her father and Bruckelmyer, Massie asked her for forgiveness. Looming over her, the three men wept. Then the girl’s dad and preacher allowed the man who had been sexually abusing her since kindergarten to hug her.
“It was one of the worst things ever,” she told police some 15 years later.
In accordance with one of the core tenets of their church, the matter was resolved. It was forgiven. It should now be forgotten. If she spoke of it again, she would be guilty of having an unforgiving heart and the sins would become hers.
But she could never forget. And neither could the other children.
Over the course of about 20 years in two states, Massie had, according to court documents and by his own admission, sexually abused children within the Old Apostolic Lutheran Church, or OALC, community. He touched girls under blankets when their parents were present, in the backseat of a car with other passengers — even in the pews at church. His abuse was such an open secret among the tight-knit congregation that mothers warned their daughters to stay away from him.
Some former victims, as adults, confronted preachers, including Bruckelmyer, about what Massie had done to them. Church leaders told Massie to stay away from the congregation’s children, and they sent him to a therapist who specialized in sex offender treatment.
But they never reported Massie’s crimes to police, as required by the law. Instead, Bruckelmyer and other leaders in the church encouraged the victims to take part in forgiveness sessions — which allowed Massie, now 50, to continue abusing children, according to an investigation by the Minnesota Star Tribune and ProPublica.

Massie did not respond to requests for comment but has denied abuse allegations relating to some individual victims in pending lawsuits. In December 2024, he pleaded guilty to four counts of felony criminal sexual conduct with victims under the age of 13. In March, a judge sentenced him to 7 1/2 years in prison. Church officials, including Bruckelmyer, were not charged in connection with Massie’s crime, but prosecutors said they should have done more to stop him.
“It gives the appearance of a group of people who are not just trying to protect someone — but something,” Mike Ryan, the St. Louis County assistant district attorney who prosecuted Massie, said at his sentencing. “And they have enabled something awful here.”
Law enforcement there first became aware of the allegations against Massie in 2017. They said that the church’s lack of cooperation — including pressuring potential witnesses and victims to stay quiet about the abuse and preachers failing to report it to authorities — was a major factor in the delay in bringing charges.
Bruckelmyer declined to comment or to answer a detailed list of questions. But in a 2023 interview with a St. Louis County detective, he acknowledged knowing about Massie’s sexual abuse and didn’t dispute that he took part in forgiveness sessions involving Massie and his victims.
He said it was up to the victims to report the crimes to police, a clear misreading of the law for mandated reporters — doctors, teachers and others who are required to report crimes against children.
“We don’t protect either one,” Bruckelmyer said of sexual abusers and their victims.
Bruckelmyer also told police his actions followed church protocol. An internal church document, obtained by the Star Tribune and ProPublica, suggests that, when appropriate, church leaders and others facilitate “a conversation with both parties together” — an action that experts who work with abuse victims say can add to a victim’s trauma. While the document praises the police and the justice system, it doesn’t mention mandatory reporting laws and gives preachers wide latitude on whether to involve police.

Kimberly Lowe, a lawyer and crisis manager for the church, said its preachers are unpaid and therefore might not be legally required to report sexual abuse of children. Asked if she believes the preachers are mandated reporters under Minnesota law, Lowe would only say that the language of the statute is unclear.
Bruckelmyer’s church, Woodland Park, is one of two OALC congregations north of Duluth, in the bluff region above Lake Superior. Some members live nearby, in a rural, forest-lined community. Members are not obviously identifiable by their clothing — they dress modestly but modernly, in muted colors and long skirts. Women do not wear makeup, jewelry or open-toed shoes and they keep their hair up in a bun, giving rise to the nickname “bunners.” According to church literature, members are to live simple, modest lives like Jesus did; television, music and dancing are seen as sinful, according to former members.
On a recent Sunday, the modern, unadorned sanctuary of the Woodland Park church, which seats 1,000, was full of families, parents soothing babbling and crying infants, older children clutching baggies of candy or toy cars.
At the close of the sermon, the preacher asked the entire congregation for forgiveness, which kicked off “movements” — a portion of the service when congregants embraced and begged one another for forgiveness for various sins, frequently in tears.
OALC is a conservative Christian revival movement that came to the U.S. with 19th-century settlers from Norway, Finland and Sweden, and it is not affiliated with any mainstream Lutheran denominations. There is no official count, but one academic study estimated 31,000 members worldwide as of 2016, with most in the United States. The church is rapidly growing, experts say, and the member count today is likely much higher. OALC’s emphasis on large families has created booms in places like Washington state and Duluth.
There are 33 OALC churches in the U.S. and Canada. Only men hold leadership positions. The less formal nature of OALC structure — a spokesperson said there’s no headquarters in the U.S. — means that, unlike sexual abuse scandals in the Catholic Church or Southern Baptist Convention, there’s no central authority to hold accountable. Still, news of the criminal case against Massie spread widely in the insular OALC, inspiring more victims to come forward in Minnesota and other states.
St. Louis County investigators say they have been contacted by current and former church members in South Dakota and Washington who allege they were victims of sexual abuse that was never reported to law enforcement. The Star Tribune and ProPublica have interviewed more than a dozen alleged victims of Massie and of other church members in Wyoming, Maryland and Michigan.
By forgiving men like Massie, prosecutors and police said, preachers created a situation where the alleged victims had to worship next to their alleged abusers — and allowed Massie to escape arrest and prosecution for years.
“He was so brazen about it — and there was so little done about it — that he thought it was permission,” Ryan said.

‘Church knows’ 
For the girl who said she was pressured to forgive Massie at Bruckelmyer’s office, the silence that followed only compounded her trauma. She reported struggling with debilitating anxiety and obsessive-compulsive disorder in her teens. She grew tense every time she walked into the church, especially when she saw Massie holding another little girl.
“I lived in darkness for so many years of my life because I couldn’t talk about it,” the girl said in a recorded interview with police. “Multiple times in my life I wanted to die.”
When she was 16 and in counseling, she told her therapist how Massie had abused her. The therapist reported it to the police, which is how the St. Louis County Sheriff’s Office in Duluth first learned about Massie in summer 2017.
Sgt. Jessica LaBore was the investigator assigned to the case. In a recorded interview, the girl reluctantly told LaBore how she used to sit with Massie and his wife, Sarah, at church, just a few rows from the front. Massie would snake his hands up her skirt and touch her thighs and genitals. Another time, at a gathering at the home of her parents’ friends, she said, Massie told her to get a blanket and began touching her underneath it, with her mom and dad nearby.
She told LaBore that she’d reported the abuse to a preacher, Calvin Raisanen, and that her mother had spoken to Bruckelmyer about it, according to police documents and a recording of the interview obtained through a public records request. Raisanen did not respond to requests for comment. In her own conversation with LaBore, the girl’s mother confirmed that Massie had asked forgiveness from her husband and daughter years ago.
Like some victims in the records from Massie’s case, she declined to speak to reporters for this story and is not being identified because the news organizations typically don’t name victims of sex crimes without their consent.
In an email to reporters, she wrote that she is still a member of the church and feels supported by its community: “I truly believe I’m in the right place.”
St. Louis County’s case against Massie cites victims’ descriptions of the church’s “forgive and forget” practice. (Obtained by the Star Tribune and ProPublica. Highlighted by ProPublica.)
When LaBore interviewed Massie, he confirmed some important details about the allegations: Bruckelmyer was aware that several girls had accused Massie of sexual abuse. And he remembered asking for forgiveness at his preacher’s business office.
LaBore did not respond to requests for comment, but police reports show that the girl’s family stopped cooperating with the investigation. The mother told her that preachers at the church had spoken to Massie and that he’d “learned his lesson,” though the mother believed that Massie had “continued to sexually assault children after this point,” according to LaBore’s notes.
LaBore referred the case for charges to Deputy St. Louis County Attorney Jon Holets. In a statement to the Star Tribune and ProPublica, Holets said he also spoke to the victim’s mother, who informed him “that there had been therapeutic intervention, that ‘they were good’” and that her daughter did not want anything more to be done. Without the girl’s cooperation, Holets said he decided he could not bring charges against Massie, an outcome he said gives him “heartache” to this day.
Three years later, Massie again came to the attention of the sheriff’s office. Two crime-reporting hotlines received anonymous tips saying Massie had sexually assaulted “little girls” over the course of three decades. “Church knows but no action,” reads a police summary of one of the tips.
This time, LaBore went to Bruckelmyer. According to her notes, Bruckelmyer said the church encourages abuse victims to go to police, but he told her he believed it was “on them to do that.”
LaBore explained the state’s mandated reporting law to Bruckelmyer and told him that he and others at the church could be charged criminally if “somebody that they already know about” were to keep abusing children and they failed to report it.
“We are finding out from our investigations that these Mandated Reports are not being made, and instead, these incidents are being dealt with within the church,” she wrote in a departmental memo to update other detectives. “Sometimes the preachers are facilitating in the asking for forgiveness.”
For the second time, Holets decided not to bring charges, though this time it was about church preachers rather than Massie. In a statement to reporters, Holets said law enforcement decided to try to “educate” church leaders about their legal responsibility to report the sexual abuse of children.
“I believed it was more effective to work with existing leadership to influence practices and attitudes regarding child abuse reporting, rather than to pursue criminal enforcement at that stage,” Holets wrote. “That said, criminal charges for failure to report remain a possibility in such cases.”
When LaBore spoke to Bruckelmyer, she read him the entire mandated reporter law over the phone, line by line, then texted it to him.
Haunted by silence
In 2023, a call to police breathed new life into the case.
A woman told police that she’d been sexually abused repeatedly as a kid. Her abuser was a relative: Clint Massie.
The case landed on the desk of Sgt. Adam Kleffman of the St. Louis County Sheriff’s Office. He interviewed the victim and listened to the different ways the woman said Massie sexually abused her: the nights when she slept over after helping tend to his horses, the day when she rode a tractor with him, or swam with him and other members of her family at the lake.
Her mom had reported Massie to a preacher when she was a child, she told Kleffman. At the time, the preacher promised to handle it, she said, and told her mother never to speak of it again, not even to her husband. Later, she went through a session with Bruckelmyer, similar to the other girl, where she was pressured to forgive Massie and forget the abuse.
As an adult, she was alarmed to see Massie in church, hugging and kissing children about the same age she was when the abuse began, which is why she’d felt a duty to report it all these years later, she said.
“I went back to the same preacher, which is Daryl [Bruckelmyer], and said, ‘Why is he still able to hold kids and whatever?’” she recalled to Kleffman in a recorded interview. “And he’s like: ‘I don’t know. Like, we’ve told him that he’s not supposed to, but he still does.’”
Kleffman picked up where LaBore left off and contacted the girl who spoke to their office in 2017. She was now in her early 20s, married, a new mom living in Washington state. In a recorded conversation, she told Kleffman that the trauma — and in particular, the mandate that she remain silent about it — still haunted her.
Though the woman had tried to put time and distance between herself and Massie, Massie’s wife, Sarah, had asked for a meeting about a year earlier when the woman returned to Duluth for a visit. At a Starbucks, she said, Sarah Massie told her that the abuse was no big deal and she needed to forget about what happened. The conversation, the woman said, was “horrible.”
Sarah Massie declined to comment for this story.
The woman agreed to be part of the police investigation but told Kleffman that she had little faith it would go anywhere. It did not, after all, go anywhere last time.
“I can tell you,” Kleffman said, “you should have lots of faith in me.”
The investigator now had two victims. They gave him the names of others they suspected had also been abused by Massie. Kleffman tried to contact them, but some were reluctant to cooperate. One woman told Kleffman that Massie had asked for forgiveness. The sin, she said in the recorded call, was “washed away in the blood of reconciliation.”
“It is gone forever,” she told Kleffman.
“So you’re following what the church says to do,” Kleffman replied.
“I am following what God says to do,” the woman told him, before hanging up.

‘There could be hundreds’ 
On Feb. 10, 2023, Massie sat opposite Kleffman and Investigator Tony McTavish in a beige, windowless room at the sheriff’s office in Duluth. In a video of the interrogation, Massie downplayed the allegations as a series of accidents and misunderstandings. But as the 90-minute interrogation progressed, his demeanor shifted. He admitted he’d felt a “tinge” of a “sick, perverted thing” when, he claimed, one very young girl had pulled his hand to her vagina before he realized what was happening.
“I’m a lustful man, sure,” he said, but he denied he touched girls on purpose. “Strike me dead right now if I’m lying to you. I was not trying to touch her sexually.”
“I call bullshit on that,” Kleffman said.
Massie told Kleffman and McTavish that Bruckelmyer had spoken to him “at least” three times about inappropriate behavior with children. The investigators asked how many more girls might come forward with stories about him touching or kissing them.
“I mean, there could be hundreds,” Massie said.
Five days later, Bruckelmyer walked into the same interview room with Raisanen, another preacher at the church.
Bruckelmyer, now 68, is described as a kind but domineering force in the church, a father of at least 12 who worked in construction.
Unlike in other branches of Christianity, OALC preachers like Bruckelmyer do not attend traditional seminaries or receive formal training before assuming their leadership roles. Instead, according to a church spokesperson, they are selected by the congregation.
Their advice is seen as coming directly from God, according to several former church members.
In a video recording of the police interview, Bruckelmyer and Raisanen joked quietly with one another before Kleffman and Sgt. Eric Sathers, another investigator, entered the room.
“Do you know what the mandated reporting laws are in the state of Minnesota?” Kleffman asked.
“We have looked at them some, but it’s hard for us to interpret everything,” Bruckelmyer replied.
“Have you ever been told about them?” the officer asked.
“No,” Bruckelmyer said.
Kleffman said he knew that wasn’t true and brought up the 2020 call with LaBore. “I just listened to the audio recording, and it was line-for-line. You said you understood what they were,” Kleffman said.
“We felt, unless it’s changed, that as a part of the church that we keep silent,” Bruckelmyer said.

Kleffman and Sathers explained that if someone like Massie confessed to Bruckelmyer one-on-one, that would constitute a protected conversation with clergy. But hearing directly from the victims, from parents of victims or about abuse allegations in a group setting was another matter entirely.
Bruckelmyer and Raisanen claimed ignorance of the legal distinction and thanked the officers for the “clarification.” Bruckelmyer asked what became of the 2017 investigation into Massie. “I mean, it should have been taken care of then, you know?” the preacher said. “It’s like, what happened?”
Kleffman reminded him that a decade before that, the girl’s parents had come forward to Bruckelmyer and was told to forgive Massie.
“Nothing was done by you,” Kleffman said. “So in that meantime, she is not being protected while Clint is still scot-free doing what he’s been doing for 15 years.”
“I see,” Bruckelmyer said quietly.
“You’re just keeping a pedophile in your church,” Kleffman said.
Both Bruckelmyer and Raisanen confirmed they’d known about the girl from the 2017 report, and Bruckelmyer said he knew of two others as well. He expressed his eagerness to cooperate with law enforcement moving forward but denied knowledge of any other victims beyond the three.
Bruckelmyer and Raisanen left the St. Louis County Sheriff’s Department office without facing any consequences. John Hiivala, a spokesperson for the Woodland Park Old Apostolic Lutheran Church, said that the church “has fully complied with the law in the referenced case, and it’s a matter of legal record.” Hiivala declined to comment further.
By the time prosecutors brought the case against Massie, the three-year statute of limitations had run out on charging Bruckelmyer with failure to report.

Reckoning
On the day of Massie’s sentencing in March 2025, Kleffman walked Kyla Chamberlin to the front row of the high-ceilinged courtroom. The opposite side of the courtroom quickly filled with at least a dozen Massie supporters, including his wife, Sarah.
Chamberlin had flown in from North Dakota alone. Of the nine alleged victims prosecutors identified from the case, she was the only one to attend the sentencing in person. As she waited, she was shaking. She didn’t want to look back, particularly at Sarah Massie, whom she’d adored as a child. She said she could feel the eyes of her former church community on her, people she’d once trusted and loved.
A former EMT and mother of three, Chamberlin had grown up in the Black Hills of South Dakota in the 1990s. Clint and Sarah Massie lived nearby and opened their home to Chamberlin and her four siblings. Her parents sometimes asked Clint, starting in his late teens, to babysit.
The sexual abuse began around the time Chamberlin was 7 years old, she told police. In interviews with Kleffman, she described a remarkably similar pattern of abuse as the two Duluth victims.
After the Massies moved to Duluth in the early 2000s, Chamberlin’s parents say she went from meek and sweet to being filled with an inexplicable anger. She rebelled, she drank. The close-knit family began to fray. She and one of her older sisters, Kristi Bertolotto, stopped speaking to each other.
“I’ve lost a lot of friendships, a lot of relationships, divorces, anger management — didn’t understand why I was so mad,” Chamberlin said.

She stopped attending church in 2010 and, in response, her parents made it clear that she was no longer welcome at family and holiday functions, a painful and common experience described by several former church members.
“It’s like you don’t even think for yourself,” Janie Williamson, Chamberlin’s mother, said in an interview. “To turn against your own children because of some of those things is — it’s awful.”
After St. Louis County announced charges against Massie, Kleffman began receiving calls from alleged victims all over the country. One of those was from Chamberlin. Months later, Kleffman realized that one of the other victims he interviewed was Chamberlin’s older sister, Bertolotto.
Neither of them knew what had happened to the other. Neither knew the other sister had come forward. Both women agreed to be named in this story.
Court filings listed nine alleged victims, but only three of the cases resulted in charges of felony sexual conduct with a victim under the age of 13. The statute of limitations under South Dakota law had run out for Bertolotto and Chamberlin. And the girl who’d been pressured to forgive Massie in Bruckelmyer’s office hadn’t had her case charged either; under Minnesota law, too much time had passed between her initial report in 2017 and the prosecution.
Nevertheless, six of the alleged victims whose cases didn’t result in charges were still part of the case, and some of the women traveled to Duluth in December 2024 to testify at Massie’s trial. Just after jury selection, Massie agreed to plead guilty to four felony counts. One charge was dropped.
Four months later, at his sentencing, Massie looked pale and paunchy in an orange jumpsuit, his hands and feet shackled. His attorney, citing Massie’s lack of a criminal record, asked that he receive no prison time and be allowed to seek treatment and receive probation that he could serve at home. Massie apologized to his victims and their families.
“I beg for their forgiveness, for the damage and hurt that I’ve caused them over the years,” he said in a quavering voice. “I feel responsible for the horrible acts to these children.”
But Judge Eric Hylden noted that since Massie had pleaded guilty, he’d never tried to enroll in sex-offender treatment or written apology letters to his victims. Hylden also quoted aloud from one of 17 letters of support for Massie, many from OALC members, which he said demonstrated that some in Massie’s community still did not believe he’d done anything wrong: “I wish you find ones that have actually done these things and get them put away rather than putting your energy into lying and seeking evil where there is none to be found.”
The judge sentenced Massie to 7 1/2 years in prison.
Afterward, in the witness room a floor higher in the courthouse, Chamberlin met Ryan, the assistant district attorney, and Kleffman — the two men she credited with putting Massie in prison 30 years after he’d abused her. The three exchanged hugs.
“I feel a sense of justice for the first time in 30 years,” Chamberlin said.

At the same time, none of them felt completely satisfied that the problem began and ended with Massie — that church leaders had not been held accountable.
Ryan said that he’d struggled as he prepared to go to trial with keeping several of the women from succumbing to what he called “a constant effort” by members of the church to “try to get these girls to either tone down their position on it or just to not cooperate.” One alleged victim, he said, had dropped out weeks before trial.
Chamberlin and her sister have retained the same lawyer who represented some of the victims in the Jeffrey Epstein case. He has filed lawsuits on their behalf against Massie, their church in South Dakota and the Old Apostolic Lutheran Church of America.
In a letter written from prison that was filed in court, Massie denied both sisters’ allegations. The OALC, in a motion to dismiss both lawsuits, wrote that “while OALC-America is mindful and sympathetic to Plaintiff for the abuse Plaintiff alleges occurred by Massie, such empathy does not take away from the plain fact that this Court does not have personal jurisdiction over OALC-America.”
Chamberlin and Bertolotto’s family has left the church. They are now navigating a delicate reconciliation, which Chamberlin credits to the abuse finally coming to light.
Chamberlin said she hoped to have a role encouraging other victims to come forward before the secrecy consumes their lives the way it had consumed hers.
“There’s a lot more to be done,” she said. “There’s a lot of Clints out there.”

(Photo: J. Holly McCall/Tennessee Lookout)Former Lipscomb University professor Lauren Pinkston, who has spent her career researching human trafficking prevention and community development, will run for governor as an independent candidate. 
A first-time candidate, Pinkston, of Columbia, said she first considered running for the state legislature before eyeing the governor’s race.
“Knowing who is on the ballot on the Republican side, there are some really polarizing figures that people are not excited about,” she said. “There are a lot of Republicans who were raised like I was with a core set of values that they just don’t feel represented by their party anymore.”
Pinkston cited 2024 data from Gallup Poll showing 43% of Americans considered themselves as independent voters, affiliated with neither the Democratic Party nor the Republican Party. 
U.S. Sen. Marsha Blackburn, U.S. Rep. John Rose and state Rep. Monty Fritts are vying for the Republican gubernatorial nomination, while Memphis City Councilperson Jerri Green is the most prominent of four Democrats running. Of the remaining Democrats, only one, Carnita Atwater,  has electoral experience, having run for Memphis mayor in 2023 and for governor in 2022. 
According to Ballotpedia, two other independent candidates are planning to run for governor in 2026. 
Independent candidates typically have not fared well in Tennessee’s gubernatorial races: In 2014, the late John Jay Hooker, an attorney from a prominent Nashville family, entrepreneur and one-time ally of Robert F. Kennedy, earned 2.3% of the vote in the general election. 
Pinkston acknowledged skepticism about her candidacy exists.
“A lot of independents are even more fringe than the extremes that we have, but there are a good number of us who are interested in breaking apart from the extremism we have and offering a solid path back to the middle ground,” she said.
Her campaign will focus on agriculture — one of the state’s largest industries — and education. 
“We live in a modern society, and so while we can have Tennessee first and America first policies, we don’t make those policies in a vacuum,” Pinkston said, addressing a crisis with Tennessee soybean farmers hit hard by the Trump administration’s tariffs. “I’m interested in talking to farmers about how we can brand products and sell products within our state to relieve the pressure of federal policies.”
Pinkston has a bachelor’s degree from Freed-Hardeman University and a Ph.D. from Clemson University. She taught in the Lipscomb University College of Business and has worked with the Freedom Business Alliance, an organization that works to end human trafficking through economic empowerment. 
She believes her message will resonate with Tennesseans.
“People are looking for a choice that they can vote for, rather than against,” Pinkston said. “Over the last decade or so people have felt so disenfranchised and feel unenthused with other options on the ballot, and this just feels like the right year to give people the choice they have been looking for.”
Pinkston will launch her campaign Saturday in three stops across the state, in Selmer, where she grew up, Columbia, and Chattanooga.

Screenshot. “We remember and honor the memory of those transgender, nonbinary and gender non-conforming people who lost their lives to anti-trans violence,” Rev. Dr. Lawrence T. Richardson said in a virtual church service celebrating Transgender Day of Remembrance on Thursday evening. 
“What we need is for the terrorism to stop, because until all of us are free, none of us are free, so we advocate, educate and prioritize visibility,” Richardson, a transgender man himself, said.
The associate conference minister for church vitality and transitions in the Michigan Conference United Church of Christ, he preached to the crowd that just this year, over a thousand anti-trans pieces of legislation have been introduced nationwide. 
“Trans folks are real, and we exist, no matter what policies attempt to legislate us out of existence,” he said. “I can’t explain away anti-trans violence or why some of us make it and some of us don’t, but what I do know is this, those of us still alive, still surviving, still thriving, we have been preserved for such a time as this. This is the time to show up. This is the time to speak up. This is the time to declare your sovereignty. This is the time to show them who we are. This is the time to let the world see our beauty, richness and diversity.”

The names of 38 trans, nonbinary and gender non-conforming people were read by ministers and clergy members, while those in attendance online shared the names of transgender loved ones in the chat of the call. 
“We are here because lies have been lost. We are here because violence tried to silence our siblings,” Rev. Elder Carmarion D. Anderson said, explaining why the names are read each year. “We are here because the world grows comfortable with forgetting, but we refuse to forget.”
“We say their names because silence is a grave that tries to bury the truth,” Anderson, a minister in Alabama and Black trans woman, added. “We say their names because every life deserves honor, dignity and breath.”
“Let this resilience hold those who grieve, lift those who are afraid and surround our trans siblings with protection, affirmation and fierce, unshakable love,” Rev. Derek Terry, a pastor from Ohio, said in an opening prayer. “May resilience move us from remembrance into action, to create communities where trans lives are safe, celebrated and cherished without condition.”

(Photo courtesy of the West Virginia Office of Gov. Patrick Morrisey)This week, reporter Steven Allen Adams of Ogden newspapers confirmed what many had been hearing in recent days: Gov. Patrick Morrisey inexplicably wants to call the Legislature into a special session mere weeks before the regular session to muscle through a deeply regressive tax and budget plan. The tradeoff, reportedly, is even deeper cuts to a state budget already hemorrhaging from years of disinvestment and underfunding, in many ways fueling the affordability crisis many West Virginians are now facing. 
More cuts are unthinkable after years of state budget austerity have already resulted in unprecedented public school closures and program cuts, the failure to make new investments in affordable child care, crumbling water and road infrastructure in rural communities, and low pay and skyrocketing insurance costs for state and local workers.
Morrisey’s proposal is reportedly to move West Virginia from a progressive, graduated income tax (in line with the majority of states) to a flat tax of 3.88%. To be clear, this proposal would not lead to lower taxes for everyone. In fact, it would raise income tax rates for at least one-third of West Virginia households (the West Virginia Center on Budget and Policy is crunching the numbers and will have more specific details soon). The biggest beneficiaries by far would be high-income households, who have already seen significant state and federal tax cuts in recent years and, as a result, already pay less in state and local taxes as a share of their incomes than low- and middle-income households in West Virginia. A flat tax would make our already upside-down tax system even more regressive, with Morrisey’s plan requiring low-income households to pay more to give yet another tax break to higher-income earners.
But that isn’t the only cost. Adams also reported that Morrisey has instructed state agencies to plan for budget cuts in the upcoming year. Instead of talking about another flat budget (which by definition, is shrinking by failing to keep up with inflation), we are looking at an even smaller budget next year, meaning low- and moderate- income households will be asked to pay more and get less back in public services.
Since 2019, the state’s budget has shrunk by nearly $500 million (or about 8%t) after adjusting for inflation. The state is spending less than it did just a few years ago on school aid funding to local districts, Medicaid, child care assistance and the Public Employees Insurance Agency. The only areas of the budget that have seen state funding increases are jails and prisons, foster care and adoption, and the Hope Scholarship. 
The budget cuts agencies are reportedly being asked to make would slash programs further and mean no much-needed investments in modernizing our school funding formula to help neighborhood schools stay afloat and districts hire and retain well-qualified teachers; no new investments in child care affordability; no clearing of the Intellectual/Developmental Disabilities waiver wait list; no solution for PEIA; and nothing for rural community infrastructure or economic development.
One major question that remains unanswered is whether Morrisey would allow the Hope Scholarship’s expansion to move ahead, meaning the program’s budget would increase by more than 100% while every other program in the state is forced to make cuts. This is yet another area where leaders are prioritizing higher earning households over low- and middle-income ones. 
Treasurer Larry Pack, whose agency administers the Hope Scholarship, has already said 85-90% of current Hope Scholarship enrollees are families who would have used private schools without the voucher program, and 100%  of those who would benefit from the program’s expansion are already in private schools — meaning they are already able to afford it. Can policymakers seriously consider giving shrinking public taxpayer dollars to families who can already afford private school while refusing to invest in an outdated public school funding plan, or worse, making public school funding cuts?
Let me be perfectly clear: The only winners in Morrisey’s tax plan are high-income households who’ve already received windfalls in state and federal tax cuts and the Hope Scholarship over the last several years. It is everyday West Virginians who would bear the consequences of the “tough choices” that Morrisey promised as tradeoffs — many seeing their taxes increase and most harmed by more budget cuts to pay for another round of tax cuts that help the wealthy pay less. For West Virginia lawmakers to contemplate giving our richest even more — paid for by outright cuts to our public schools, our rural communities, and our children’s futures — is unconscionable.

(Photo provided by UK College of Medicine)Kentucky scientists have successfully edited genes in living mice, switching a gene associated with high risk of Alzheimer’s disease to its counterpart, a protective gene.  
This new research, which came out of a 22-person team from the University of Kentucky and beyond, has the potential to someday prevent millions of cases of Alzheimer’s in humans, said Lance Johnson, an associate professor in the UK College of Medicine’s Department of Physiology. 
The study, published this month in Nature Neuroscience, found that editing a specific gene known to increase risk of Alzheimer’s with its counterpart, a gene associated with lower risk, in mice resulted in “fewer Alzheimer’s-related brain changes such as amyloid plaque buildup and inflammation, and stronger performance on memory tests.” 
Lesley Golden, the lead author, said in a statement that “this model allows us to test what happens when we go from risk to resilience. Remarkably, even switching the gene later in life improved multiple aspects of Alzheimer’s pathology at once.” 
Everyone has the apolipoprotein E, or APOE gene, Johnson explained, though some people have variants —  “the same gene that just differs by only one or two base pairs” — APO E2, E3 and E4. Most people inherited E3 from both parents, Johnson said. Some will inherit a mixture of variants. 
People who got an E4 variant from both parents — about a quarter of the population, Johnson said — are about 15 times more likely to develop Alzheimer’s disease. 
“The good news there is: Some people, I like to say, have won the genetic lottery in that they’ve inherited the E2 variant of the gene,” Johnson said. “And so those that have inherited E2 are equally as protected as the people who inherited E4 are at risk. So it’s an incredibly protective variant of this gene.” 
He and his team wanted to answer this question: “Why don’t we just change the gene itself? if you got an E4 from mom and dad, and you’re facing an almost certain chance of getting this disease at some point, if it was possible, wouldn’t you want to have the E2 variant?”

Researchers gave living mice the risk variant “designed a mouse’s DNA so that it had the (protective gene) behind” the risk variant. Then, researchers injected a drug into the mice that directed the DNA to change from making the risk gene to making the protective gene. 
The change took a few days in mice, but would likely take longer in a human body. (Mice have a lifespan of around 1.5 years). Mice also do not get Alzheimer’s disease, Johnson said, meaning the team had to “use a genetic model that makes lots of the amyloid plaque that features that disease.” 
At best, making an effective gene switch in humans is years away, and there are many hurdles to clear before efficient and specific editing is an available treatment. But the research offers some hope to many Kentuckians who live with Alzheimer’s and the loved ones who take care of them. 
The 2025 Alzheimer’s Disease Facts and Figures Report, released by the Alzheimer’s Association in May, reported that 80,000 Kentuckians aged 65 and older are living with an Alzheimer’s diagnosis. Additionally, around 160,000 Kentucky residents provide unpaid care for a loved one with Alzheimer’s, an incurable but treatable disorder characterized by memory loss. 
“To us, it was an exciting proof-of-concept study to show that, okay, perhaps one day this would work in a human if we can figure out a safe way to deliver gene editing technology; if we can figure out a way to do that with the correct timing,” Johnson said.  
Report shows effects of Alzheimer’s in KY, the disease ‘you can’t see’ 

Johnson hopes to continue his research in the coming years, “assuming we can continue to get (National Institutes of Health) funding for this.”
This research is not an end-all, fix-all to effectively treating Alzheimer’s. The gene that is protective against Alzheimer’s can raise a person’s risk of other conditions, Johnson explained, including age related macular degeneration and cardiovascular disease.  
“It would be too good to be true if inheriting E2 was good for everything,” Johnson said. “The last thing you’d want to do is protect someone from Alzheimer’s disease, but put them at a higher risk for cardiovascular disease, right?” 
The scientists studying this gene will need to keep that front of mind, Johnson said, and ensure that any treatments don’t put patients at risk of other diseases. He believes this will happen and is “as hopeful as I have been for this field and for tackling this disease.” 
“My hope and my belief is that one day — and hopefully it’s sooner rather than later — we’re at a point where we have tools that can edit DNA efficiently and safely, and we could target something like APOE,” Johnson said. “In theory, we could prevent millions of Alzheimer’s disease cases from ever happening in the first place.”

Bobby Scott, D-Newport News, fifth from left, hold a ceremonial groundbreaking of the Cuffee Aquatics Center in Chesapeake, the city's first public pool, on Friday, Nov. 14. (Photo by Roger Chesley/Virginia Mercury) Local, state and federal leaders recently broke ground on Chesapeake’s first-ever public pool, an event more than a half-century in the making. The $27 million Cuffee Aquatics Center, set to open in late 2027, will be an expansion of the existing community center at the site, and the 28,628-square-foot indoor complex will include 25-yard lanes for competitive swimming, diving boards, and a therapeutic pool.
Public pools provide opportunities for people of all races and income levels to learn how to swim, prevent drowning, and acquire a skill that will last a lifetime. That the commonwealth’s second-largest city (population 253,000 today) resisted this practical amenity for so long has been stupefying.
To say the natatorium is long overdue woefully understates the history of this issue. City Council members have displayed obstinance, inertia and absurd tight-fistedness since at least 1973. That’s when Chesapeake residents began urging officials to build a public swimming pool in the huge city of 353 square miles.
Council members refused to relent, even though Chesapeake often has been the top locality in household income compared to the other major cities in South Hampton Roads (along with Norfolk, Portsmouth, Virginia Beach and Suffolk). 
“You can’t be a city of our size and wealth and not have public pools,” Mayor Rick West told me a few days before the Nov. 14 groundbreaking. “It’s a major step forward.”
“The mentality (has been) we don’t need a public pool,” longtime council member Ella Ward told me at the groundbreaking. That stance has hurt poor people and families without nearby access to aquatic facilities. “Our tax dollars should be used here,” she added.
In 2022, as the current plan was being hashed out, West had told me it was “embarrassing” the city lacked such a public facility. That’s putting it mildly.
The delay also reminds African-Americans of the ugly violence and slights that accompanied attempts to integrate pools in the South decades ago. Author Jeff Wiltse documented those incidents in his book, “Contested Waters: A Social History of Swimming Pools in America.”
Meanwhile, the American Red Cross notes that today 64% of African-American children, 45% of Latino children, and 40% of white children have few or no swimming skills. And 79% of children in households with incomes less than $50,000 have few or no swimming skills.
Private clubs and places like the YMCA are available in Chesapeake. But if families can’t afford membership fees, they miss out. Parents also hesitate to frolic at coastal beaches if they and their children don’t know how to swim.

In 2015, I wrote a series of columns in The Virginian-Pilot urging the city of Chesapeake to take the plunge. I’m surprised a decade has already passed.
At that time, Chesapeake was one of just two cities among the nation’s largest 100 without a public pool. (Fremont, California, was the other.) Then and now, Chesapeake clocked in as the 92nd-largest city in the United States. I even suggested alternatives – such as starting public-private partnerships – to increase options if Chesapeake didn’t want to pay the whole freight itself.
That’s despite the fact the city is far from destitute.
Median household income in 2015 was nearly $70,000; the city says it’s nearly $93,000 today, a few thousand more than the state level.
Chesapeake waded into the current pool project after garnering $9 million in state appropriations and $3 million from the feds. Other cities across the country receive similar help, sure, but Chesapeake could’ve dived in by itself.
What gives?
I’ve called Chesapeake home for 28 years now, and I wrote dozens of editorials about the city when I was on The Pilot’s editorial board from 2000 to 2010. So I’ve gleaned some things about my adopted hometown.
Chesapeake has been fiscally conservative – sometimes ridiculously so – despite enjoying a strong real estate tax base, hosting major company headquarters like Dollar Tree, and being the home of several military installations. All three major ratings agencies place the city’s bonds at AAA, the highest.
Yet, Chesapeake moves at a snail’s pace on initiating some city services.
For example, it didn’t start curbside recycling with large, rolling bins until 2009 – years after neighboring cities did so. Chesapeake then ended the program in 2022. City officials that year told me the move by China to bar imports of recyclable materials was a big reason for the change, but it was a disappointing decision for the 70,000 households that used the service.  
Much of this backstory – though not all – was in the rearview window last week as City Council members, state legislators and U.S. Rep. Bobby Scott, D-Newport News, took part in the groundbreaking. Roughly 100 people were on hand on that brisk, sunny morning, including several people from the Campostella community where the pool will be located.
Particularly poignant were the comments by Del. Cliff Hayes, D-Chesapeake, who grew up in the immediate area. The former city councilman has spoken before about nearly drowning as a child when ill-equipped to be in the water, and not having public pools in Chesapeake where he could learn how to swim. He also mentioned a childhood friend who had drowned.
“Today is a fulfillment of a promise – a promise decades in the making, rooted in the soil of this community, and watered by generations of hope, struggle and determination,” he said.
I hope it doesn’t take several more decades before Chesapeake builds a second public pool.

(Photo by Imaginima/Getty Images)The largest initial business investment in Caroline County’s history has been awarded to a tech company that will soon break ground on three major data centers, state and local leaders announced Thursday.
The CleanArc Data Centers project, on the site of a former shopping center along I-95, will build three hyperscale data centers at 490,000 square feet each, using 600 MW of power – totalling over $3-billion for construction and generating 50 jobs.
The project was approved by-right by the county’s Board of Supervisors in August, a process that didn’t require public hearings like those needed when project developers seek a conditional use permit. The leaders said the area was already zoned for industrial use and the project was grandfathered into county requirements since they had already made significant investments in the project, according to a release from the county. 
The approved application also left things open ended, and the company could add two additional sites with the approval of the board of supervisors.
The amount and source of water being used to cycle through data centers is a frequent concern for localities, especially rural ones like Caroline, where many homeowners depend on well water. Per the agreement, the county won’t provide the CleanArc with potable water for cooling of the machines inside. The county will provide water for flushing and washing at the facilities, according to the county’s statement.
CleanArc said the initial amount of water needed would be brought in from off site and will be circulated from then on – using only the amount of water necessary for an average office building.
The locality’s leaders said the project will abide by rules so residents’ quality of life isn’t degraded.
“The Board is proud that it has led the Commonwealth in setting exacting standards for data centers in the form of regulatory guidelines,” said county supervisor Nancy Long. “These regulations include setbacks to enhance buffering from communities, noise abatement provisions, screening requirements, and the prohibition of the use of potable water for industrial cooling.”
Caroline County used incentives to draw the company to the area. Every year 25% of the increased tax revenue generated at the parcel, which is estimated at $13 million annually, will be given back to CleanArc as part of the grant incentive program. The grant will be paid out over the course of 15 years.
“With this campus, CleanArc is ensuring every data center built in Virginia is better than the last,” Secretary of Commerce and Trade Juan Pablo Segura said in a release. “This enormous investment in Caroline County is a sign of Virginia’s growing dominance in the global tech industry.”
The company  — which has offices in Reston, Dallas and Las Vegas — has already placed the campus in the queue with Dominion to receive power, which encouraged the county to approve the agreement, since it seemed likely the project would come to fruition. 
The three campuses are expected to create 50 jobs which are significantly higher median salaries than average in Caroline County.
“By listening to Virginians and collaborating with industry leaders, CleanArc is ensuring this campus brings great jobs and revenue to this community and the Commonwealth while ensuring the high quality of life Virginia is known for,” Gov. Glenn Youngkin said in an announcement about the company’s planned entrance to Caroline on Thursday. 
The first 300MW of power is expected to be energized no later than 2027 with additional power coming online over the next 3-5 years after.

Old Dominion University announced in October it was partnering with Google Cloud to launch an incubator for artificial intelligence research and applications.
Through the new incubator, students, faculty, staff, local cities and small businesses can access Google’s advanced AI tools they wouldn’t otherwise have access to.
ODU professor Chrysoula Malogianni described the incubator, called the MonarchSphere, as an “ecosystem” that will help both those within the university and the broader community.
“At the same time, (they) tap into access to ODU expertise, and that expertise, obviously, is research expertise,” she said.
Internally, ODU is using the incubator to develop AI advisors to help those who advise students. Researchers can test ideas and practical applications of AI in areas like coastal resilience, defense, cybersecurity and healthcare in an environment where they won’t have to commit to buying costly licenses to Google’s products.
Already, the incubator has 30 researchers working on projects, Malogianni said. The researchers come from a variety of backgrounds, including computer science, data science, quantum computing and philosophy.
Professor George McLeod is the director of ODU’s geospatial research center. He and his team are replicating a project that estimates the economic impact of a hurricane striking Hampton Roads. Flood and hurricane modeling require an enormous amount of data, which can be time consuming to process, he said.
He said using the incubator’s advanced AI tools may be able to speed up processing time, lead to more accurate results and discover new research questions.
“There’s a lot of natural concern about whether AI is giving us the truth,” he said. “Is AI giving us accurate results? Our role as a partner with Google in the MonarchSphere is to help develop these tools.”
ODU electrical and computer engineering professor Khan Iftekharuddin has been developing computer models for glioblastoma, an aggressive type of brain cancer, for several years. The models use MRI images to predict how tumors will grow and how quickly, which can help doctors determine if treatment is possible.
Without the advanced Google AI tools, the process takes nearly 2 hours per patient, multiplied by thousands of patients, Iftekharuddin said. With Google’s advanced tools, that time is cut to just 44 minutes per patient.
“Human health is, I think, one of the most important areas where AI and this kind of computation is going to make a difference, and it is making a difference,” Iftekharuddin said.
The collaboration between Google and ODU also includes certificate opportunities for students, such as Google Career Certificates, into degree and continuing education programs.
“Students not only learn about AI,” Malogianni said. “AI becomes the content, the context and the tool.”
The incubator will be open to people outside of ODU, too, Malogianni said. Small businesses or organizations may have a problem they’d like to solve with AI, but don’t have the tools or know-how to make it happen.
The university eventually will establish an intake process, Malogianni said.

(Courtesy of Lovewell Farms)I co-founded Lovewell Farms, Rhode Island’s only USDA-certified organic hemp farm in 2018. Since 2019, we’ve been growing legal hemp outdoors, using natural ethanol extraction, and creating safe, full-spectrum CBD products like tinctures, salves, and gummies, all lab-tested, adult use only, and compliant with some of the strictest regulations and THC limits in the country. Our mission is simple: to make non-intoxicating, plant-based wellness options accessible. We’re not trying to get people high, we’re trying to help them feel better.
But last week, Congress quietly passed H.R. 5371, a government funding bill that redefines hemp so narrowly it could effectively ban most full-spectrum CBD products, even those that are non-intoxicating, naturally extracted, and legally sold under state law. The bill criminalizes any product with a “quantifiable” amount of THC or THCA, and even targets products extracted “outside the plant,” including widely used, safe methods like ethanol distillation.
What this definition ignores is botanical reality: It is virtually impossible to grow a CBD-rich hemp plant with absolutely zero THC. All cannabis plants, including federally legal hemp, naturally produce trace amounts of THC, it’s part of the plant’s chemistry. These trace levels are not enough to cause intoxication, especially when balanced by a dominant cannabinoid like CBD. Full-spectrum products rely on these naturally occurring compounds to work effectively and safely, not to get anyone high.
So, what’s the result? Tens of thousands of compliant hemp businesses, including ours, could be shut down. Not for breaking the rules, but for following them. This isn’t science-based regulation. It’s 21st-century reefer madness.
According to Reuters, the U.S. was already losing over 11,000 jobs per week as of October. Now, an additional 300,000 hemp industry jobs, from farmers to retailers to manufacturers, could disappear by 2027, threatening a $28 billion market.
Even more frustrating: while the bill includes a one-year delay on enforcement and mandates a federal study by the FDA and USDA it still amounts to a “ban now, ask questions later” approach. Unlike here in Rhode Island, where regulators kept regulations the same while a state-led study is underway, the federal law already rewrites the definition of hemp, locking in penalties before the study is even complete. 
For farmers like us, a year isn’t enough time. We make seed purchases in March, plant in April, and harvest in October. If the ban takes effect in November 2026, we could be forced to destroy our entire crop at the end of next season, despite following all the rules. That’s not a transition plan, it’s a trap. At minimum, Congress should delay enforcement by 720 days to accommodate real-world timelines of agriculture.
Rhode Island’s current rules already require lab testing, child-resistant packaging, adult-only sales and labeling that mirrors the state’s medical program. Yet our Attorney General, Peter Neronha, signed a letter to congressional leaders describing the entire industry as “unregulated” and “marketed to children.” That’s simply not true, is deeply misleading to the public and harms compliant, state-licensed family farms like ours. In Rhode Island, the state requires customers to prove they are 21 -years old, and meet the same exact testing, packaging, and label requirements as the regulated adult-use and medical cannabis programs.










We make seed purchases in March, plant in April, and harvest in October. If the ban takes effect in November 2026, we could be forced to destroy our entire crop at the end of next season, despite following all the rules.


The letter goes even further to claim that hemp-derived THC products “kill children.” In reality, only two isolated independent case reports exist linking child deaths to cannabis ingestion, and both involved illicit, unregulated products, infants, and in one case, additional substances such as fentanyl and ketamine. These tragedies are not connected to regulated hemp products. 
A broad ban wouldn’t prevent harm, it would push the market underground, where unregulated products are more likely to pose real risks. Responsible regulation is what keeps children and consumers safe. That’s what we already have in Rhode Island, and it works. To date, there is no record of a single cannabis-related death, of a child, infant, or adult, in the state.
The letter Neronha and 38 other attorneys general signed also makes the claim that hemp-derived gummies and beverages are “designed to appeal to young children.” By that logic, the same could be said of alcoholic drinks like hard seltzers, which are often sweetened, fruit-flavored, and brightly packaged. Yet alcohol wasn’t banned, likely because that industry is larger, older, and has more powerful lobbyists. We didn’t ban potatoes just because someone turned them into moonshine. We regulate alcohol. We should do the same with hemp.
Despite calls from farmers and small business owners across the state, both of Rhode Island’s U.S. senators, Democrats Jack Reed and Sheldon Whitehouse, voted to keep the ban language in the bill, citing Neronha’s falsehood-ridden letter as justification. Thankfully, Rhode Island’s Democratic Reps. Seth Magaziner and Gabe Amo, both voted no on the corresponding House bill, though it still ultimately passed. 
We still have time to fix this, but only if the public speaks up. The bill allows for a year before implementation. That’s one year for advocacy, education, and science to lead the way. Congress should be going after bad actors, not punishing compliant small farmers who follow the law, protect public health, and provide plant-based wellness alternatives to pharmaceuticals.
This isn’t a partisan issue. Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle, from progressive Democrats to conservative Republicans, have expressed concern about the impact of this hemp ban. That’s because it affects real people in every state: farmers, veterans, small business owners, and families looking for natural relief. We need smart, bipartisan solutions, not rushed overreach that punishes the compliant.
We don’t need another war on cannabis. We need honest, evidence-based legislation.

The proposal now awaits consideration by the full chamber following a 25-1 vote by the House Children & Youth Committee. 
Rep. Brenda Pugh (R-Luzerne) cast the lone vote against the measure. She supports the intent, but thinks the language should be tweaked.

The Trump administration is making it easier for farmers to employ guest workers from other countries. (Photo by Mario Tama/Getty Images)In a tacit admission that U.S. food production requires foreign labor, the Trump administration is making it easier for farmers to employ guest workers from other countries.
At the same time, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in recent months appears to be refraining from conducting agricultural workplace raids, even as it scours Democratic-led cities for immigrants who are in the country illegally.
“We really haven’t seen agriculture targeted with worksite enforcement efforts, and early this year we did,” said Julia Gelatt, associate director of U.S. immigration policy at the Migration Policy Institute, a nonpartisan think tank.
The shifts come as many Americans are concerned about the rising cost of food, creating political problems for a president who campaigned on lowering them. Last week, the administration also announced it would lift tariffs on some foreign food products, including bananas, beef, coffee and tomatoes.
Trump migrant deportations could threaten states’ agricultural economies

To ease labor shortages on farms and ranches, the administration last month made changes to the federal H-2A visa program, which allows employers to hire foreign workers for temporary agricultural jobs when there aren’t enough U.S.-born workers available. Under the new rule, the Department of Homeland Security will approve H-2A visas more quickly.
“Our immigration system has been broken for decades, and we finally have a President who is enforcing the law and prioritizing fixing programs farmers and ranchers rely on to produce the safest and most productive food supply in the world,” the U.S. Department of Agriculture said in an email to Stateline.
But the move to increase the supply of foreign agricultural workers conflicts with a July statement by Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins that “the promise to America, to ensure that we have a 100% American workforce, stands.”
Rollins also said the administration was committed to the mass deportation of immigrants who are here illegally, but that it would be “strategic so as not to compromise our food supply.” Ultimately, she said, the solution would be increased automation of agricultural jobs.
The government has issued about 420,000 H-2A visas for agricultural workers every year since 2023, which amounts to about half of the 812,000 agricultural worker jobs. They are concentrated in states that grow fruits and vegetables as opposed to grains, which are increasingly planted and harvested using machines. The government expects an additional 119,000 visas to be issued under the new rule.
Almost half the H-2A visas in the 2025 fiscal year were in Florida (60,000), Georgia (44,000), California (37,000), Washington state (36,000) and North Carolina (28,000).
Lower wages
The new H-2A rule also includes new hourly wage guidelines that vary by state but are lower than previous wages, and allows employers to charge workers for housing that used to be free. In North Carolina, for instance, the new rate is $11.09 for unskilled workers compared with $16.16 last year. In California, the rate is $13.45 for unskilled workers compared with $19.97 last year, though minimum wage laws in California and some other states would apply to those jobs, according to a Cornell University analysis.
ICE has a new courthouse tactic: Get immigrants’ cases tossed, then arrest them outside

In North Carolina, farmers are looking forward to lower labor costs, said Lee Wicker, deputy director of the North Carolina Growers Association, a trade association that brought 11,000 guest workers to the state through the H-2A guest worker program last year.
“If you think farmers are making more money in these conditions, you’re wrong. They’re going broke,” Wicker said. Workers will take a pay cut under new guidelines and will have to pay for housing, but that may help farmers stave off bankruptcy, he said.
“I’m not saying the workers are going to be happy about this, but I think they’ll come back. Wages have gone down before and they kept coming,” he added.
Jeffrey Dorfman, an agricultural and resource economics professor at North Carolina State University, said the changes will be a boon to the state’s farmers.
“The move to lower the H-2A wages by the Trump administration will be very well received by growers in North Carolina and will save farmers tens of millions of dollars statewide,” Dorfman said. “For many farmers, it will turn money-losing crops into money-making crops, if prices stay about where they are now.”
Unionized California farmworkers are opposed to the pay cuts and loss of free housing in the new guest worker visa plan, said Antonio De Loera-Brust, a spokesperson for the United Farm Workers, which represents about 10,000 workers in California.










First came the raids, which hurt workers, and now in order to appease business interests, they make all these concessions on wages and the guest workers program.


– Antonio De Loera-Brust, United Farm Workers


The union sued the administration over ICE raids in the fields earlier this year, but recently “it’s been pretty quiet,” he said.
“For us it’s been really a one-two punch,” De Loera-Brust said. “First came the raids, which hurt workers, and now in order to appease business interests, they make all these concessions on wages and the guest workers program.”
Fewer raids
The administration quickly walked back a June directive to avoid raids on the agriculture and hospitality industries. Nevertheless, ICE raids on those employers have been more infrequent in the months since.
In June, ICE raided a dairy farm in New Mexico and a meatpacking plant in Nebraska. Since then, the agency has raided only a handful of food and agriculture employers, such as a July raid on a California marijuana grower and an Arizona restaurant chain, and a September raid to arrest Wisconsin dairy workers.
For-profit immigration detention expands as Trump accelerates his deportation plans

Earlier this month, ICE agents descended on an onion farm in Northern California, arresting four immigrants on charges of illegally selling farmworker visas.
Even as ICE ramps up its activity in North Carolina cities such as Charlotte and Raleigh, Wicker, of the growers trade group, said farms in the state have not been targeted.
Gelatt, of the Migration Policy Institute, said that’s been true of farms and ranches in many states since June.
“In past administrations we’ve seen a very quiet de-emphasis of immigration enforcement at farms. You don’t need to make an announcement. You don’t need to fight in the courts,” Gelatt said. “It is possible just to direct enforcement activities away from farms. It’ll be hard to know if that’s happened now, but I would not be surprised.”
While farmworkers in California are seeing some relief from raids, life is still uneasy for them, De Loera-Brust said.
“Overall, they have clearly slowed down [raids] in ag areas, but that’s not policy. They could resume at any time. People are living with uncertainty,” he said.

(Photo by Will Steinfeld/New Hampshire Bulletin)Soon after Joshua Bogden attempted to register to vote on the day of Portsmouth’s municipal elections Nov. 11, he faced a tough decision.
Bogden had not brought along a passport or birth certificate to prove his citizenship. And though he had previously been registered and voted in Wilton, poll workers told Bogden he needed to leave and return with one of those physical documents.
Bogden could either drive to city hall and request a same-day copy of his birth certificate, or rush home and find his own copy. But he had only hours until the polls closed, and only minutes before Portsmouth stopped its birth certificate service at 4:30.
In the end, Bogden decided to drive home and chance that he could find the certificate, he said during a press conference Thursday. He did find it and was able to vote. But the hassle he faced is at the center of arguments by some that recent changes to New Hampshire’s voter registration laws are too strict and will result in frustrated voters choosing not to vote.
“Luckily, I lived nearby,” he said. “But if there had been any more sort of traffic or anything in my personal life — going home to pick up the kids, trying to do this after work — there’s no way I would have been able to come back and vote successfully.” 
Since a new law took effect November 2024, New Hampshire voters are required to produce hard copies of citizenship documents the first time they register to vote in the state. The law eliminated the previous option for voters registering on Election Day to sign a “qualified voter affidavit” that allowed them to vote without proving citizenship by testifying on penalty of perjury that they were a U.S. citizen. 
Republican supporters of the law, House Bill 1569, say the new requirements are reasonable and necessary to close loopholes that could allow non-citizens to vote, and that voters should prepare by obtaining their citizenship documents in advance 
Lawmakers also passed a follow-up law in 2025, House Bill 464, that allows local election officials to access the Statewide Voter Registration System, New Hampshire Vital Records, and Division of Motor Vehicle databases in order to attempt to corroborate a resident’s citizenship. 
But a number of voting rights groups are suing in federal court to block the law, arguing it creates an unconstitutional burden and that it will disenfranchise eligible voters, especially those for whom obtaining a passport or birth certificate could be difficult. 
In the meantime, the October and November municipal elections have offered a fresh look into how the new law might affect voting in practice. 
According to a tally by the New Hampshire Campaign for Voting Rights, 123 voters were turned away from the polls due to a lack of documents. Combined with the 121 residents the group reported were turned away for the same reason during town meetings in spring, at least 244 people were turned away in 2025, the group says. 
Voting rights advocates and Democrats argue those tallies are a cautionary tale for the state ahead of the September 2026 state primaries and the November 2026 midterm federal election. Many more people are likely to vote in those elections, and many more who don’t bring along their citizenship documentation could be turned away, advocates warn. 
They hope U.S. District Court Judge Samantha Elliott, who is presiding over the lawsuit, will issue an injunction ahead of the midterms. A full evidentiary trial in that case is expected in February. 
At Thursday’s press conference, advocates attempted to show the difficulty posed by the new documentary requirements, which election law experts have called the strictest in the country. 
In addition to Bogden, Brayden Rumsey, a Dover voter, said he had to drive home to retrieve his passport in order to vote Nov. 11. Rumsey was not aware of the new citizenship documentation requirements; he had assumed that showing a REAL ID driver’s license would suffice, since to obtain it he had been required to show his passport. 
“I have my own car. I have my own way of getting there. I don’t have any kids to take care of. I have access to a passport and access to my birth certificate that I could easily get,” he said. “I know a lot of people don’t have that privilege like I do.”
And Michael Blanchette, who recently moved from Concord to Manchester, said he had called the city ahead of the Nov. 11 election to get confirmation of his citizenship using his previous registration and presence on the voter database. But despite that confirmation, Blanchette said he was still asked for citizenship documentation at the Manchester Ward 7 polls, and had to wait an hour for multiple election workers and city officials to clear him to vote. 
“(I knew) if I went back home and took my pain meds, I was not coming back out,” he said. “And it was now or never. So I stuck through it. I didn’t realize it would just drag on.”
Linnea Hartsuyker, a supervisor of the checklist in Dover’s Ward 5, said she had seen at least one prospective voter leave and not return once learning of the requirements. 
Hartsuyker said the 2025 law providing election workers access to the state voter file proved helpful, allowing her to verify at least those voters who had already registered. That remedy would not have worked for new voters who moved from out of state, she said.
“Last year at the general (election) I and my team registered 50 people per hour for 12 hours,” she said. “That’s almost one person per minute with the old system, and I am quite worried about being able to do that in the coming election, at the midterms.” 
Access to those state databases might vary from polling place to polling place depending on internet availability and the amount of time and manpower available during a rush of voters, critics say. Rumsey and Blanchette said workers at their polling places did not appear to have direct access to those databases, necessitating calls to city hall officials. 
It is not clear how the apparent tallies of voters turned away from voting might affect the trial in next year’s lawsuit. 
In a July 29 ruling, Elliott ruled that some of the plaintiffs in the lawsuit, filed in 2024, lacked standing because their experiences did not directly demonstrate a potential unconstitutional barrier to voting. But she granted standing to other plaintiffs, such as the Coalition for Open Democracy, the League of Women Voters of New Hampshire, the Forward Foundation, and three plaintiffs who were minors but planned to register to vote when they turned 18 and said the need to procure documentation was a burden. 
The Attorney General’s Office has defended the law and said the constitutional challenges are not substantiated. In a Nov. 7 memorandum asking Elliott to dismiss the case, Assistant Attorney General Michael DeGrandis argued that the law struck a balance between allowing every eligible person to vote and safeguarding the process from fraud.
“New Hampshire pairs that open access with commonsense eligibility checks so only the votes of eligible voters are counted,” DeGrandis wrote. “Striking this balance is essential to guarantee an election system that is both welcoming and vigilant in protecting the integrity of the ballot.”
And he wrote that the law does not impede the organizations suing, and that the individual plaintiffs “have not offered competent evidence of cognizable injuries.”
“It is Plaintiffs’ burden to come forward with definite, competent evidence of injury, causation, and redressability, but they have not,” DeGrandis wrote.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/nashelection-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-21 05:56:52.455465
,Connecticut Mirror,2025-11-21 10:00:00+00:00,CT Mirror,State officials never shared email warning of McCrory conflict,Andrew Brown and Dave Altimari,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/11/21/doug-mccrory-ct-decd-email/,The DECD was alerted in 2023 of an alleged conflict of interest involving McCrory. But staff never shared it with anyone outside the agency.,"When the Connecticut Department of Economic and Community Development was alerted in 2023 that Sen. Douglas McCrory allegedly had a conflict of interest with a woman whose businesses received state grant funding, the agency’s staff privately discussed how to handle the potentially damaging information. 
But they never shared the allegations about the Democratic senator with anyone outside their agency.
Gov. Ned Lamont and his staff said they were not informed until recently about the 2023 email in which the director of a Hartford nonprofit complained about a “potential conflict of interest concerning the relationship” between McCrory and Sonserae Cicero, the owner of a company called SHEBA. 
DECD officials also said they never alerted the Office of State Ethics, which could have investigated the matter further. 
And the agency said it didn’t ask McCrory or Cicero about the nature of their relationship because they didn’t have reason or authority to do so. 
Jim Watson, a spokesman for DECD, said the alleged relationship between the state senator and Cicero was considered an “unfounded rumor” in 2023. 
The FBI and a federal grand jury are now investigating whether the allegations are true, however. 
In August, federal investigators subpoenaed DECD for any records that mentioned a “personal or non-professional relationship” between McCrory and Cicero. 
And the 2023 email from Sabrina Tucker Barrett, the nonprofit director, was turned over to federal authorities as part of that process. 
The Connecticut Mirror reported earlier this month that Tucker-Barrett, the founder of Girls For Technology, told DECD officials that she was persuaded to split a $5 million grant with Cicero “based on false representation.”
“We have recently discovered a potential conflict of interest concerning the relationship between Sonsorae [sic] Cicero of SHEBA and Sen. McCrory. The nature and timing of this discovery have raised concerns, and I must admit I feel a degree of political coercion in proceeding with matters I do not fully agree with,” Tucker-Barrett wrote. 
Watson confirmed that DECD officials never forwarded Tucker-Barrett’s email to anyone, but he said agency staff held “internal discussions” about the matter. He declined to identify the people who were involved in those conversations. 
Alexandra Daum, who served as Lamont’s DECD commissioner from late 2022 to 2024, declined to discuss how the agency handled the complaint about McCrory. 
DECD also would not say whether any current or former employees at the agency have been questioned by the FBI or testified in front of the federal grand jury. 
Watson said the agency had no reason to ask McCrory or Cicero whether the two were in a relationship, even though the agency oversaw funding that McCrory helped direct to Cicero through his position as a member of the Minority Business Initiative Advisory Council, a board within DECD. 
Agency leaders also confirmed they never shared the information about McCrory’s alleged “conflict of interest” with the Office of State Ethics, despite a law requiring such disclosure if there’s “reasonable cause” to believe there was an ethics violation. 
Watson said the state ethics law doesn’t cover conflicts of interest for public officials outside their spouses, children or associated businesses and, as a result, the agency didn’t have cause to question McCrory or forward the email to state ethics officials. 
“We will note that the State Code of Ethics does not address alleged personal relationships between public officials and unrelated persons and thus, absent other evidence indicating impropriety, which was not apparent at the time, it would not be appropriate for DECD to probe into the claimed romantic relationships of a legislator nor does DECD have any authority to do so,” Watson said. 
“That said, the fact of the investigation indicates that there may have been an issue, that while not necessarily an ethics violation, is concerning and thus we are reviewing our response so that we can best carry out our obligations to diligently manage the public funds that pass through DECD going forward,” Watson added. 
Peter Lewandowski, the director of the Office of State Ethics, agreed that the sections of the state ethics law dealing with conflicts of interest covers specific relationships like spouses, children and fiancées. 
But he noted that other portions of the law broadly prohibit state officials from using their “public office or position” to “obtain financial gain” for themselves. 
There is no evidence in records reviewed by the CT Mirror that McCrory profited personally from the grants awarded to Cicero’s companies. The federal investigation is ongoing.  
After receiving the 2023 email, Watson said DECD staff spoke with Cicero and Tucker-Barrett and encouraged the two nonprofit leaders to “engage in constructive dialogue to resolve their differences.”
Watson said DECD could not provide any additional details about how the agency responded to the allegations directed at McCrory because of the ongoing criminal investigation. 
“DECD will refrain from speculating now as to the degree which individuals interpreted the email at the time to be aggressive leveraging by one partner towards another, whether there was any factual basis for the allegation, or how the two partnered organizations who had submitted the RFP together resolved their issues and moved forward,” Watson said. “Obviously, these issues are under investigation, and it would not be responsible to speculate about the outcome of the ongoing investigation or make premature conclusions.”
Federal investigators asked DECD this year to turn over records related to McCrory and a number of nonprofits serving Hartford’s north end, and they issued several grand jury subpoenas to other local non-profits with which McCrory interacted. 
Records obtained by CT Mirror and other news outlets in recent months show McCrory helped set up meetings for Cicero, including a face-to-face with U.S. Sen. Chris Murphy, and he advocated on her behalf for funding, including grants that flowed through the state Department of Education.  
Lamont, who announced his campaign for a third term last week, declined through his spokesman to answer questions about whether he believes anyone at DECD should be fired or disciplined for failing to report the allegations involving McCrory. 
Meanwhile, the governor’s staff argued it is too early to determine if DECD officials should have shared the email about McCrory with the state ethics office. 
“The governor won’t speculate as to how individuals at DECD interpreted these allegations at the time, the factual basis for them or how the parties resolved them factually and moved forward,” Rob Blanchard, the governor’s spokesperson, said. “It would not be prudent to predetermine the outcome of the ongoing investigation or make premature conclusions.” 
Lewandowski, the state ethics director, confirmed that commissioners and deputy commissioners in Connecticut are considered “mandatory reporters” under the state’s ethics laws and said his staff reminds state employees of those reporting requirements during every training they hold. 
Lewandowski wouldn’t comment on the specific allegations against McCrory or DECD’s decision not to share the email with his office. But he said his staff reviews every complaint it receives so it can determine if further investigation is necessary. 
“Information received by this office, in whatever format, is reviewed in order to determine whether it is suggestive of a potential ethics violation and whether more information should be gathered,” Lewandowski said. 
Sen. Stephen Harding, the Republican minority leader, argued that DECD’s failure to disclose the allegations against McCrory was a misstep on the part of the Lamont administration. And he said the legislature needs to determine why that information was not shared with the proper authorities. 
“I think it is incumbent upon us to provide some oversight on the legislative side,” Harding said.
The Democratic Party holds a supermajority in both chambers of the Connecticut General Assembly, but Harding argued that lawmakers should serve as a check on state agencies and officials that are responsible for distributing millions of dollars in taxpayer money. 
“There needs to be repercussions and regulations surrounding that,” Harding said this week. 
Watson, DECD’s spokesman, said attorneys who are representing the state instructed agency officials not to talk about how they responded to the allegations directed at McCrory. 
“We do not know what the federal investigators would consider relevant, and in order to preserve the integrity of the investigation, we should not identify potential witnesses until such time as the government has had a chance to review the voluminous documents produced and identify whom it considers relevant witnesses,” Watson said. 
Records obtained by the CT Mirror show McCrory continued to push for funding for Cicero and her businesses after 2023. 
Lamont’s office said that DECD and other agencies were put in a tough position in recent years of managing millions of dollars in grant funding, while dealing with state lawmakers who were pushing for state and federal money to go to specific causes and organizations that they supported. 
Blanchard said DECD officials had to decide how to handle questions from McCrory, who was “passionately” advocating for a particular recipient in his district.
“The bottom line is that DECD was put in a difficult spot managing legislators,” Blanchard said.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/MCCRORYHVAC1107-SR-1-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-11-21 05:56:52.455465

Ohio utility regulators handed down a quarter billion-dollar penalty Wednesday against FirstEnergy for its part in the Ohio House Bill 6 political bribery and utility bailout scandal.
The Public Utility Commission of Ohio decision comes more than five years after former Ohio House Speaker Larry Householder was indicted, and the Ohio Consumers’ Counsel sought a review of FirstEnergy’s conduct.
Ohio House Bill 6
The tainted legislation tacked charges onto Ohioans’ electric bills to bail out aging coal plants.
According to a deferred prosecution agreement with the U.S. Department of Justice, the company admitted to funneling almost $60 million to Householder to pass the bill and neuter a referendum effort.
“These funds represent an unnerving shadow over our regulatory role in this State and have harmed each and every consumer whose interests we aim to protect in proceedings before us,” the PUCO’s order said.

The bulk of the PUCO’s penalty gets chalked up a provision in Ohio law requiring triple damages when a regulated utility violates state law.
That turned the $60 million slush fund into $180 million in customer restitution. The commission ordered FirstEnergy to refund customers with a bill credit over three billing cycles.
Still, even with triple damages, that amount falls far short of the complete refund many challengers were seeking.
Under H.B. 6, FirstEnergy collected about $460 million from customers through surcharges on their monthly bills to fund grid modernization.
Challengers like the Ohio Consumers’ Counsel argued the company should pay it all back with interest.
But commissioners determined, “the more appropriate amount of restitution to be the very amounts paid in furtherance of the H.B. 6 activities.”
The former chairman
The commission also ordered the company to pay a little more than $40 million in penalties related to bribes it paid to former PUCO chairman Sam Randazzo.
The payments began in 2013, well before Randazzo joined the commission.
In its order, the PUCO found that consulting agreement with a Randazzo controlled company amounted to a corporate separation violation.
Former FirstEnergy executive sheds light on Ohio HB 6 machinations, denies culpability

FirstEnergy, the distribution company, is a regulated monopoly. But it’s affiliate, FirstEnergy Solutions, operated in the unregulated energy generation market.
The problem is Randazzo’s work was meant to benefit FirstEnergy Solutions, but it got billed to FirstEnergy, effectively charging everyday Ohio ratepayers for Randazzo’s services.
In its order, the commission wrote, “the severity of the violation involved and pattern developed over the course of a number of years requires the maximum forfeiture to be assessed.”
The penalty amounted to $21.78 million, or $25,000 a day for the roughly two years that agreement was in place before it was amended with a ‘side deal’ in 2015.
The commission also assessed a $10,000 a day penalty for the more than five years between inking the 2015 side deal and publicly disclosing it in a federal financial filing in 2021. That fine amounted to $18.93 million.
In a separate order, the PUCO levied an additional $23.36 million penalty for corporate separation violations unrelated to H.B. 6.
Reactions
Alongside its order, the PUCO issued statements from the commissioners.
PUCO Chair Jenifer French insisted they “have followed the facts wherever they may lead.”
“These proceedings were the first, and we trust the last, of their kind,” she said. “It is our responsibility and duty to impose appropriate remedies so as to ensure that they are.”
The Ohio Manufacturers’ Association welcomed the decision but insisted the “PUCO’s job isn’t done yet.”
The organization warned regulators are still too willing to accept the utilities’ word when it comes to future projections.
The association is currently appealing a PUCO decision on data centers in the Ohio Supreme Court.
The group argues, in part, that utilities haven’t backed up their forecasts about future power demand.
“Ohio manufacturers won’t tolerate anything less than a fair, transparent energy market,” Ohio Manufacturers Association President Ryan Augsburger said.
“When corruption is ignored, ratepayers get fleeced. Today’s long-overdue action makes clear that accountability isn’t optional and Ohio’s job creators won’t be the ones footing the bill.”
Karin Nordstrom, a clean energy attorney with the Ohio Environmental Council, said the ruling sent a clear message that corruption won’t be tolerated.
“At a time when Ohioans’ electric bills are skyrocketing, the Commission has finally acted to hold FirstEnergy accountable for H.B. 6, forcing FirstEnergy to repay its customers for money it unduly collected,” she said.
Ohio Consumers’ Counsel Maureen Willis said, “Ohioans should never be made to pay for corporate misconduct.”
“Ohioans expect and deserve fair utility bills and utility companies that follow the law,” Willis said.
“Today’s PUCO order requiring fines, restitution and refunds is an important milestone in fixing the harms FirstEnergy caused.”

(Photo by David DeWitt, Ohio Capital Journal.)A Republican Ohio Senator wants to regulate natural kratom products and ban the synthetic version, while Gov.

Ohio Senate Bill 299 would require those who sell, distribute and make kratom to register with the Ohio Department of Agriculture. 
The bill would also prohibit synthetic 7-hydroxymitragynine, known as 7-OH, limiting it to no more than one milligram in products. 
Kratom products would only be sold to adults 18 and older under the bill. 
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Ohio Sen. Bill Blessing, R-Colerain Township, introduced the bill which had sponsor testimony Tuesday during the Ohio Senate General Government Committee meeting. 
“This legislation seeks to establish kratom product standards, labeling requirements, age restrictions, and rulemaking so consumers can make more informed decisions and so we can protect young Ohioans from the risks associated with this substance,” he said. 
Kratom is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia and its leaves can be crushed and smoked, brewed or placed in gel capsules. Consuming it at low doses can lead to stimulant effects while high doses can lead to sedative effects. People often take kratom to treat chronic pain, opioid dependence, anxiety and depression. 
The 2023 National Survey on Drug Use & Health estimates there are 1.6 million annual kratom users in the United States. Reported side effects of kratom include high blood pressure, confusion, seizures, weight loss, vomiting, dizziness, and drowsiness. 
Kratom is not controlled under the Controlled Substances Act and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration warns against using kratom because of adverse risk effects such as liver toxicity, seizures and substance use disorder. 
The synthetic version of kratom, concentrated with 7-OH, is an opioid-like substance and over the summer the FDA recommended scheduling 7-OH products under the Controlled Substances Act. The FDA clarified they are not focused on natural kratom leaf products. 
Poison control centers in the United States received than 3,400 reports about kratom use — including death — from 2014 to 2019, according to the Mayo Clinic. Kratom was the cause of death in more than 200 unintentional overdoses deaths in Ohio from 2019 to 2024, according to preliminary data from the Ohio Department of Health. 
However, most deaths from kratom also involved other drugs or substances, according to the National Institute on Drug Abuse. 
During his testimony, Blessing talked about an Ohio man who took his own life this fall after his family said he became addicted to synthetic kratom and experienced severe withdrawal symptoms. 
“The goal of this legislation is to prevent tragedies like this one from occurring by creating common-sense regulations that ensure product safety and protect consumers,” he said. “By treating kratom in the same manner as other botanical products, Ohio can prioritize public health while promoting consumer choice and supporting responsible commerce.”
DeWine called on the Ohio Board of Pharmacy to designate all natural and synthetic kratom compounds as illegal drugs at the end of August, but paused his call for a kratom ban after talking with Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. 
“These modified kratom products, sold online and in stores, are essentially legal, over-the-counter opiates that anyone – including kids – can buy with just a few bucks,” DeWine said in an Aug. 25 statement. 
It is illegal to buy, use or possess kratom in Alabama, Arkansas, Indiana, Louisiana, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Wisconsin. Kratom is illegal in some countries including Australia, Denmark, Israel, and Japan, among others. 
Similar kratom bills have passed in Utah, Georgia, Arizona, and Nevada, Blessing said.

(Photo by Win McNamee/Getty Images)Six months ago, I wrote a piece arguing against the inclusion of a 10-year moratorium on state artificial intelligence regulation in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. 
The 10-year moratorium aimed to prevent states and political subdivisions from enacting their own regulations on AI development and deployment. This would have made it impossible for school boards, town councils, or any other local government organization to regulate AI.
Fortunately, enough members of Congress heard my plea and the plea of the American public and decided against its inclusion in the bill. However, everything in politics gets a return. 
What was once a near miss has now been revived by President Trump and could become a full-blown AI policy disaster.
Moratorium on state AI policies: part deux  
Shortly after his working lunch with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, President Trump posted twice on Truth Social about national AI policy. Both messages appeared within a span of just 40 minutes and stated: 
“Investment in AI is helping to make the U.S. Economy the ‘HOTTEST’ in the World — But overregulation by the States is threatening to undermine this Growth Engine. Some States are even trying to embed DEI ideology into AI models, producing ‘Woke AI’ (Remember Black George Washington?). We MUST have one Federal Standard instead of a patchwork of 50 State Regulatory Regimes. We can do this in a way that protects children AND prevents censorship!”
“Investment in AI is helping to make the U.S. Economy the ‘HOTTEST’ in the World, but overregulation by the States is threatening to undermine this Major Growth ‘Engine.’ Some States are even trying to embed DEI ideology into AI models, producing ‘Woke AI’ (Remember Black George Washington?). We MUST have one Federal Standard instead of a patchwork of 50 State Regulatory Regimes. If we don’t, then China will easily catch us in the AI race. Put it in the NDAA, or pass a separate Bill, and nobody will ever be able to compete with America.”
Take his comments about diversity, equity, and inclusion as you will. The germane part of these posts is his use of the word “[i]nvestment.” The Saudi royal family has invested billions of dollars into AI development and has a keen interest in influencing American policies to secure this investment. 
Given the rapid-fire nature of his posts, President Trump appears eager to secure more investment from the royal family by supplanting state regulations with a single federal AI policy. While he suggests that this policy could be crafted into its own bill, there is early word out of D.C. that he might try to move more expeditiously with an Executive Order, a constitutionally and legally tenuous approach at best. 
President Trump’s comment about adding a federal AI policy to the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) echoes recent comments made by House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, who has suggested the same approach. 
Majority Leader Scalise has even said that he is willing to “tuck in” the original language of the 10-year moratorium between NDAA’s pages. Lauded by the think tank R Street, that language reads:
“…no state or political subdivision may enforce, during the 10-year period beginning on the date of the enactment of this act, any law or regulation limiting, restricting, or otherwise regulating artificial intelligence models, artificial intelligence systems, or automated decision systems entered into interstate commerce.”
This time around, the language may see more revisions to get through Congress. After all, it was reduced to five years before ultimately being removed from the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. 
Regardless, the fact that this idea is being reintroduced underscores its intent: elimination of state-level regulations to maximize investment in, and accelerate the development of, AI.
A policy of this kind could lead to a litany of economic outcomes. A bigger AI bubble. More AI-related layoffs. Larger amounts of foreign investment. Advancements in chip development. Creation of AI-focused jobs. It could even lead to the onset of superintelligence. 
Whatever the economic outcome, we must consider the impact that such a moratorium could have on young, developing minds. These minds could be set adrift in a world of AI information consumption where the only regulating incentive is profit at all costs.
A federal issue, but local voices must be heard
AI regulation squarely falls under the Interstate Commerce Clause of the Constitution in the same way the internet does. 
My objection to a federal AI moratorium is not rooted in a states’ rights argument. Rather, it stems from a desire to reduce harm to young minds — an argument I’ve made ad nauseam.
If a moratorium lands on the Resolute Desk with language that restricts state and political subdivisions from crafting their own supplemental AI policies, we will end up in a situation where the people who know young minds best have no legal input into how AI influences their lives. 
State governments, school boards, administrators, local governments, and regulatory bodies would be left powerless to mitigate the harms and enhance the benefits from AI that they witness firsthand. 
AI is one of the most significant inventions in human history, and its potential benefits and harms are equally profound. We must adopt a layered approach to its regulation, one that looks beyond a federal-only, economically driven framework. 
When social media and smartphones emerged in the early 2000s, we failed to recognize and regulate their effects on young minds. We now face a similar moment with AI. It has the power to elevate an entire generation of young minds, or to harm them in unprecedented ways. It is essential that we not lose the ability at the local level to help manage this complex and consequential moment.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/trumpsaudi-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-21 04:56:24.224424

Across the country, many communities are seeing an increased presence of federal immigration agents. Chicago, Los Angeles and New York City have seen aggressive and sometimes violent tactics from ICE officers trying to apprehend people from the street and from their homes.

 Show Notes



In Episode 2 of our new Stories from the States podcast, you’ll meet Ayman Soliman, a former Cincinnati Children’s Hospital chaplain. He was detained by ICE for 73 days, and now shares his experience.
Soliman has been in the U.S. since 2014 fleeing persecution from the Egyptian government, where Ayman was detained and tortured for his work as a journalist. In 2018 he was granted asylum in the U.S.
However, his asylum was revoked in June and he was asked to meet with ICE officials on July 9. At the check-in, Ayman was detained by ICE and sent to Butler County Jail in Hamilton, Ohio.
Although the Trump administration contends that ICE is focused on detaining and deporting hardened criminals, Ayman disagrees.
ICE releases Ohio hospital chaplain. Case for detention unclear

“I don’t think these are the worst of the worst. This is just a statement that they made to convince the American public that these people deserve to be deported and to cover their racist reasons behind the deportation.”
With increased ICE raids, many U.S. citizens also have been swept up and detained. You’ll hear from Washington, D.C., Bureau reporter Ariana Figueroa, who has reported about this development.
Finally, Evening Wrap newsletter author Danielle Gaines shares the top stories she’s watching out for.

(Photo by Grant Baldwin/Getty Images)Lately, a weird thing has been happening in national political discussions. Things have gotten down-right conventional. The hum-drum of Washington seems to have returned.
And when things in Washington shift, that signals something new in Kansas politics, too.
Need evidence of the change?
First of all, Democratic politicians are focusing on affordability, of all things, as a tactic to destabilize President Donald Trump, who promised inflation-busting sorcery upon returning to the presidency. Affordability, however, seems down right boring compared to recent national political debates.
Also, the national government shutdown consumed politics during the last month, which gave me Newt Gingerich-era vibes from the 1990s. A central effect of this year’s shutdown was assistance to low-income families, in this case through Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits. That debate reminded me most of even older debates: the misleading 1980s ‘welfare queen’ rhetoric of the Reagan administration when fiscal matters took center stage. 
Politics seemed certain to return to conventional turf when Democrats were forced to return to the bargaining table by nothing juicy: just airports and canceled flights.
And what is more typically Washingtonian than a Beltway sex scandal? The Epstein files scandal has members of Congress battling over who knew what and when. How vintage.
The change in national politics seems familiar, if not downright wholesome. The headlines are more predictable and politically anodyne after 10 years of political pandemonium powered by President Donald Trump.
We spent these years marinating in this MAGA slop: tawdry, inflammatory, corrupt and violent headlines. And many of us swore that one breaking news headline or another — or perhaps the weight of them all — would bring Trump down.
I certainly did. More than three years ago, I predicted the FBI’s raid on Mar-a-Lago would force Republicans to saunter away from Trump. Another extraordinary event on the Trump timeline, the raid and the top secret, yet unsecured, files at his resort would have been the salacious and defining news about most former presidents.
In reaction, I wrote, “The president (that Republicans) once enabled might be doomed — not just legally, but also politically. And it might need to be enough for them to ignore him and to look away.”
Hearing this, his voters, we now know, shrugged.
Count the other past scandals that threatened him. The Access Hollywood tapes. The Stormy Daniels payoff. The Ukrainian phone call. The riot at the Capitol. The campaign rally at the White House.
In this age of climate change, so-called 100-year storms threaten us more often than the past. Similarly, the Trump presidency barraged us with a new scandal — “unprecedented!” — while we are still bailing our cognitive basements from the last one.
A decade living with this political dynamic makes the recent conventional politics seem alien. When Republicans refused this week to bend to Trump’s Epstein files demands, he relented. His iron grip on the GOP slipped, if for the first time. Many presidents have their tenures defined by these divisions within their party.
In opposing Trump, especially in his first term, Democrats appealed to high-minded American ideals: the future of democracy, the rule of law, eliminating corruption and respecting women. It turns out the basic retail politics might have been better strategies all along.
Stressing the rising cost of living, candidates earlier this month won races in New York City for mayor and Virginia for governor. Targeting the billionaire Trump on affordability is effective, because it’s simple.
Up until now, Trump’s scandals and flagrant actions have understandably distracted liberal groups. Talking about inflation when migrant children are being separated from their children would have seemed callous.
But it also might have been ruthlessly effective.
Overstating this moment as a watershed is tempting. This week’s headlines: “7 signs Trump is losing his groove,” from Politico. “Trump Approval Rating Hits Low Point Amid Epstein Controversy—Latest Sign Of GOP Discontent,” from Forbes. “The Day Republicans Beat Trump,” from New York Magazine.
Suddenly news organizations find it easy to find shadowy, brooding photos of Trump, seemingly mulling his demise.
Some of this optimism about siphoning off some of Trump’s power has nothing to do with political tactics. His term limit may be draining some of the jet fuel from his typical political leverage. Democrats shouldn’t get any credit for that.
Here’s another caveat. While the tactics of winning races and damaging Trump may have returned to the political status quo, the acts of this administration have not.
Yes, affordability is the Democratic message. Meanwhile, the White House flatters a crown prince accused of ordering the murder of a journalist, orders immigration raids to continue and flails at prosecuting Trump’s enemies. Similarly, Trump’s values will likely remain central in conservative politics even once his direct power fades.
For all of those reasons, we should wonder how this back-to-the-future moment will test Kansas politicians, from U.S. senators down to school board candidates. Will they be able to ride the enthusiasm within their party for Trump? Or will his declining popularity force them to distance themselves?
Is affordability enough to sway Kansas voters toward Democrats?
These startlingly conventional political questions are back, it seems. And the answers will define the next decade of our civic and cultural life as Kansans.

(Getty Images)Whenever Ohio’s gerrymandered Republican supermajorities in the Statehouse concoct new “culture war” bills to codify book bans, dictate lesson plans in school, mandate bathroom rules, erase marginalized youth, or outlaw diversity, equity and inclusion as the downfall of society, lawmakers always bray about the need to protect the vulnerable young from terrible MAGA imaginings. 
Yet these same disingenuous actors just passed an outrageous child exploitation measure last week as a cheap labor gift to businesses desperate to find workers. 
Ohio Senate Bill 50 is a sweet deal for companies looking to hire for less and work low-cost employees longer hours. 
Republican legislators want to put kids to work as young as 14 and 15 years old on night shifts for cheaper pay than adults. Let them work later at fast food restaurants after a full day of school, they say. Builds character, they say. Imparts valuable skills (over a hot fryer), they say. Helps them be successful, they say. 
Forget about protecting children from greedy corporations looking to maximize profits on the backs of middle schoolers. 
Senate Bill 50 is focused on relieving the burdens of employers battling labor shortages — not learning lapses from sleep-deprived child laborers who fall behind in school and life.
Key industries in the state can’t fill job openings with an ever-shrinking pool of available hires, exacerbated, in part, by the nearly sevenfold increase in ICE deportations of immigrant workers in Ohio this year. 
Exhibit A is Springfield, Ohio, ground zero for JD Vance’s hateful, dehumanizing campaign to eradicate a legal Haitian community welcomed as a revitalizing engine in the region. 
It devastated employers in the area who lost hard-working, reliable employees they can’t replace.
One exploitive solution Ohio and other red states have embraced is to supply companies with child laborers who can temporarily fill employment gaps (and company coffers) during the school year for practically nothing. 
Ohio Senate Bill 50 would allow employers to pay 14- and 15-year-old employees the federal $7.25 minimum wage to work late on school nights — instead of Ohio’s entry level wage of $10.70 per hour.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Ohio Republicans did their business pals and campaign donors a solid. 
They voted to use minors — who should be focused on school and being a kid — to mitigate a depleted labor base (as workers leave Ohio for opportunities or detention camps) and boost company earnings with bargain rate teenage hires.
Picture eighth and ninth graders on the payroll until 9 p.m., with their parents’ permission, as corporate net incomes balloon from revenue generated by sub-minimum wage middle schoolers who can’t even drive yet. 
These are kiddos in school before the sun comes up, off the bus in the afternoon, with friends or buried in homework in the interval and catching a ride to bus tables or man drive-through windows until closing time. 
Does it matter to anyone that Ohio’s youngest workers could get home and in bed by maybe 10:30-11:00 on a school night just to wake up early and do it all again? 
Apparently not in the General Assembly’s Republican caucus that overwhelmingly drove Ohio Senate Bill 50 to passage. 
The legislation clearly regards 14- and 15-year-olds as commodities in service to bottom-line business growth, not as developing children in vital school years who need protection from economic predators. 
The GOP measure was crafted to remedy a scarcity of labor problem, especially in the restaurant and hospitality sectors. 
It weakens century-old child labor protections with extended work schedules for the under 16 workforce that stretch beyond the 7 p.m. restriction stipulated in the federal child labor law.  
The prospect of exhausted teens sleepwalking through school to meet labor demands doesn’t raise eyebrows in Ohio’s ruling party. 
The teen labor bill is emblematic of how little state Republicans value public education as a paramount investment in future generations of Ohioans.
 So what if kids nod off in class, fall behind academically and never catch up if Chick-fil-A can save on hiring costs and plug job vacancies on closing shifts?
Of course, Ohio businesses who take advantage of the GOP’s largesse in Ohio Senate Bill 50, with low-paid, underage workers historically exploited and abused by employers, still risk federal child labor law violations. 
Unfortunately, enforcement of youth labor laws by the Department of Labor hasn’t been great and the number of minors employed in jobs that violate child labor laws is rising precipitously.
But the Ohio lawmakers who bray about protecting the very young from invented MAGA crises are the same ones putting them most in harm with a return to the bad old days of 1938 when Big Business notoriously pounced at the chance to exploit children working long hours for little pay in unsafe conditions without educational opportunities.  
We’re forfeiting the promising futures of school-age Ohio kids to accommodate employers who can’t get enough employees. 
That’s not character-building. That’s a crime.

(Photo by Jay Waagmeester/Florida Phoenix)The state’s school voucher program has exhibited “a myriad of accountability problems” and caused a funding shortfall for public schools, a state audit released this week shows.
The audit, encompassing the 2024-2025 school year, was presented this week to lawmakers, who are spending the weeks leading up to the legislative session learning the woes of the universal school voucher system in which, contrary to how it was marketed, “funding did not follow the child.”
Matthew Tracy, deputy auditor general for the state, presented the 22-page audit to each legislative education budget committee Thursday. Tracy’s team recommended the Legislature change the timing of scholarship application windows and provide more financial support to avoid funding shortfalls.
Sen. Don Gaetz, R-Crestview, said that at any given moment the state does not know where 30,000 students are in terms of school categories — traditional public or voucher-supported private or home schools — together worth $270 million in education support.

Gaetz spearheaded an unsuccessful bill last year, SB 7030, to change various parts of the voucher system. 
In 2024-2025, the department paid $655 million to middleman scholarship funding organizations, as statutes prescribe, before school started. That’s part of the questioned accounting practices. 
“Any improper payments, any ineligible amounts, you’re paying and chasing those amounts, because the dollar’s already gone out the door,” Tracy said. 
Last month, the House held committee meetings during which members asked scholarship funding organizations and the department about miscalculations and processes. Those meetings provided initial numbers of how many students were double-counted or lost in fuzzy accounting. For example, the state’s largest scholarship funding organization sent at least $7 million to families before verifying whether their students were attending a private school or homeschooling.
School daze: Rapid expansion of voucher program leaves public, private schools underpaid

Earlier this month, legislators approved a $47 million budget amendment to make up for traditional public schools shortchanged by the accounting inaccuracies at the end of the previous fiscal year, even after tapping into $118 million from the education stabilization fund, through which the Legislature can cover voucher-related budget overruns. In the meantime, some districts were caught off guard after education funding from the state ran dry. 
Foreseeable for some
Sen. Jennifer Bradley, R-Fleming Island, said the audit showed “a lot of concerning information.” 
“I wouldn’t say wholly unforeseeable, given the rapid expansion of the program in the last couple years — which has been a point of concern that I’ve had for many years here — is how are we going to make sure that we track students, have budget accountability, have budget predictability,” Bradley said. 
In the past four years, the voucher program has grown rapidly, serving about 500,000 students during the past school year. In 2021-2022, the program had served about 200,000 students. In 2024-2025, the program dished out $3.17 billion in Family Empowerment Scholarship vouchers and recorded another $804.5 million in scholarship programs funded through corporate tax credits, totaling nearly $4 billion dollars.  
In some respects, the state went “beyond” state law, but also missed “various opportunities … to further accountability over the use of State education funds and timelier and more effectively identify and halt duplicate payments and recoup ineligible amounts.”
“I’m disgusted; this is another, in eight years I’ve been here, ‘I told you so,’ and they’re just getting more and more expensive,” Sen. Jason Pizzo, NPA-Sunny Isles Beach, said. 
The audit found that as of June 30, the end of the last fiscal year, $36 million sat in scholarship accounts unspent as did more than $367 million in scholarship accounts for students with disabilities.
At the end of the 2024-25 school year, nearly 300 accounts for students with disabilities held “excess balances,” or more than $50,000 each in unspent money. The sum of the excess alone was $2.3 million. 










A family can’t run their family budget this way. They wouldn’t survive, they’d be in the street


– Sen. Jason Pizzo, NPA, Sunny Isles Beach


Pizzo focused on “float,” the lost value of interest that could be collected on money that is not in state hands when it could or should be. 
“Certainly, you could never close out books for a company or an organization the way this is,” Pizzo said, adding that “a bunch of [Department of Education] bureaucrats just don’t understand finance. This is so bad.”
Tracy said it “was not evident that the department had sufficient staff resources to perform its critical duties.”
“I think that this is a cautionary tale to what can happen if you don’t phase things in and you don’t take the appropriate and adequate amount of time with something as transformational as this program truly was,” Senate Appropriations Committee on Pre-K-12 Education Chair Sen. Danny Burgess, R-Zephyrhills, said.
The Department of Education said it has addressed concerns raised in the audit that directly implicate the department.
“We’re trusted with these dollars, and we kept using, ‘Does the department have the authority, the authority, the authority.’ I’m left myself asking, ‘Does the department have the ability to actually reconcile these issues?’” Pizzo said.

Separate silo
Gaetz said he will introduce a bill in the coming days to address these concerns. 
His bill, to be co-introduced by Burgess and Committee on Education Pre-K-12 Chair Sen. Corey Simon, R-Tallahassee, would separate the school choice scholarships from the Florida Education Finance Program (FEPF), the mechanism that funds traditional public schools, and would expand the education stabilization fund.
The auditor’s report recommended separating scholarship payments from the FEFP, making it a separate “silo” in the budget.
“The auditor general said in his meeting with the chair and myself that whatever can go wrong with this system has gone wrong,” Gaetz said. 
The bill would establish monthly payments to families and schools and provide student IDs to private school students, too, a focus of House committee hearings last month. 
“We do not have a perfect bill to introduce, but we have a bill which fixes these issues, which, left unaddressed, will continue to worsen and threaten to disrupt and imperil school choice in Florida,” Gaetz said. 
There seems to already be a difference in House and Senate approaches.
House PreK-12 Budget Subcommittee Chair Rep. Jenna Persons-Mulicka, R-Fort Myers, said moving scholarship funding outside of the FEFP “would be a huge mistake and that would end universal school choice in the state of Florida.”
Jenna Persons-Mulicka via Florida House
Persons-Mulicka said the problem is not the funding model, but instead the implementation of the program. 
“If you change the funding model, create a new funding model, who’s to say there still won’t be implementation problems?” Persons-Mulicka said. 
Included in the audit is the Department of Education’s response, which agreed with separating the the school choice programs from the FEFP.
“The Department acknowledges that, while the popularity and growth of the scholarship programs evidence their value and need, the administrative systems supporting these programs must keep pace with their implementation,” Education Commissioner Anastasios Kamoutsas wrote.
Gaetz said the program must be “partially reengineered.”
“We can’t just rearrange the deck chairs, we have to make sure that we change course in the ways that the auditor general has recommended,” Gaetz said.

That declaration states, in part, that all men are created equal and that they were endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights; among these being life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. 
We’ve been struggling, very largely unsuccessfully, with that mandate ever since.
In the context of its Black population, for instance, even some of the signers of the Declaration were slaveholders with no intentions of changing their own lifestyles by freeing them. Arguments between succeeding generations of slaveholders and Northern abolitionists became uglier over the next 85 years, and, as we painfully know, we fought a Civil War that killed in the neighborhood of 750,000 young Americans. 
It was also the prime cause of the assassination of perhaps our greatest president. For about 12 years, from 1865 until 1877, a period known as our Reconstruction Era, a number of national laws were adopted that were intended to correct many inequities in our culture. The 13th Constitutional Amendment, for instance, prohibited slavery almost entirely. The 14th Amendment granted full citizenship to all native- born and naturalized Americans as well as assuring them of due process and equal protection under established laws. The 15th Amendment provided full voting rights for all male citizens and enjoined all States from abridging these rights on the basis of race, color, or previous servitude. 
Most regrettably, however, between 1875 and 1894 a combination of Supreme Court rulings and Congressional enactments repealed most of the enforcement provisions of these laws. The result of those relaxations gave rise to an explosion of Southern laws and practices, referred to broadly as Jim Crow rules and regulations. These restraints segregated Black people from whites in schools, public accommodations, and economic opportunities. Those inequalities prevailed as legally unchallenged hardships for more than half a century. 
Finally, the Congress passed the Civil Rights Act in 1964 under enormous pressures from a civil rights movement that had gained political clout from the leadership of a number of Black citizens, especially from Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. 
The Civil Rights Act banned segregation in education, employment, and voting rights. The last of these was reinforced in 1965 with the passage of the Voting Rights Act, which banned racial discrimination in election processes in every state by ruling against things like literacy tests, language proficiency, or skin color standards. In the meantime, starting in the mid-1800’s, the issue of women’s rights had been pursued by several female activists like Elizabeth Cady Stanton and a female suffrage amendment was first considered by the Congress in 1878. Unbelievably enough, It took a full four decades for the 19th Amendment to get ratified.
Two kinds of inequalities
With all of that history, then, where have we arrived in terms of people equality in the 21st Century? Sociologists advise us that despite considerable legal restraints, our practices and our culture are rife with two pervasive kinds of inequalities; the structural racist sort and the more foundational systemic category. 
The former is rooted in many historical injustices, like segregation and broad discrimination in a variety of forms. It is manifest in any number of ways. For instance, the quality of available educational opportunities is impacted in many communities by biased taxation policies that assess white-owned properties at higher rates than Black or recent immigrant sites. This results in more funds being allocated to the former school districts than the latter. This, in turn, means better facilities and better teaching. 
Another source of inequalities is vested in health care systems that are based fundamentally on abilities to pay. Less affluent members of our society can and do have less access to top notch care than their more monied peers. Statistics have demonstrated that there are serious national financial implications of socially differentiated health care. 
It is estimated that nationally we lose about $175 billion annually from our potential GDP because of shortened working life spans.   Systemic racism is rooted in our belief systems and various inappropriate ideologies. We notice it when we observe talk and initiatives such as the white Christian nationalism cult, which totally ignores the reality that America is a nation of immigrants and hypocritically talks about their commitment to core Christian values while violating them in their demeaning behavior. 
We also suffer from ethnic and racial stereotyping which is displayed in everyday biased activities like law enforcement where minorities are much too often treated more harshly than others for similar conduct.
Addressing these cultural inequalities effectively will require vastly different leadership than what we have elected to national, state, and local offices recently. 
Our current national government is continuously installing divisive measures that tear at the foundations of our United States. It is startling to see masked ICE troops, President Trump’s private police force, roaming the streets, homes and offices of America and forcibly detaining people without grounds or due legal process.
These outrages mirror the same sort of atrocities carried out by Mussolini’s Italian Blackshirts and Hitler’s German Brownshirts in the 1930’s. But then, when you have someone behaving like a narcissistic megalomaniac in charge of our government, one who openly admires the style of dictators, why should we be surprised?  
Astonishing levels of inequality
Economically, we have astonishing  levels of inequality between the compensation of policy-level office holders and their employees. Recent analysis has revealed that on average, CEOs are compensated 285 times the pay of their workforces. In some extreme cases, typically reflecting the discriminations applied to racial minorities and immigrants, the multipliers are above 600. 
Companies such as Starbucks have been glaring examples of that kind of inequality, but such dubious distinctions are clearly shared by many other organizations in areas like household services and healthcare. Responsible analyses of relative real values added by the respective levels of employment would surely demonstrate the unfairness of these gaps. 
In a different category, although some positive improvement has been realized very recently, women across the nation are still being paid an average of 17% less than their male counterparts for similar responsibilities at work. In the tax and legislative area, something referred to as a “Big Beautiful Bill” by its Republican sponsors was passed into law by Congress under severe pressure from the White House. This measure, besides adding close to $4 trillion dollars to what is now an unsustainable national debt, severely cut back funding for Medicaid, effectively blocking access to prime medical support for huge numbers of America’s low-income cohort. It also provided major tax breaks for the wealthiest less than 1% of our country while raising the cost of living for most of the rest of us, as the impacts of the current outrageous and internationally divisive tariff/tax instruments kick in.
 Voter apathy let this happen
So how did this inequality calamity come about? How has America developed more children and seniors living in poverty than any other nation in the developed world?
That is a complicated question, but widespread disaffection with government, which is shared by every age group of our current and recent electorate, is a significant part of the answer. Additionally, the 50% or so of eligible voters, who even bother to exercise their voting franchise, typically re-elect about 90% of incumbent Congressional officeholders without meaningful concern for their performances in office. 
This pervasive lack of accountability has allowed a self-privileged political class to settle into the instruments of national governance. Based on their recent fear of being primaried, Republicans doing the servile work of bowing to Trump’s specious whims have given us all the evidence we need to conclude that keeping their jobs is their dominant motivation; public interests be damned. 
Name-calling, retributive investigations and indictments, pay-for-play transactions, ignorance and disregard for laws and precedents dominate the current legislative and executive scenes. Crackpot theories, contempt for proven science, astonishing levels of corruption, and implementing the democracy-debilitating Project 2025 doctrine’s provisions have left no intent or room for dealing with climate change, gun violence, or other existential issues. 
As this was being written, millions of unhappy Americans assembled across all of America to express their dismay and anger toward our current government in “No Kings” protests. That is a strong message for our government to get back to working on what is best for our people. It is an important way to keep pressure on Congress and the Administration. regrettably, however, real positive change can only be affected at the ballot box.
The hour is already late for developing a game-changing number of truly honest and conflict-ready candidates for national office in 2026 mid-term elections. The Democrats, to borrow a phrase from David Corn’s Mother Jones newsletter, need to quit bringing policy papers to a gunfight. 
Serious but peaceful activism for the people’s benefit needs to be stimulated among ALL OF THE ELECTORATE in every local precinct, neighborhood, town, city and state. Our schools, societies and professional associations can add important muscle to the arguments for full and truthful expressions of our history as well as for the honest and reasonably regulated conduct of our diverse businesses. Our churches of every denomination can address the entire issue of inequality, especially where ugly immorality is so often present.
Nothing less than our fundamental freedoms are at stake.

Peter Auster, chief scientist
My first experience visiting this vast wonder was in 1978, when conducting marine mammal surveys.  Every single time I went out to the shelf edge, I knew I was entering an unfamiliar world. The color of the water changed. The scent of the air was different. I encountered marine wildlife I had never seen before. In 1984, I first experienced what is now the Monument from the underwater side in a research submersible. It really is like visiting a part of the planet that few have witnessed firsthand before. It’s the twilight zone and the deep ocean. It’s a true marine wilderness.
Each visit after that reinforced the idea that we need to protect these animals and their habitats from long-term harm.
In 2001, my colleagues and I led the first leg of the first expedition for National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s (NOAA) new ocean exploration program. I had the privilege to dive into the deep-sea gorges that run deeper than the Grand Canyon and discover the beauty underneath the surface. It was like something out of a Dr. Suess book. Large and colorful sea creatures like deep-sea corals and fish with strange appendages wandered by the viewports. The beauty and wonder of it all ran from the sky to the seafloor.
The Northeast Canyons and Seamounts were officially designated a marine national monument in 2016, after years of advocacy for the creatures and habitats that reside there.  But over the last decade, presidential administrations have played tug-of-war with the monument’s vital protections.  


During the first Trump administration, the monument’s protections were rolled back, making the Northeast Canyons and Seamounts vulnerable to disturbances from commercial-scale fishing. During the Biden Administration, these protections were reinstated.  Now, in a second Trump administration, we find the Northeast Canyons and Seamounts to be threatened again under the guise of freeing the fishing industry from regulation and increasing seafood market competitiveness.
Opening the Northeast Canyons and Seamounts, or any marine national monument, to commercial-scale fishing has serious consequences for these protected areas, which serve as places of refuge for marine wildlife and the habitats in which they live. Commercial fishing removes and displaces wildlife, impacts biodiversity, and alters ecosystems. We need these protected places to understand the impacts of our activities elsewhere in the sea. But monuments don’t only exist to serve scientists. Most important, the existence of monuments further humanity’s goals of preserving the planet we live on and our collective natural heritage. Monuments serve as a contribution to, and an example for, global conservation efforts.
Much of my career has focused on exploring how ocean ecosystems work, human impacts in the sea, and how we balance human needs and the obligation to protect sensitive and vulnerable places for which we are stewards. The Northeast Canyons and Seamounts are under threat of being harmed in ways from which they may never recover.  The area is 1.5% of US waters in the Atlantic region and 0.11% of waters under US jurisdiction in all oceans.  Why is this such a problem? Opening this monument to commercial scale fishing will do nothing substantial to improve catch or markets for the industry.
It is more important than ever to stand up for ocean wildlife, ocean places, and our marine monuments and sanctuaries that draw us to the sea. Our future, and our natural heritage, depend on it.

Carl Jackson (D-Baltimore County) and Del. Ryan Nawrocki (R-Baltimore County) discuss a bill that would bring the county's schools under the gaze of the county inspector general. (Photo by Steve Crane/Maryland Matters)Baltimore County lawmakers said Thursday that they will introduce bills that could give the county’s Office of Inspector General oversight over the Baltimore County Public Schools.
The bills, introduced by Sen. Carl Jackson (D-Baltimore County) and Del. Ryan Nawrocki (R-Baltimore County, come in response to an August resolution by the county council, asking the General Assembly for the authority to bring the county board of education under the inspector general. If passed, it would be up to the council to make the change, which would likely not come before 2027.
At a news conference in Annapolis to announce the bills, Jackson and Nawrocki were joined by Baltimore County Council Chair Mike Ertel and County Councilman David Marks. All four said the proposal was not a response to any single incident at the school system but was solely an attempt to increase accountability and transparency for parents and taxpayers, what one referred to as “just good government stuff.”
“This is not to cast aspersions,” but to be as transparent and accountable as possible, Nawrocki said. Jackson and others noted that the school systems in Montgomery and Prince George’s counties are both subject to independent oversight, and that it only makes sense for Baltimore County schools to be subject to external review as well — more than just audits, but investigations if necessary.

The county council resolution, which passed 6-1, only cited the “very public controversy this year over the County School System’s budget,” which makes now “the appropriate time to advance more transparency and accountability in the County Board of Education.”
“We have a great school system,” said Ertel, before noting that it accounts for about half the county’s budget in a given year. “There is not necessarily anything nefarious or criminal. This just puts another set of eyes on the system.”
When asked for comment on the legislation, a school system spokesperson noted that Superintendent Myriam Rogers “was asked at a previous press conference and shared that BCPS is committed to working closely with all partners,” and that the system would have no further comment.
Ertel said the inspector general’s office would likely need additional staff to take on the county school system. It’s not unrealistic to think that the office might have to double its staff of six, given the fact that adding the school system would be doubling the size of the government it reviews, but he said there have been no talks on when or how an expansion might occur.
“It’s not a big line item for the taxpayer,” given the potential savings that could come from inspector general review, Ertel said. The potential for savings was echoed by others.
The legislature tried unsuccessfully to pass similar legislation in 2021, including a bill by then-Sen. Kathy Klausmeier (D), who was sworn in as county executive earlier this year to replace Johnny Olszewski Jr. after he was elected to Congress.
Jackson and Nawrocki said they know there will be some opposition to their bills in the county delegation, but that the overall response among their colleagues has been positive and they are optimistic about the legislation’s chances. The fact that a Democratic senator and a Republican delegate could come together to push the legislation shows it’s broadly supported and augurs well for its chances, they said.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_1944-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-11-21 09:57:54.237209

As youth sports nationally grow “insanely” popular — including volleyball in powerhouse Husker territory — club co-founder and president Tony Carrow said he hopes to build a new home.

He foresees a $63 million sports complex in Douglas County bumping up tourism, spurring new commercial development and helping to stop the slow bleed of young people from the state. 
But the proposed 181,000-square-foot complex that could involve the Omaha Supernovas won’t happen, he told a state board on Thursday, without a public incentive available through the Sports Arena Facility Financing Assistance Act (SAFFAA).
A sticking point for that project — as well as eight others that in the past year have requested the incentive —  is that under the Nebraska law, Gov. Jim Pillen’s vote of approval must be among the board’s majority before the project moves on to other necessary hurdles, such as local votes of the people. 
Pillen missed the last two board meetings. The state’s lieutenant governor filled in for him Thursday and also at an October meeting. Pillen attended the board meeting prior to that, last December, but no action was taken on any application.
Thursday, following a public meeting that stretched nearly five hours, the board did not vote on any of the four projects presented. A Pillen spokesperson later told the Nebraska Examiner that the governor would not vote on any of the proposals until June 2026 at the earliest.
 Loopholes, carveouts

Spokesperson Laura Strimple referred to the incentive as a “government handout” and said any of the applicants could move forward by opting for private funding.
“Governor Pillen will not be a party to further erosion of Nebraska’s sales tax base with new loopholes and carveouts when there is still not a reliable indication from the Legislature that existing sales tax loopholes and imbalances can be closed and corrected to achieve lasting and transformative property tax relief,” she said in a statement.

Pillen has tried for years to get lawmakers to broaden the state sales tax base by eliminating exemptions so he can use the money to offset local property taxes.
Strimple said that by June, the Legislature would have had a chance “to remedy our Swiss cheese sales tax code and create a healthy tax environment for some of these projects to succeed.”
As it stands now, nine proposed projects by applicants from Omaha to Valentine await the board’s action. 
Here’s how the financing incentive generally works: For bigger cities, up to 70% of new state sales taxes generated within 600 yards of the sports facility goes to help pay off bonds for construction. The “new” tax revenue generated refers to sales on tickets or at retailers that sprout in the designated area after the project is announced. In most cases, city voters must approve the use of such bonds. For smaller cities, the state assistance, or turnback, is up to 25% of the new state sales taxes generated. 
 Applicants left waiting 

Four applicants on Thursday presented their case for the state assistance: 

Douglas County is a co-applicant with Nebraska Elite Volleyball. The sports complex would rise near 180th Street and West Maple Road and contain 12 full-sized volleyball courts, six full-sized indoor basketball courts, two full-sized indoor sand volleyball courts and more than 10,000 square feet of multipurpose space for events and viewing. 
City of Gretna with co-applicant Wolf Pack Sports Foundation. Project: $28.5 million sports complex featuring cheer athletics (six full-sized spring floors, two full-sized dead floors, tumbling tunnel, dance space and training areas) and five full-sized basketball courts convertible for volleyball courts.
City of West Point. Project: $8.1 million recreation center including two multi-purpose courts that can be partitioned off to make four smaller courts for an array of youth and adult sports such as basketball, baseball, pickleball and a walking track.
City of La Vista. Project: $48.31 million parking facility to serve The Astro, a privately-owned concert venue at the City Centre development.  

Brett Lindstrom, who, as a former state lawmaker, championed amendments to the turnback tax law that were adopted in 2021, told the board and an overflowing hearing room that he did not see a loss to the state. The law was modified even more later. Lindstrom argues that the facilities will draw tourism-related dollars as facilities host tournaments and events.

Lindstrom and others talked about how states beyond Nebraska are capitalizing on the youth sports industry. He said new facilities would help “level the playing field” for the state. 
Craig Wolf, who is driving the application for the Gretna cheer facility, said he was disappointed the governor was not present to hear testimony from youths, employers and supporters.
“Every single one of these should be approved, not because it’s a money grab. We are so far behind,” he said. “This project is not just an investment in the building. It is an investment in people and the future of our state.”
 Filling hotels

Robert Sabin, general manager of Hilton Omaha, spoke of hotel occupancy spikes due to tournaments such as the ASICS Presidents Day extravaganza hosted in February by Elite Volleyball. Tourism officials describe it as a four-day, $10 million annual event based at the organization’s current Elkhorn home, the Union Bank and Trust facility.
“This tournament delivers like no other,” Sabin said.
He said the proposed facility could nearly double that tournament activity — “and fill hotels from Columbus to Lincoln.”
Tyler Toline, president and CEO of Franciscan Care Services in West Point, said his hospital is contributing to the cost of the proposed sports facility in West Point. Other project applicants say they have funding sources beyond the incentive as well. Toline sees the project in his city as a way to attract workers, saying that medical and health care recruits commonly ask: What is there to do for my family?
“The biggest thing they want is amenities for their kids,” said Toline, a former Husker football player. 
Deb Carlson, president and CEO of Nebraska Methodist College, sees a connection between Wolf’s cheer athletic facility and the labor force. She explained how Wolf introduced himself to her at a state workforce summit, adding that she knew nothing then about the competitive cheer scene.

Wolf wanted to create a pathway for his athletes, who currently train at a smaller La Vista gym, Carlson said. The first four students who came to see her exhibited traits Carlson called critical to caring for people, including discipline, teamwork and resiliency. She offered them scholarships on the spot.
“Having those qualities in our students is what we’re all looking for,” Carlson said. “Cheer athletes know what it means to fall and get back up.”
 Brain drain plug

La Vista Mayor Doug Kindig said the state assistance will help fund parking facilities related to The Astro concert venue, which draws world-class entertainment to the City Centre campus. 
While not the typical application, La Vista officials said SAFFAA was written to also promote construction of publicly owned parking facilities near a privately owned concert venue like The Astro.
Kindig said the parking structure would further two critical goals: attracting tourism and retaining young people who want to be in a vibrant community. He said the city already has seen an increase in young visitors to the City Centre development and knows parking is key.
“The city also shares the goal of attracting visitors to spend their disposable income in La Vista as  it will boost sales tax revenues and reduce our property tax burden,” he said in a letter to state officials.
Five other SAFFA applications were pending prior to Thursday:

City of Norfolk with co-applicant Northeast Nebraska Youth Sports Association. Project: $31.57 million two-phase sports complex.


City of  Valley with co-applicant Elkhorn Athletic Association. Project: $11.1 for the second phase of the First Interstate SportsPlex, whose total price tag was $24.8 million. Four additional baseball/softball fields, new concession and restroom building, maintenance building and paved parking lot for 1,800 vehicles.


City of Valentine. Project: $9.38 million enclosed, city-owned multi-venue wellness center and competitive sports complex that includes two multipurpose sports courts, a fitness center, walking track, coaching classrooms and parking. 


City of Lincoln and co-applicant N4VB (Nebraska for Volleyball). Project: $17.2 million youth sports complex with minimum of eight indoor volleyball courts with capacity to expand to 12 courts and associated uses such as performance training and concessions areas.


City of Omaha with co-applicant Omaha Performing Arts. Project: Promote arts and culture through education and engagement activities in the new downtown Omaha Tenaska Center and across the state. Funds would come from state sales tax generated from Steelhouse Omaha, estimated at $2 million a year. 

 Former Husker players

Former Nebraska Heisman Trophy winning quarterback Eric Crouch made an appeal to Pillen in a letter regarding the Valley project. Crouch is a co-founder of EAA, which is seeking the incentive.
“I can only imagine how many lives this will change and dreams that will come true,” he said. “I see this area being a destination for many athletes, fans, families and sports enthusiasts for years to come.”

The applicants expect ancillary development of about $28 million, including restaurants, a hotel and retail space. By year five, they foresee nearly 19,000 hotel room night stays and $31 million in annual economic impact from operations and off-site spending.
Visit Omaha’s former executive director Deborah Ward said in a letter that the first phase of the Valley project, in just the first six months of 2024, welcomed more than 9,000 out of town visitors from cities such as Chicago, Minneapolis, Denver and Los Angeles.  
EAA says it currently serves more than 8,000 kids annually in 10 sports from over 75 zip codes. Proposed enhancements, additional fields will attract even larger events and boost visitor numbers and economic impact, supporters said. EAA foresees nearly one million local and regional visitors to the complex annually upon completion.
“The facility has become a new destination for regional and national tournaments and its continued success helps sustain Omaha’s reputation as a premier sports destination,” Ward said. 
 Sports, a ‘powerful tool’

Andrew Wehrli, volleyball coach at Omaha Westside High School, during the Thursday hearing echoed sentiments of many who spoke about the value sports have to youth, in developing mentally tough young people.
He spoke of how he was raised by an abusive dad who had him believing he was “worthless” until coaches stepped in.
“Sports are a powerful tool that changed the trajectory of my life,” he said. “My story is just one of many.”

(Photo by Danielle J. Brown/Maryland Matters)State officials and anti-homelessness organizations  said they fear a shift in federal funding priorities could result in thousands of Marylanders who now benefit from permanent housing assistance, instead facing homelessness once again.
The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development last week announced policy changes that cut funding from permanent housing solutions for people experiencing homelessness, opting for an emphasis on temporary housing supports.
HUD Secretary Scott Turner said in a statement that the change “restores accountability to homelessness programs and promotes self-sufficiency among vulnerable Americans.”
“It redirects the majority of funding to transitional housing and supportive services, ending the status quo that perpetuated homelessness through a self-sustaining slush fun,” his statement said.
But Maryland Housing Secretary Jake Day says the funding change would cut $42 million from Maryland programs that help provide permanent housing options to people struggling with homelessness.
He warns that move could land 4,300 formerly unhoused people back out onto the street.

“The Trump Administration’s decision will directly result in a 25 percent spike in homelessness across Maryland. It will reverse decades of progress to reduce unsheltered homelessness,” Day said in a statement Thursday.
“It will force domestic violence survivors to return to abusive households and unaccompanied youth to couchsurf with strangers,” Day said. “And it will increase burdens on hospital emergency departments, fire, police, EMS, and shelters.”
Concerns from advocates primarily revolve around funding changes for a program called Continuum of Care. A recent Notice of Funding Opportunity for the program raised alarm bells for housing advocates.
The National Low Income Housing Coalition says the policy changes “will quickly upend homelessness response systems throughout the country and increase homelessness.”
“The new policy … slashes support for permanent housing programs by more than half, putting as many as 170,000 people who rely on CoC assistance for stable, affordable housing at risk of returning to homelessness,” the coalition said.
The coalition said that about 87% of the $3.5 billion typically allocated for Continuum of Care goes to permanent housing solutions for people facing homelessness. The recent funding notice would reduce the amount allocated for permanent housing down to 30%, or little more than $1 billion, with a preference for temporary housing options.
Groups like the National Low Income Housing Coalition say the temporary options — such as high-barrier transitional housing or emergency shelters — can be less effective and cost more in the long run.
People facing chronic homelessness often struggle with mental health needs and drug addiction. Advocates say that permanent housing programs may address those challenges by pairing with connections to mental health services and other resources.
Scott touts reduction of thousands of vacant Baltimore properties since 2020

“Funding goes to communities for a range of homelessness assistance,” said Kevin Lindamood, president and CEO for Health Care for the Homeless in Maryland, during a virtual roundtable discussion Thursday with Maryland agency leaders. “But over the last 20 years, in a very bipartisan way, HUD funding has been moving much toward helping people find housing and keeping it.”
Housing advocates say that moving away from the permanent housing solutions will undo progress made in recent years to reduce the number of homeless people across the United States, including in Maryland.
Day said that “Housing First” policies have been effective over the last decade.
“Utilizing Housing First practices, we have cut unsheltered homelessness by 42% and overall homelessness by 28% since 2015,” he said. “The experts and bipartisan officials agree: permanent supportive housing is the evidence-based practice that most effectively and most affordably solves homelessness.
“$46 million in cuts to Maryland’s funding allocation will result in more than 2,400 Maryland households – including 4,300 people and 1,900 children – losing their homes,” Day said. “With no available vouchers, no surplus of affordable units, and no alternatives to absorb this massive displacement, the vast majority will be forced straight back into homelessness.”

Dominguez detailed plans for a  potential new power generation facility in Harford County. (Photo by Christine Condon/Maryland Matters)There’s a slight hitch in Constellation Energy’s plan to construct a new natural-gas fired power plant in Maryland: The potentially prohibitive cost of delivering natural gas to the proposed Harford County site.
“We will need some help on that,” Constellation CEO Joe Dominguez told a room full of policymakers, businesspeople and lobbyists Thursday. “I was told that the gas interconnection — the extension of the gas to the site to enable these things — is something like $800 million.”
His comments came in a speech at the Maryland Chamber of Commerce’s 2025 Policy Forum at the University of Maryland, College Park. Dominguez laid out Constellation’s plans for more energy generation, challenged state lawmakers to help — both financially and in terms of policy — and railed against the idea that electric utilities, such as Exelon, would be allowed to get back in the business of power generation, in competition with Constellation.
The remarks also came as Constellation is hoping to get fast-track approval for new power generation, one of a number of measures approved this year under the Next Generation Act, as lawmakers responded to high energy bills enraging consumers.
Constellation submitted three projects to Next Generation Act approval: a larger natural gas generating facility and a smaller version, as well as a proposal for 800 megawatts of battery storage, which could contribute power onto the grid during times of peak demand.

Dominguez, for the first time, identified Constellation property near the Perryman Generating Station in Aberdeen, as the site for all three projects.
The Perryman site already hosts oil- and gas-fired generating units, but Dominguez said transporting additional natural gas to the site would still come at a steep cost, according to the company’s internal estimates. Constellation could turn to the General Assembly for help, he said.
He noted that some states, for instance, have used bonds to finance desired energy projects, Dominguez said. But, whereas regulated utilities, like those in Maryland, usually receive a guaranteed return on their investment of 10%, the state requires utilities to build the infrastructure at cost.
“They say to the utilities: ‘Look, we’ll raise, in a bond, the money and give it to you. But you don’t add 10% to the bill,’” Dominguez said in an interview.
As for the cost of connecting the Perryman plan to natural gas lines, Baltimore Gas & Electric spokesman Nick Alexopulos said in a statement that his company “has not provided Constellation Energy or any other merchant generator an estimate for work related to proposals submitted under the Next Generation Energy Act.”
“BGE is committed to working with merchant generators and other partners to solve the state of Maryland’s energy security challenges,” Alexopulos said. BGE is an Exelon company.
Dominguez said Constellation also wants assurance from Maryland policymakers that they actually want new gas generation to respond to ever-increasing power demand projections, largely from data centers. Otherwise, Constellation won’t build it, he said.
Just a few years ago, Maryland lawmakers passed the Climate Solutions Now Act, which requires the state to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions 60% from 2006 levels by 2031. Gov. Wes Moore (D) has backed a goal to meet the state’s electricity needs with 100% clean energy by 2035.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
That shifted with soaring utility bills that paved the way for the Next Generation Act, but the idea of new gas-fired power plants has unsurprisingly attracted ire from climate groups.
“You shouldn’t say: ‘I’m really upset no one is building natural gas fired generation, and simultaneously have a policy that says anybody who builds merchant gas-fired generation has got to be out of business by 2035,” Dominguez told the crowd on Thursday.
The Next Generation Energy Act created a new regulatory fast-track through the Maryland Public Service Commission for certain energy projects. Policymakers did not explicitly call for new natural gas. Instead, they said zero-emissions projects should outnumber emissions-generating ones, and they required that any new gas plant have the potential to transition to hydrogen fuel.
Besides Constellation, only two other companies put in
Only two other companies put in applications for the fast-tracked project  by the Oct. 31 deadline — one for an upgrade at an existing gas plant in Prince George’s County and another entirely confidential proposal. The PSC has until late December, 60 days after the deadline, to decide which proposals will receive the expedited consideration
The PSC also opened a procurement for the state to buy battery energy storage technology, which attracted proposals from BGE and Potomac Edison, among others.
Exelon wants to build a power plant in Maryland, reversing decades of deregulation policy

If electric utilities like Exelon were to reenter the power generation business, it would reverse a Maryland policy that has stood for more than a quarter-century. It would also mean that ratepayers would foot the bill.
Constellation had been part of Exelon, but it was spun off.
“It is curious to us, as you can imagine,” Dominguez said. “Constellation was launched a little bit over 40 months ago. It was launched by Exelon because Exelon decided it did not think it was prudent to put its owner’s money into the generation business.”
“Every bit of expertise, including operating all the land, all the equipment, came with us to Constellation,” Dominguez added.
In response, Alexopulos from BGE said it’s clear that Exelon’s campaign has “struck a nerve.”
“The generation needed in Maryland won’t build itself.

Daniel Robles) Officials with the Alaska National Guard said they are preparing and training a response force of 100 service members to deploy to Washington D.C. and support civil authorities, as directed by the Pentagon and Gov. Mike Dunleavy. 
The update on Tuesday from Maj. Gen. Torrence Saxe, Adjutant General of the Alaska National Guard and Commissioner of the Alaska Department of Military and Veterans Affairs, was in response to a letter from state legislators on the Alaska Joint Armed Services Committee. The lawmakers raised concerns around the implications of a Pentagon’s directive to Alaska to prepare 350 National Guard personnel for rapid deployment for “civil disturbance operations.”
In his letter, Saxe said Gov. Mike Dunleavy requested that the force be deployed to Washington D.C. to join a joint federal task force in March of 2026. 
A spokesperson with the governor’s office confirmed Thursday the request came from the U.S. Secretary of the Army and Dunleavy approved it. 
“Governor Dunleavy approved the request because he wants to help the Trump Administration restore public trust and improve the quality of life in the nation’s capital,” said Jeff Turner, the governor’s director of communications, by email. 
But the request may turn out to be moot, after a federal judge temporarily blocked the deployments to Washington D.C. on Thursday, declaring the use of troops is likely unlawful. There is a pause on the order until Dec. 11, which gives the Trump administration time to appeal.
Turner declined to comment on the federal ruling. 
Saxe said in the letter that 100 Alaska service members are being trained to align with “national level requirements.” 
“The team will consist of Alaska Army and Air National Guard personnel trained in mission sets that may include site security, roadblocks and checkpoints, civil disturbance control, critical infrastructure protection, and personnel security,” Saxe wrote. “All training activities are integrated into existing unit schedules and do not alter the organization’s operational commitments.”
The Alaska National Guard is currently active in the disaster relief effort after Typhoon Halong devastated communities of Western Alaska, with an estimated 200 service members deployed there, officials said.

Saxe repeated that the development of this “quick response force” is not new for the National Guard, and it will be  structured to “respond quickly to protect lives, property, and critical infrastructure.” 
“At the request of Alaska Gov. Mike Dunleavy, members of the Alaska NGRF (National Guard Response Force) will activate to Washington, D.C., in March 2026 to support Joint Task Force–District of Columbia, a federally coordinated effort that brings together National Guard elements, civic leaders, and partner agencies to enhance safety, stewardship, and community engagement,” he wrote.  
Officials with the National Guard declined interview requests on Wednesday and Thursday. 
In August, officials with the governor’s office said there were “no plans” to deploy the Alaska National Guard to Washington D.C., as reported by the Anchorage Daily News. 
The Trump administration’s deployment of National Guard troops to primarily Democratic-led cities has been challenged and repeatedly blocked as illegal in federal courts. On Monday, a Tennessee judge barred the National Guard deployment to Memphis, and said it was only allowable if there was a rebellion or invasion. On Thursday, a federal judge temporarily ordered an end to the monthslong deployment of National Guard to Washington D.C. to tackle crime, declaring the use of troops as likely unlawful. 
Rep. Andrew Gray, D-Anchorage and co-chair of the Alaska Joint Armed Services Committee, said he was grateful for the commissioner’s response and additional information on the specialized force, but remains concerned about the capacity and purpose of such a mission.

“It’s important to note that the American taxpayer will be paying their salary while they’re on this mission. They’ll be paying for their room and board,” he said. “So when the National Guard does a mission like this, we just don’t have unlimited money. So we are redirecting money away from training and work here in Alaska.”
Gray said while the Trump administration may have the authority to call the National Guard to Washington, a federal district, he remains concerned at military service members being deployed against civilians and used for police or immigration enforcement.
“Are these police departments saying that they’re overrun, that they’re unable to perform their law enforcement mission, that they need to have their force doubled, tripled, quadrupled in numbers?” he said. “Because that’s what’s happening.”
There are currently 2,866 National Guard service members enlisted in the state, with 1,676 in the Alaska Air National Guard and 1,190 in the Alaska Army National Guard.
Gray, a veteran of the Alaska National Guard who deployed to Kosovo in 2019, said he also worries about the erosion of trust and regard for the military doing these kinds of missions, and deploying against civilians. 
“I love the U.S. military. I am proud of my service in the Alaska Army National Guard,” he said. “I think this is going to hurt the military’s standing in the public’s mind. I think that this is going to cause folks to lose some of the admiration that has been so foundational in our country for the military. Our country has long admired, respected and praised its military, and the moves that we are seeing, directed by Secretary Pete Hegseth and the President of the United States are going to lose our military’s standing, not only internationally, but domestically as well.” 
Gray said he has requested a meeting with Saxe, and is asking for continued public communication and transparency as the quick response force is developed.

Lack of space, resources is limiting enrollment",Emilia Otte,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/11/20/ct-department-of-correction-higher-education-pell-grants/,"About 320 incarcerated people were enrolled in higher education as of Oct. 2024. That's a fraction of the estimated 3,000 people eligible.","Thousands of incarcerated people in Connecticut want to enroll in higher education — and financial aid is available — but limited space and resources in the state’s prison system have prevented the programs from expanding to meet the demand. 
About 320 incarcerated people were enrolled in higher education programs as of October 2024. That’s a fraction of the estimated 3,000 people who are eligible. 
State leaders, correction officials and educators say a shortage of classrooms and a lack of internet access are key barriers.
“With the classroom space we are currently allotted, we are really only able to admit maybe 12 to 15 students per year out of hundreds who express interest annually,” Zelda Roland, founding director of the Yale Prison Education Initiative, said during a meeting of the Criminal Justice Policy Advisory Committee last month. The Yale initiative offers college courses at MacDougall-Walker Correctional Institution in Suffield, and is one of several programs run by Connecticut colleges and universities in the state’s prison system. 
Funding to expand the programs is available — in the form of individual tuition stipends, known as Pell Grants — but without the space and equipment to field a larger number of students, the programs can’t grow. The maximum Pell Grant amount for 2025-26 is about $7,400 per student.
“The scale of this unmet need is astounding,” said Daniel Karpowitz, undersecretary of criminal justice policy and planning at the state’s Office of Policy and Management, during the meeting last month. 
“If we measure it simply in the failure to draw down the millions of dollars that the federal government is offering us and our higher ed partners to do this, it’s staggering,” Karpowitz said.
In March, the Office of Policy and Management released a report underscoring the changes needed in the state prison system in order for more people to access post-secondary studies while incarcerated. Some of the biggest barriers included a lack of designated space and availability of technology and internet access, as well as the need for increased administrative and academic support for students and a clear pathway to graduation if they are released from prison before they finish their degrees. 
Roland said students in the Yale Prison Education Initiative don’t have internet access — nor do their professors. And all the teaching material that comes into the facility has to be approved by Department of Correction officials. 
That creates extra barriers for students doing something as routine as writing a research paper, Roland said. “It is an extremely onerous and lengthy process to be able to access that research that on campus takes a student a matter of seconds to locate and have access to.”
Teresa Foley, who oversees CT State Community College programs for incarcerated students, said many students don’t have access to laptop computers. Even if those computers aren’t connected to the internet, she said, they still offer opportunities to learn how to use word processing and presentation software like Microsoft Word and PowerPoint — skills that will be necessary once students have returned to their regular lives.
“When they get out, they have this great digital divide to try to cross, to try to readapt to society where technology has just advanced and they haven’t had the opportunity to participate in that,” Foley said. 
Pell opportunity
It’s only recently that Pell Grant aid once again became widely available to eligible students in Connecticut prisons. 
In 1994, the U.S. Congress barred incarcerated people from receiving Pell Grant funding, and the availability of post-secondary education for incarcerated people across the country declined.
In the first decade of the 2000s, several Connecticut schools began teaching college courses in correctional institutions. Wesleyan University started offering classes at Cheshire Correctional Institution through its Center for Prison Education, later expanding to York Correctional Institution. Trinity College and Quinnipiac University also began offering classes at different facilities.
In 2015, the Obama administration created the Second Chance Pell Program, a pilot that gave colleges the opportunity to apply to use Pell funding toward higher education in prison. Four of Connecticut’s community colleges were approved and began offering courses to incarcerated men and women. Wesleyan and Yale also received funding. 
In 2016, Yale University formed the Yale Prison Education Initiative and began offering classes at MacDougall-Walker.  
And in 2020, the Trump administration restored Pell eligibility to all incarcerated people, beginning in the year 2023.

The various universities and colleges now offer a variety of degree programs within the state’s Department of Correction. They often share classrooms that are used for USD #1, the school district housed within the department. 
OPM’s Karpowitz called the Pell Grant change as the “largest federal intervention into the condition of confinement in American prisons in our lifetime.” 
It’s not the only source of funding aimed at expanding higher education in Connecticut prisons.
In recent years, the state Department of Correction received $3 million in coronavirus relief funds to expand high-speed broadband access in an effort to improve higher education in the facilities. Andrius Banevicius, spokesperson for the department, said the funding was slated for updates to telecommunication infrastructure at Brooklyn, MacDougall-Walker, Osborn, Carl Robinson and York correctional institutions. 
Banevicius said that since the vast majority of incarcerated men and women return to their communities after serving their sentence, “it is in everybody’s best interest to give these individuals as many opportunities as possible to enhance the likelihood of successful reentry.”
He said studies have shown that education during incarceration reduces the risk that someone will end up back in prison. Even for individuals who don’t return to their communities, Banevicius said opportunities for learning “promote a sense of accomplishment, self-worth and prosocial behavior, in turn, creating a safer prison environment for all.”
Foley, of CT State, said professors learn to adapt creatively to the restrictions — and some actually enjoy teaching in the program more than they do on campus. “ [The students] are engaged with the materials in a very active manner, so that they’re always coming to class with all kinds of questions and examples and just exploring topics that the instructors are not necessarily getting from students on campus,” Foley said. 
Leaders of prison higher education programs say their graduates have gone on to start businesses and work at organizations that help people who are incarcerated. And Karpowitz said that when people who are incarcerated begin studying for a college degree, the high school graduation rates in their families also increase. 
“This is an intergenerational priority. And we are missing the boat, currently,” Karpowitz said.
‘A one-room schoolhouse’
While the programs provide opportunities, they remain frustratingly limited. 
Tess Wheelwright, director of Wesleyan’s Center for Prison Education, said her program rotates between two classrooms at Cheshire — where they offer seven classes per semester to between 50 and 60 students — and one classroom at York, where they offer four classes to 20-30 students. 
“ Imagine a one-room schoolhouse that is sometimes being used for other programs,” Wheelwright said. 
Professors have access to whiteboards and a projector they can use to show PowerPoint presentations. Everything has to be approved by the Department of Correction before it can be shown in class. This, plus the lack of internet, makes it hard to present anything spontaneously, Wheelwright said. 
“ Faculty in 2025 are so accustomed to googling a TED talk or pulling down a video of the geological phenomenon they’re trying teaching about, and that’s not possible there,” she said.
And classes are only one component of what it means to be a college student. Wheelwright said Wesleyan’s program brings in writing tutors to the prison during study hall. But she said that connecting students with student services like peer tutoring, the writing center and office hours has been difficult. 
If the prisons had internet access, she said, “I think the first thing we would use it for [are] some of these appointments with campus offices there to support student success.”
Roland, at Yale, also said she’d like to have laptops available so incarcerated students can attend office hours with professors on Zoom or Microsoft Teams. 
Karpowitz said the state is looking at how to integrate internet into correctional facilities and has already identified 1 million square feet across those campuses for the installation of high-speed broadband. 
The Institute for Municipal and Regional Policy at the University of Connecticut has also developed a series of modules designed to teach people who are incarcerated or formerly incarcerated how to use the internet for things like telehealth, applying for jobs and education. The institute is also looking to partner with libraries to improve services for people who are incarcerated and on community supervision.
Wheelwright and Roland both said Pell Grants wouldn’t fully cover the cost of their programs, including laptops, paying faculty and additional student services. The colleges make up the difference using private grants and donations. 
There are other challenges to the success of the programs. Within DOC, it’s fairly common for incarcerated people to be moved from one facility to another. For someone participating in a higher education program, a transfer can effectively halt their educational progress.
Roland and Wheelwright said facility lockdowns — which are also fairly common — impede professors’ abilities to finish all of their course material and it reduces study time for students.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/HIGHERED-INDOC-1114-02-1024x607.jpg,,,2025-11-20 21:57:07.926803

(Julie O'Donoghue/Louisiana Illuminator)Starting next year, hundreds of Louisiana officials will be able to sue private citizens, businesses and government entities for not removing their basic biographical information from the internet. 
Gov. Jeff Landry and state lawmakers approved a new law earlier this year allowing a wide swath of public officials to bring lawsuits against those who don’t take down online posts with officials’ personal-identifying information when they request it. 
Anyone who doesn’t take the information off social media or websites could also face criminal penalties under the new law, including up to 90 days in prison and a fine of up to $1,000 per violation. 
States across the country have approved similar laws in recent years after a handful of high-profile attacks on judges and other politicians. By shielding their personal information from the public, government officials hope to reduce their risk to political violence. 
But Louisiana’s version is more sweeping than almost all other states’ laws. It will entitle a wider range of elected officials to sue over internet posts for more reasons, according to a review of dozens of states’ privacy laws. 
Government transparency advocates said Louisiana’s law will infringe on citizens’ First Amendment rights and lead to frivolous lawsuits. Attorney Scott Sternberg described the new law as “wildly unconstitutional” in a memo he wrote on behalf of the Louisiana Press Association earlier this year. 
“Effectively, the Louisiana Legislature has decided to criminalize the publication of a church birthday calendar, the mortgage documents required by federal law, birth announcements, engagement party RSVP websites and traffic tickets,” he wrote.
“This law will undoubtedly lead to more litigation, higher costs for public and private entities, and a chilling effect on speech,” Sternberg said. 

New limits on social media, news articles, political commentary
In Louisiana, the ability to bring a lawsuit or criminal charges over internet posts is already in effect for active and retired judges and family members who live with them. Starting in February, it will be available to many more government officials and their relatives. 
At that point, it will extend to current statewide elected officials, state legislators and public service commissioners, current or retired district attorneys, current or retired assistant district attorneys, and current or retired district attorney investigators. Spouses, children and other dependents who live with these officials will also be covered. 

Among items that officials and their relatives can demand come down off the internet are their home addresses, telephone numbers, personal email addresses, marital records, birth dates, schools and daycares of their children, places of worship and employment locations of spouses, children and dependents. 
Governments will have 15 days after receiving a request from one of these officials to take their personal information off the internet or provide a reason why they can’t.

Individuals and private businesses will have 72 hours to remove the protected information before they become vulnerable to a lawsuit or criminal charges. 
This new restriction will apply to any type of internet post, including news stories, the state’s political campaign contributor database, private websites and social media posts from constituents. 
The breadth of Louisiana’s law is what sets it apart from 38 other states with similar statutes, which were identified by the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts. In other states, the provisions apply to far fewer people, often only judges, prosecutors and law enforcement. 

The scope of what can be taken off the internet is also narrower in other states. It sometimes includes just home addresses, telephone numbers and email accounts, and it almost never applies to someone’s place of worship. 
Texas, for example, enacted a law in September that allows judges and their families to sue over internet posts with personal information, but its doesn’t apply to other types of elected officials. It also doesn’t apply to content that involves “reporting, news gathering, speaking, or engaging in other activities intended to inform the public on matters of public interest or public concern.” 
Judges fear violence 
Judges have been pushing states to adopt these new security measures for themselves in response to violent attacks on the judiciary. 
They started pursuing the state laws after U.S. District Court Judge Esther Sales’ son was murdered at her home in New Jersey in 2020. The man who ambushed her family had appeared before her in court. 
The assault on Salas’ home led to a new federal law that allows federal judges and their families to demand the removal of internet posts with their personal information, but the federal statute is less restrictive than the Louisiana version. 

Unlike Louisiana, the federal law does not permit judges to require the removal of such information from news stories, political commentary and “other speech on a matter of public concern.” Federal judges also don’t have a right to sue private citizens or businesses for damages under the federal law. 

Louisiana judges have experienced threats of violence that made the state law necessary, said Judge Tiffany Chase, who serves on the state’s 4th Circuit Court of Appeal, during a legislative hearing in 2024. 
Orleans Parish Criminal Court Judge Kimya Holmes was stalked by a family member of one of the teenagers she sent to prison for the killing of 73 year-old Linda Frickey during a botched 2022 carjacking. Chase also had a person who appeared before her in court show up at her house, she said. 

“We are in a more precarious situation,” Chase said last year. 
Louisiana drafted its law to look like a Maryland judicial security statute, which passed after a district court judge there was murdered in his driveway. 
Yet the Maryland law is not as sweeping as Louisiana’s. It does not allow for lawsuits or criminal charges to be brought over personal information included in a news story, political commentary or “any other speech on matters of public concern,” as the Louisiana law does.  
The Maryland law also applies solely to judges and hasn’t been expanded to allow other elected officials to bring lawsuits. 
State lawmakers worry about violence too 
Judges aren’t the only ones fearing for their personal safety. 

California and Florida passed laws limiting access to elected officials’ home addresses after Minnesota House Democratic Caucus leader Melissa Hortmann and her husband were murdered in a political attack carried out at their home. The same gunman also shot and injured  Minnesota state Sen. John Hoffman and his wife. 

In California, state lawmakers closed off access to elected officials’ home addresses included on their voter registration forms, which used to be given out on a limited basis to journalists. 
In Florida, legislators approved a new law restricting access to elected officials’ addresses on publicly-available government documents to just their home city and ZIP code.
But Louisiana legislators passed their law a few days before the Minnesota ambushes took place, and its protections go well beyond what California and Florida have done. 

Neither California nor Florida allow elected officials to sue private citizens or businesses for posting their home address – or other personal information – on the internet. Free speech advocates have said that is likely because such a law impinges on people’s constitutional rights. 

“This kind of behavior isn’t going to hold up to constitutional scrutiny,” said David Cuillier, director of the Freedom of Information Project at the University of Florida. 

California used to have a similar law in place prohibiting people from posting state lawmakers’ telephone numbers and home addresses on the internet if the lawmakers’ feared for their safety. It was repealed in 2017 after a federal judge ruled the statute unconstitutional.
At the time, gun rights activists had posted online the home addresses and telephone numbers of 40 California state lawmakers who voted for a law that required the state to collect personal information about gun buyers. When lawmakers received threats and the state demanded that activists remove the posts, the activists sued California in federal court and won. 
In Louisiana, free speech advocates weren’t given the chance to raise concerns about the expansion of the law that allows elected officials to sue over internet content. 
The legislation, sponsored by state Rep. Marcus Bryant, D-New Iberia, initially only expanded the right for lawsuits from judges to district attorneys, their staff and their retirees. Lawmakers changed it to apply to other elected officials – such as the governor, attorney general and themselves – very late in the legislative process after public hearings and the opportunity to provide testimony on the bill had closed. 
Louisiana lawmakers also didn’t debate the amendment to expand the protections to themselves and other elected officials before voting. With no discussion, they approved the bill unanimously in both chambers.",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_20200623_085452-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-11-20 20:58:26.787583

Updated policy seen by the service as way to strengthen reporting, investigation and prosecution.","WASHINGTON (AP) — The U.S. Coast Guard is poised to change some of its language and policies surrounding the display of hate symbols like swastikas and nooses as well as how personnel report hate incidents.
The service stressed, however, that the symbols will remain prohibited. The updated policy is seen by the Coast Guard as a way to strengthen its ability to report, investigate and prosecute violators.
“Any display, use or promotion of such symbols, as always, will be thoroughly investigated and severely punished,” Admiral Kevin Lunday, acting commandant of the Coast Guard, said in a statement.
A Coast Guard message in 2020 from then-Commandant Karl Schultz said symbols like swastikas and nooses were “widely identified with oppression or hatred” and called their display “a potential hate incident.” The Coast Guard policy dated this month calls those same symbols “potentially divisive,” adversely affecting morale, discipline, unit cohesion and mission effectiveness.
The new policy maintains a yearslong prohibition on publicly displaying the Confederate flag outside of a handful of situations, such as educational or historical settings. However, it does not outright ban the symbols, saying the policy does not apply to private spaces outside of public view, such as family housing.
The new Coast Guard policy, which is set to take effect on Dec. 15 and was first reported by The Washington Post, is facing pushback.
Democratic Sen. Jacky Rosen of Nevada said that “this updated policy rolls back important protections against bigotry and could allow for horrifically hateful symbols like swastikas and nooses to be inexplicably permitted to be displayed.”
“At a time when antisemitism is rising in the United States and around the world, relaxing policies aimed at fighting hate crimes not only sends the wrong message to the men and women of our Coast Guard, but it puts their safety at risk,” she added.
Lunday said the policy does not roll back any prohibitions, calling it “categorically false” to claim otherwise.
“These symbols have been and remain prohibited in the Coast Guard per policy,” Lunday said in a statement, adding that “any display, use or promotion of such symbols, as always, will be thoroughly investigated and severely punished.”
Lunday’s predecessor, Admiral Linda Fagan, was fired on President Donald Trump’s first day in office. Trump officials later said she fired in part for putting an “excessive focus” on diversity and inclusion efforts that diverted “resources and attention from operational imperatives.”
The new policy explicitly says that “the terminology ‘hate incident’ is no longer present in policy” and conduct that would have previously been handled as a potential hate incident will now be treated as “a report of harassment in cases with an identified aggrieved individual.”
Commanders, in consultation with lawyers, may order or direct the removal of “potentially divisive” symbols or flags if they are found to be affecting the unit’s morale or discipline, according to the policy.
The Coast Guard is under the Department of Homeland Security, but it is still considered a part of America’s armed forces and the new policy was updated in part to be consistent with similar Pentagon directives, according to a Coast Guard message announcing the changes.
It also has historically modeled many of its human resources policies on other military services.
The policy change comes less than two months after Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth ordered a review of all the hazing, bullying and harassment definitions across the military, arguing that the policies were “overly broad” and they were “jeopardizing combat readiness, mission accomplishment, and trust in the organization.”
The Pentagon could not offer any details about what the review was specifically looking at, if it could lead to similar changes as seen in the Coast Guard policy or when the review would be complete.
Menachem Rosensaft, a law professor at Cornell University and a Jewish community leader, said in a statement that “the swastika is the ultimate symbol of virulent hate and bigotry, and even a consideration by the Coast Guard to no longer classify it as such would be equivalent to dismissing the Ku Klux Klan’s burning crosses and hoods as merely ‘potentially divisive.’”
Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer called the move “disgusting, and it’s more encouragement from the Republicans of extremism.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Coast-Guard-cutter.jpg,,,2025-11-20 21:57:07.926803

(Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)If a slot machine gives skillful players the ability to win every time, is it illegal under Pennsylvania’s Crimes Code and Gaming Law?
That was the question the state Supreme Court set out to answer Thursday in a pair of appeals by the commonwealth’s attorney general’s office and Department of Revenue. 
“This court has been very clear,” Senior Deputy Attorney General Susan Affronti told the justices. “Gambling is the hope of gaining something beyond the amount played, and that’s what creates the dangers associated with gambling.”
The court has said in the past that a single feature, such as the memory game included in leading maker Pace-O-Matic’s Pennsylvania Skill games, can’t change the fundamental nature of a gambling device, Affronti, who argued for the attorney general’s office, added. 
Rather, a game’s maker must show that skill is a predominant aspect of the game, and in Pennsylvania Skill Games, the skill element is difficult, tedious and completely optional. Many players, Affronti claimed, skip it to continue betting in hopes of winning a jackpot.
But how people play the game isn’t a workable way to determine whether it’s illegal, attorney Matthew Haverstick argued. He represented Capital Vending Co., that was charged after a 2019 state police raid on Champion Sports Bar in Highspire, Dauphin County, where it had provided skill games.

Haverstick said both his clients and the commonwealth agree the correct standard, established by the court more than 40 years ago, is whether skill is the predominant factor in whether a player wins or loses. 
And Pace-O-Matic’s games allow players who lose the slot machine-style bet to win back their money plus 5%, Haverstick said. They just have to be good enough at remembering and repeating an increasingly complicated pattern of colors that one attorney involved in the case compared to the 1980s electronic game Simon.
Haverstick also argued Pace-O-Matic’s games fall outside of the definition of slot machines set by the state Gaming Control Board.
“When you look at the regs the Gaming Control Board sets what a slot machine … has to pay out,” he said, noting that the requirement is a return of between 85% and 100%. Pennsylvania Skill games allow players to win back up to 105%. “It can never be a game or slot machine rather, as defined under that statute.” 
The state agencies are challenging lower court rulings that neither the Gaming Law or the Criminal Code apply to skill games. The devices, which look like casino video slot machines, have become fixtures in corner stores, gas stations and social clubs in a billion dollar industry that developed since a Beaver County judge first ruled they’re not illegal in 2014.
The commonwealth never appealed that decision and every court that has examined Pace-O-Matic’s devices, has determined they are legally games of skill, according to the Georgia-based company.
In recent years, however, state lawmakers have undertaken efforts to pass legislation that would regulate and tax the skill game industry or ban the machines completely. Proposals during budget negotiations this year devolved into infighting among state Senate Republicans over the rate. Proposals ranged from Gov. Josh Shapiro’s call for 52%, which is the rate casinos pay, to 16%, favored by Sen. Gene Yaw (R-Lycoming), whose district is home to the company that builds Pennsylvania Skill machines.
Jason Levine, who represents a majority of the state’s 17 casinos in a brief to the Supreme Court, said the skill game question is important to casino owners, who say they lose business because of the devices. But he said it’s a crucially important question for the commonwealth and Pennsylvanians who benefit from the taxes casinos pay on slot machine revenue. 
Under the Gaming Law, in addition to supporting the horse racing industry and the state property tax relief fund, gambling revenue goes toward state government and local governments through economic and community development grants.
“The stakes could not be higher for the commonwealth and casinos as well as the mom and pop shops facing a loss of revenue,” Levine said.  “I think the thing that all of the parties can agree to is that clarity is needed from the Supreme Court.”
The justices on Thursday questioned how often players use the skill element to attempt to recoup their money. Affronti said the machines deliver a win 8% of the time and the rest of the time players have the ability to go on to the skill section, but only if they touch a button marked “follow me.”
“It’s not explained,” Affronti said. “It’s not telling you ‘press this button to use skill.’ … There’s no suggestion that’s a way to win your money back. The only way you discover that is if you, for some reason, touch there and then, and only then is the skill game explained.”
Justice Christine Donohue asked Affronti whether it’s legal to give people the opportunity to gamble.
“They can walk into an establishment and never intend to play ‘follow me.’ Just continue to put money into the machine and pull it and pull it and pull it … with the hope that their gamble will pay off and they will get the jackpot,” Donohue said.
Affronti agreed, adding that is why the court must identify the predominant aspect of the game. 
“What is the game really about?” Affronti asked “This isn’t a game of Whac-a-Mole. This isn’t a game of Skee-Ball. This is a slot machine.”",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/skill-games-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-20 19:56:49.723632

(Alixel Cabrera/Utah News Dispatch)With tension ongoing between Utah’s Legislature and judiciary, the Utah Senate confirmed Judge John Nielsen as the state’s newest Supreme Court justice in a party-line vote.
Following this week’s 19-6 vote, Gov. Spencer Cox’s nominee thanked state leaders and his family for entrusting him with the role.
“We live in a contentious time, but it’s my hope to be a voice of reason and respect. I deeply love this state, my lifelong home. I love the law and I love the court, and I will do my utmost to ensure a legacy of trust. I pledge my best efforts and gratefully accept this weighty responsibility,” Nielsen said in his brief remarks.

Nielsen, who described his judicial philosophy as “textualist” and “originalist” at the news conference announcing his nomination, was well received by Republicans who have been quick to accuse judges of “judicial activism” in rulings they disagree with.
Democrats, meanwhile, flagged his role in some of the state’s most heated political lawsuits, including over abortion and transgender student sports participation.
Sen. Stephanie Pitcher, D-Salt Lake City, a member of the Senate Judicial Committee, highlighted Republican lawmakers’ criticism of the judiciary and said she would prefer a candidate who could be a check on the Legislature and an unbiased arbiter.
While Pitcher praised Nielsen’s legal experience, she said his appointment “feels like we are injecting politics into the appointment process, and that is not our role.”
“I find him to be incredibly intelligent, but his background does not inspire much confidence with litigants or the public that we are selecting someone who will be fair, neutral and unbiased,” Pitcher said.

Sen. Brady Brammer, R-Pleasant Grove, pushed back on those criticisms, saying that in the years they have known each other since attending law school together at Brigham Young University and throughout Nielsen’s “stellar legal career,” there have been no claims that Nielsen has done anything improper or that he lacks experience.
The criticism is “not pointing to his impartiality as a judge, which has not been questioned. It’s not going to any of his qualifications. It is solely on the basis of partisanship without regard to whether or not he can be an impartial justice,” Brammer said. “Are we ready to say that ‘because you represented a client that I disfavor, you are no longer allowed to be on the bench?’” 
When Nielsen was nominated, Utah Supreme Court Chief Justice Matthew Durrant praised Nielsen’s selection and his abilities in the courtroom, which he said he has witnessed numerous times in the past 25 years.
“And in those 25 years, I have never seen a better oral and written advocate. His writing has always been impeccable, honest, to the point,” Durrant said.
The governor appointed Nielsen to the 3rd District Court in September 2024 after his work in different private ventures — including a joint firm with former Utah Associate Chief Justice Thomas Lee, Sen. Mike Lee’s brother. Nielsen also worked 11 years as solicitor general in the Utah Attorney General’s Office, and years as an adjunct associate professor at the University of Utah.
He replaces outgoing Associate Chief Justice John Pearce, who is retiring Dec. 1.

(Courtesy The Center for Land Use Interpretation)A coalition of environment and health organizations requested the New Mexico Environment Department take immediate action Thursday toward air monitoring and developing community health guidance following an explosion at an oil refinery in Artesia.
HF Sinclair’s Navajo Refinery, located in southeast New Mexico and the Permian Basin, experienced an explosion and fires on Oct. 31, which injured three and caused thick smoke to waft over the city. 
Members of the Permian Basin Climate Justice Coalition, which represents more than 20 organizations devoted to environment, health and community advocacy, sent a letter Thursday to New Mexico Environment Department Secretary James Kenney asking for the department to take action to protect southeastern New Mexicans. 
They specifically called for the department to install a permanent air monitor in Artesia; provide real-time air-quality data to the public; develop health guidance for the public in cases of industrial emergencies; hold a public meeting in Artesia within a month to let the public know the plans for air safety and monitoring; and establish a mobile air monitoring unit in the Permian Basin.
NMED stated in January 2025 that the department had secured funding for such a mobile unit through a $500,000 settlement between WildEarth Guardians and OXY USA, Inc., an oil and gas producer in the region. 
“Our coalition has documented countless spills, leaks, and releases across the Permian. When something like this [explosion] happens, people deserve truth and transparency,” Melissa Troutman, climate and health advocate for WildEarth Guardians, said in a statement. “Numerous studies now document the health impacts experienced by people living in the oilfields. Air monitoring shouldn’t be optional in communities surrounded by refineries and fracking sites.”
NMED Director of Communications Drew Goretzka told Source in a written statement Thursday that the department has not had a chance to thoroughly review the coalition’s letter yet. 
“Sec. Kenney and the Department are open to all community monitoring actions that can better protect New Mexican’s air quality in the wake of the HF Sinclair Navajo Refinery explosion,” Goretzka wrote.
The coalition pointed out that the NMED operates two air monitors in the Permian Basin in Carlsbad and Hobbs, but these monitors do not track air pollution around Artesia.
“The Artesia refinery has operated for more than a century, making this not a new problem but a long-ignored one,” the coalition’s letter states. “An independent air monitor in this community is beyond long overdue. No parent should have to wonder whether it’s safe for their children to trick-or-treat outside, breathe the evening air, or go to school the next morning.”
Mariel Nanasi, executive director of New Energy Economy, said in a statement that air pollutants are a known cause of asthma, mortality and other ailments, and residents in the Permian Basin “deserve” to be protected from such harms. 
“Action cannot be taken until the state acts to collect data and provide families with real-time information so they can protect themselves, their children and the elderly when ozone precursors, [Volatile Organic Compounds] and particulates rise to dangerous levels,” Nanasi said. “The state cannot continue to depend on the EPA to take action to protect its own residents. They are depending on NMED to take action.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/sinclair-1024x681.jpg,,,2025-11-20 19:56:49.723632

(Otto Kitsinger for Idaho Capital Sun)An Idaho legislative task force aimed at improving government efficiency and cutting costs on Wednesday moved forward proposals to eliminate or merge six state entities with an estimated savings of just over $300,000 a year. 
Some of the proposals considered at Wednesday’s meeting at the Capitol in Boise either had no estimated savings or staff had not yet been able to analyze how much could be saved. 
The Idaho DOGE Task Force, named for the federal Department of Government Efficiency previously helmed by billionaire Elon Musk, held four additional proposed mergers or eliminations for further consideration.  
The ideas lawmakers advanced were: 

Eliminate the Bingo-Raffle Advisory Board and place its duties under the Lottery Commission.
Merge the Soil and Water Commission with the Department of Water Resources  
Move the STEM Action Center into the Workforce Development Council 
Eliminate the regional committees for the state Infant and Toddler Program Early Intervention Services 
Eliminate the Idaho Honey Commission 
Integrate the animal health duties of the Sheep and Goat Board into the Department of Agriculture 

The task force cannot pass legislation but will bring forward recommendations to the rest of the Legislature when it convenes for the 2026 session, which begins Jan. 12. 
Most of the decisions were unanimously approved by task force members, except for the vote to propose elimination of the Idaho Honey Commission. Sen. Carrie Semmelroth, D-Boise, and Rep. Heather Scott, R-Blanchard, voted no, with Semmelroth noting that the department staff did not consult the Honey Commission before making the recommendation.

Task Force co-chair Sen. Todd Lakey, R-Nampa, said he would vote to move forward the recommendation for consideration, but he thought it was “important that (the Honey Commission) weigh in, and have an opportunity to weigh in, which they will on legislation.” 
The task force held for further review the following proposals: 

Consolidate the Lottery Commission and State Liquor Division 
Merge the Office of Energy and Mineral Resources and Office of Species Conservation 
Eliminate community college Dormitory Housing Commissions 
Integrate the State Brand Board into the Department of Agriculture

 Proposals had varied results for saving state money 

Agency heads brought the proposals to the committee in response to an executive order by Gov. Brad Little issued in August. Some agency staff began looking into the merger or elimination proposals earlier, including Workforce Development Council Executive Director Wendi Secrist. 
Secrist in August 2024 also became director of the STEM Action Center, which is meant to facilitate educational opportunities in science, technology, engineering and math, or STEM. 
She began evaluating the merger last summer, and her proposal indicated that the state general fund would see savings of around $300,000 a year by eliminating two staff positions.

Rep. Josh Tanner, R-Eagle, questioned how the effectiveness of STEM Action Center activities are measured and its $6 million a year total cost. 
“How can you guys as Workforce Development Council actually bring evaluational processes to this, to actually make these where they’re actually worthwhile for the state?” Tanner asked Secrist.
Lakey echoed Tanner’s questions. 
Secrist said staff is in the process of creating new ways to evaluate the effectiveness of the programs that are less focused on outputs, such as how many events were attended or how many students attended them. 
The other proposal with a cost-savings estimate came from Cally Younger, administrator of the Office of Energy and Mineral Resources. 
Younger said the idea to merge the energy office with the species conservation office existed from the time when she worked for former Gov. Butch Otter. 
In doing so, she estimated about four full-time positions could be eliminated with a savings of about $360,000 a year.
“It makes a lot of sense, because our offices serve very similar functions,” Younger said. “We both serve as liaisons to the federal government on our offices’ issues.” 
Scott asked why the species conservation office wouldn’t move to Idaho Fish and Game, and Tanner suggested eliminating the Office of Energy and Mineral Resources and instead having Younger work on those issues as a staff member in the governor’s office. 
Younger responded with concerns to both of those ideas, including that the Fish and Game’s mission was very different in dealing with hunting and fishing regulation rather than protecting endangered species, and that eliminating her office would not result in much savings because it is federally funded. 
Scott made a motion to hold the proposal in committee to consider other avenues. Tanner agreed with the motion, and said he still saw benefits of eliminating the Energy and Mineral Resources office. 
The proposal to integrate the animal health duties of the Sheep and Goat Board into the Department of Agriculture was a “revenue wash,” according to Lloyd Knight, deputy director of the Idaho State Agriculture Department. 
Other proposals mentioned Wednesday did not include cost-saving estimates. 
 Task force will continue looking into other proposals 

The task force plans to continue looking into many of the proposals, including the ones that did not move forward. 
Some of those proposals come with complications. For instance, the merger of the lottery and liquor entities may require constitutional changes, according to Andrew Arulanandam, state director of lottery and liquor. He said while the two programs share a director, they “serve fundamentally different missions.” 
The Dormitory Housing Commissions are a largely obsolete method by which Idaho community colleges may finance on-campus housing and student facilities. However, North Idaho College has a $7.2 million bond for a recreation center owned by its Dormitory Housing Commission, said Jennifer White, executive director of the Idaho State Board of Education. The bond will be active until 2046, she said. 
Co-chair Rep. Jeff Ehlers, R-Meridian, said he hopes to plan one more meeting in December. He told the Sun the members would continue to look at agency staffing and other proposals, as well as other ideas from task force members. 
He said other issues will have to be addressed in future legislative sessions, and on Wednesday said the task force’s work is a “multi-year project.”

The Joint Revenue Committee voted Wednesday to sponsor a bill to eliminate residential property taxes, another to raise sales taxes to replace the resulting revenue loss.
The post Lawmakers advance plan to revamp Wyoming’s tax structure appeared first on WyoFile .","The Wyoming Legislature’s Joint Revenue Committee voted Wednesday to sponsor a pair of bills to eliminate residential property taxes and to raise sales taxes to replace the resulting revenue loss.
The meeting in Cheyenne marked the last of the committee’s off-season work that prioritized property tax reforms and relief for homeowners. The topic has been a focal point for the Legislature since at least 2022. 
Lawmakers have already, in recent years, expanded the state’s refund program, amended the constitution with the support of voters to separate residential property into a separate tax class and capped annual increases. 
The Legislature has also added several property tax exemptions to state law — creating a complicated web in the process — but no enacted measure has been so sweeping as abolishing residential property taxes altogether. 
Meanwhile, raising or creating new taxes has historically been a non-starter for Wyoming’s Republican-dominated statehouse. But lawmakers find themselves in new territory, with some arguing that the state’s tax system needs a thorough overhaul. 
The committee also voted to sponsor several other property tax bills, including one to repeal a sunset date on an exemption for long-term homeowners, another to amend the Wyoming Constitution to allow for an acquisition-value tax system similar to California. 
How we got here 
Casper Republican Sen. Bob Ide proposed abolishing all property taxes during a Revenue Committee meeting in June. 
“We need to shift to a new system,” Ide said at the June meeting, before bringing a motion to draft a bill repealing most of Article 15 of the Wyoming Constitution.

That version, if passed by the Legislature and approved by voters, would have eliminated all property taxes — residential, commercial, industrial and personal — which brought in $2 billion in the 2024 tax year. 
The committee instead approved a narrowed version of that proposal Thursday that would only eliminate residential property taxes. Lawmakers voted 9-1, with four excused, to sponsor the bill. 
Sen. Cale Case, R-Lander, was the sole dissenting vote, while Sens. Stephan Pappas, R-Cheyenne, Dan Dockstader, R-Afton, and Reps. Liz Storer, D-Jackson, and Bob Wharff, R-Evanston, were excused. 
Because the bill amends the Wyoming Constitution, it requires voter approval. Meanwhile, legislation to raise sales taxes would only go into effect if the constitutional amendment passes. 
The state sales tax rate is 4%. The bill would increase it to 6%, which would be in addition to the local county sales taxes. All but one county — Sublette — have an additional 1% to 3% sales, according to Department of Revenue data. 
The bill is estimated to bring in approximately $475 million, which would then be transferred to local governments to fund local services. 
The committee voted 8-4, with two excused, to sponsor the bill. The dissenting votes included Sen. Case and Reps. Jayme Lien, R-Casper; J.R. Riggins, R-Casper; and Clarence Styvar, R-Cheyenne. Storer and Pappas were excused. 
Discussion 
“I think what we’re trying to do here is protect our citizens. That’s all we’re trying to do,” Ide said. “And a sales tax, a consumption tax is probably the best avenue to protect those citizens from what’s going on back in Washington with deficit spending and stimulus and all of those things.”
Ide also said no member of the committee had reported hearing from their constituents, “we wish you wouldn’t have lowered our property taxes.”
The committee, however, heard nearly that very thing when it met in Ide’s district in August, when about two dozen local homeowners urged lawmakers to skip further property tax cuts. 
“Don’t defund and destroy our institutions,” Lisa Jamieson, a Casper homeowner, told the committee in August, echoing others at the meeting. “I think what’s important to people like me is, I would like for our communities to remain nice places to live, and I’m willing to pay taxes to keep that going.”
Recent property tax cuts have had an asymmetrical impact on counties, as a recent WyoFile collaboration detailed. While some haven’t experienced much belt tightening, others are eyeing cuts to various public services, like road maintenance and election administration.

“Listening to all of this, it makes my stomach hurt in the sense that you are cutting off the legs of our communities and pulling the blanket out from under them,” said Beth Blackwell, the city of Newcastle’s grant and loan specialist.
Blackwell previously worked as the grant loan manager for the Office of State Lands and Investments, where she said she saw firsthand how local governments, including special districts, rely on property taxes. Moving to sales taxes — a more volatile revenue source — will make it difficult for local officials to effectively budget, Blackwell said. 
Sen. Case, an economist, reiterated that point. 
“Sales tax, they’re the most erratic of your tax forms. We already have a problem with erratic revenue streams from our minerals,” Case said. 
For others, eliminating property taxes was the type of solution lawmakers have long sought. 
“I frankly see this is the best thing I’ve heard, is doing away with the property tax,” Rep. Wharff said. “Let people actually own their homes and do away with this perpetual tax that we have to pay on our property.”
The slate of bills will now go to the full Legislature for consideration. The 2026 budget session begins Feb. 9.

Davidson County Chancellor Patricia Head Moskal issued a temporary injunction Monday blocking Lee’s deployment of the national guard, agreeing with the plaintiffs that it likely violated the “terms and conditions of Tennessee’s Military Code.” But she told the state that if they appealed her ruling, which they did, she would lift the injunction during the appeal process. 
Moskal formally lifted her injunction on Wednesday.
Lee assigned members of the national guard to patrol the streets of Memphis starting in October as part of a task force created by President Donald Trump a month earlier. 
Tennessee governor to appeal ruling against Guard in Memphis

The Memphis Safe Task Force is made up of hundreds of state and federal law enforcement officers working in conjunction with local law enforcement. This case does not impact its work in Memphis. 
It’s unclear how many national guard personnel are stationed in Memphis. The Memphis police said there are about 200, but recent court filings indicate more than 700 are currently there.
Shelby County Mayor Lee Harris and several other local and state lawmakers filed the lawsuit to block the guard’s deployment, arguing that the Tennessee Constitution only allows it to be used in “circumstances amounting to a rebellion or invasion,” and “even then, the legislature must declare, by law, that the public safety requires it.”
Attorneys representing Lee and the state contend that deploying the national guard falls within the governor’s authority and that the judiciary has no oversight on the executive decision.
Moskal noted in her Monday ruling that Lee never issued an official order, putting out a press release about the deployment after Trump signed a memo creating the task force. The Tennessee legislature also never voted to send Guard personnel to Memphis, as required by law, and Shelby County leaders didn’t request the deployment.

The Conservation Fund acquired the 600-acre parcel from private landowners and facilitated a sale to the Forest Service in 2025. (Courtesy The Conservation Fund)A swath of land within the Tobacco Root Mountains that was privately owned is now part of the Beaverhead-Deerlodge National Forest after nonprofit organization The Conservation Fund facilitated a land sale this fall. 
The 600-acre inholding parcel covered the upper reaches of Dry Boulder Lakes Road including sections of trail that are the gateway to Lower and Upper Boulder Lakes. The area is now fully open and accessible to the public. 
“Connecting Montana’s patchwork of public and private lands is the kind of problem the Land and Water Conservation Fund was created to solve,” Gary Sullivan, Montana state director for The Conservation Fund, said in a statement. 
According to The Conservation Fund, the trail to reach the lakes winds through roughly four miles of alpine forest and granite basins, and provides access to high-elevation lakes with native trout populations as well as late-season hunting opportunities in the rugged backcountry of the Tobacco Roots.  
Prior landowners allowed road access to Boulder Lakes across their property through an informal agreement, and Sullivan said the owners, who preferred to remain unnamed, saw public access and conservation as a priority. 
When the landowners decided to sell the property, The Conservation Fund bought the property in 2024 as the first step to transferring the inholding to the federal government. 
Sullivan said he sees the nonprofit organization as a “bridge financier” for conservation land deals, that has worked on more than 9 million acres of land acquisitions across all 50 states.
A screenshot from Montana Cadastral showing the parcel added to the Beaverhead-Deerlodge National Forest outlined in blue.
The organization partners with government agencies — federal, state, municipal, or county — or occasionally other nonprofits such as land trusts, to provide funding and swift action on real estate transactions. 
“In many cases, like Boulder Lakes, we’re painfully aware of how slowly government moves,” Sullivan told the Daily Montanan, adding that federal funding cycles are often years ahead of property sales. “There’s a lot of ‘Gary, we don’t have the money right now, and Congress can’t appropriate the funds for a few years.’”
“We’re nimble, we’re small, we have real estate expertise, and we can swoop in and do what we do,” Sullivan said. 
In the case of the Beaverhead-Deerlodge National Forest, Sullivan said the landowners were eager to put the land into public hands, but didn’t want to wait for the wheels of federal government to come around on funding and the due diligence process required. 
Sullivan said that when The Conservation Fund steps in to make a conservation purchase like this, the organization makes sure the partner agency, in this case the Forest Service, has the property in their sights as a priority funding project. He said the average hold time for properties before they are sold to the partner agencies is roughly 12-18 months. 
The Boulder Lakes property was purchased by the organization in October, 2024 and sold to the Forest Service in September. 
“There’s always some risk we take on and always the chance of delays in every project, but we make sure we acquire properties by meeting all the due diligence standards required by our partners,” Sullivan said.
He said that another priority is land that’s considered biologically important to the greater ecosystem. 
Many of the parcels The Conservation Fund works with are similar to the Boulder Lakes property — inholdings held by private owners but surrounded by federal, state or locally-managed public land. 
In 2022 The Conservation Fund acquired another nearly 600-acre inholding just a few miles across the Beaverhead-DeerLodge Forest, selling it to the Forest Service in 2024.
Sullivan said the potential impact of private property adjacent to public lands goes far beyond the potential of development. 
“Inholdings have a much greater overall impact to the public land base than the actual acreage,” he said. “Habitat fragmentation is a problem for animals, and it’s in our interest to preserve the ecological integrity of these huge blocks of public land. 
He added that completing blocks of public land can cut down on management costs as well — arguments he uses with congressional staffers when working on securing the funding needed for an agency to purchase land. 
“If we can prevent these from being developed, it saves taxpayer money,” Sullivan said. “If there’s an access road the public is using, but the landowner isn’t spraying for weeds, that can carry noxious weeds into public land. If there’s a wildfire, the Forest Service has to defend the private property. There’s real tangible benefits to trying to acquire these properties, and that includes real cost-saving measures.”
The Forest Service acquisition of the property was done with funds allocated by the Land and Water Conservation Fund, which was permanently funded in 2020 by the Great American Outdoors Act, a bill championed by Montana’s senior U.S. Sen. Steve Daines. 
“As a lifelong sportsman, protecting and promoting access to Montana’s beautiful public lands has always been one of my top priorities,” Daines said in a statement. “I was proud to pass the Great American Outdoors Act in 2020 which permanently reauthorized the Land and Water Conservation Fund, and I’m thrilled to see that access to the Boulder Lakes will be provided.  I commend the Conservation Fund for their work on this project, so that Montana’s great outdoors are accessible for all to enjoy.”
Earlier this month, the Beaverhead-Deerlodge National Forest announced it had acquired another 396-acre on the northwest side of the Tobacco Roots along Point of Rocks Road. 
That acquisition was facilitated by the Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation and also utilized LWCF funds.

Larry Rhoden pushed back Thursday on a lawmaker’s suggestion that the agricultural industry should be more tightly regulated to improve water quality.
“Rest assured,” Rhoden told town hall attendees, “he’s going to be set straight on a few of his issues in a very kind, civil way. But I will have conversations.”
Senate President Pro Tempore Chris Karr, R-Sioux Falls, said during a legislative committee meeting Wednesday that it might be time to “get serious” about new regulations on agriculture to address the state’s polluted rivers and lakes.
With so much polluted water, SD lawmaker says state can no longer ‘dance around’ ag regulations

“And that’s pretty scary for folks, especially for those that are in the community that starts with the letter ‘A’ and ends with ‘G,’” Karr said during the meeting. “We can sit here and talk about it, and dance around it all day. I think you can have some incentives, but we’re going to have to look at some restrictions as well, and regulate.”
Karr’s comments came after Legislative Research Council staff shared a report that over three-quarters of monitored river and stream miles in the state fail to fully support at least one of their intended uses — such as swimming, fishing or boating — with similar problems in many lakes.
Rhoden, a rancher, said during his Thursday town hall at the Canopy by Hilton hotel in Sioux Falls that Karr’s comments were “misinformation,” saying they were “made out of ignorance.” He added that “nobody on the planet has a bigger, more vested interest in protecting our environment and natural resources” than farmers and ranchers.
Rhoden told the media after the event that making a “carte blanche statement that we need more regulations is unhelpful, to say the least.”
Lawmakers agree water quality is an issue in Iowa

In an interview later Thursday with South Dakota Searchlight, Karr said Rhoden reached out to him to talk about the comments. Karr said he hopes the discussion and the controversy around his comments will lead to a larger conversation surrounding South Dakota’s surface water quality.
He added that he “didn’t mean to pick on ag in particular,” but that the state will “have to look at restrictions and runoff” in rural and urban settings to improve surface water quality. The agricultural community has already risen up in defense, Karr said, as he predicted in his Wednesday comments.
“There’s been a pretty strong reaction,” Karr said, “but I’m hoping it’ll bring folks to the table to say that 75% failure in our rivers and streams is something we can’t live with.”
South Dakota has “proactive” programs in place to address water quality in the state, Rhoden said, including grants to reduce livestock waste runoff into waterways. Karr said he’s been speaking with water districts for years to learn about the state’s surface water quality problems, and he played a role in the $3 million infusion into a Big Sioux River grant program with 2021 legislation.
A recent final report on that program said it resulted in 67 buffer projects spanning 83 linear miles under 10-year contracts. The buffers prevent an estimated 1,500 pounds of phosphorus, 6,500 pounds of nitrogen and 1,000 tons of sediment from entering the Big Sioux River watershed each year.
Rep. Drew Peterson, R-Salem, a farmer, told South Dakota Searchlight that farmers and ranchers in his district are “highly regulated,” conservation-minded and “pay taxes to the watershed districts to improve water quality.”

“For someone to imply we are lax, unregulated and don’t care — that’s not fair to every producer and ag taxpayer working hard on this issue, and simply not true,” Peterson said.
Glenn Muller, executive director of the South Dakota Pork Producers Council, brought up the issue at the town hall, asking for Rhoden’s response.
Muller told South Dakota Searchlight that he would prefer the state further study the issue, to identify how different sectors of agriculture and other industries affect water quality. That would help create more targeted solutions, he said.
In response to Karr’s comments, Lt. Gov. Tony Venhuizen said that “top-down mandates” can be more expensive without being more effective.
“You can go too far the other way,” Venhuizen said, “and create a lot of new burdens that don’t really get you much in terms of value.”

Johnston and Girod say they're receptive to changes in faculty workload and post-tenure review procedures at the state's six public universities. (Photo by Tim Carpenter/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — The Kansas Board of Regents is preparing to vote on faculty tenure policy recommendations that set academic workload expectations and require rigorous post-tenure reviews of professors at the state’s six public universities.
The initiative would establish common points of reference in evaluating the work of hundreds of tenured faculty at the University of Kansas, Kansas State University, Wichita State University, Emporia State University, Fort Hays State University and Pittsburg State University. The policy package would require one-year remediation programs for faculty falling short of expectations. It would set the stage for dismissal of people with substandard evaluations in back-to-back years.
Under the draft plan circulated to Board of Regents members and university personnel, administration leaders on each campus would retain jurisdiction over details of evaluations of tenured faculty and the provisions of self-improvement programs for anyone with recognized deficiencies. The core obligations of state university faculty would continue to revolve around teaching, research and service, but instruction of students would be the biggest factor in assessments.
“We’re looking for sort of an umbrella policy that stills shows accountability, but obviously is flexible enough that the institutions will be able to utilize it,” said Board of Regents member Alysia Johnston, who has more than 35 years of experience in community college education.
She said Wednesday during a Board of Regents meeting in Hays the new approach would answer questions about whether tenured faculty continued to find success at a level commensurate with someone of their academic rank.
The workload policy would link faculty performance evaluations to tenure status.
“This seems like a really good potential product,” said Kathy Wolfe Moore, appointed to the Board of Regents last year by Gov. Laura Kelly after serving a dozen years in the Kansas House.
Rusty Monhollon, vice president of academic affairs for the Board of Regents, said overhauling post-tenure and workload systems would make it easier for the public universities to identify on an annual basis the faculty who excelled. It would provide administrators a roadmap for addressing faculty not adhering to high expectations, he said.
Monhollon said campus evaluations of tenured faculty would “become less subjective” through reliance on tangible evidence related to teaching, research and service.
He said policy changes were intended to reinforce the values of faculty tenure, support student academic success and enhance accountability at taxpayer-supported universities. The changes weren’t designed to thwart faculty development or scholarly innovation, he said.
In addition, he said, the framework resulted from collaboration with university administrators and faculty, and drew from established practices found elsewhere in U.S. higher education.
Policy recommendations would direct state universities to produce annual reports on the process of awarding tenure, including data on awards, denials and departures among faculty. It wouldn’t alter current policy limiting tenure-track faculty probationary periods to seven years. Tenure also would continue to be awarded based on meritorious performance rather than longevity of service.
In terms of post-tenure review, each faculty member would operate with work plans adjusted annually to outline expectations. Committee of at least five people would conduct full-scale reviews of each tenured faculty member every five years.
Tenured professors receiving an unsatisfactory evaluation would be required to take part in a one-year improvement plan. A second year with an unsatisfactory rating “may lead to dismissal or reassignment,” the policy proposal said.
Each university would provide an annual report to the Board of Regents on the number of tenured faculty assessed and improvement plans initiated. It would document the number of faculty departures or dismissals.
Under proposed changes to workload policy applicable to tenured professors, each would be assigned a teaching load. Exceptions could be granted to faculty holding extension, clinical or research positions that didn’t include instructional responsibilities. Otherwise, the three large doctoral universities in Kansas would set teaching loads ranging from 40% to 55% of a faculty member’s work schedule. The three regional universities would set teaching loads ranging from 60% to 75%.
Research expectations for tenured professors would be specific to each discipline, with consideration given to involvement in development of grants, publications, graduate supervision and dissemination of scholarship. Work linked to service duties must coincide with “institutional goals,” and could include administrative responsibilities.
Biennial reports prepared by the six universities would document faculty metrics on credit hour production, graduation rates, publications and research funding.
The Board of Regents could take a preliminary vote on post-tenure and workload policies in December. If advanced, the final vote would likely be in January.
KU chancellor Doug Girod said if the Board of Regents implemented post-tenure and workforce reforms it would constitute “one of the most robust processes in the country.”
“Most of what you’re seeing in state legislatures around the country are trying to accomplish where we are today,” Girod said.
Richard Linton, president of K-State, said the university’s faculty senate would provide feedback on the plan.
“From a 50,000-foot viewpoint,” Linton said, “I think it’s headed in a very good direction.”

,DC,2025-11-20 23:42:07+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,The Trump administration wants everyone to reapply for food stamps. What does that mean?,Jacob Fischler,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-administration-wants-everyone-reapply-food-stamps-what-does-mean,,"U.S. Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins’ call for a close reexamination of the 42 million people who receive federal food aid has befuddled advocates and lawmakers, coming mere days after recipients began to see benefits that had been stalled during the government shutdown.Details remain scant a week after Rollins during an interview on the right-wing Newsmax network first publicly broached the startling idea that every beneficiary would have to reapply for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, often called food stamps.The U.S. Department of Agriculture, asked for an explanation, referenced existing requirements and suggested more changes in SNAP rules could be in store.“Secretary Rollins wants to ensure the fraud, waste, and incessant abuse of SNAP ends,” a USDA spokesperson wrote Wednesday. “Rates of fraud were only previously assumed, and President Trump is doing something about it. Using standard recertification processes for households is a part of that work. As well as ongoing analysis of state data, further regulatory work, and improved collaboration with states.”The 2008 law governing SNAP leaves states responsible for administration. Part of that role includes periodically making sure that the low-income people in the program meet the qualifications for inclusion, but the law allows states to determine how often that occurs.“It's not clear what she would be proposing that is different from what is already happening,” said Katie Bergh, a senior policy analyst for food assistance at the left-leaning think tank Center for Budget and Policy Priorities.One interpretation of Rollins’ comments is that she would remove all 42 million individuals from SNAP’s rolls and ask them to resubmit applications. Bergh said that would lead to people losing money they need for groceries. About 40% of those enrolled in SNAP are children.“If she's suggesting that they're going to somehow redo that process for more than 40 million people who already demonstrated their eligibility and who already have to periodically recertify their eligibility, that would be pretty duplicative and would likely create pretty significant paperwork backlogs that would cause people who are eligible to lose the food assistance that they need,” Bergh said.Administration critics have suggested that, while the comments are unlikely to lead to policy changes, they introduce even more confusion for a program that was used as a political token during the record government shutdown that ended this month. Making people reapply would underscore the Trump administration’s opposition to the nearly $100 billion program, which accounts for 70% of federal nutrition assistance. USDA says the average SNAP household in fiscal 2023 received a monthly benefit of $332, or $177 a person based on the average SNAP household size of 1.9 people.“Secretary Rollins and the Trump administration have cut food assistance for 42 million Americans multiple times this year,” U.S. House Agriculture ranking member Angie Craig said in a Wednesday statement to States Newsroom. “Now, they've once again shown that they do not understand the program.”What did Rollins say?In the Nov. 13 interview on Newsmax, Rollins said SNAP was beset by widespread fraud, citing data that 29 mostly Republican-run states submitted to the department. Acquiring data from the 21 other states would give the department a way to wholly remake the program, she said.“Can you imagine when we get our hands on the blue state data, what we're going to find?” she said. “It's going to give us a platform and a trajectory to fundamentally rebuild this program, have everyone reapply for their benefit, make sure that everyone that's taking a taxpayer-funded benefit through SNAP or food stamps that they literally are vulnerable, and they can't survive without it. And that's the next step here.”In an interview Monday on Fox News, host Maria Bartiromo asked Rollins about the move to have recipients “reapply.”“Business as usual is over,” Rollins answered in part. “The status quo is no more. We know that the SNAP program is rife with fraud.”She added that guarding against fraud would help those the program is meant to serve.The comments touched off widespread confusion about what specifically Rollins meant. Asked about the initiative during a Thursday press conference, Craig, a Minnesota Democrat, said she was unclear about how it would work and predicted that Rollins would take credit in the future for the existing low rate of fraud.""We're hearing off the record that, you know, maybe people don't know what the hell they're talking about,” she said. “In fact, I think they're trying to take credit for the already very strict standards and the actual low fraud rate in the SNAP program ... So we can find no real plan there. Not even sure there's concepts of a plan there.”In response to a States Newsroom request this week for details about the initiative, USDA provided the statement that did not answer how the department would proceed or under what authority, but said Rollins was seeking to reduce fraud in the program.Spokespeople did not respond to follow-up questions, or a request to respond to Craig’s remarks Thursday.Low fraud rateProgram experts say fraud is not a widespread problem for SNAP.An April report from the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service found that retailers illegally trafficked about 1.6% of SNAP benefits from fiscal 2015 to 2017.Fraud by households applying for SNAP, which appear to be the main target of Rollins’ proposal, is even lower. According to a USDA report, about 26,000 applications were referred for an administrative review or prosecution on suspicion of fraud. That number accounts for about 0.1% of the 22.7 million households enrolled in the program, according to the Pew Research Center.“Long-standing data sources indicate that intentional fraud by participants is rare,” Bergh said.At Thursday's press conference, Craig called Rollins’ comments “bullsh*t” and “propaganda.”“Secretary Rollins goes on TV and talks about all the fraud,” she said. “This most effective anti-hunger program in our history has a fraud rate of 1.6%. It's actually one of the most effective, well-run programs in the country … The bullsh*t this administration is peddling is egregious.”More targeted reformsEven experts who advocate for reforms to SNAP say eligibility fraud is not a major issue.Romina Boccia, director of budget and entitlement policy at the libertarian Cato Institute, said high-net-worth individuals can receive SNAP benefits, but aren’t committing fraud by doing so.“Some of the issues with SNAP … aren't because of fraud or abuse, but they are because of bad program rules,” said Boccia.Boccia also cited an “incentive misalignment” inherent in the state-federal program. States have little incentive to control payments because the federal government funds the program, she said.Forcing all beneficiaries to reapply would likely reduce the cost of the program by reducing the number of its beneficiaries, including by forcing out higher earners who may not consider the benefits they don’t actually need to be worth the onerous reapplication process, Boccia said. But it would also result in a percentage of low earners dropping off the program, as well as many who would be affected by the administrative backlog that would come with processing tens of millions of new applications, she said. Shutdown, the big beautiful bill, and confusionBergh said Rollins’ comments “add insult to injury” because they come after congressional Republicans and President Donald Trump signed a major tax cuts and spending law that is expected to shrink federal SNAP spending by $187 billion over 10 years. The law added work requirements for many SNAP recipients and shifted some costs to states.That was followed by the six-week shutdown that saw a dizzying back-and-forth over whether November SNAP benefits would be paid.“There has been huge amounts of chaos and confusion and disruption for both states and participants in recent weeks, largely due to the shutdown, but also because simultaneously, the administration has required states to implement many of the reconciliation bill’s SNAP cuts,” Bergh said.Craig, in her statement, also said Rollins’ comments would hurt the people who need the program.“I am astounded by the secretary's careless disregard for the hungry seniors and children who can afford to eat because of this program,” she said.Sara Naomi Bleich, a public health policy professor at Harvard University, said in a phone interview the confusion from Rollins’ comments compounded hardships produced by the Republican reconciliation law, known as the One Big Beautiful Bill Act.“Big picture with the One Big Beautiful Bill Act is that there's basically this tidal wave coming to families that have low income,” Bleich, who worked at USDA during the Obama and Biden administrations, said. “They're going to lose Medicaid. They're going to lose SNAP. There could be collateral impacts on the school meals. This is going to be a really hard time for families to navigate.”",,,,2025-11-20 18:57:55.396017

(Photo by Eesha Pendharkar/ Maine Morning Star) At a Thursday campaign event with former New Jersey Governor Christine Todd Whitman, Maine Sen. Rick Bennett from Oxford denounced the two-party system, making the case for his independent bid for governor.
Bennett, who formerly chaired the Maine GOP and left party earlier this year to announce his run, emphasized his long history working within his former party, as well as with Democrats, to pass legislation he believed in. 
If elected governor, he said he would prioritize passing reforms in favor of affordability and fixing broken systems, including capping drug prices, focusing on improving academic performance in public schools, and lowering energy costs. 
“What people want is actual, real results, and they’re not getting it from the partisan structure,” Bennett told the 50 or so attendees.
“I’m running for governor as an independent because I want to govern as an independent, and that is different,” he added. For example, serving as an independent governor would allow him the flexibility to choose the best suited members of his cabinet, he said, as opposed to having to select exclusively Republicans or Democrats.
At the event, which was held at the Cumberland Club, Bennett was endorsed by the centrist Forward Party, formed in 2020 by Todd Whitman, known as a centrist Republican, and former Democratic presidential candidate Andrew Yang. The group supports independent candidates across the country at the local, state and national level that reflect its values from all parties. In 2024, the group endorsed Rep. Amy Roeder, a Democrat from Bangor.
“We want to support those that represent our values, as Rick does, and we want to find those candidates in the state and local offices,” Todd Whitman said.
Bennett is among a crowded field of contenders vying to replace Democratic Gov. Janet Mills, who will be termed out. The Oxford senator’s long track record in state government drew a mix of Democrats, Republicans and independents to the event who told Maine Morning Star they support his ideas and appreciate his commitment to work across the aisle.
Voters tired of two-part system
Many people in attendance were undecided on who they will be voting for next November, and many plan to vote in Democratic or Republican party primaries in June. But many said they think highly of Bennett, and agree with his denouncement of increasingly partisan politics.  
Phil Steele and his wife Francesca Galluccio-Steele are both registered Democrats, but attended because they agreed with Bennett’s push for transparency in campaign finance. Bennett introduced multiple bills last session aiming to expand clean elections to the local level and chaired the committee behind the successful 2023 referendum banning foreign entities from spending money on referendum campaigns. 
“I’m fed up with both parties, we have to get out of the two party system,” Phil Steele said. “I don’t agree with him on a lot of issues, but I agree on getting dark money out of politics.”
Anne Butterfield, who works for Our Power Maine, the campaign to establish a public utility system in the state, said she agrees with Bennett’s ideas about energy reform and reducing utility costs for Mainers. Butterfield, also a registered Democrat, said she’s “still looking at the playing field, but the trust is really high with him.”
Ted O’Meara, another former chair of the Maine Republican Party, said he left the party several years ago and is aligned with Bennett on many issues. Bennett has demonstrated leadership through his work across the aisle, he said, such as with former U.S. Rep. Mike Michaud when the two co-led the Maine Senate, and that makes him the “kind of candidate that people are looking for this year.”
“He has demonstrated throughout his political career that he’s willing to work with anybody to find a solution,” O’Meara added. “And people are really fed up with the partisanship and fighting. They really just want solutions.”",https://mainemorningstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_1288-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-11-20 18:57:55.396017

(Photo by Max Graham/Northern Journal)COOK INLET, Alaska—High in a mountain valley on the far west side of this tidal inlet sits an unusual plot of land.
It’s a private parcel, with a gravel airstrip and four or five buildings that make up a small worker camp. But there are no towns in sight. Known as the Johnson Tract, the property is fully surrounded by the vast Lake Clark National Park—millions of wild acres marked by the broad white peaks of a volcano, sprawling glaciers and a muddy ocean coastline patrolled by brown bears.
Beneath the Johnson Tract lies a potential fortune. For decades, geologists have eyed gold, copper and zinc deposits thought to be worth billions of dollars. But they’ve never been tapped.
Now, amid surging gold prices and rising demand for metals like copper, the prospect is generating new excitement—and concern.
A prominent Alaska mining company is leasing the Johnson Tract from its Indigenous owners, and the property, some 125 miles southwest of Anchorage, has emerged as one of the most promising mining prospects in Southcentral Alaska.
But conservationists, commercial salmon fishermen and local lodge owners fear a mine, encircled by the federal protected area, could disrupt harvests and harm wildlife, including an endangered population of beluga whales.
Getting the Johnson Tract’s minerals to buyers will require trucking ore through a now-roadless corner of the national park to a future port.
Critics point out that the bay where the mining company, Contango Ore, Inc., wants to build a shipping terminal is an important winter habitat for the endangered belugas. Concern for the whales, among other objections, led mine opponents to sue federal regulators earlier this year over a permit that Contango received to build a short access road and expand an airstrip at the site.

Still, the project is advancing.
The land is owned by Anchorage-based Cook Inlet Region, Inc., or CIRI, one of 12 Indigenous-owned regional corporations created by Congress as part of a wider land claims settlement with Alaska’s Native people in 1971.
Contango, based in Fairbanks, started leasing the land from CIRI last year. With gold prices surpassing a record high of $4,000 per troy ounce this year, the mining company is already planning new roads and a tunnel to allow underground drilling on the Johnson Tract.
If a mine gets built, both Contango and CIRI’s nearly 10,000 Indigenous shareholders are poised to profit.
“The stars might be aligned right now,” said Margie Brown, a former CIRI president who also worked for the corporation’s lands department in the 1970s, when the company acquired the prospect.
The conflict reflects a deeper tension between two competing visions for Alaska—one of environmental preservation, the other of industrial development. Both visions extend back to a time when Congress set aside large tracts of the state’s wilderness for protection but also carved out areas for resource extraction, often intended to benefit Alaska’s Indigenous-owned corporations. Rooted in a series of landmark bills in the 1970s and 1980s, the Johnson Tract saga echoes some of the state’s other, higher-profile environmental battles, including over a mining road and oil development in the Arctic.
As Contango forges ahead, CIRI is asserting its right to profit from lands long intended for development, while opponents say that mining imperils a still-wild slice of Alaska.

Among critics of the mining project is Dustin Solberg, a commercial fisherman and environmental advocate who spends summers with his family setting nets for salmon along the beaches of Tuxedni Bay, about 10 miles northeast of the Johnson Tract. Contango could one day load ore onto ships from the same shore where Solberg and other fishermen haul fish out of the bay.
Standing on a quiet Tuxedni beach one day this summer with dramatic cliffs looming overhead, Solberg imagined mining trucks rumbling down a road nearby.
“I think it would irreversibly change this place,” he said.

 A pivotal deal

The Johnson Tract fight is rooted in the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act.
Intended to resolve disputes over Indigenous land claims in Alaska, the federal legislation in 1971 established 12 for-profit Alaska Native corporations, each owned by Indigenous shareholders with ties to a region in the state. More than 200 other Indigenous companies tied to Native villages also formed.
The act promised to compensate the corporations with nearly a billion dollars and millions of acres of land, to be chosen by the companies’ elected leaders.
Those leaders quickly moved to obtain traditional hunting and fishing grounds and areas with cultural value, but they also sought land thought to be rich in minerals and other resources that they could convert into profits for shareholders.


In the Arctic, Native corporations acquired land with oil deposits. In Southeast Alaska, they logged vast stands of cedar and spruce.
But in CIRI’s region, around Anchorage and neighboring Cook Inlet, the pickings were sparse. The southcentral region is the state’s most populous, and by the time of the settlement, military bases and wildlife refuges had been set aside by the federal government, prime real estate was in the hands of private developers and other parcels had been snatched up by the state.
“You just had so much pressure for lands within the Cook Inlet region,” said Brown, who now serves on CIRI’s board.
The corporation’s leaders argued that they were largely left with glaciers and mountain ridges — dim prospects for shareholders.

Two years after Congress approved the settlement, CIRI sued the U.S. interior secretary, arguing that his agency had not made adequate property available for CIRI to develop. Tense negotiations ensued, producing a sprawling agreement between CIRI and the state and federal governments: the Cook Inlet Land Exchange.
The deal called for CIRI to give up half the property around Cook Inlet that the corporation was entitled to under the original settlement, Brown said. Some of that foregone land would be folded into Lake Clark National Park and Preserve when Congress created it a few years later.
In return, CIRI would be able to acquire land elsewhere in Alaska, and even outside the state.

The deal also allowed CIRI to pick up some key assets around Cook Inlet, including the Johnson Tract, which the corporation chose specifically for its mineral potential. CIRI’s early leaders viewed the land swap as a hard-fought compromise, and Brown called the Johnson Tract “key to the bargain.”
“The ability to use the land in the way Congress intended is something that needs to be preserved,” she said. “It’s unfortunate that as we move further and further from congressional intent, it’s harder and harder for people to remember that.”
The Johnson Tract is really two adjacent parcels, totaling about 33 square miles. CIRI—now a huge business, with nearly $1 billion in assets—owns the minerals beneath both parcels, and the surface of the south tract, where the main deposit sits. The federal government retained surface ownership of the north tract.
Citing a provision in the land exchange, the Department of Interior earlier this year granted CIRI the rights to transport ore through the park, with certain restrictions to limit environmental impacts. CIRI and Contango have not formally proposed building a haul road and port, which would require additional permits.
 An ‘Awesome’ Deposit

Soon after CIRI acquired the Johnson Tract, the corporation began scouring it for more minerals, seeking enough to justify building a mine.
In the early 1980s, CIRI partnered with Anaconda Minerals, a subsidiary of the global oil giant ARCO, to evaluate the prospect.
Anaconda found promising amounts of gold, zinc and copper and at one point—given the area’s prolific amount of snow—envisioned an underground tunnel or aerial tram to move ore the dozen miles from a mine to a port on the coast. But Anaconda went out of business. And aside from another unsuccessful effort to develop the Johnson Tract in the 1990s, the land sat largely dormant until 2019.
That year, CIRI signed a lease with a Vancouver-based mineral exploration company, which quickly handed over the operations to a spinoff firm, HighGold Mining Inc. HighGold spent tens of millions of dollars on exploration and drilled more than 150 core samples before Contango bought the company last year in a deal worth some $35 million.
The Johnson Tract appealed to Contango’s chief executive, Rick Van Nieuwenhuyse, because it seemed to be a good fit for the company’s unconventional development model, which involves shipping raw ore to a processing plant off site, rather than crushing and processing ore next to the deposit, as most mines do.
The approach avoids some of the more expensive and hard-to-permit components of a typical mine, like a mill and a big waste pond. In theory, it keeps construction costs low and makes permitting easier, Van Nieuwenhuyse said. But shipping unprocessed ore also risks higher transportation costs, so Johnson Tract’s close proximity to the ocean and shipping routes made it attractive.
“It’s an awesome deposit,” Van Nieuwenhuyse said, citing the prospect’s high ratio of valuable minerals to rock and its thickness, which he expects will make the mining process more efficient.
Van Nieuwenhuyse is a veteran of Alaska’s mining industry, having worked over the past four decades on some of the state’s most prominent early-stage projects.
He played major roles in advancing Western Alaska’s Donlin project — the state’s biggest proposed gold mine — and high-profile prospects in Northwest Alaska at the end of the controversial proposed Ambler Road. He also led development of the Rock Creek gold mine near Nome, which closed in 2008 soon after opening amid a slew of challenges.
At Contango, where Van Nieuwenhuyse was named chief executive in 2020, he partnered with the multinational Kinross Gold Corp. to spearhead the construction of Alaska’s first large mine in more than a decade, a project in the Interior called Manh Choh.
Unlike that open-pit mine, Johnson Tract would be an underground operation. Several years of exploratory drilling, permitting and engineering are expected before a final decision on building a mine, Van Nieuwenhuyse said.

The mine, according to Contango’s preliminary plans, would operate for seven years and would be small compared to other major Alaska mines. Contango would share royalties on mineral sales with CIRI, which has an option to buy as much as a 25 percent stake in the mine.
CIRI declined interview requests about the Johnson Tract, and the corporation’s executives have made few public statements about it.
The project “presents an opportunity to responsibly develop mineral resources to benefit our shareholders while respecting the environment and preserving the land,” CIRI said in a brief update last year. “The Johnson Tract project reflects decades of hard work to build a foundation of self-determination and financial stability.”
 ‘We’re Here Because it’s Beautiful’

Dustin Solberg, the fisherman and mine opponent, was motoring to a net he’d set on the west side of Tuxedni Channel one afternoon last summer when he spotted a brown bear on a rocky beach ahead.
“I think it smells the fish, Dad,” 12-year-old son and deckhand Leif Solberg called out.
Neither father nor son seemed particularly concerned. The area has so many beach-loving bears that it draws tourists from around the world for viewing and photography.
Far more worrisome to the elder Solberg is the future of the beach where the bear was roving—near a site that Contango is studying as a port.
Solberg, his family and others who fish in the channel each summer have growing concerns about Contango’s vision. They fear that a new road and industrial dock, and the traffic and noise from trucks and ships, would mar the wild character of the bay and the park around it.

As Solberg looked across the channel, it was remarkably quiet, aside from a few fishing skiffs and an occasional float plane that landed at a bear-viewing lodge on Chisik Island. Other than the lodge and a few fishing cabins, Chisik is a federally designated wilderness area, home to a prolific seabird colony.
A dozen or so crews fish commercially for salmon in the bay. Two or three times a week, from June through August, they set, pick and pull nets along pebbly beaches on either side of Tuxedni Channel, with fishing periods that can last 12 hours or more.
It’s hard labor, Solberg said, but the season moves at a slower pace than Alaska’s bigger-volume salmon fisheries, like Bristol Bay, where boats sometimes work 24-hour shifts.
“If you wanted to make money, you would fish somewhere else,” said Ann Harding, Solberg’s wife. “We’re here because it’s beautiful.”
The area has “phenomenal” mountains and a striking density of birds and bears, added Harding, a seabird biologist who sometimes fishes alongside Solberg.
The family uses a cabin a mile or two down the shoreline from where the bear had been walking. It’s a small plywood structure beneath an A-frame roof, surrounded by an electric fence to keep away curious ursine visitors. The cabin is about a hundred feet back from the water and set fully within Lake Clark National Park.
Solberg and Harding bought the structure several years ago. They don’t have title to the land beneath it or a formal permit from the park service. But the cabin existed before the park was established, and past owners had an informal arrangement with federal officials to keep using it, Solberg said.

The cabin now sits in an easement that the Department of Interior earlier this year granted CIRI for a mining port. Solberg doesn’t think his small business will amount to much of an obstacle.
“This is just a little shack that doesn’t really compete with the value of an operation like that,” he said, referring to the mining plans. “So, I don’t expect this to get in the way of anything.”

CIRI and Contango have not made a final decision about where to put the port, and a CIRI environmental document said last year that there is “considerable uncertainty” about future construction.
Van Nieuwenhuyse, the Contango mining executive, said his company recognizes the rights of the setnetters, and he believes a mine can co-exist with the fishery.
“I would ask that everybody recognize CIRI’s rights as well,” he added.
 Where Belugas ‘Hang Out’

As it gathers pace, Contango is facing opposition not just from the commercial fishermen but also from conservation groups and some tribal governments in the region.
A national group, the Center for Biological Diversity, along with the Homer-based nonprofit Cook Inletkeeper and the Chickaloon Village Traditional Council, a tribal government, are suing the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers for issuing a key permit to Contango.
Several tribal leaders also have raised concerns about the project and have asked the Trump administration to suspend the permit.
A core concern among those opponents is that a mining operation could threaten Cook Inlet’s beluga whales, which are treasured by many Anchorage residents and local wildlife viewers.
The inlet’s belugas—which are genetically distinct from other beluga populations—once numbered around 1,300 animals, but their numbers sharply declined in the 1990s. They were listed as endangered in 2008 and still have not significantly recovered. The population now stands at some 330 whales.
During the summer, the belugas are commonly spotted feasting on fish at the mouths of salmon-bearing streams near Anchorage. Where they go in winter has been a mystery.
But last year federal scientists announced a big discovery in a study that analyzed underwater sound recordings.
The researchers, affiliated with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, identified Tuxedni Bay as the only known foraging ground for the whales between late fall and late spring. They warned that human-caused noise is a “key threat” to the belugas, which use sound to navigate and communicate, and that industrial activity could affect the quality of the whales’ habitat.
NOAA Fisheries, which led the study, declined interview requests. One of its scientists, in a press release announcing the study, said that “maintaining the status quo” may be all that’s needed to help the beluga population recover.
As Contango studies sites for a port, it’s now funding a new beluga survey by biologists working for the state of Alaska, which has often been more friendly to the mining industry than the federal government.
The survey is focused on the narrow channel where Contango is considering shipping ore, while the NOAA-led study looked more broadly at the 10-mile-long Tuxedni Bay.
“We want to know where the belugas like to hang out,” Van Nieuwenhuyse said.
One of the loudest voices advocating for the belugas and against development at the Johnston Tract is Cooper Freeman, a Homer resident and the Alaska director at the Center for Biological Diversity. The center is a 35-year-old nonprofit that aims to protect wildlife and ecosystems across the country, and it’s a participant in nearly a dozen active lawsuits in Alaska’s federal court.
In an interview, Freeman acknowledged CIRI’s right to the minerals at the Johnson Tract. But he noted that federal environmental laws still apply and argued that CIRI does not have an “absolute right” to build a mine.
In his view, the area is too ecologically rich—with its important beluga habitat and high density of brown bears, seabirds and shorebirds—to risk.
“It’s just an incredibly, biologically, intensively rich and completely intact area—one of the only remaining places like it in all of Cook Inlet,” he said. “I don’t think there’s any amount of money that’s worth destroying this place.”

There are no towns within 40 miles of the Johnson Tract—just roadless mountains, glaciers, forests and streams.
Aside from seasonal fishermen, CIRI and Contango’s neighbors include Silver Salmon Creek Lodge, a bear-viewing and sport-fishing business that’s near the mouth of the Johnson River, a dozen or so miles downstream of the mineral deposit.
Longtime lodge owners David Coray and Joanne Edney have kept loose tabs on the prospect for decades and have grown more concerned as Contango’s project advances.
In a recent interview, Coray and Edney said they’re worried that a mine could pollute the Johnson River and disrupt bear habitat.
“We understand their interest, and we understand their rights,” Edney said of CIRI and Contango. But a mining operation could come into “direct conflict” with her family’s business, she said.
CIRI declined to respond to questions about opposition to the project, and about how it’s gauging the views of its shareholders, some of whom have spoken out against it.
Van Nieuwenhuyse said Contango is committed to protecting wildlife.
“We’ll develop this deposit with minimal impacts to the environment, which we recognize as pristine,” Van Nieuwenhuyse said. “We’re all from Alaska. We enjoy the outdoors. That’s why we all became geologists.”
For Solberg, the fisherman, the convergence of competing interests in the area is “endlessly fascinating—and really complicated and really unfortunate.”
In a conversation after the fishing season, Solberg acknowledged a tension between CIRI’s rights to the Johnson Tract’s minerals and the spectre of a mine transforming the landscape and bay that his family has come to know and love.
Solberg said he feels “really torn” about the issue and that he respects CIRI’s land claims. But as one of the few Alaskans who spends long stretches of time in Tuxedni Bay, he feels obligated to speak in defense of its wildness and beauty.
“I just want decisionmakers to have their eyes wide open,” he said. “And to realize what’s at stake.”

EPA can charge up to $68,445 per day of Clean Water Act violations, but the agency lowered the charge on the basis that the feedlot had “a limited ability to pay a civil penalty.” 
In addition to the fee, Wynja Feedlot Inc., a 999-head capacity cattle feedlot, is required to apply for an National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System, or NPDES, permit, construct a lined containment basin and sample discharges from the surrounding tile for possible pollutants.

EPA discovered in March 2021 that the confined animal feeding operation had been discharging wastewater through a drainage pipe that led to a “relatively permanent” tributary of the West Branch of the Floyd River. 
According to EPA, the wastewater contained high levels of bacteria, ammonia, chlorides, and unprocessed organic matter, all of which can contribute to impaired water quality. 
The feedlot did not have an NPDES permit for the drainage pipe, and according to EPA, the facility admitted the observed discharge had occurred for three consecutive days. 
According to EPA and the Iowa Department of Natural Resource fish kill database, the West Branch Floyd River has been subject to multiple fish kills in the past two decades, some of which were attributable to animal waste.
EPA concluded the facility also had “limited wastewater containment” that meant further “unauthorized discharges” likely occurred during storms. 
The consent decree was filed Nov. 17, but the facility was tasked with meeting compliance deadlines over the summer to begin the process of building runoff control structures and sampling process plans. 
According to EPA, the facility has already applied for an NPDES permit and received a construction permit to build the lined containment basin. 
EPA estimates the facility’s compliance will prevent an estimated 4.5 million gallons of wastewater each year from entering the river. The agency estimates that amount of wastewater is equal to 137,000 pounds of pollutants, consisting of total suspended solids, nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium and oxygen demand.

(Photo by Peter Dazeley/Getty Images)An Iowa lawyer accused of elder abuse is now suing the Henry County District Court, the county attorney and the Mt. Pleasant chief of police over a search warrant related to his financial records.
Attorney Beau Bergmann and the Bergmann Law Firm are suing Henry County, Henry County District Court, Henry County Attorney Darin Stater, and Mt. Pleasant Chief of Police Lyle Murray in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Iowa.
The lawsuit claims Bergmann and his law firm maintained a lawyer trust account for depositing client funds at Wayland State Bank in Mt. Pleasant. According to the lawsuit, in August 2023, Murray and Stater  initiated a search warrant application for account information at Wayland State Bank. The warrant application allegedly sought access to financial statements for accounts controlled by Bergmann or the law firm.
As part of the warrant application, Murray allegedly provided the court with an affidavit stating that Bergmann had illegally taken $20,000 from a mentally incapacitated person and would not return the money. Additional references were made to $9,500 paid to Bergmann by a different client.
Murray’s affidavit, according to the lawsuit, alleged that “Bergmann either stole or fraudulently obtained money from the two victims.” The affidavit allegedly cites “two suspicious checking accounts,” without offering any explanation as to why the accounts were deemed suspicious.
Despite the fact that funds held in such accounts are not the property of the attorney who maintains the account, but are instead the property of the clients, Stater and Murray sought access to financial statements pertaining to the account, according to the lawsuit.
Based upon Murray’s affidavit, District Associate Judge Jonathan Stensvaag then approved the warrant application and signed a search warrant in the case, the lawsuit alleges.
Bergmann now claims the court was aware, or should have been aware, there was probable cause that a criminal offense had been committed.
The lawsuit seeks unspecified compensatory and punitive damages for alleged civil rights violations related to the improper issuance of search warrants and invasion of privacy.
The defendants in the case have yet to file a response to the lawsuit.
Lawsuit follows case alleging elder abuse
Civil court records indicate the search warrant pertaining to the mentally incapacitated individual are tied to a dispute that arose in May 2023, when attorney Steven E. Ort filed a court petition against Bergmann seeking relief from elder abuse.
In that case, Ort, who was representing the incapacitated individual’s conservator and guardian, alleged Bergmann had accepted $20,000 from the individual after that person’s financial matters were placed in the hands of the conservator, and that Bergmann then refused to return the money to the conservator.
“This is not an ordinary commercial transaction between a lawyer and a potential client,” Ort alleged in court filings, adding that the incapacitated individual “was subject to a pending guardianship and conservatorship when he first met with Mr. Bergmann (and) a conservator had been appointed by the time the check was dated and was cashed.”
Ort’s court filings also alleged Bergmann’s license to practice law had been suspended beginning on Feb. 24, 2023, and so Bergmann could not legally represent the individual at a court hearing that took place in March 2023.
“Bergmann cannot escape liability for elder abuse by asserting that his privilege to practice law somehow immunizes him,” Ort argued to the court.
In June 2023, Ort filed a motion to dismiss the case, although the available court records don’t indicate the reason for the motion.
Court records show that in December 2022, Bergmann consented to the suspension of his law license, admitting the Iowa Supreme Court Attorney Disciplinary Board had fielded “complaints containing allegations that I had violated ethical rules in my representation of multiple clients.”
In consenting to the suspension, Bergmann acknowledged the following previous sanctions:
April 2015: He was privately admonished for neglecting a client’s appeal.
July 2018: He was privately admonished on for lack of diligence in pursuing a client’s case and failing to keep his client informed.
September 2018: He was privately admonished due to unearned fees not being placed in a client trust account.
January 2020: The Iowa Supreme Court publicly reprimanded Bergmann for missing a hearing in a marriage-dissolution case and not attending a mediation session.
Court records show Bergmann’s Iowa law license is currently active.

“Not only do these exemptions provide immediate relief to our hardworking farmers and ranchers, but they also help bolster Arkansas’ number one industry,” Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders said in a news release.
Commodity crop farmers are facing one of their worst periods in decades as a result of skyrocketing production costs and stagnant demand. Agriculture industry leaders told lawmakers in September that 25% to 40% of farmers are likely to leave the industry after this season unless they receive aid.
State lawmakers petitioned the federal government for emergency financial aid to farmers last month.
Neither Sanders’ news release nor a letter from the state Department of Finance and Administration to the state Department of Agriculture makes it clear whether Arkansas farmers have received or are about to receive the requested aid. A spokesperson for the Arkansas Department of Agriculture did not respond to a request for comment.
In the letter dated Wednesday, Finance and Administration Secretary Jim Hudson confirmed to Agriculture Secretary Wes Ward that farmers will not have to pay income taxes as of Jan. 1 of this year if they received aid from the U.S. Department of Agriculture under the American Relief Act of 2025. This complies with Act 696 of 2025, sponsored by longtime farmer and Senate Majority Leader Blake Johnson, R-Corning.

Arkansas lawmakers urge feds to help farmers stay afloat in struggling industry


A provision of the American Relief Act is the Emergency Livestock Relief Program, which set aside $2 billion for livestock producers “suffering losses due to drought, wildfires, or flooding in calendar years 2023 and 2024,” according to the USDA website.
“Arkansas farmers and ranchers are the backbone of our state’s economy, and they continue to demonstrate incredible resilience in the face of extreme weather and market challenges,” Ward said in the news release. “These tax exemptions ensure that federal relief dollars go directly to helping producers recover, reinvest, and remain strong heading into the next growing season.”
Federal lawmakers are responsible for renewing a sweeping agriculture bill every five years to set both policy and funding levels for the industry. Arkansas Republican U.S. Sen. John Boozman chairs the Senate Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry Committee, one of the committees responsible for drafting the farm bill.
Congress has repeatedly extended the 2018 farm bill a year at a time, but it expired Sept. 30 of this year, the day before a 43-day government shutdown began. The spending package that reopened the government last week included three years of funding for the USDA.
The federal government faces the possibility of another shutdown in January without consensus on addressing rising health insurance costs.

(Rebecca S. Gratz for the Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — A group of voting advocates filed a ballot measure to make it harder for Nebraska lawmakers to override or alter voter-passed laws or measures tweaked by referendum. 
The group, Respect Nebraska Voters, announced its push to gather signatures on Thursday. The initiative is a state constitutional amendment that would require bigger majorities to repeal or change any law passed by voters.
The measure also would require larger majorities to make changes to the requirements or processes for a citizen-led initiative to reach the ballot.  
Currently the Legislature needs two-thirds of lawmakers, or 33 senators, to vote to make those kinds of changes. The ballot measure would increase the required vote to four-fifths, or 40 senators.
Dawn Essink, a sponsor of the new ballot measure, said what prompted the proposed constitutional amendment is seeing the “anger from a lot of Nebraskans who had worked very hard on that paid sick leave initiative, among other initiatives.”
The new push comes after this year’s legislative session, in which the officially nonpartisan but Republican-led Nebraska Legislature, often with gubernatorial support and the support of at least one Democrat, prodded for changes that would have weakened or reversed some ballot measures.

Essink said the ballot initiative process was designed so that the voice of Nebraska voters is heard, but lawmakers are disrespecting voters. 
“The Legislature is taking that vote and watering it down … diluting it … call it whatever you want, but they’re changing it to their will, not the will of the people,” Essink said.

For example, advocates said, the state is currently slowrolling two voter-approved laws legalizing and regulating medical cannabis. Nebraska’s GOP lawmakers and Democratic State Sen. Jane Raybold of Lincoln successfully pushed to weaken the voter-approved law’s blanket requirements for paid sick leave by adding new restrictions and exceptions. Legislative majorities tried — and failed for now — to slow down voter-approved minimum wage increases. That proposal is already scheduled to be reconsidered in the upcoming session.
Some conservative lawmakers have considered making the petition process harder because of the recent passage of more progressive measures have been passed in recent years.  
Jo Giles, executive director of the Women’s Fund of Omaha and a ballot measure sponsor, said the group wants to add “protections for the ballot initiative” and hopes Gov. Jim Pillen and conservative lawmakers support it. 
The ballot initiative process “is direct democracy,” she said. “It is letting Nebraskans vote for issues that come up, and we want them to respect the will of the people,” Giles said. 
The group organizing the new petition drive would need to gather the signatures of 10 percent of the state’s registered voters since the initiative seeks to change the state constitution. 
Respect Nebraska Voters has until July to get on the November 2026 ballot.

(Photo by Thomas Barwick/Getty Images)Pennsylvania is hoping to secure its own slice of a $50 billion rural health fund in the face of federal Medicaid cuts, with a focus on bolstering a beleaguered workforce and expanding health access for more than two million people. 
The Rural Health Transformation Fund was a last-minute addition to President Donald Trump’s summer budget bill that imposed Medicaid work requirements and cut upwards of $51 billion in funding to the commonwealth over the next decade. That new fund is worth roughly 37% of the estimated lost Medicaid funding in rural areas. 
“Pennsylvania is home to the third-largest rural population in the country, and our rural communities face unique challenges when it comes to public health and access to health care. A strong, accessible, affordable health care system is the foundation of any healthy community, and health care is essential to the economic growth, population revitalization, and stabilization of our rural communities,” said Val Arkoosh, the state’s secretary of the Department of Human Services, in a release.
The 67-page application — released Thursday, which was also National Rural Health Day — requests up to $200 million in annual funding over the next five years, totalling $1 billion. Its six focuses include: technology and infrastructure; workforce; maternal health services; behavioral health services; aging and access; and emergency medical services and transportation. 
The U.S. Department of Human Services is expected to award funding by the end of the year.

Key objective targets are: 

Access to care: More than 85% of Pennsylvanians can get a routine primary care appointment within four weeks and urgent care appointments within one week.
Digital connectivity and telehealth: More than 85% of rural hospitals and clinics will have broadband and telehealth functionality. More than 50% of rural hospitals and clinics connected via Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources. 
Workforce adequacy: Reduce rural hospital vacancy rates by 10% for key direct care roles. Add three new rural training programs. 
System sustainability: More than 60% of systems partnered with rural Community Health Centers for specialty care. 
Health outcomes: Reduce the number of pregnant women living in rural areas with inadequate prenatal care by 20%.


“The state did sort of have their hands tied on the different areas that they could apply for because of the way that (the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services) set up that funding,” said Helen Hawkey, the board president of the Pennsylvania Rural Health Association. 
She also serves as the director of the Pennsylvania Coalition for Oral Health and added that she would have liked to see more funding for dental access. But the overall investment in workforce development — a need across health care sectors — will attempt to fill in gaps across the spectrum alongside a separate state Rural Health Plan. 
“You have to have providers to have access. You cannot access health care if you have no one to provide it,” said Hawkey. “The incentives that are included in the plan — like scholarships, stipends, housing — all of those things are going to be really, really important to try to increase providers in rural areas.”
 Shoring up workforce, technology improvements

Though nearly 20% of the state’s population is rural, only 10% of the state’s physicians and hospital beds are in rural counties. 
Dentists number even fewer, with just 6% of the state’s practitioners in rural areas. 
Additionally, one-third of the state’s rural hospitals are at-risk of closing, according to The Hospital and Healthsystem Association of Pennsylvania. HAP told the Capital-Star in a statement that the anticipated funds wouldn’t be sufficient to make up for lost Medicaid funding.

“Fewer than half of the commonwealth’s rural hospitals are operating with margins necessary for long-term stability because they have been chronically underfunded for the care they provide. Medicaid is among the largest payors for many rural hospitals, yet, in Pennsylvania, reimburses only 71 cents per dollar spent providing care,” said Nicole Stallings, the organization’s president and CEO.
“This is already unsustainable but upcoming federal cuts will reduce reimbursement even more — to 64 (cents) per dollar — resulting in a nearly $1 billion direct payment cut to Pennsylvania’s rural hospitals over the next decade on top of a sharp rise in uncompensated care due to coverage losses.”
The state hopes to use the federal dollars to bolster the workforce of rural hospitals and update technology, both aspects praised by HAP and included in the organization’s September recommendations. 
The scholarships, rotations and residencies for future health care practitioners come with a five-year service commitment, prioritizing students from rural backgrounds
The state requested $239.2 million in workforce investments.
The application also pitches telehealth and virtual provider visits as ways to relieve burnout and increase access to specialists, with new technology assistance managed by a central hub. It specifically named artificial intelligence as an opportunity.

Examples include conversational AI, digital check-in tools and chronic disease prevention or management services. The Guthrie Clinic’s Pulse Center in Pennsylvania is highlighted for its use of AI in centralized digital monitoring and improved care coordination, which “ease staff workload and achieve reductions in nurse turnover and hospital costs.”
Even as practitioners report fewer hours devoted to paperwork because of AI, state lawmakers have recently sought to control the growth of AI in health care settings, citing transparency concerns.
 A focus on maternal and elder health

Mothers and mothers-to-be have inadequate prenatal care in rural areas, and nearly one-third of rural women live more than 30 minutes away from the closest labor and delivery unit. Three rural hospitals in the state closed their labor and delivery units last year, exacerbating the problem. 
The state proposes regional rural Maternal Health Hubs, places where pregnant Pennsylvanians can get comprehensive, coordinated care. The hubs will also facilitate — through face-to-face contact or telehealth — mental, oral and behavioral health care alongside substance use disorder services. 
 
Rural Pennsylvanians experience higher rates of mental illness and substance use disorder, compounded by the lack of qualified providers. The nation’s new suicide hotline, 988, continues to be underutilized in the commonwealth, with rural areas having disproportionately higher suicide rates. 
If you or someone you know is considering suicide, please call or text 988 to be connected to a crisis counselor free of charge 24/7.


“The hub model is invaluable in rural areas, where patients often face long travel distances, workforce shortages and fragmented care systems,” read the application. “The hub will augment the capacity of existing providers by centralizing key activities and expanding services where gaps exist.” 
Investments from the federal government could additionally fund: an app for new moms that connects them to local providers, telehealth and community resources; remote psychiatric and substance use consultations; and remote patient monitoring for high-risk pregnancies or postpartum complications. 
For these services, the state is requesting $187.4 million.
Expanding paramedicine services, where specially trained paramedics check on newly discharged patients, could improve recovery times for seniors and reduce readmissions. The providers can assess homes for fall risks — one of the leading causes of hospitalizations for older Americans — and assist with chronic disease management or wellness checks.
Additional dollars could be used to improve nursing home quality and staffing, which fell following the COVID-19 pandemic. In total, the state seeks $77.6 million for aging-related services. 
And while the public can expect annual state reports, staff at the University of Pittsburgh Medicaid Research Center will also provide independent evaluations, including “secret shopper” surveys to measure the impacts of rural health investments on appointment availability and wait times.",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/hospital-room-1024x6831762391450-1.jpg,,,2025-11-20 18:57:55.396017

The citizen nonprofit group filed a lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of using eminent domain for carbon capture and sequestration projects. (Elise Plunk/Louisiana Illuminator)A group of Louisiana residents is suing Gov. Jeff Landry’s administration over state laws that allow the acquisition of private property against landowners’ wishes for pipelines transporting carbon dioxide. 
Save My Louisiana, composed mostly of resident and elected officials from Allen, Beauregard, Livingston, Rapides and Vernon parishes, is the lead plaintiff in the lawsuit against the state Thursday morning in the 19th Judicial District Court in Baton Rouge. Group president Gray Musgrove joined six other local citizens in the case against the governor and state Department of Conservation and Energy Secretary Dustin Davidson.
The governor’s office did not respond to requests for comment on the lawsuit. A Conservation and Energy spokesman declined to comment, citing department policy on pending litigation. 
The lawsuit argues statutes on the use of eminent domain for carbon capture and storage in Louisiana law are unconstitutional. The laws “provide special privileges and immunities to private Corporations,” deny citizens their right to own property and cede judicial authority to the executive branch of state government.
There are currently 31 carbon capture and sequestration projects awaiting state approval, according to the Department of Conservation and Energy. The 101 total storage wells from these projects would cover 18 different parishes, mostly centered in Central and South Louisiana.

Only one well, operated by Hackberry Carbon Sequestration in Cameron Parish, has received approval so far, with its permit okayed on Sept. 5. The 101 total storage wells from these projects would cover 18 different parishes, mostly centered in Central and South Louisiana. 
Various state laws on the use of eminent domain for carbon transport and storage are listed in the lawsuit. Developers and government agencies that have successfully argued in court for the use of eminent domain to obtain property lean on the argument that the acquisition is for a greater good that outweighs the interests of the property owner. In the case of CO2 pipelines, the reasoning is that removing the greenhouse gas from the atmosphere and storing it underground is in the interest of public health by mitigating the effects of climate change. 
Supporters of the plaintiffs disagree. They include Louisiana Treasurer John Fleming, a U.S. Senate candidate who joined the plaintiffs outside the courthouse for a news conference and shared his opposition to forced land acquisitions for carbon capture projects.
“Eminent domain is designed for the public good … This is not for the public benefit,” Fleming said. “This is for the benefit of a very, very small group of people who will end up making lots of money from this.”
The issue of carbon capture has divided a Republican Party in Louisiana that typically backs the fossil fuel industry, a sector that’s shown the greatest interest in developing the technology. Some GOP state lawmakers with projects proposed in their districts have called for more restrictions on carbon capture and local approval for such projects. Gov. Jeff Landry has said he would like to see Louisiana lead the way in putting the technology to use.
“Believe me, we all support the oil and gas industry in general,” said Fleming, a Republican. “But there’s a segment that wants to make even additional money by putting burden on the citizens, and that’s where we draw the line. This is not good for Louisiana.”
Mike Slocum, co-founder of Save My Louisiana and one of the plaintiffs, said that while his group staunchly backs fossil fuels, there’s a lack of transparency between the industry and state and residents of parishes where carbon capture projects are planned.
“As we started to have [Save My Louisiana] meetings, we found that the community didn’t really know what it was,” Slocum said. “We don’t think the whole state really realizes what’s happening.”
Opponents of carbon capture and CO2 transport have concerns over safety and environmental impacts. Most hold up the example of a ruptured CO2 pipeline in 2020 that forced the evacuation of the small town of Satartia, Mississippi, that resulted in 45 people being hospitalized. Other worries include possible groundwater contamination and the potential for leaks. 
Beauregard Parish resident Mona DeFries, who owns land in Calcasieu Parish near a planned CO2 pipeline, said she feels the use of eminent domain for carbon capture is “a slap in the face” for property owners like her. Although she’s not a party in the lawsuit and hasn’t yet lost land to a project, DeFries said she supports its objectives and is concerned over environmental impacts and risk factors. 
“The safety issues haven’t been expressed clear enough for us,” she said.",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_4037-scaled-e1763674981951-1024x818.jpg,,,2025-11-20 18:57:55.396017

(Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout).A group of 10 Tennessee parents and taxpayers filed a lawsuit Thursday challenging the constitutionality of the state’s new “universal” private-school voucher program.
Filed in Davidson County Chancery Court against Gov. Bill Lee, Education Commissioner Lizzette Reynolds and Tennessee Board of Education members, the lawsuit says the Tennessee Education Freedom Scholarship Act violates the state constitution by shifting public funds to unaccountable private schools that “openly discriminate” against students.
The program provides vouchers worth nearly $7,300 to 20,000 students in its first year at a cost of $144 million. The state’s top lawmakers want to double the program to 40,000 in its second year. 
The program has two categories of students, 10,000 set aside for those whose family incomes hit 300% of the federal subsidized lunch program, up to $180,000, and 10,000 for students with no family income requirement.
“I’ve raised nine children in Memphis, and all of them have attended Shelby County Schools,” said Apryle Young, a plaintiff in the lawsuit. “I’ve seen what our teachers can do when they have resources, and what happens when those resources disappear. We need to invest in our public schools, not abandon them.”
The plaintiffs contend the law violates the education clause of the state constitution by diverting state money from underfunded schools and preventing an adequate education for students by funding schools outside the state’s system of free public schools.
The lawsuit says the voucher program is unconstitutional because participating private schools don’t have to meet the same academic standards, accountability measures such as tests and civil rights protections as public schools.
Debate over private-school voucher expansion looms in Tennessee

Private schools can discriminate against students with disabilities, LGBTQ students and those of certain religions, all of which would be illegal for public schools, the plaintiffs say. Nor are private schools required to follow the state’s curriculum  or special education services guaranteed for state and federal law, a release says.
In addition, teachers at participating private schools don’t have to follow state certification requirements or give the state’s main standardized test, which is used to determine student proficiency and teacher and school effectiveness, the release says.
“They call this ‘school choice,’ but the choice isn’t yours, it’s the private schools,” said one of 10 plaintiffs, Crystal Boehm, a Hamilton County parent and preschool teacher. “They can reject your child for a disability, for your family’s religion, for any reason at all. Meanwhile, public schools that educate everyone are losing the funding they need.”
The plaintiffs are represented by the American Civil Liberties Union of Tennessee, Education Law Center and Southern Poverty Law Center, in addition to the Southern Education Foundation and Robbins Geller Rudman & Dowd law firm.
Lawmakers passed Lee’s private-school voucher program in a January special session after postponing it in 2024 for lack of support.
The Department of Education released important dates Thursday for families wanting to apply for the money for the 2026-27 school year.
“In its first year of implementation, the Education Freedom Scholarship Program has been a remarkable success, and I look forward to continuing to deliver families with quality educational choices to best serve their students’ unique needs,” Education Commissioner Reynolds said in a statement.
Lee has said his only regret about the program is that it can’t be available to all students, though he is planning to try to expand it next year. 
The state estimated 66% of the students who receive the funds would be returning private-school students. The Lee administration refused to show how many of the 20,000 students receiving the vouchers attended private schools last year.

Idaho State Department of Agriculture officials said in a new release that there have been confirmed reports of Equine Herpesvirus Type 1, or EHV-1, linked to the events in Texas and Oklahoma. 
Idaho does not have any confirmed cases of the disease at this time, but state officials warned the virus is very contagious among horses and can lead to respiratory disease, abortions in pregnant mares, neurological disease and potentially the death of horses.

“Idaho has no confirmed cases of EHV-1 at this time,” Idaho State Department of Agriculture officials wrote in a news release issued Thursday. “Due to the highly contagious nature of the virus, the Idaho state veterinarian urges horse owners, trainers and event organizers to take immediate biosecurity precautions and temporarily stop any transporting or hauling of equine to protect Idaho horses.”
Although the virus is highly contagious among horses and can be spread through respiratory particles or contaminated equipment or clothing, state officials said the virus cannot infect humans. 
As a result of the confirmed cases of EHV-1, Idaho state officials urge horse owners, trainers and event organizers who may have participated in the events in Texas and Oklahoma to contact their veterinarian or the Idaho State Department of Agriculture’s Division of Animal Industries immediately. The phone number for the Boise off of the Division of Animal Industries is (208) 332-8540.
Symptoms of EHV-1 may include fever, nasal discharge or coughing, lethargy or depression, abortions on pregnant mares or neurological changes such as stumbling, incoordination, head tilt or hind leg weakness, state officials said. 
Infected horses may take up to 21 days to show symptoms, officials said.
Additional information about EHV-1 and biosecurity recommendations is available online.

The union representing Vermont state employees is turning to two legal venues to challenge Gov. Phil Scott’s order that many of its members return to the office in person.
On Nov. 10, the Vermont State Employees’ Association filed a charge with the state’s Labor Relations Board alleging the Scott administration skirted a union demand to enter formal bargaining over the return-to-work plan, in violation of labor protection laws. The plan will require many employees to come into the office at least three days a week. 
The union also filed a separate grievance with the Labor Relations Board arguing that parts of the plan violated the collective bargaining agreement it has in place with the state.

Then, on Nov. 12, the union filed a lawsuit in Washington County Superior civil court asking a judge to bar the Scott administration from implementing its workplace plan — set to take effect Dec. 1 — until the labor board adjudicates the union’s complaints. 
The union wrote in its lawsuit that “neither the unfair labor practice charge nor the grievance is capable of being decided” by the labor board before Dec. 1. The suit seeks a temporary restraining order or a preliminary injunction that allows state employees to continue working remotely.
Steve Howard, the union’s executive director, said in an interview Wednesday that he hoped the suit would at least slow the implementation of the governor’s directive. He said he thought a hearing could be held on the lawsuit as soon as next week. 
The legal challenges mark a significant escalation in the monthslong fight between the union and the administration over the plan to have state workers, with some exceptions, return to the office. The union contends that the hybrid work mandate will cause experienced employees to quit, decreasing the quality of state departments’ work. 
At the same time, administration officials say that the order will improve government services by boosting collaboration and helping to preserve institutional knowledge. They’ve argued Vermonters want government workers to be present in-person.
In a statement Thursday, Amanda Wheeler, a spokesperson for the governor’s office, said the union’s legal challenges had no impact on Scott’s support for the plan. 
“The Administration’s decision to implement this standard is well within our authority,” Wheeler wrote. “The Governor’s position on returning to a hybrid work standard has not changed, he continues to believe human connection is an important part of employee engagement, as well as team building and learning from each other.” 
According to court filings, after the administration formally announced its return-to-work plans in late August, it wrote to the union in September requesting a meeting to discuss the plans and hear the union’s concerns. In that letter, which is attached to the lawsuit, John Berard, the state’s director of labor relations, said the plan did not need to be the subject of formal bargaining. That’s because the planned hybrid work requirement was permissible under an existing teleworking policy for state employees, he said.

But the union doesn’t see it that way. In court filings, the union contends state leaders agreed to remote working arrangements for their employees, starting at the outset of the Covid-19 pandemic, that did not fall under the stipulations of the teleworking policy. Those arrangements “have become an established condition of employment which the State is not free to change” without entering formal bargaining, the union wrote in an Oct. 24 letter to the state. It demanded, in that letter, that bargaining take place. 
Berard then wrote the union back Nov. 10 saying the state’s position had remained unchanged, according to court filings. That’s the same day the union filed its challenges with the state Labor Relations Board.
The legal challenges are set to play out as the state has expanded its workspace ahead of the planned return to office for many employees. On Monday, it signed leases for three new office spaces in the privately owned Pilgrim Park complex in Waterbury, which records show would be used by workers at the state Agency of Human Services.
That agency has been facing a shortage of office space at the nearby Waterbury State Office Complex, where much of its operations are based. The shortage could delay the restart of in-person work for some employees past Dec. 1, officials said previously.
The state is set to pay about $2.3 million to lease the new office space over the next five years, according to the leases.

(Photo by Leon Neal/Getty Images.)Washington state lawmakers next year are set to again discuss whether public sector unions can bargain over their employers’ adoption of artificial intelligence technology.
House Bill 1622 looks to require government employers to bargain with unions over the use of the technology if it affects wages or worker performance evaluations. 
This past session, the bill passed the House mostly along party lines, with Democratic support, before stalling in the Senate.
Opponents, including business groups and city officials, argued the measure would skew the balance of power between employees and managers too far toward workers. They also said the mandate could delay workplace innovation.
With hopes of getting it over the finish line in 2026, the bill’s lead sponsor, Rep. Lisa Parshley, D-Olympia, brought the idea to the state’s artificial intelligence task force on Thursday. The Legislature created the task force in 2024.
“Public sector bargaining covers wages, hours and working conditions and agencies are already required to bargain any change that touches those areas, but without legislation, that bargaining happens after implementation,” said Washington State Labor Council President April Sims. “With legislation like House Bill 1622, it would happen before.”
A state law passed in 2002 prohibits bargaining over technology for classified employees of state agencies and higher education institutions. 
“The biggest technology decisions made by management was, what kind of desktop, what kind of fax, what kind of phone,” Parshley said of the era when that law took effect. “Is that fair when we have a technology that now will actually impact our workers in ways that we have not even begun to realize?”
A separate statute governing workers at cities, counties and other agencies, on the other hand, requires bargaining over technology if it affects issues like wages, hours or working conditions.
Many workers are concerned about what the rapid rise of artificial intelligence means for their job security. 
A Pew Research Center survey conducted late last year reported over half of workers are worried about the future impact of AI on the workplace and about one-third think it will lead to fewer jobs. About one-in-six workers said AI was already doing some of their work.
Maryland, for example, is partnering with AI company Anthropic to help residents apply for food aid, Medicaid and other social welfare programs.
In early 2024, then-Gov. Jay Inslee issued an executive order outlining a future for state government’s use of generative artificial intelligence. It noted that the state “seeks to harness the potential of generative AI in an ethical and equitable way for the benefit of the state government workforce.”
In line with that guidance, a September directive from the state’s Office of Financial Management requires giving union-represented state employees six months’ notice of any use of generative AI if it “will result in a consequential change in employee wages, hours, or working conditions.” Under the memo, unions can file a demand to bargain over using the technology.
“Including workers at the beginning is not a courtesy. It is a practical necessity,” Sims said. “It identifies risk. It ensures human oversight where it is needed, and it builds trust among staff, who will ultimately have to operate, troubleshoot and rely on these systems.”
The memo also mandates human review for such systems when they’re used for employment-related decisions.
Parshley called the directive an “excellent first step.” But she says her proposed law “would allow future administrations to be held accountable” by codifying the order in law.
Meanwhile, President Donald Trump is reportedly considering an executive order directing U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi to sue states that pass regulations on AI. But it’s unclear if that would cover potential laws like this one, since it doesn’t directly regulate the technology itself.
It’s the latest salvo in the debate over a federal versus state approach to guardrails on the technology. In the debate over Trump’s signature tax cut and spending law over the summer, Congress considered putting a moratorium on state-level artificial intelligence regulations. U.S. Sen. Maria Cantwell, D-Wash., led the charge to axe that provision from the final law.

Santiago/Getty Images)A Northern Kentucky Republican is working on a bill that would require all Kentucky police agencies to enter agreements for immigration enforcement under a program that has rapidly expanded under the Trump administration. 
Rep. TJ Roberts, of Burlington, presented the proposal during a Thursday meeting of the Interim Joint Committee on Local Government. He argued that entering such agreements with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) would provide Kentucky police agencies with new federal resources and dollars. 
However, Democrats on the committee voiced apprehension about requiring local agencies to partner with ICE. 
“I think this really gets down to being a local control issue for me,” said Rep. Rachel Roarx, D-Louisville. “Our law enforcement agencies, I think they know their jurisdictions best. They know where their resources need to be allocated.”
Roberts later said that his bill would be “a way to ensure greater senses of community policing, of allowing it to be done and administered by the local level.” 
Kentucky’s Republican-controlled General Assembly could consider the bill during the 2026 legislative session, which starts in January. 
Roberts called the agreements an “incredible opportunity to provide more resources to our law enforcement community, to promote public safety and to align us with the priorities of the federal government.” He added that local police officers would be “deputized for limited immigration enforcement,” such as during traffic stops when they have “reasonable suspicion” to further investigate the driver’s or passengers’ citizenship or immigration status. 
Roberts acknowledged that while some Kentucky law enforcement agencies have entered ICE agreements, he believes “we do not have that in the areas that we need it at.” 
According to ICE’s website, 22 law enforcement agencies within Kentucky have an active 287(g) program to date. The agencies include mostly county sheriffs’ departments but also some local jails and a local police department. All of the agreements were signed this year. 
Roarx questioned what Roberts meant by not having the agreements “in the areas that need it most.” Roberts said his home region of Northern Kentucky, which has major highways, should have such agreements. He added that “it’s needed everywhere in Kentucky” and not just in the counties with current programs. 
“Once they complete that 40 hours of training that is all online, that is paid for by the federal government, these officers are deputized by Immigrations and Customs Enforcement,” Roberts said. “And they can only engage in this limited enforcement while under the supervision of the federal authorities in order to ensure that there is oversight, that there is accountability.” 
If approved, Roberts’ proposal would direct the Kentucky State Police and local law enforcement agencies to have a written agreement with ICE under Section 287(g) of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996. The program is often referred to as the 287(g) Program. 
Under such agreements, ICE can delegate “the authority to perform specified immigration officer functions” to state and law enforcement officers, the federal agency’s website says. 
ICE expanded the number of agreements by 641% after Republican President Donald Trump took office earlier this year. However, immigrants and their advocates have argued that these agreements can lead to racial profiling and lack oversight. 
The U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) previously announced that law enforcement agencies participating in the 287(g) Program would be eligible for significant reimbursements starting in October. An example of that is that ICE may reimburse an agency for “the annual salary and benefits of each eligible trained 287(g) officer, including overtime coverage up to 25% of the officer’s annual salary.” 
Roberts argued the agreements would bring in significant dollars to Kentucky law enforcement agencies. He added that he had been working with legislative liaisons for DHS and ICE on the legislation and it was “one of their top priorities.” 
Committee co-chair Rep. Patrick Flannery, R-Olive Hill, emphasized that he viewed the agreements as “an opportunity to potentially utilize resources from the federal government to implement those into our local communities that we serve.” 
Democratic lawmakers took issue with the proposal. Rep. Sarah Stalker, of Louisville, said she had “a lot of concern” about deputizing officers for a new jurisdiction, particularly when news reports across the country have highlighted what many see as cruelty and abuse during arrests and mass raids. 
“I feel like this would simply exacerbate an issue that is already on its own out of control,” Stalker said. 
Before the meeting, advocacy group Kentucky Citizens for Democracy expressed concerns about Roberts’ proposal and encouraged lawmakers to reject the legislation. 
“This proposal, which strips local governments of the ability to decide their own level of cooperation with federal immigration enforcement, is fundamentally unacceptable,” the group said in a statement. “Our cities and counties know their communities best. Forcing them into mandatory cooperation with ICE, given its long history of egregious and cruel actions, violence, and overly aggressive tactics, will deepen fear, break trust, and push our immigrant neighbors further into the shadows.”

“I want to state clearly the way our AML (anti-money laundering) program operated in this instance was unacceptable,” Caesars Entertainment Chairman of the Board Gary Carano told the commission. 
“We never sacrifice compliance for revenue,” Caesars CEO Tom Reeg said. “There is no customer that’s worth illegitimate profits. We didn’t catch Boyer and we should have. Full stop.”
The $7.8 million is three times the amount that Bowyer lost gambling at Caesars. 
“So any notion or concern that Caesars will somehow benefit net of a fine amount is absolutely not the case,” said Michael Somps of the Nevada Attorney General’s office. “They are paying three times more than they won over the period.”
Bowyer, an associate, and illegal bookie Damien LeForbes, lost just under $24 million at Resorts World Las Vegas, which paid a $10.5 million fine for allowing them to gamble, leaving the casino with close to $14 million in net profit, and rendering the sanction little more than the cost of doing business. 
Bowyer is currently serving a 12-month sentence for bookmaking and money laundering. LeForbes is awaiting sentencing on the same charges.
“You had an AML officer who was a senior vice president,” Commissioner Rosa Solis-Rainey said to Caesars Palace executives. “The fact that this gentleman was a bookie was brought to his attention in 2019, so that is six years before he was banned by the property.” 
Only Solis-Rainey declined to support the stipulated fine, which she said should be higher, given what she deemed to be more egregious violations by Caesars than MGM Grand. That resort paid an $8.5 million fine for allowing another bookie, Wayne Nix, to pay gambling debts with a large amount of cash. 
Scott Sibella, president of MGM at the time, lost his gaming license for failing to file an anti-money laundering (AML) report for the transaction, and entered a plea deal in federal court for the same infraction.  
On Thursday, Solis-Rainey and Commissioner Brian Krolicki conflated Bowyer and Nix, holding Bowyer solely responsible for a series of high-profile AML violations adjudicated by regulators this year. 
MGM, Solis-Rainey, had “all of the steps in place years before Bowyer infiltrated their system, and that was done through the help of a third party internally that chose to make unilateral decisions, to not follow the program,” she said, referring to Sibella and confusing Bowyer with Nix. “He (Sibella) was as much a bad actor as Bowyer.” 
Krolicki also erroneously attempted to lay all of the Strip’s money laundering sanctions this year at Bowyer’s feet. 
“This AML wrecking ball by the name of Mathew Boyer continues to wreak havoc on compliance plans down the street,” he said. ”I’m as livid today as I was during the first case. …It’s almost numbing that we continue to have this conversation, particularly because of the acts of one individual.”",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/image-10-1024x576.png,,,2025-11-20 17:57:52.707512

The state Insurance Superintendent is asking the Legislature to extend a $10 million fire mitigation program for homeowners in high-fire-risk areas. (Patrick Lohmann / Source New Mexico)New Mexico’s Superintendent of Insurance said Thursday she hopes the Legislature will continue its support of a $10 million wildfire mitigation program for homes at extremely high wildfire risk, a program she said is becoming a national model to address rising homeowners’ insurance rates and cancellations.
The Legislature gave $10 million to the Office of the Superintendent of Insurance during the session in January for grants to homeowners who live in increasingly wildfire-prone areas. The grants help owners who have “Fair Access to Insurance Requirements” plans, or FAIR plans, pay for wildfire mitigation measures.
The state’s FAIR plan increasingly provides the only option for homeowners in wildfire-prone areas. Known as the “insurer of last resort,” the plans only become available to home and property owners if they’ve been denied coverage in the private market. 
Lawmakers approved the $10 million in grants this year to help FAIR plan recipients avoid losing their homes to wildfire, but the funding expires June 30, according to the state budget. 
NM GOP and Democrats say state needs to fix home insurance, as disasters upend private market

Insurance Superintendent Alice Kane told the Legislative Finance Committee on Thursday that she is asking the Legislature to re-authorize and extend the funding, because the program shows promise and could become a national model with more time. She also said the program ranks as the largest of its kind in terms of the amount of financial support available.
“We think the whole country is looking at us as being a leader in this wildfire mitigation program,” she said. 
As of Thursday, she said 28 Otero County homeowners with the FAIR Plan were slated to receive $7,000 grants from the fund as part of a “pilot program” to fire-proof their roofs in line with the highest standards of the Insurance Institute for Business and Home Safety, a nonprofit research and testing organization that seeks to reduce property damage from natural disasters.
Kane said she hopes those roofs will all be completed by spring, and then the office will have tested a grant program that could benefit as many as 1,400 FAIR plan holders. 
“We’re hoping that the pilot program will be not just operational, but done by the first quarter this year, so we can show the Legislature that the money is being used,” she said.
Across the state, homeowner and other property insurance premiums have sharply increased, and insurers have refused to renew or even canceled policies in some areas, particularly the burn scars of the recent South Fork, Salt and Hermits Peak-Calf Canyon fires.
In the private market, New Mexico’s 10 biggest insurers have increased premiums on average 50% to 60% since 2022, the chief OSI actuary has said. 
The mitigation program is just one of several big changes to the FAIR plan in 2025. During the session, the OSI approved increasing the plan’s coverage from $350,000 to $750,000. And in October, the office announced that an increase in commercial coverage limits, as well, from $1 million to $2 million. 
In October, about 7,200 residents were in the FAIR plan statewide, including 280 businesses, according to the news release.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/IMG_0116-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-11-20 17:57:52.707512

The state’s third major political party, the Vermont Progressive Party, voted in an almost entirely new bench of statewide leaders at its biennial convention earlier this month.
Among them is a new party chair: Bill Hunsinger of Ripton, who serves as one of two Progressive-endorsed members of that Addison County town’s selectboard. He is the party’s first new chair in close to a decade. Anthony Pollina, a longtime state senator from Middlesex, stepped down this month from the job, which he had held since 2017.
The Progs also elected Cindy Weed, a former state representative from Enosburgh, as vice chair, along with a slate of other officials who oversee the party’s finances and direct its electoral strategy. Ahead of the convention, the party also hired a new executive director: Heather Thomas. Josh Wronski, the party’s former director, left the job in July after nine years.
In all, just four members of the party’s 17-person leadership committee are returning to their posts after the party’s convention, held Nov. 9 at the Old Labor Hall in Barre. A press release called the changes “a new era for the Vermont Progressive Party.”

Hunsinger said he wants that new era to include a stronger party presence at the most local levels of government. That means giving more candidates for selectboard and school board races a Progressive Party endorsement, he said in an interview, even though few of those seats, anywhere in the state, are filled in party-based elections. 
In Burlington — where candidates for city office do run under a party label — Progs control the mayor’s office and have a slim minority of five of 12 seats on the City Council. 
According to the party’s website, there are also Prog-backed officials in nonpartisan selectboard seats in Ripton, Brattleboro and Dummerston, as well as in nonpartisan school board seats in Burlington and the Windham Southeast Supervisory Union.
“We’re not trying to make these races partisan,” Hunsinger said Wednesday. “Just, you know — there are Progressives. We’re here. We’re reducing speed limits, and helping organize food drives and clothing drives. It’s that sort of a mentality.”
At the state level, there are three members of the Vermont House and one state senator who primarily identify with the party’s label. A number of other members of both chambers, and State Auditor Doug Hoffer, identify as Democrat/Progressives. The party often caucuses with Democrats and its platform aligns with Democrats on many issues.
However, the Progressive caucus disagreed with many Democrats, who control both chambers of the Legislature, on this year’s marquee legislation — Act 73. That’s the law that lays out sweeping changes to how Vermont’s schools are funded and governed. To be sure, Republican Gov. Phil Scott had also insisted legislators advance the law in a form he was amenable to.
Hunsinger said he wants Progs to continue taking a stand against Act 73 in the upcoming legislative session, which starts in early January. Burlington Rep. Kate Logan, the House Progressive leader, agreed in an interview Thursday that would be a priority for her caucus next year.
At its recent convention, the Progs passed a resolution “to petition the VT Legislature to rescind Act 73, and instead explore options to make the education portion of the Property Tax more fair and equitable in order to ensure that every owner of property in Vermont is contributing proportionally to funding Vermont Schools,” the party’s release said.
Hunsinger described his opposition to the education reform plan, which seeks to consolidate the state’s 119 school districts, as a desire to preserve local control. He charged that the Legislature has been making “broad, almost power-grabby decisions.”
“Our party is going to keep fighting for making sure that our schools are kept in our communities — and our communities are given autonomy over their own schools,” he said.
The party also passed two resolutions at its convention this month focused on major national issues. The party does not run candidates for federal offices, though it counts Vermont’s independent U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders among its ranks.
One of those measures “condemns the apartheid and ethnic cleansing by the Israeli State” against people in Gaza and calls for an immediate end to all U.S. government funding for the Israeli military, according to the press release. It also states “that Israeli settlers in the West Bank be expelled and the land returned to Palestinians.”
Sanders has been among the most vocal critics of the Israeli government in the U.S. Senate and, along with the other two members of Vermont’s congressional delegation, has called the country’s military campaign in Gaza a “genocide.”
Another resolution “recognizes the critical need for public resistance to and non-compliance with unlawful and unconstitutional actions” by President Donald Trump’s administration.
Hunsinger said he hopes the party can be a home for Democrats who feel that their party, at the national level, isn’t doing enough to resist Trump’s many controversial actions over the first year of his second term.
“The Vermont Progressive Party endorses all facets of resistance, including political action, protests, strikes, boycotts and other acts of non-compliance,” the resolution states, per the release. “We will work in every capacity afforded to us.”

The summit “is a way to coalesce in our movement of resistance against authoritarianism, oligarchy and oppression,” said Big Hartman, Human Rights Commission general counsel and executive director.

This story by Maryellen Apelquist was first published in The Herald on Nov. 20, 2025
Human rights concerns and calls to action spanned a sweeping summit of the same name last weekend in Randolph Center, as advocates from across the state gathered to call out inequity and mistreatment, in areas from housing to policing, with an eye toward pushing Vermonters to continue to effect change.
The state Human Rights Commission hosted the three-day event, the first of its kind, largely in response to federal actions over the last several months.
“The idea for this conference really hit me like a bolt of lightning during one of many sleepless nights where my mind could not rest amidst the horror of what is happening at the national and global level,” said Big Hartman, HRC general counsel and executive director, in their opening remarks to a few dozen community members who turned out to Vermont State University’s Judd Hall on Nov. 14. At least twice that number tuned in online.
The summit “is a way to coalesce in our movement of resistance against authoritarianism, oligarchy and oppression,” said Hartman. “To strategize for solutions to the civil rights crisis that is upon us. We are not here to complain and commiserate about the Trump administration’s horrendous policies and actions, although of course a little of that is bound to happen.”
In the spirit of boosting spirits and strengthening participants’ resolve in working toward justice, the summit began by celebrating Vermont’s human rights wins over the years, such as its leadership in marriage rights for same-sex couples, gender identity non-discrimination, expansion of protections against harassment and access to housing.
José Ignacio De La Cruz of Migrant Justice spoke of his personal experiences with discrimination in Vermont that led to his and others’ advocacy work. That work resulted in a recently enacted Vermont law that expressly prohibits discrimination against immigrants in housing and in places of public accommodation, based on their citizenship or immigration status. Specifically, the new law requires landlords to accept an original or copy of an unexpired government-issued ID, an individual tax identification number or a Social Security number.
Before the law was passed, De La Cruz said, immigrants often faced discrimination because they did not have a Social Security number. He also pointed to other acts of discrimination, particularly as he and other community members in recent years began seeking employment, and subsequently housing, in areas outside of dairy farming where housing was included as a condition of employment.
For example, “when workers were leaving farms to work on sawmills or with some construction subcontractors,” they were assured there would be housing, but ultimately would find untenable conditions — such as four workers being charged $500 each to share a single bedroom, or, in the case of De La Cruz’s family member, who belongs to a queer community, being told: “You can’t have visitors at home because I don’t want the house to fill up with people like you.”
Other key voices throughout the weekend came from those who, like De La Cruz, shared their lived experience. Among them were Mohsen Mahdawi, a legal U.S. resident and Palestinian activist who last April was taken away by masked federal agents after his naturalization appointment in Colchester. During a session on Saturday, Mahdawi and one of his attorneys, Monica Allard of the American Civil Liberties Union of Vermont, spoke of his experience.
“After 16 days in a Vermont prison, a judge ordered Mohsen to be released, allowing him to return to his communities, his studies, and his advocacy,” Allard said. “But this legal battle is not over, and the [federal] government was in court just weeks ago arguing again that it has the authority to lock Mohsen back up.”
For his part, Mahdawi, who grew up in a refugee camp in the West Bank, spoke poetically of his community of Vermonters “being as sweet as the maple syrup that we get from the maple trees,” and as connected in protecting each other. A stark contrast from life in the camp, he said, where “as a child … I never felt safe.”
He also spoke of Vermont being a place in the United States where civil rights and the constitution are protected. “Democracy and human rights are aligned,” he said, and noted that what we are seeing now are “very chilling” attacks on free speech. Mahdawi contemplated what the “future could look like for humanity” if Project 2025 — a political blueprint aimed at reshaping government in line with far-right policies — is successful.
“If they succeed in orchestrating it, and demolishing and destroying human rights here in this country, silencing people, punishing people for their speech, they will be able to do it on a much larger level,” on an international level, given the influence of the United States.
A discussion about policing
José Ignacio De La Cruz also participated in a panel centered on fair and impartial policing in Vermont, a session that frequently turned to the presence of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement in the state, as well as the role of law enforcement as communities struggle to respond to mental health crises.
Among the other panelists were Vermont State Police Sgt. Daniel F. Bennett, a senior drill instructor who also serves as co-director of the Fair and Impartial Policing Committee; Lisa Ryan, community inclusion director with the Vermont Criminal Justice Council and Vermont Police Academy; and Tabitha-Ann J. Moore, an equity strategist and consultant who works with law enforcement and communities. Moore is also the founding president of the Rutland-area NAACP.
Again the topic was personal for De La Cruz, who last June, with his stepdaughter, was detained by U.S. Border Patrol while delivering food to a farm. They were held for weeks before being released following a public campaign.
He spoke of the migrant community’s fight for access to driver’s licenses years ago, but how once they had them, and were on the roads, they would get pulled over by police and end up getting turned over to Border Patrol. “Because of all the work over the past decade, I can say now that really we have changed those practices and that we’re not seeing that form of collaboration” between local law enforcement and federal immigration authorities, he said.
On what it means to be a leader in fair and impartial policing, Bennett noted that VSP has long been forward-thinking. “It’s an important distinction that Vermont State Police began this [work and have taken] it seriously, prior to all the attention and the focus on this,” the sergeant said. “We’re doing a lot of cooperation with a lot of different organizational communities.”
Ryan, the VCJC community inclusion director said that Vermont is a national leader “because we walk the walk at the top, right? We are doing and acting in what we’re saying we’re gonna do. … We have a great system of community policing in the state, people getting to know their neighbors. So I think being a small state and building those relationships between law enforcement, communities, and the different agencies that law enforcement represents is so important.”
Still, the panelists addressed instances where actions on the ground do not align with policies. De La Cruz referred to instances where Border Patrol has been called on the pretext of law enforcement needing help translating from Spanish to English. “At the end of the day, the result was that the person was being detained by immigration authorities. … These pretexts [are] put in place to try to avoid compliance with policy.”

(Getty Images)A Florida Bar complaint alleging defamation was filed Thursday against a Miami Beach City Commission candidate who had long-celebrated her father — a serial killer who inspired ‘Dexter’ executed by the state in 2012 — on social media.
The complaint by South Florida filmmaker Billy Corben alleges that Monique Pardo Pope, an attorney and commission hopeful, defamed him to the Miami New Times by falsely claiming — somewhat ironically — that Corben had previously lost a defamation case.
Pardo Pope is preparing for a run-off election for the seat on Dec. 9.
Her comment came after the Times asked her about a discovery Corben had made:
Pardo Pope’s father was a pro-Nazi, anti-Black serial killer executed in 2012 for murdering nine people in South Florida. Years after his execution, Pardo Pope called Manuel Pardo her “guiding light” on social media, promising Floridians that she planned to bring the “kind of leadership” she learned from her family to City Hall.
“Ms. Pardo Pope is certainly free to view her father as an angelic, heroic figure and she unquestionably has the right to criticize my reporting; however, she is not entitled to defame me, nor should she be allowed to ignore her professional obligations as a member of the Bar,” Corben wrote in his five-page complaint, rife with Eminem quotes and sardonic hits at the Bar for not disciplining other embattled attorneys.
“Moreover, as my reporting rightfully notes, if Ms. Pardo Pope intends to use her family history as the slightest basis for her candidacy, she should be candid with voters about the sins of her serial killer father and explain how she reconciles that history with her glowing statements about him,” he added.
Later, talking to the Phoenix, Corben stressed that his complaint is “not about the sins of the father, but about the lies of the daughter.”
What happened?
On Sep. 25, Corben, an avid critic of local Miami politics and founder of the BecauseMiami podcast, first reported that the Miami Beach candidate was related to Manuel Pardo, a fired Sweetwater police officer who dealt cocaine and systematically murdered both drug dealers and bystanders alike in the 1980s.
Pardo Pope was 4 years old when the crimes occurred.
When searching the Pardos’ Hialeah apartment, Corben said officers found a family dog named “Satan,” tattooed with a Swastika, Polaroid photos of Pardo’s victims, and a slew of anti-Black and anti-Jewish memorabilia. Pardo was executed via lethal injection after then-Gov. Rick Scott signed his death warrant in 2012.
Years after his execution, Pardo Pope offered adulation of her father on social media. He was her “guardian angel,” she wrote.
“Happiest of Birthdays to this little girl’s first true love — her Daddy. You would’ve been 59 years young today. Missing you each and everyday, mi papi bello….my guiding light in the sky, my eternal best friend,” she wrote, including a photo of him holding her as a baby.
She signed it off with his final words on the execution table, “Airborne forever, love your Michi girl.”
The Miami New Times quickly picked up Corben’s reporting, reaching out to Pardo Pope for comment (she did not immediately respond to the Phoenix’s request for comment). She told them that “Billy Corben has made a career of slinging mud, which has even resulted in losing a defamation case.”
Corben had not lost the defamation case. The case against his movie-making firm was dismissed, and Corben’s company instead filed an anti-SLAPP suit and was awarded more $180k. The law disfavors lawsuits found to infringe participation in public affairs.

They said the department’s approach and the decisions violate the Montana Constitution.
In a lawsuit filed Tuesday in Lewis and Clark County District Court, Bull Mountain Land Alliance and the Northern Plains Resource Council both say that vague rules or, in some cases, no rules allow department officials to modify mining plans constantly without any public notice, input and scrutiny. If the court found that to be the case, it would not only violate the Montana Constitution’s provisions guaranteeing the right-to-know and right to participate in government, but also run afoul of the environmental protections enshrined in the state’s document as well.
The state’s constitution says that residents must be provided the information about governmental plans, often described as “right to know.” That includes some residents and groups being notified when changes are proposed. Another section of the constitution says that residents have the right to participate or give input at the decision making process. However, the new lawsuit said that DEQ officials are making thousands of decisions without any public notice or chance to comment. Moreover, the suit alleges that DEQ officials have created a regulatory scheme that is vague and poorly defined so that it can essentially hide information from the public until after the action is completed. Montana’s Constitutional also requires a “clean and healthful” environment for current and future generations.
Officials with the DEQ did not respond to requests for comment as of publication.
  Major vs. minor decisions 

Part of the case turns on how the state’s DEQ, which has supervisory and regulatory power over mining operations in Montana, classifies decisions, either as major or minor. Major decisions are subject to public notice and input, whereas the state appears not to apply the same processes to actions it deems “minor.”
For example, ranchers, farmers and landowners near the Bull Mountain Mine, which is operated by Signal Peak Energy, say that the mine’s operations affect their springs, livestock wells and groundwater. However, they are often unaware of actions that are being taken by the company and approved by state DEQ regulators because they are considered minor revisions to the mine’s permit.
“(DEQ’s) regulations authorizing revisions to permits with no notice or opportunity to be heard are unlawful under Montana’s public participation statutes and infringe on fundamental constitutional rights by depriving plaintiffs and their members of adequate notice of permit revision applications, agency deliberations and any meaningful opportunity to examine documents or participate in decisions of significant interest to them and to the broader public,” the suit said.
The DEQ currently defines “major revisions” or actions as those which result in:


A significant change in the post mining drainage plan;
A change in the post mining land use;
A significant change in the bonding level within the permitted area; or
A change that may affect the reclaimability of an area or the hydrologic balance on or off the permitted area.

 
Major changes must be published in a newspaper for four consecutive weeks, with the last triggering a 30-day public comment period. The DEQ also has a list of five things it does if a major permit revision is complete, and that includes public notice of the action, where documents can be inspected, and that comments can be submitted formally or informally.
However, the suit points out: “There is no public process required or prescribed by law for the proposed permit revisions that DEQ considers to be ‘minor.’”
That alone, the lawsuit contends, is problematic because it appears to be at odds with the state’s Constitution.
  Hundreds of minor changes 

The conservation groups say during the life of the Bull Mountain mine permit, the DEQ has approved hundreds of permit revisions to it without “any public notice or process by classifying the revisions as ‘minor.’” Attorneys for the groups say in the past decade alone, they’ve tracked approximately 100 which have skirted a public review process.
Even with these small changes, the DEQ prepares an environmental assessment for the minor revisions, but those don’t get posted publicly and there is no public feedback mechanism, according to the lawsuit.
“Many of the revisions approved by DEQ for the Bull Mountains Mine permit with no public process have concerned modifications to surface water control plans, mitigation plans associated with springs and livestock wells, and the monitoring and quality assurance plan — all of which are incorporated into the permit — without any notice or any opportunity to comment by either the public at large or the landowners whose water resources are the subject of the minor permit revision,” the lawsuit said.
The lawsuit said that there’s no chance for the public to participate or even know about the revisions, one of the bedrock principles of Montana’s open records laws: That residents must be given a meaningful way to be notified and participate.
The lawsuit noted that even Rep. Gary W. Parry, a Republican lawmaker and advocate for coal mining from Colstrip, warned in 2023 that the policy was vague.
“The current definition (in Montana DEQ rules) for a ‘minor revision’ is, essentially, anything that isn’t a major revision,” Parry said on Nov. 22, 2023. “That kind of ambiguity sets the stage for uncertainty for our mining industry, and an open door for litigation against the state when the department exercises its discretion in applying this broad definition.”
  DEQ responses 

Both the Bull Mountains Land Alliance and the Northern Plains Resource Council contend in the lawsuit that they have “repeatedly raised concerns” about this policy, but have not had much feedback.
“DEQ has failed to respond meaningfully by to plaintiffs’ concerns,” it said.
Moreover, the vague approach to minor versus major changes are not backed up by other resources.
“DEQ has no publicly available guidance document, manual, policy or other written criteria governing how it determines whether a proposed revision is a major or minor,” the lawsuit said. “The vague and ambiguous regulator definitions of ‘major revision’ and ‘minor revision’ coupled with the absence of any public process for minor revisions has created a regulatory loophole that DEQ has exploited to approve hundreds of coal mine permit modifications without public oversight.”
The lawsuit claims that violations of state constitutional law require Judge Mike McMahon to apply strict scrutiny to the case, which means that the DEQ will have to show that its approach to permitting mines serves a beneficial public purpose and that it has done it in the least restrictive way.
The groups, represented by Barbara Chillcott, Melissa Hornbein, and Meridian Wappett of the Western Environmental Law Center in Helena, are asking for the court to rule the policies violate state law, and force the DEQ to provide public notice and afford the public the right to participate or comment on the process. The groups are also asking for the court to award it attorneys’ fees for vindicating constitutional rights, if they’re successful.
“By delegating to itself unfettered discretion to process permit revisions behind closed doors, DEQ violates our fundamental constitutional rights to know and participate in the operations of our government,” said Bull Mountains resident Pat Thiele, who is also a member of the Landowners Alliance. “This practice not only threatens our livelihoods here in the Bull Mountains, but erodes the rights of Montanans across our state.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/IMG-4639-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-11-20 17:57:52.707512

(Photo by Kyle Martin/For the North Dakota Monitor)Emmons County residents had mixed but mostly positive opinions Thursday about a project that would be North Dakota’s first-ever battery storage site.
NextEra, the company overseeing the project, is looking to build an estimated $181 million to $191 million Battery Energy Storage System project that would use massive batteries to harbor wind energy when it’s produced in excess — on days when wind harnessed by turbines exceed demand for electricity. Utility regulators will decide whether to give the proposal the final green light.
The batteries would be stored on 24 acres of an existing wind farm operated by NextEra. Storage sites are typically empty fields peppered with rows of massive, highly-secure battery units similar in size to shipping containers.
Similar projects have been popping up across the country as a way to smooth out grid congestion tied to energy sources variable generation. The technology receives production tax incentives from the federal government.
North Dakota utility regulators to consider state’s first-ever battery storage sites 

During a Public Service Commission hearing in Emmons County on Thursday, NextEra told utility regulators the storage site would have minimal adverse impacts on the area. Approximately two dozen people were in the audience. 
Michael Bettis, a fire safety engineer for NextEra, said the major potential safety threats when it comes to Battery Energy Storage Systems are called “thermal runaway events.”
Such events occur when a small portion of a battery unit fails and captures more heat than it can dissipate, Bettis said. Sometimes this occurs when water leaks into a unit; other times it’s caused by general internal system failure.
Thermal events can result in fire, but they begin by expelling hydrogen, carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide into the atmosphere, according to Bettis. Part of the safety response plan involves training local firefighters to let a fire burn within the storage site area because it consumes the hydrogen and the carbon compounds. 
Bettis said of NextEra’s 50 battery storage sites in the United States, there have been few thermal runaway events — none of which resulted in environmental contamination.
He also pointed to the project application, which outlines the constant on-site monitoring and procedures in place if a thermal event were to occur. NextEra later told the commission it’s been in contact with local first responders to establish a safety plan. 
The company also vowed to craft a plan for decommissioning the batteries and to provide associated financial insurance. 
North Dakota coal industry prepares to seize opportunity for growth

Public Service Commission Chair Randy Christmann previously raised concerns about the site using batteries made in “adversarial” countries, like China. But NextEra told commissioners Thursday the company has since decided to use lithium-ion batteries sourced in the United States. 
NextEra Environmental Specialist Dustin Wernicke said further impacts to the environment, such as air, water, soil and noise pollution, are minimal. He also said the company has consulted with some tribal representatives about possible discovery of cultural resources during construction.   
Around 150 construction and one to three permanent jobs would be tied to the project, the company estimates, and the county is estimated to reel in $7.2 million in property taxes over its 25-year lifespan. 
After more than three hours of discussion with NextEra, commissioners heard testimony from a handful of area residents who had varying opinions on the project. 
Sen. Jeff Magrum, R-Hazelton, asked the commission to hold off on issuing a permit until the Legislature has time to design guardrails and a specified tax structure for the new technology.  Magrum’s district is in Emmons county. 
He said the Legislature was “left out” of the process, and too much responsibility was placed on the county during the outset.  
Pete Silbernagel, a former state lawmaker who owns a cabin near the proposed site, disagreed with Magrum’s idea of bringing the Legislature into the approval process and said the benefits to securing the grid outweigh the potential safety risks.
“You’re all well aware of the growing, increasing demand of electricity in this nation,” he said. “I really appreciate the fact that North Dakota has an all-of-the-above approach. I think this project can significantly help provide the energy that we’re going to need in the future.” 
North Dakota Transmission Authority Director Claire Vigesaa told the Monitor he supports the new technology and its ability to stabilize the grid, a sentiment shared by other residents as well as the Dakota Resource Council, an environmental advocacy group. 
“If executed in a manner that does not infringe on the rights and safety of the local community while bringing meaningful benefits to that community, this and future projects should be a good addition to the regional grid,” Mike Graalum of the Dakota Resource Council said in a statement. 
Emmons County has already approved the permits necessary to start construction. The project now awaits approval from the Public Service Commission.
According to Director of Utilities for the Public Service Commission Victor Schock, the decision will likely come in the next month or two, depending on how long it takes the company to provide information requested by the commission.  
If approved, construction is slated to begin May 2026 and be completed by December that year. 
NextEra is proposing a similar battery storage project on the other side of the state, in Burke County. The hearing for that project is scheduled for 10 a.m. Dec. 19 at the Bowbells Memorial City Hall.

There was no coherent roadmap, no shared strategy, and certainly nothing resembling a statewide plan.","WHEN I LAID OUT my concerns in advance of last week’s annual hearings on cost trends held by the state Health Policy Commission, I suspected many across our health care ecosystem shared them. The hearings confirmed that. 
Speaker after speaker voiced anxiety about the same issues: the harmful impact of Trump administration policy changes combined with passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act; the growing affordability pressures facing families, employers, and state government; the likelihood of increases in both the uninsured and underinsured; the return of double-digit premium hikes; and the precarious financial position of many hospitals, community health centers, and nonprofit insurers. 
My hope then—and still—is that we not only sound the alarm on the dire state of things, but can begin to collectively chart a course of action that lays out a plan for what to do about it all. But anyone listening last week for a clear sense of direction would have been disappointed. While there was general consensus at the hearing that it can’t be business as usual, the ideas offered up for what to do about it were piecemeal. There was no coherent roadmap, no shared strategy, and certainly nothing resembling a statewide plan. 
The day opened with Attorney General Andrea Campbell, the lone elected official to speak. She noted the legal battles that her office is involved in with other state attorneys general, fighting against the Trump administration. She enumerated a series of conflicts: efforts to restrict immigrant rights, threats to universities’ federal research funding, actions designed to limit or eliminate access to gender-affirming care, and the battles to continue SNAP benefits during the shutdown. 
Her message was energetic, forceful, and morally clear. But like most presenters that day, despite expressing deep worry about health care affordability, she did not offer concrete solutions.  
What she did offer, though, in a positive note of encouragement about our collective strength and resilience, was an unexpected reference to Muhammad Ali—praising him as someone who consistently punched above his weight, just as Massachusetts has tried to do in health policy and other areas.  As an Ali enthusiast since childhood, that comment caught my attention. So let’s consider the rest of what unfolded at the hearing through the lens of some of The Greatest’s more memorable lines. 
“Float like a butterfly, sting like a bee.” 
This year marked the first time pharmaceutical companies and pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) were required to submit written testimony and for a select group to answer questions from Health Policy Commission members. A senior executive from Eli Lilly and a vice president from Optum took the hot seat. 
Pharma companies and PBMs often glide through policy discussions with a polished narrative. Pharma emphasizes innovation, miracle drugs, and breakthroughs. PBMs describe themselves as indispensable negotiators, creating savings for employers and consumers. Their public personas “float” lightly above the messy realities of pricing, profit margins, and opaque contracting. But history reminds us that these companies can sting hard. Whether through monopoly pricing, strategic patent games, or non-transparent rebates and fees that warp incentives, both industries have figured out how to extract tremendous profits from a system they claim to be helping. 
Consider Lilly. Their representative highlighted the company’s new oral GLP-1 weight loss drug, recently approved by the FDA, which will be priced around $150 per month—dramatically less than the current injectable versions costing thousands per month. He clearly hoped for praise. What he did not highlight was that this accelerated approval came after the company struck a deal with the Trump administration involving tariff relief and expedited FDA review for this drug — likely leading to a 2026 launch date.  
Optum’s witness spoke earnestly about negotiating lower prices for certain brand-name drugs, but carefully sidestepped questions about rebate transparency. She showed no interest in discussing how PBM practices contribute to inflated list prices designed to accommodate the rebates PBMs demand. Nor did she acknowledge the well-documented steering of patients to PBM-owned pharmacies, often at the expense of independent community pharmacies.  
“Don’t count the days, make the days count.” 
The day’s standout voice belonged to Michael Levine, director of the state’s Medicaid program, MassHealth. His presentation was a refreshing blend of candor and practicality. Levine described the central challenge ahead: navigating the implementation of new work requirements and administrative hurdles created by the sweeping bill passed this summer, dubbed by Trump the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. These changes threaten to push eligible residents off the Medicaid rolls not because they fail eligibility tests, but often because they cannot easily show that they are exempt from work requirements or meet other paperwork demands. 
Levine outlined two major strategies to prevent unnecessary loss of coverage. First, the state will maximize auto-renewals, drawing on an array of state data sources to verify eligibility without requiring beneficiaries to submit new paperwork. Second, the administration plans to again partner with Health Care For All, replicating their 2023 outreach initiative to help residents complete required documentation.  
His message was clear: The period between now and January 1, 2027—the date when new rules take full effect—must be used to protect as many eligible people as possible. Levine embodied Ali’s dictum about making each day matter. 
“He who is not courageous enough to take risks will accomplish nothing in life.” 
The final panel of the day surfaced the boldest ideas—though none yet sufficiently developed, let alone agreed upon. Still, the willingness to imagine some new affordability-promoting ideas was notable. 
Manny Lopes, CEO of Fallon Health, reminded the audience of the long-running success of the state’s program for frail, community-based elders who are dually eligible for Medicare and Medicaid. For roughly 25 years, this model—built on comprehensive care, integration of medical and social services, and a predictable per-member fee—has succeeded in improving health outcomes while reducing nursing home use. Lopes argued that a broader move toward such a system of total capitation could be an innovative path toward restraining spending growth and improving care coordination statewide. 
Doug Howgate of the Massachusetts Taxpayers Foundation floated a more budget-focused concept: creating a hard spending cap for Medicaid and then redesigning payment arrangements beneath that cap to cover as many people as possible. 
Kevin Tabb, CEO of Beth Israel Lahey Health, spoke about the need to “rationalize” care across the state—implying that Massachusetts may need to close low volume health facilities,  and less duplication of certain services.   He implied that there is no ‘free lunch’: if the state wants to reduce overall health care spending it will have consequences for the care delivery system and patient access. 
Blue Cross CEO Sarah Iselin pushed for making the state’s total per capita cost growth benchmark a firm, enforceable number for the total growth of health care spending—rather than only a guiding target.  Right now there is really only a weak performance improvement process (PIP)  that can be applied to a provider whose measured revenue growth per person is above the benchmark—currently at 3.6 percent. 
In recent years, there has been little fear of any meaningful consequence for exceeding the benchmark growth rate—something that Iselin wants to change. She called for a benchmark accountability process with “real teeth and consequences” — presumably one that could even demand that monies be clawed back from market participants whose per capita revenue growth is above the benchmark. She even raised the possibility of exploring global hospital budgets—a payment model used in Maryland—if Massachusetts wants to genuinely restrain hospital spending growth. 
“A man who views the world at 50 the same as he did at 20 has wasted 30 years of his life.” 
As the day closed, members of the commission each offered brief reflections. What united them was a recognition that the system cannot continue functioning under the assumptions of 2012, when the last major health care cost law was enacted. There was a shared sense of urgency that Massachusetts needs a more comprehensive, coherent approach to achieving better health care affordability—one capable of maintaining access while reining in costs. 
Ali could afford to wait out his opponents, leaning against the ropes, conserving energy, and striking when the moment was right. For Massachusetts health care, time is not our ally. 
The problems are accelerating faster than our solutions. The Legislature needs to recognize the urgency of the moment and that now is the time to come off the ropes and engage with purpose to stop the unchecked affordability challenges facing us all.

(Photo courtesy of Crossroads Rhode Island)The state’s housing leaders and homeless care providers are raising the alarm over a new Trump administration directive they say could put over 1,000 formerly unhoused Rhode Islanders back out on the street.
That estimate represents two-thirds of the 1,500 Rhode Islanders now living in what is known as permanent supportive housing — or housing units that provide a subsidized, stable residence for formerly homeless people, often those who have experienced mental illness or spent years on the streets. 
Permanent supportive housing is a cornerstone of the “Housing First” model, which prioritizes providing immediate housing without preconditions, such as sobriety or treatment programs, to stabilize lives of residents.
But on Nov. 13, the same day the federal government reopened, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced a policy change to redirect the majority of its $3.9 billion Continuum of Care funding from permanent supportive housing to transitional housing with work requirements. HUD’s new policy — it aligns with President Donald Trump’s July 24 Executive Order titled “Ending Crime and Disorder on America’s Streets” — also attacks diversity and inclusion efforts, support of transgender clients and use of “harm reduction” strategies that seek to reduce overdose deaths by helping people in active addiction use drugs more safely.
“Unfortunately, we had some warning this was the direction they were going in, but you try not to believe it until it’s real,” Crossroads Rhode Island CEO Michelle Wilcox said in an interview Thursday. “Now it’s real.”
Wilcox, who leads the state’s largest provider of housing and homeless services, fears that HUD’s changes could mean 14 residents would no longer live at the Harold Lewis House managed by Crossroads. Opened in 2006, the 14-unit building in West Warwick houses formerly homeless people ages 50 and up who have mental health issues or have been unhoused for years — with preference given to veterans.
“We’re serving high needs folks,” Wilcox said. “It’s a really great community for folks where they can have privacy and dignity.”
Wilcox will join other housing leaders outside the Harold Lewis House on Providence Street at 10:30 a.m. Friday to call more attention to the impact the cuts will have on the populations their organizations serve.
HUD has framed the policy change as a way to promote “self-sufficiency among vulnerable Americans.”
“Our philosophy for addressing the homelessness crisis will now define success not by dollars spent or housing units filled, but by how many people achieve long-term self-sufficiency and recovery,” HUD Secretary Scott Turner said in a Nov. 13 statement. “We are stopping the Biden-era slush fund that fueled the homelessness crisis, shut out faith-based providers simply because of their values, and incentivized never-ending government dependency.”
A HUD spokesperson did not immediately respond to request for comment Thursday.
Organizations that don’t rely on federal Continuum of Care grants could end up seeing fewer places to direct Rhode Island’s unhoused population if the state loses permanent housing options.
“The goal that we’ve all been working so hard together on across the state seems like it will come to an end,” said Nick Horton, co-executive director of OpenDoors, a Providence nonprofit that helps formerly incarcerated people, those struggling with addiction and other unhoused people. “This just seems like it’s destroying one of the only resources that we have to help people out of homelessness.”
A 30% cap on permanent housing spending
Rhode Island last year received over $9 million in HUD grants toward permanent supportive housing. HUD’s latest Notice of Funding Opportunity for continuum of care grants is open though Jan. 14, 2026.
Grant awards are expected to be made May 1, according to the funding notice issued Nov. 13. The funding notice limits how much Continuum of Care funding communities can spend on permanent housing to 30%. The National Alliance to End Homelessness has warned that cap will force communities and organizations to reallocate funds from permanent housing programs to less effective programs.
Based on that math, Wilcox said an estimated 1,020 of the roughly 1,500 Rhode Islanders in federally-funded permanent supportive housing could be out on the street. 
But Brenda Clement, director of housing policy research group HousingWorks RI, said she’s hopeful that drastic scenario can be avoided as the state’s own Continuum of Care board crafts its request for proposals for providers
“We’re hoping to be able to craft things so that we can continue to meet the requirements of the new restrictions,” Clement, who serves on the Continuum of Care’s Finance Committee, said. “The last outcome that anyone wants is to see more people on the street.”
Still, Clement said her preference is that the federal government stick to the “Housing First” model adopted in the 1990s.
“It helps people get into recovery, it helps people get into a better economic situation,” Clement said. “But for whatever reason, this administration does not share this philosophy.”

Ford",,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/top-ice-official-elaborates-plan-send-kilmar-abrego-garcia-liberia,,"GREENBELT, Md. — U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials detailed to a federal judge Thursday plans for the Trump administration to again remove the wrongly deported Kilmar Abrego Garcia, this time to the West African country of Liberia.U.S. District of Maryland Judge Paula Xinis is considering whether to lift her order that barred Abrego Garcia, a longtime Maryland resident, from being removed from the United States. The case and its months of wrangling in courts in two states has generated huge publicity, both in Maryland and nationally, and has brought attention to the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown.Separately, as the Trump administration tries to deport Abrego Garcia, the Justice Department is moving forward with criminal charges against him of human trafficking in Tennessee.Xinis specially requested the Trump administration provide John Cantú to testify because he is a top official at ICE’s Enforcement and Removal Operations and previously submitted a declaration to the court regarding the State Department’s deliberation with Costa Rica’s government about accepting Abrego Garcia as a refugee. Abrego Garcia, whose deportation due to an “administrative error” cast a spotlight on President Donald Trump’s aggressive immigration crackdown, is challenging his detention on the grounds that the Trump administration is using his imprisonment as punishment rather than for the purpose of removal. He is currently detained at an ICE facility in Pennsylvania.Abrego Garcia has agreed to be removed to Costa Rica, but the Trump administration last month argued before Xinis to allow him to be removed to Liberia. In August, Costa Rica’s government stated it would accept him as a refugee. As he challenges his removal to any country other than Costa Rica, Abrego Garcia has also pleaded not guilty to the criminal case in Nashville, which accuses him of the human trafficking of immigrants in an incident stemming from a 2022 traffic stop in Tennessee. Rally outsideSimilar to previous hearings at the Greenbelt courthouse, the immigrant advocacy group CASA led a rally in support of Abrego Garcia. The event included a singing group called the Rapid Response Choir.George Escobar, who will become CASA’s new executive director on Jan. 1, said it’s important for people to stand up against a “corrupt government” that seeks to take away immigrant rights, especially as the Trump administration tries to ship Abrego Garcia to various third countries.“We want to make sure that we stand here united. We want to make sure that Kilmar (and) his family understands that we are by his side,” Escobar said. “We will not let this go silently into the night.”

Maryland Del. Gabriel Acevero, a Montgomery County Democrat who’s from Trinidad and Tobago, and who has a family background in Venezuela, said his state colleagues will be working on legislation to improve immigrant rights, such as ending the 287(g) program in the state.Currently, about eight local enforcement agencies in the state have agreements with ICE that delegate certain immigration enforcement abilities to local police. But Acevero’s colleague, Del. Nicole Williams, a Prince George’s County Democrat, plans to reintroduce legislation to terminate all ICE agreements. Law enforcement agencies would have a year to do so.After the rally ended, CASA leaders handed out green postcards for participants to write down words of support for Abrego Garcia.Jacki Gilbert of Baltimore wrote on her postcard: “Dear Kilmar, We stand with you and your family. You are both a friend and a neighbor.”“This impacts my community. My culture in Baltimore City. My economy there. You got to stand with your friends and neighbors. Respect them,” Gilbert said as she choked up and shed a tear.

Abrego Garcia has deportation protections that should have prevented his deportation to his home country of El Salvador, but earlier this year he was still removed to a brutal Salvadoran prison. Because of those protections granted by an immigration judge in 2019, the Trump administration must find a third country that is willing to accept Abrego Garcia and a country where he believes he will not face harm or persecution. The Trump administration so far has floated sending him to Liberia as well as one of three other nations in Africa — Ghana, Eswatini and Uganda.Worries about return to El SalvadorAbrego Garcia’s lawyers have raised concerns that if he is sent to a third country, that country will then send him back to El Salvador. Cantú said that the government of Liberia has given the State Department assurance that Abrego Garcia will not face torture, persecution, and will not be sent back to El Salvador. The assurances from Costa Rica’s government accepting Abrego Garcia were “nonbinding,” Cantú said. The State Department informed him that Abrego Garcia’s removal to Costa Rica is “not an option at the moment,” he said.Cantú was pressed by one of Abrego Garcia’s attorney’s, Sascha Rand, about communications with the State Department and Costa Rica regarding Abrego Garcia.  Cantú said he had a five-minute virtual meeting with an attorney from the State Department, during which he was given a statement that Costa Rica was no longer an option for Abrego Garcia. But he could not give the judge any additional information on further communications between the State Department and Costa Rica’s government since August.“This witness has zero information about the content of the (Costa Rica) declaration,” Xinis said. “No shade on you, Mr. Cantú, you’ve been very candid with the court. The point has been made.”Rand pointed to how the assurance from Costa Rica granted Abrego Garcia refugee status and citizenship, and he asked if Liberia made those same assurances. Cantú said he did not recall. Rand asked Cantú if in his career at the Department of Homeland Security, which dates to 1997, if he has had any experience of removing someone from Latin America to Africa. Cantú said he has in the past six months under the Trump administration. Rand asked about any scenarios prior to that time.“I cannot recall,” Cantú said.Rand said that Abrego Garcia has “no objection to him being removed to Costa Rica.” He argued that the Trump administration, and its witness, have not proved that Abrego Garcia cannot be removed to Costa Rica. Order of removalAbrego Garcia’s attorneys also requested that DOJ provide the order of removal for Abrego Garcia. Cantú said he had not seen such a document.“If there is no order for removal, then there is no basis for detention,” said Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg, another attorney for Abrego Garcia, who specializes in immigration law. DOJ attorney Drew Ensign said he does “believe there is a final order of removal.”Xinis rejected that, because no document was provided to her and the document Ensign produced for her only mentioned that Abrego Garcia’s 2019 asylum claim was rejected.“I am just interested in finding the order of removal,” she said. Ensign argued that because Abrego Garcia has a withholding of removal, meaning he cannot be removed back to his home country of El Salvador, that should be treated as a final order of removal. Ensign added that it’s odd that Abrego Garcia would agree to be removed to Costa Rica if he didn’t believe there was a final order of removal.“No, it’s not,” Xinis said. “It’s a concession because he's been to CECOT and back.”While at the notorious mega-prison known as CECOT, Abrego Garcia detailed how he was psychologically and physically tortured by Salvadoran officials. Abrego Garcia tried to make another application for asylum, after he was brought back to the U.S. this summer, but an immigration judge denied it. He has appealed the decision.

The case before Xinis is a habeas petition, which is how immigrants challenge their detention.

Bob Wilson, a member of the Howell Township Board of Trustees, confirmed with Michigan Advance on Thursday that Meta was pushing the project. But Wilson said he and members of the board have known about the development for months now. 
Messages seeking comment from Meta’s public affairs and press office were not returned at the time of publication.
In September, Wilson took to Facebook, ironically, to say that he was one of several people in the Howell area who took a bus to New Albany, Ohio, to tour the community, which has become a hotspot for data centers, the Livingston Post reported. 
Meta has a data center in New Albany, Ohio.
Wilson said then that he believed a Meta data center could possibly land at the facility when completed with a $9 billion investment. It was his estimation that the center, if approved, would take up at least 20% of the 1,000-acre space with the remaining space for the data center.
On Wednesday, the Livingston County Planning Commission heard from locals about a decision to rezone the farm land to build the data center. The commission ultimately rejected the project and recommended that the Howell Township Board of Trustees reject the project, as well.
It’s unclear if the township board has the votes to push it forward. The board meets Thursday evening to discuss the project and is expecting a large crowd. Some have called for a six-month moratorium so the community can draft ordinances related to the project. That moratorium will be before the board this evening.
MLive also reported Thursday that Wilson confirmed Meta was behind the project. The publication also noted that the data center investment was likely $1 billion, as opposed to the $9 billion reported by the Livingston Post. Wilson further told MLive that he met with a Meta “land crew” both in person and over a Zoom call, and that they didn’t hide the ball that they worked for Meta.

In an interview with the Advance, that it was possible that the developer on the project would build the center and then sell it to a third-party, like Meta or others exploring AI, much like Google. He did say, however, that it was his understanding that Meta builds its own projects and doesn’t usually play the middle man.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/558199098_25184650887794802_5733019724495903299_n-1-1024x1024.jpg,,,2025-11-20 17:57:52.707512

President Donald Trump has taken his most decisive step yet toward dismantling the Department of Education, a move that will have widespread ramifications for vulnerable students and has raised concerns among education leaders and lawmakers who contend that it will create chaos and confusion for families instead of giving them the help they actually need.
His administration announced on Tuesday that it will transfer core agency functions to four other federal offices — news met with fierce criticism by education advocates who questioned its legality and said it is an abandonment of the nation’s students.
“Donald Trump and his administration chose American Education Week, a time when our nation is celebrating students, public schools, and educators, to announce their illegal plan to further abandon students by dismantling the Department of Education,” said National Education Association (NEA) President Becky Pringle in a statement. “It’s cruel. It’s shameful. And our students deserve so much better.”
The Trump administration will reassign the department’s key programs involving K-12 education, higher education, Indian education and international studies through so-called interagency agreements with the departments of Labor, Interior, Health and Human Services and State.
The reorganization marks one of the most significant overhauls to the department since its establishment during former President Jimmy Carter’s administration in 1979. Only Congress can create a federal agency and has the sole authority to approve its restructuring or elimination.
The move to restructure the agency, Trump officials argue, will lead to more efficiency by reducing administrative burdens and making it easier to pursue objectives like aligning education with workforce readiness.
Vulnerable students stand to be uniquely affected by the reorganization with the shift of K-12 programs to the Department of Labor raising major concerns about the wellbeing of economically disadvantaged students. The Labor Department will manage programs such as Title I, which provides additional resources to K-12 schools serving such students. Labor will also administer postsecondary education grant programs authorized under the Higher Education Act with the goal of ending an estimated labor shortage of over 700,000 skilled jobs nationally.
“Moving Title I, the largest federal funding stream providing important resources to the schools serving the lowest-income students in America, to the Department of Labor makes no sense,” said Denise Forte, president and CEO of The Education Trust, a nonprofit that advocates for equity in the nation’s schools.
“The Trump administration began the process of selling off the Department of Education for parts,” Forte said in a statement. “Further diminishing these offices… and sending them off to be run by agencies that work on public health and short-term training, which lack the skills, expertise, or capacity in education, isn’t about improving student outcomes. It’s about implementing a business model that transforms students into widgets instead of human beings who need support.”
Leaders of the nation’s two largest teacher unions, the NEA and the American Federation of Teachers (AFT), characterized the restructuring as a betrayal of students and families.
“This move is neither streamlining nor reform — it’s an abdication and abandonment of America’s future,” AFT President Randi Weingarten said in a statement. “Rather than show leadership in helping all students seize their potential, it walks away from that responsibility.”
Similarly, Weingarten pushed back against the idea that the restructuring was about efficiency.
“What’s happening now isn’t about slashing red tape,” she said. “If that were the goal, teachers could help them do it …Instead, spreading services across multiple departments will create more confusion, more mistakes and more barriers for people who are just trying to access the support they need.”
Other changes affect groups of students who have traditionally needed extra support: The Department of the Interior will be the primary administrator for Indian Education programs, functioning as the point of contact for tribes and students. The Department of Health and Human Services will manage a program for student-parents in college called Child Care Access Means Parents in School (CCAMPIS) and another related to foreign medical school accreditation standards. Finally, the Department of State will administer the Fulbright-Hays Program which awards grants to students, teachers, administrators and institutions.
It’s unclear how Native American students will fare with Indian Education programs moved to the Interior Department, an agency that manages natural resources and not the education of children. The future of the thousands of student-parents in college who rely on campus-based childcare grants is also uncertain, since moving the Child Care Access Means Parents in Schools program to the Health and Human Services Department could lead to disruptions in support for them that sidetrack their journey to a degree. Transferring responsibilities from the Department of Education to the Department of Labor undermines public education’s purpose, according to National Parents Union President Keri Rodrigues.
“At a time when the public demands transparency regarding the Epstein files, the Administration has instead launched a chaotic assault on education,” she said in a statement. “Families see this clearly: a political diversion, not a vision for better schools. Public education has never been about turning children into factory workers, it has always been about preparing creators, innovators, and dreamers who will shape the future of our nation.”
Democratic Sen. Patty Murray, who serves as vice chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee, questioned the constitutionality of the interagency agreements.
“Donald Trump and Linda McMahon are lawlessly trying to fulfill Project 2025’s goal to abolish the Department of Education and pull the rug out from students in every part of the country,” stated the Washington lawmaker, a former preschool teacher.
Democratic Rep. Summer Lee, who serves on the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform and the Committee on Education and Workforce, called the shakeup “a direct assault on the students, families, and educators who depend on its essential protections.”
In her statement, the Pennsylvania lawmaker emphasized that even the education secretary has acknowledged that only Congress has the authority to eliminate the department.
“Our children deserve better than political stunts that jeopardize their futures,” she said. “And let’s be clear: an uneducated electorate isn’t a by-product of authoritarianism — it’s a prerequisite for it. We will fight back.”
Critics of the department’s makeover also said they feared that its Office for Civil Rights (OCR) and Office of Special Education and Rehabilitative Services would be the next to be reassigned to other federal agencies. The Trump administration has diminished their power and effectiveness through staff cuts and — in the case of OCR in particular — regional office closures that have led to civil rights cases not being investigated.
“Transferring OCR’s authority to another department that is ill-equipped to carry out its critical functions would all but guarantee that civil rights complaints will continue to be dismissed en masse without resolution,” Forte said. Such a development would disproportionately affect students of color, students with disabilities and English learners.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-11-20 21:57:57+00:00,CT Mirror,Lamont taps Jeffrey Beckham to become Superior Court judge,Keith M. Phaneuf,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/11/20/lamont-taps-jeffrey-beckham-to-become-superior-court-judge/,"Gov. Ned Lamont announced he will nominate his departing budget director, Jeffrey Beckham of Tolland, to become a CT Superior Court judge.","Gov. Ned Lamont announced Thursday he will nominate his departing budget director, Jeffrey Beckham of Tolland, to become a Connecticut Superior Court judge.
Lamont, who praised Beckham for restoring confidence to the Office of Policy and Management following a corruption scandal, said his outgoing director also played a crucial role over the past three-and-a-half years in the state government’s fiscal resurgence.
The governor also predicted Beckham’s successor, Joshua Wojcik, a key health policy leader in the comptroller’s office, would continue that fiscal progress while helping Connecticut safeguard its most vulnerable residents as federal funding for human service programs shrinks.
“Jeff took over during a time of some change at OPM. I want to tell you what an extraordinary secretary he has been,” Lamont said during a midafternoon press conference at the Capitol.
“And by the way, in case you’re wondering,” Lamont added, “he looks like a judge to me. I’m just saying.” 
The General Assembly is expected to consider that nomination during the regular 2026 session, which begins Feb. 4.
Beckham, who holds a bachelor’s degree in political science and a law degree from Florida State University, would not be the first state budget director elevated to a judgeship.
Norwalk Republican Robert Genuario, a former state senator, served as Rell’s budget director from 2005 through 2010 until she appointed him to the Connecticut Superior Court.
Beckham become OPM secretary in March 2022 following the resignation of Melissa McCaw, Lamont’s first budget chief, who left to become East Hartford’s financial director, Meanwhile, her deputy, Konstantinos Diamantis, had become embroiled in a scandal involving state construction funds that ultimately led a federal jury last month to convict him on 21 counts of bribery, extortion, conspiracy and lying to federal investigators.
He earned praise not just from Lamont for his handling of OPM, the state’s chief fiscal and policy planning agency, in the wake of that scandal.
“He restored confidence and became a measured, principled voice on fiscal matters within the governor’s administration,” House Minority Leader Vincent J. Candelora, R-North Branford, and Rep. Tammy Nuccio of Tolland, ranking House Republican on the Appropriations Committee, wrote in a joint statement.
Beckham, who had been OPM’s liaison to the General Assembly prior to becoming Lamont’s budget director — and who has more than three decades of experience in state agencies across all three branches of government — credited his relationships with helping to stabilize the budget office.
“I knew most of the team. I’d come up with a lot of them,” he said, adding his familiarity with the General Assembly also played an important role. “I know its culture very well. I think I was pretty well positioned. I think we were fortuitous in that. And so, I think I was a reassuring presence for the staff.”
Lamont also praised Beckham, a fiscal conservative, for his dedication to the budget caps that helped Connecticut to replace a nearly depleted rainy day fund with a record-setting $4.3 billion reserve in just eight years, and to simultaneously dedicate about $10 billion in surpluses to shrink pension debt.
“I want to thank you from the bottom of my heart,” Lamont said. “You’ve been standing there every day protecting an honestly balanced budget. No more of this buy-now-pay-later stuff.”
Lamont also showed confidence in Wojcik, 43 who will succeed Beckham next month.
A veteran of the comptroller’s office, Wojcik has managed the Health Policy and Benefits Services Division since 2022, overseeing a $2 billion program budget and benefits for more than 270,000 public sector workers, retirees, dependents and other individuals.

Wojcik, who lives in Brooklyn, also served as a budget and policy analyst for the state Senate’s Democratic Caucus before his time in the comptroller’s office.
Lamont noted that his new budget director, like his outgoing one, was very familiar with the challenges Connecticut faced during the last recession, from late 2007 to early 2010 — a crisis that triggered many of the budget deficits and tax hikes of the 2010s.
“You know, in ’08, ‘09, when we lost billions of dollars in just a matter of a few months,” Lamont said to Wojcik. “You understand how important it is that not only we have an honestly balanced budget but also that we have a rainy day fund that protects our people, protects our communities.”
Sean Scanlon, Connecticut’s comptroller since 2022, called Wojcik “one of the smartest public policy minds that I’ve ever met. He has been an invaluable advisor to me and to my predecessors in the comptroller’s office. The work he has done as a leader in our agency and state include designing transformational health care policy that saves lives and saves taxpayer money and budgetary policy that led to Connecticut’s fiscal comeback. So, while I am certainly sad to see him leave our team, Gov. Lamont has made an excellent choice.”
Wojcik said he is committed to helping Lamont continue the financial success that state government has enjoyed under his administration. One of the new budget director’s toughest challenges involves negotiating with a Democratic-controlled General Assembly that tends to be more fiscally liberal than the Democratic governor.
“I’ve worked with many of them on many significant issues, particularly surrounding health care, in recent years,” Wojcik said, “and I absolutely want to be a thought-partner with the governor and [help in] trying to identify opportunities where we have general agreement.”
Wojcik, who holds a bachelor’s degree in international relations and a master’s of public administration from the University of Connecticut, added that when it comes to working with lawmakers, “We’re not always going to agree, of course, but you know, having that good and positive relationship that OPM has historically had, I plan to continue that.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_2385-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-11-20 17:57:52.707512

Those vehicles — part of a 252-car replacement fleet — are running years behind schedule.","THE MBTA’S long-running effort to replace its Red and Orange Line fleets faced renewed schedule pressures this fall, with transit officials highlighting a recent shift toward more consistent Red Line production as the Orange Line order nears its finish line.
Shipments of Chinese-manufactured train shells have slowed in recent months — in part because of ongoing federal forced-labor reviews — contributing to delays that pushed the builder past a September delivery deadline for the Orange Line.
Although the federal reviews have introduced uncertainty into the supply chain, MBTA leaders said the broader fleet-replacement program continues to move forward, supported by a production strategy that now places greater emphasis on keeping Red Line deliveries on track.
The manufacturer of new MBTA Red and Orange Line fleets missed the September deadline to complete all 152 Orange Line cars, after US Customs officials detained multiple shipments of train shells and components under a federal forced-labor law. Transit officials say the builder, China Railway Rolling Stock Corporation MA (CRRC), remains on pace to finish the Orange Line order by year’s end.
The MBTA expects to receive another pair of Orange Line cars on Thursday, bringing the total to 150. The final two cars are scheduled to arrive next month, closing out the 152-car order required under the contract. 
The new Orange Line fleet, which began entering service in September 2022, has been large enough to support reliable operations, officials said, allowing the T earlier this year to direct CRRC to prioritize Red Line production instead.
So far, the T has received 58 new Red Line cars, with two more expected in December. Those vehicles — part of a 252-car replacement fleet — are running years behind schedule. 
The project originated under Gov. Deval Patrick’s administration in 2014, has been buffeted by repeated manufacturing setbacks, and underwent a major contract “reset” last year that waived some penalties, lifted the contract’s value above $1 billion and set a new completion deadline of late 2027.
A new wrinkle emerged in May, when US Customs and Border Protection began holding newly shipped car shells in American ports as authorities review whether CRRC’s supply chain complies with the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act. The 2021 law bars imports linked to forced labor in China’s Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region and places a high burden of proof on importers to document that their goods were made with an ethical supply chain.
CRRC ships partially assembled shells from China to the US, where final assembly is performed at its Springfield facility by a workforce of more than 400. Components from 32 states feed into US assembly, according to General Manager Phil Eng.
US Customs’ review has required multiple rounds of documentation from CRRC. In July, Eng said the company was “in the midst of answering the last round of questions,” adding he was “very confident” the parties would navigate the review.
CRRC spokesperson Lydia Rivera told WBUR the company has maintained “rigorous compliance reviews” and that “no entity involved in these shipments is linked to any violation” of the law.
Erik Olson, executive director of the Rail Security Alliance, encouraged the federal reviews, saying, “We are grateful for US Custom’s attention to CRRC train shells and components and the materials within the full supply chain, ‘requiring full traceability of certain raw materials—down to the level of ore extraction and smelting.'”
Despite the detainments, both CRRC and the MBTA say the Springfield line continues to operate. 
Eng said this summer that enough shells were in Massachusetts to “keep the workforce working through the end of the year.” 
MBTA spokesperson Joe Pesaturo said this month the agency “continues to work closely with CRRC MA to keep the production line moving at the Springfield plant” and “ensure that each shipment of car shells is accompanied by the necessary documentation required by US Customs officials.”
The MBTA’s October bondholder statement acknowledged the detainments and said CRRC is “working to rectify the situation.” 
The document reiterates that the full vehicle program includes 404 heavy-rail cars — 152 for the Orange Line and 252 for the Red Line — each equipped with wider doors, ADA-dedicated spaces, LCD passenger information systems, LED lighting, redundant train-control and HVAC systems and upgraded monitoring and communication technology. The vehicle investments accompany systemwide upgrades to maintenance facilities, track and signaling.
The T is approaching the long-sought milestone of completing the Orange Line replacement, more than a decade after state officials first awarded the contract. But the beleaguered Red Line program, still not half delivered, remains vulnerable to external shocks from the federal inquiry.
For now, the last two Orange Line cars are slated for December delivery, and the Red Line has a two-car delivery schedule for next month as well, as its multi-year push toward full fleet replacement continues.",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Transportation_MBTA_Red-Line_Ashmont-edited-1.png?fit=1024%2C767&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-11-20 16:57:24.917358

RJ May, who pleaded guilty in September to sending videos of children being sexually abused, faces new charges of failing to pay his income taxes.
The 39-year-old West Columbia Republican owes the state $14,637 for three years of income taxes he failed to file, according to arrest warrants the South Carolina Department of Revenue served May with Thursday. May remains in the Edgefield County Detention Center, awaiting sentencing on the federal child sexual abuse material charges.
May could face up to one year in state prison, a $10,000 fine or both for each of the three tax charges if convicted. That’s on top of the 25 to 100 years he could collectively face for all five charges of sending videos of children being sexually abused. Those five charges to which May pleaded guilty could also carry hefty penalties of up to $250,000 each.
May, a founding member of the ultra-conservative Freedom Caucus, owned and operated Ivory Tusk Consulting, which ran campaigns for likeminded candidates. From 2022 to 2024, May earned $323,000, according to a news release. He was first elected to the House in November 2020.
Ex-Rep. RJ May failed to pay income taxes for years, SC House Ethics investigation finds

A House Ethics Committee investigation first turned up questions about May’s tax filings. The committee began its investigation in July, several weeks after police arrested May on the sexual abuse charges.
An investigation is usually the first step in expelling a House member, but May resigned his House seat in August, while the committee’s hired lawyers were still looking into his conduct. In requesting the ethics investigation, House Majority Leader Davey Hiott, R-Pickens, asked for a closer look into May’s financials, prompting a search of his state income tax filings.
That search came up empty, lawyers said last month when presenting their findings to the committee. The committee referred any potential criminal charges to the appropriate state agency, without clarifying the agencies involved.
Whether May filed federal income taxes remains unclear. Investigators did not attempt to get those records because the federal government did not have the same obligation to participate in a state-level investigation, committee attorneys said.
Also unclear is how much money May had when a judge assigned him a federal public defender. At the time, he claimed he had no assets but his truck, and in messages from jail, he weighed selling the truck to fund his defense.
May claimed from his jail cell that clients owed him thousands of dollars he could have used to hire a lawyer to defend him in federal court. The ethics committee’s lawyers questioned whether he disclosed this to the federal judge.
May ultimately fired his attorneys and opted to represent himself. He rehired his defense team for his sentencing trial, which is scheduled to take place Jan. 14.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/RJ-May-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-11-20 16:57:24.917358

“The Torchbearer Awards recognize Hoosier women for their exceptional achievements in their community, our state, and our nation,” he said in a statement. “These Hoosier women are outstanding leaders in their fields. Today I was proud to recognize each of them for their trailblazing accomplishments and the examples they’ve set for future generations.”
This year, four women were named Torchbearers and one woman was honored with a lifetime achievement award.
Betsy Wiley received the lifetime achievement award for her public service to Indiana’s students in many areas, including school choice. She has worked to support parents’ rights to lead their own children’s education, and advocated to improve schools and outcomes for all Hoosier children, the governor’s news release said.
Monica Kelsey was named a Torchbearer for her efforts to save babies’ lives through Safe Haven Baby Boxes. Braun’s office said her work has made Indiana the national leader in preventing child abandonment.
Grace Estabrook was a member of the swimming and diving team for Penn State, and she spoke against transgender women competing in women’s sports. The news release said her voice on the issue was an important part of the national conversation and yielded significant policy changes to support fairness.
Kristian Stricklen became President of the Madame Walker Legacy Center in 2021. She was honored for her leadership of the Walker Center into a new era of financial sustainability and cultural impact.
Erin Houchin serves Hoosiers in Congress as the representative for Indiana’s 9th district. She was honored for her leadership for Hoosiers on the national stage. Representative Houchin was elected to House Republican leadership in 2024, serving as the House Republican Conference Secretary for the 119th Congress, making her the second-highest-ranking woman in the Republican House majority.
Braun presented the awards on behalf of the Indiana Commission for Women, which created the Torchbearer Awards in 2004 to celebrate extraordinary contributions made by Hoosier women.

(Photo by Mitch Perry/Florida Phoenix)TAMPA — Saying Floridians need property tax relief now, former Florida House Speaker and 2026 Republican gubernatorial candidate Paul Renner is calling for the Legislature to reduce the ad valorem taxes levied by local governments immediately by rolling them back to the previous year’s levels, plus a reduction based on how much the county’s spending had increased since 2020.
The Legislature should cap future taxes to ensure local government cannot grow faster than Floridians’ incomes, he added, and require a 2/3 supermajority vote of local government for any new or increased tax or fee subject to a subsequent referendum, for voters to approve or reject.
“We don’t have to wait two years for an amendment to go on the ballot in November 2026,” he said while addressing reporters in Tampa on Thursday. “We can give people relief right this minute and that’s what I’m calling for today in the form of a rollback.”
Renner said his proposal isn’t complicated and that it’s simply reproducing what happened during a 2007 special legislative session. That’s when then Gov. Charlie Crist and House Speaker Marco Rubio agreed to reduce ad valorem taxes collected by local governments in FY 2007-08 to a specified percentage of the rolled back rate for 2006‐07.
Renner’s comments came while a select House committee in Tallahassee debated several proposed constitutional amendments to substantially reduce or outright eliminate property taxes for homestead properties that would potentially go on the November 2026 ballot. The idea has been aggressively pursued by Gov. Ron DeSantis as he heads into his final year leading Florida.
Renner said that the percentage of what would be returned to taxpayers in his proposal would depend on how much that local government has spent.
“If your county has been fiscally conservative and they’ve given some of that money back to taxpayers — as they should — then they have a smaller rollback,” he said. “If your county is one that has taken every single penny — and this has happened in many counties — you have a larger rollback. That’s up to the Legislature to look at the numbers and make a decision on what that rollback amount would look like.”
Gov. DeSantis has dismissed the multiple proposed measures that members of the Florida House debated Thursday, saying only a single constitutional amendment should go on the ballot. Renner said he mostly agreed with that idea.
“I think you need one plan that’s straightforward,” he said. “That people can look at and say, ‘Does this make my life better?'”
The 58-year-old Renner, a military veteran and former state prosecutor, concluded a nine-year stint in the House in 2024, spending the last two years as speaker. He entered the GOP contest for governor in early September, joining southwest U.S. Rep. Byron Donalds in the contest to succeed a term-limited DeSantis next year.
Although there have been rumors of other candidates entering the race, Donalds and Renner remain the top contenders going into next August’s GOP primary. “I think I am the viable alternative,” he said when asked if he considered himself the top challenger to Donalds, who has the imprimatur of Donald Trump as well as $30 million raised in his campaign coffers.
“We’re the undisputed leader as well on having a plan,” Renner added, referring to the affordability plan he released last week that includes specific proposals to reduce insurance costs, ensure that tuition isn’t increased in Florida universities, and boost healthcare (he is calling on Congress to repeal the Affordable Care Act and return control to the states as well as promoting “high-quality healthcare options that put patients in control”). He also wants to end H-IB visa hires for state employees.
Renner spoke about what he deemed the legislative successes that he worked on with DeSantis and the Legislature during his term as speaker, which included his sponsorship of an expansive and controversial voucher law to provide public money for children to attend parochial, secular, and other private schools across the state, regardless of family income. That program has now expanded to 500,000 students statewide.
A recently released audit for the 2024-2025 school year found a “myriad of accountability challenges” with the school choice program, with millions of dollars in overspending as well as lack of oversight and delays in scholarship payments.
“I think you don’t want to throw the baby out with the bathwater,” Renner responded. “This is a great program, but if out of that half-a-million there are 50 or 500 that are not complying in the right way, kick them off the program. That’s enforcement. Don’t use any problems along the way to eliminate the program or redo the program.”
Despite the fact that he considers himself the main challenger to Donalds in the Republican primary, Renner says his campaign is centered on the needs of the electorate.
“I’m not running a campaign against him, I’m running a campaign for the people of Florida,” he said. “I’m putting Florida first. I have leadership that the other candidates frankly don’t have. I’ve delivered results. And again, I’m focused on people’s needs. It’s a ‘we’ campaign, it’s not a ‘me’ campaign.”

A focus of the Republican citrus farmer from Wauchula, a similar version of the bill was a casualty of late-session negotiations last year. Approaching the second and final session of his presidency, Albritton is gearing up to push his priority. 
“As we prepare to embark on a nationwide celebration of America’s 250th Anniversary, there is no better time to celebrate and renew our focus on heritage farming communities across our state and nation. The hard work and patriotism of small family farm communities not only helped win our independence but also created and maintained a robust agricultural supply chain vital to our national security,” Albritton said in a news release.
Last year, SB 110, the previous Rural Renaissance bill, passed the Senate unanimously but the House declined to pass the Senate version, killing the bill. 
“We’ve seen tremendous economic growth in urban Florida over the years, and it’s rural Florida’s turn now to grow the way we see fit,” Albritton said in a video message to a Rural Health Association event in Lake City.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture is working with Albritton to make his proposal a national model





Additionally, some of the health care proposals included in the 2024 proposed Rural Renaissance were included in the Agency for Health Care Administration’s Nov. 3 application for $200 million in federal rural health funding.
Last year, Albritton said the bill would not impose a mandate for rural areas but instead a “buffet” of opportunities for communities to “be able to grow the way they want to” and that it’s meant to be a “hand up, not a handout,” calling it “quintessential” in what government is meant to do.





Sen. Corey Simon, a Republican from Tallahassee who represents 12 rural counties, again is sponsoring the bill. 
“Quality of life in rural areas can be impacted by access to job opportunities, education, and health care. Rural Renaissance combines enhancements to the traditional infrastructure for schools and hospitals with innovations that drastically expand opportunities for education, commerce, and health care in rural Florida,” Simon said.

The bill would increase the threshold for what a “fiscally constrained county” is from $5 million in property tax revenue per 1 mil to $10 million per 1 mil.
Fiscally constrained status is used in statute to qualify certain counties for extra support. 
The bill, like last year’s, would create the Office of Rural Prosperity within the Department of Commerce. The office would facilitate planning and connect local governments to state and federal resources. 
SB 250 would include a $1 million block grant for counties with declining populations. The grants would target population growth and be available annually until a county achieves three consecutive years of growth. 
Rural teachers would be eligible for a student loan repayment program worth $15,000 per individual over five years. 
Hospitals would be able to receive funding for mobile units for primary care, behavioral health, obstetric, and gynecological services. The bill would increase from $10 million to $35 million the Rural Hospital Grant Program.

Ben Ray Luján (D-NM) speaks at a news conference Nov. 20, 2025 in Washington DC to announce a Democratic effort to repeal SNAP cuts in the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act.” (Screenshot from news conference) U.S. Sen Ben Ray Luján of New Mexico led fellow senators Thursday in a denunciation of recent federal cuts to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program before introducing a bill that would repeal all SNAP-related changes in the recently enacted “One Big Beautiful Bill Act.”
The bill President Donald Trump signed July 4 cuts $187 billion from SNAP over the next decade, including $68 billion by 2029, according to Congressional Budget Office estimates. It does so primarily by imposing additional work requirements on SNAP recipients and additional costs on states. 
Luján, a Democrat who leads a Senate subcommittee on nutrition and represents the state with the highest nationwide percentage of SNAP recipients, called the cuts cruel and unprecedented. 
“For half a century, our nation has upheld a bipartisan promise to ensure that no child, no senior, no veteran, no working family should go hungry in the United States of America,” he said. “Republicans broke that promise, and today, congressional Democrats are fighting to restore this program.”
The Food Depot’s busiest New Mexico distribution just got busier

The two-page bill Luján introduced, which 46 other senators co-sponsored, seeks simply to repeal all the provisions in the Republican bill imposing the SNAP cuts. It’s called the “Restoring Food Security for American Families and Farmers Act of 2025.”
He and other Democrats who spoke at a news conference Thursday in Washington D.C. pointed to the Trump administration’s efforts to withhold November SNAP benefits during the government shutdown, despite court rulings and a contingency plan the federal Agriculture Department had in place to keep benefits flowing during a shutdown. 
Withholding the benefits caused upheaval in the food assistance program, which 42 million Americans rely on, including about 460,000 New Mexicans. Food banks in New Mexico saw sharp increases in demand, and the Legislature stepped in to approve nearly $200 million in state funds to pay for benefits throughout January.
Now that the government has reopened, New Mexico’s Legislative Finance Committee director on Monday told state lawmakers the state was receiving all its expected federal SNAP funding. But the cuts are still in effect under the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” provisions, Luján noted, which he and Democrats are hoping to stop.
“These are people across the country who you probably stand in line with when you’re checking out at a grocery store every day. Folks right now, they face the real possibility of going hungry because of the choices made by President Trump and congressional Republicans,” he said.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screen-Shot-2025-11-20-at-1.33.12-PM.png,,,2025-11-20 16:57:24.917358

(Photo by Emma Murphy/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — A board governing the Mental Health Department on Thursday agreed to purchase properties in southwest Oklahoma City to replace the Griffin Memorial Hospital in Norman. 
The cost of purchasing and renovating the three properties totals about $60 million in American Rescue Plan Act funds that the Oklahoma Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services are required to spend by the end of 2026, an agency spokesperson said. 
When renovations are completed, the new inpatient mental health hospital complex has a potential capacity of 197 beds, a spokesperson said, which is an increase from the 120 beds at Griffin Memorial. 
The largest of the purchases is a former Sisters of Saint Mary Health hospital campus at 2129 SW 59th St., which includes a main complex, annex and warehouse, totalling over 190,000 square feet. 
A second building, at 5835 S. Pennsylvania Ave., is a vacant medical office. The agency intends to use this building as an office site for the project manager.
Chad Carden, the agency’s chief of operations, said this keeps funding within the project and allows the Mental Health Department to keep the money invested in property rather than renting temporary job site trailers. 
The third property is 1.6 acres of vacant land at 2149 SW 59th St., which Carden said is ready to build on and has the potential to be a future site at the new hospital campus. 
During the first phase of construction, the agency will prioritize opening 32 beds in an annex building by the end of 2025. 
A timeline was not yet determined for the full project to be completed. 
The Mental Health Department’s goal is to relocate all services offered at Griffin Memorial to the new campus. The hospital serves adults with severe mental illness. 
A previous effort to build the Donahue Behavioral Health Campus in Oklahoma City became too expensive and went over budget. 
Interim Commissioner Gregory Slavonic said the Donahue project would have cost $187 million to complete, and this new campus will save taxpayer dollars. 
While the Mental Health Department’s governing board approved the purchases, the transaction is still being finalized.

(Map made by Jay Waagmeester/Florida Phoenix via DataWrapper)Hundreds of millions in federal funding will be pumped into Florida’s rural health care delivery system in the coming months, a top health care official in Gov. Ron DeSantis’s administration promised Thursday during a recognition of National Rural Health Day.
Agency for Health Care Administration Secretary Shevaun Harris said the state intends to make rural health care grant applications available in January or February, after it hears back from the Trump administration on its Nov. 3 request for $200 million in Rural Health Transformation Program funds. Harris said the federal government is supposed to notify the state by Dec. 31.
“Our hope is to get, again, maximum funding,” said Harris, appearing during an event in Lake City hosted by the Florida Rural Health Association, the Suwannee River Area Health Education Center, the WellFlorida Council, and Florida Voices for Health. 
“We’ll have to get budget authority through the Legislature to be able to tap into any funding that we’re awarded, but we’ll put out those requests for applications,” she added.
The funds are available under the One Big Beautiful Bill. Harris said the state’s application includes funding opportunities for 15 policy initiatives that address three broad areas: workforce; technology and innovation; and improving health and health access.

While she welcomed the funding opportunities, Doctors’ Memorial Hospital CEO Lauren Faison-Clark asked Harris whether the state intends to keep the money in the hands of the rural providers or award statewide grants to large outside companies.
“Many of us in the trenches are nervous sometimes when these well-intended monies come out that big vendors nationwide, vendors will come in and try to get a statewide contract for things where really what we want to do is grow the infrastructure that already exists in rural communities,” said Faison-Clark, whose hospital in Taylor County was hit by thee hurricanes between the 2023 and 2024 Atlantic hurricane seasons.
She added: “Will there be a focus on local solutions?” 
Harris acknowledged AHCA could award statewide contracts but “that’s not our preference.”
“That’s like a plan C or D,” she said adding, “So, when we’re reviewing applications that come in through the RFA [request for application] process, we’re really going to be spending a lot of time on the sustainability option.”
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
AHCA worked with the Florida Department of Health on the application and also solicited input from stakeholders, including issuing a formal request for information. Harris said the agency met with “many of the associations.”
The agency also looked to the Florida Legislature for insight.
Harris acknowledged that the state’s application includes ideas borrowed from the rural renaissance legislation that did not pass earlier this year. Senate President Ben Albritton championed the  effort to invest hundreds of millions in state funds to help bolster spending in rural Florida. (The Senate announced Thursday the legislation has been refiled for the 2026 session.)
Sen. Ben Albritton via Florida Senate
“We did look at the key healthcare components of it and, wherever possible, tried to pull forward those pieces,” she said.
To that end, AHCA’s application includes a $5 million request to provide start-up funding for physicians and “physician extenders” to establish practices in rural areas and commit to staying there for five years.
There’s an $18 million request to expand the use of EMS providers in rural areas. 
Harris called it a “community paramedicine” approach and said the goal is to increase use of EMS providers to help reduce hospital readmission rates and to avoid unnecessary emergency department visits. The idea is to pair EMS providers with nurses who could check in on patients who have been discharged from the hospital.
“So, that would get a collaboration with the hospital system and local paramedics to ensure that we’re able to have the impact there,” she said.
There are  67 counties in Florida. Thirty one of them are considered “rural” under Florida law. The 2020 Census put Florida’s rural population at 1,183,017 people.
Harris wasn’t the only Florida official  acknowledging National Rural Health Day. DeSantis issued a proclamation extending “greetings and best wishes to all observing” the day.
In Tallahassee for committee meetings, Senate President Albritton sent a pre-recorded video message in which he reaffirmed his commitment to investing in rural Florida.
“We’ve seen tremendous economic growth in urban Florida over the years, and it’s rural Florida’s turn now to grow the way we see fit. That’s why, during my last year as Senate president, I’m laser focused on Florida’s Rural Renaissance, a comprehensive plan to improve infrastructure and expand access to education and, yes, healthcare across rural Florida,” he said.

This story by Lukas Dunford was first published in the Valley News on Nov. 19, 2025.
MONTPELIER — Roslyn Fortin, a fifth-grader from Highgate Elementary, has been named Vermont’s first Kid Governor. More than 1,000 fifth graders across 47 Vermont schools voted this month to elect Roslyn from among the seven finalists, two of which were from the Upper Valley.
Each candidate developed a platform around a single issue, creating three-point plans to address their issues with help from the Secretary of State’s Office.
Roslyn focused on addressing homelessness.
The other six fifth-graders who were on the ballot will serve on the Kid Governor’s cabinet, helping Roslyn address homelessness, according to a Wednesday release from the Secretary of State’s Office.
They also will support each other in advancing their own platforms, which ranged from health care to anti-bullying.
The two Upper Valley fifth-graders on the final ballot, Gaelen McNaughton, 10, representing the Weathersfield School, and Westyn Danforth, 11, of Bradford Elementary School, are now on the cabinet that will have monthly meetings with the Secretary of State’s Office.


In January, the Kid Governor and her cabinet will take their oaths of office during a ceremony at the State House in Montpelier.
In a race that included no Upper Valley candidates, New Hampshire fifth graders elected Liv Crete-Sayer of Boscawen Elementary School to be their state’s Kid Governor. Liv’s platform focused on the dangers of smoking, vaping and drug use, according to a Wednesday news release from New Hampshire Civics, a Concord-based nonprofit that leads the state’s Kid Governor program.
The Kid Governor program, free to participating schools, was created by the nonprofit Connecticut Democracy Center in 2015 to teach kids about state government and civic engagement.

“Our laws are clear. You can refuse illegal orders,” U.S. Sen. Mark Kelly, an Arizona Democrat, said in the video.
The video is titled, “Don’t give up the ship,” a military motto that dates to the War of 1812.
Trump accuses 6 Democratic lawmakers of ‘seditious behavior, punishable by death’

A spokesperson for Crow said his office has seen an uptick in threats following the video and Trump’s posts. 
“It’s very telling that President Trump and those around him think it’s criminal simply for asking people to follow the law,” Crow said in his own video released Thursday. “This moment requires moral clarity. Every American, regardless of your background, should unite and reject his calls for political violence.”
Democrats in the video include Crow, Kelly, U.S. Sen. Elissa Slotkin of Michigan, U.S. Rep. Chris DeLuzio of Pennsylvania, U.S. Rep. Maggie Goodlander of New Hampshire, and U.S. Rep. Chrissy Houlahan of Pennsylvania. 
“Our servicemembers should know that we have their backs as they fulfill their oath to the Constitution and obligation to follow only lawful orders. It is not only the right thing to do, but also our duty,” the group said in a joint statement. “But this isn’t about any one of us. This isn’t about politics. This is about who we are as Americans. Every American must unite and condemn the President’s calls for our murder and political violence.”
In an interview with Fox News, Crow said Trump “has made a series of very disturbing comments and suggestions that would violate U.S. law and put our military in terrible positions.” He said the “Don’t give up the ship” video serves as a reminder to troops of their obligation to decline unlawful orders before they happen, “because then it’ll be too late.” That includes sending troops to U.S. cities “to go to war with those cities” and polling stations. He referred to “illegal military strikes” in a post on X. 
A Bronze Star recipient who achieved the rank of captain, Crow served in Iraq and Afghanistan.
Colorado Democratic Party Chair Shad Murib said Trump’s threats to members of Congress are “dangerous, unhinged and unworthy of the office of the President of the United States.” 
“We commend Congressman Crow for continuing to show unimpeachable and honorable courage, integrity and leadership in the face of such radical behavior from the president,” Murib said in a statement. “As a veteran and a public servant, he knows more than most the meaning of pledging an oath of duty to their country — certainly more than a five-time draft dodger that our president is.”

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch)Republican and Democratic legislators agreed Thursday that water quality is a pressing issue in the state along with property taxes and public health – all of which will be necessary to balance as the Legislature returns in January. 
Water quality, cancer and conservation efforts in Iowa were a key topic on day two of the Iowa Nature Summit at Drake University as a panel of Iowa lawmakers discussed potential 2026 policies. 
Sen. Sarah Trone Garriott, D-West Des Moines, said water quality, especially after a lawn watering ban was issued in central Iowa over the summer due to elevated nitrate levels in the Des Moines and Raccoon rivers, is an issue she now hears about all the time. 
“There’s more folks who are paying attention,” she said. “For the people who have been doing this for a very long time, it’s an opportunity to engage those new people and those new voices in advocacy, because we can’t address big challenges unless we’re working together across broad coalitions of folks.”

Funding the trust 
The Natural Resources and Outdoor Recreation Trust Fund was established in the state constitution in 2010, with more than 60% approval from Iowa voters, to fund parks, trails, water resources, conservation efforts and natural areas in the state. 
Despite its 15 years on the books, the trust has not accumulated any funds, because the Legislature has not levied the necessary increase on sales taxes, of which the fund would receive three-eighths of a percent. 
Nature and environmental groups have urged the Legislature to fund the trust in past years. 
Rep. David Jacoby, D-Coralville, said it “may happen” in 2026.
“I think it’s time we initiate,” Jacoby said. “… but we have to be mindful that that three-eighths was supposed to supplement what we’re doing, not replace what we’re doing.” 
Trone Garriott said constituents have asked lawmakers to do something about water quality issues in the state and funding the trust is the “number one opportunity.” 
At the same time, however, Trone Garriott said property taxes will be the “biggest issue” at the Statehouse this year. 
“Within our municipalities, our counties, there are water quality efforts that happen, and those are funded through property tax revenues,” Trone Garriott said. “Any changes to our property tax structure needs to keep in mind that there’s some really important efforts that are happening on a more local level that could be damaged if we make restrictive changes.” 
She said many local municipalities and counties are also facing the end of life of their wastewater treatment plants. There are expensive infrastructure projects that can lead to increased contaminants, like E.coli, in waterways if they fail. 
Some of these issues, such as funding the trust and creating funding for the water quality monitoring networks, can be done at the state level, but Trone Garriott said water quality work is also going to take federal-level funding via an updated Farm Bill. 
Rep. Devon Wood, R-New Market, the newly appointed chair of the House Natural Resources Committee, said it will take “overwhelming feedback” from constituents in favor of the tax in order for it to pass. 
“They’re already crying out, saying that we are hurting on tax situations in other ways, even with recent tax cuts,” Wood said. “So that’s a balance we have to weigh.” 
Anna Gray, the public policy director and counsel for Iowa Natural Heritage Foundation and moderator for the Thursday panel, said Wood’s response sounded like a “challenge for all of us to up the noise and continue to grow our networks and advocacy.”

Water quality and cancer 
Jacoby said cancer is the “biggest issue” coming up for the legislative session.
He raised, and read aloud, a sign with large black text that read “It’s the water.” 
Reports list Iowa as the state with the second-highest rate of new cancer incidents and one of just two states in the nation with increasing rates of new cancers. 
“We need an honest overview of what’s causing the cancer rates,” Jacoby said. 
He advocated to fund the trust, water quality monitoring, watershed work and cancer research. 
Public health professionals and cancer researchers said at the Iowa Nature Summit on Wednesday that while there are many factors contributing to Iowa’s cancer rates, there is enough evidence linking water quality and agricultural chemicals to cancers for lawmakers to craft policies that address those issues. 
Sen. Ken Rozenboom, R-Pella, said he can’t “get out of his living room” without talking about cancer because it has touched the lives of so many Iowans. 
He said it’s a “deep concern” in the Legislature, but not one he has personally dealt with at a committee level. He said if the “finger is pointed” at agricultural pollution, it doesn’t make sense why states like Illinois are not similarly saddled with high cancer rates. 
“Once we have apparent solutions or answers, then we can start changing policy or making policy,” Rozenboom said. “But I think most of us more have more questions than answers yet.” 
During his 13 years at the Capitol, Rozenboom said water quality has been the “one common denominator” in the issues he has prioritized.
Rozenboom was part of a group of lawmakers who helped to pass long-term funding for the Iowa Nutrient Reduction Strategy — a plan for voluntary practice adoption to reduce the amount of nutrients that enter Iowa waterways and eventually contribute to the Gulf of Mexico hypoxia. He said he recognizes the “ongoing and continuing tension between agricultural production and environmental concerns.” 
He said while most Iowans know their state leads the nation in corn, pork, eggs and biofuels production, the state also leads in “water quality weapons” like bioreactors, buffers strips, grass waterways, pollinator habitat, conservation tillage and terraces. 
“That’s part of dealing with the tension between the environment and agricultural production,” Rozenboom said. 
He said he has “always acknowledged” that more work needs to be done to improve water quality in the state. 
Wood, who raises cattle and farms with her family, said there are lots of ways the Legislature can work to “modernize” conservation efforts in budgets that already exist. 
“It’s not flashy to say that we need to keep doing what we’re doing,” Wood said. “We need to do new things too, but we need to make sure that we advocate … in those boring budget line items about infrastructure, because Iowa has previously and continues to recognize water quality as an infrastructure investment.”

(Photo by Getty Images)Little Rock psychologist Krameelah Banks appeared before a federal magistrate judge on Thursday after a grand jury indicted her on 34 counts of wire fraud and making false statements this month.
Banks, 48,  is accused of defrauding Medicare and Arkansas Blue Cross and Blue Shield of more than $500,000, according to the indictment filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Arkansas.
Banks concealed her fraud by creating fictitious records and making false statements related to health care, according to a press release from Jonathan Ross, U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Arkansas.
Banks faces 23 counts of wire fraud, seven counts of making false statements in connection with health care, one count of lying to the FBI and one count of aggravated identity theft.
Banks owned Arkansas Behavioral Center (ABC), according to the indictment, and although she treated some regular patients, most of her patients were referrals who were seen just once for pre-surgical psychological evaluations.
The indictment alleges that from 2021 through 2023, Banks billed thousands of hours for psychological services that never occurred and routinely charged Medicare and Blue Cross in the names of patients she’d seen only once. Some of those billings included services that took place while she was vacationing in Florida and Mexico, according to the indictment.
The indictment also alleges Banks billed the federal insurance program and the insurance company for services to several deceased patients.
Banks responded to questions about disputed claims by creating fictitious records and providing nearly identical records to Medicare and Blue Cross and later misled the FBI by blaming over-billing on her calendaring software, the indictment alleges.
Banks was appointed a federal public defender at Thursday’s appearance, court records show.

Andy Beshear announced Thursday. (Screenshot)Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear says he will appoint a longtime Kentucky Lottery Corp. executive to lead the organization as the current president retires next year. 
Beshear during a Thursday press conference said Chief Revenue Officer Maggie Garrison would be the new president of the corporation that manages the state lottery, saying she had his “full confidence” along with that of the outgoing president Mary Harville and the corporation’s board of directors.
Garrison, who has worked in various roles with the corporation since 2011, thanked Harville for her leadership which she said led to “record sales” and “record funding for the state.” 
“We will continue to embrace new opportunities and adapt to a changing environment, one that has changed because of new technology and new player preferences,” Garrison said. “Each and every accomplishment we achieve at the Kentucky lottery directly impacts educational support for Kentucky students and their families in every county of Kentucky.” 
In the corporation’s latest annual report for fiscal year 2025, it stated it had broken for the 12th consecutive year its “all-time sales record” with more than $2.1 billion in total sales. The report also stated the lottery put more than $384 million toward college scholarships and grants. 
Harville, who Beshear appointed as the corporation’s president in 2020 as the first woman in the role, said it was her “honor and privilege to serve as the face of the Kentucky lottery.”",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screen-Shot-2025-11-20-at-3.43.35-PM-1024x816.png,,,2025-11-20 16:57:24.917358

(Photo from the PSC website)The Florida Public Service Commission (PSC) approved a four-year settlement with Florida Power & Light (FPL) Thursday for about $6.9 billion, which opponents claim is the largest rate hike in U.S. history.
The investor-owned utility, Florida’s largest with approximately six million accounts totaling around 12 million customers, said in a press release that it will enable FPL to continue to make “smart, necessary investments in the grid to power Florida’s growth — while keeping customer bills well below the national average.”
The proposed rate hike was met with fierce opposition. More than two dozen local and state elected officials sent a letter to last month to Gov. Ron DeSantis and the PSC, calling on them to reject the proposal.
The rate hike also became an issue in the race for attorney general. Former Democratic state Sen. José Javier Rodriguez, running for the position next year, called on Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier to intervene in the case.
Attorneys general in places like Michigan, Connecticut, and Arizona have challenged proposed rate hikes by public electricity utilities this year, and Republican former Florida attorneys general such as Bill McCollum and Charlie Crist previously intervened in rate hikes proposed by investor-owned utilities.
However, Uthmeier declined to get involved.
‘Shameful decision’
Bradley Marshall, who represented several groups who opposed the rate hike, insisted the fight isn’t over yet.
“We look forward to reviewing the written decision and expect this case will be appealed to the Florida Supreme Court, where we look forward to presenting our case,” he told the Phoenix. “This decision hurts the people who are already struggling with higher power bills.”
Other critics blasted the PSC.
“Four years ago, FPL was awarded one of the largest rate hikes in U.S. history. Today, they’ve made history again at nearly double that amount. This shameful decision illustrates why our state energy regulators cannot be trusted to ensure that families have reliable, affordable energy,” said Food & Water Watch Senior Florida organizer Brooke Ward in a written statement.
“People are not asking for diamonds or gold — while greedy utilities keep raking in record profits, regular Floridians want to be able to afford running their air conditioners and heaters. The Legislature must pass affordable energy legislation this session to ensure fair electricity prices.”
“By approving this rate hike, the PSC has handed FPL another blank check while Floridians struggle to keep the lights on,” said Alyssa White, climate justice organizer for Florida Student Power. “This is a slap in the face to every family, student, and small business already drowning in high bills. Our communities deserve an energy system that puts people over profit, and we will continue to build the power to make that happen!”
FPL initially wanted bigger rate hike 
Originally, FPL proposed a four-year, $9.8 billion rate hike but, shortly before the PSC was scheduled to hold hearings on that proposal in August, FPL announced that it had reached an 11th-hour “agreement in principle” with what it described as a “diverse” group of organizations including Walmart, RaceTrac, Wawa, and the Florida Retail Federation. That proposal reduced the rate increase to about $6.9 billion but still maintained a return on equity of 10.95%. ROE is a measure of a company’s financial performance.
FPL’s revised proposal drew pushback from the Office of Public Counsel (OPC), designated by law to represent Florida consumers. The OPC worked with organizations such as Florida Rising and the League of United Latin American Citizens of Florida (LULAC) and came up with their own counterproposal, which did not include any input from FPL.
Their proposal would cut the base bill by nearly half for the average residential customer compared to FPL’s original proposal, to $5.2 billion. Their proposed ROE for FPL would be 10.6%.
PSC Chairman Mike La Rosa rejected the OPC proposal on Sept. 12, saying FPL was “an indispensable party to any settlement.” He added that while their proposal could not be presented as a settlement agreement, it could be included as part of their testimony in opposition to FPL’s agreement submitted in late August.
FPL says that in 2026, its “typical” 1,000-kWh residential customer bill in most of Florida will increase by $2.50 a month, or about 2%, from the existing $134.14 to $136.64. In Northwest Florida, the typical residential customer bill will remain relatively flat, going from the existing $143.60 to $141.36 in 2026.
“We appreciate the Florida Public Service Commission’s thorough review of our rate plan,” said FPL president and CEO Armando Pimentel in a statement.
“Today’s vote enables FPL to continue to deliver some of America’s most reliable electric service and meet the needs of our fast-growing state — and we project will keep customer bills well below the national average through the end of the decade. As we begin our second century of serving Florida, approval of this plan is a win for our customers and a win for the entire state.”

“He was a giant to the end,” Liz Cheney recalls to a crowd that included Biden, Pence and Pelosi, but not Trump.
The post Wyoming son Dick Cheney remembered for integrity, loyalty, intellect during D.C. funeral appeared first on WyoFile .","In the eyes of the world, Dick Cheney is known as the most powerful vice president in America’s history — a hawkish and reticent 9/11-era figure who helped expand executive power.
But to those close to him, Cheney was a Wyoming boy to his core; a man deeply devoted to his wife, Lynne, and his daughters; a keen history scholar; an avid fly-fisherman and a proud grandfather. 
He was a man whose work took him to the White House and to world capitals to convene with global dignitaries. But he also attended his grandson’s high school football games, packed and moved his granddaughter to college, and drove another around the West as her personal rodeo chauffeur. 
“I’m pretty sure he’s the only person who ever had the title vice-president-turned-rodeo-grandpa,” his granddaughter Grace Perry told a crowd gathered Thursday in the Washington Cathedral for Cheney’s funeral.

The funeral for former Vice President Dick Cheney was held Nov. 20, 2025 in the Washington Cathedral. (Screengrab/Washington National Cathedral) 
Attendees included friends, family and politicians of all stripes, including Gov. Mark Gordon, former President Joe Biden, former President George W. Bush, former Vice President Mike Pence and prominent Democrat Nancy Pelosi — but not President Donald Trump. The Cheneys, who had public beef with Trump in recent years, did not invite him, the New York Times reported. 
More than 1,000 people were estimated to be in attendance for the service, which came weeks after he died Nov. 3 at the age of 84.
Speakers recalled a man of enormous intellect who was plainspoken and humble, unassuming and competent, decent and patriotic. 
“The vice president was always the calmest person in the room,” said Jonathan Reiner, Cheney’s cardiologist for 27 years.
They also underscored his deep and abiding connections to Wyoming. 
“I can’t think of anybody who better embodied Wyoming values than Dick Cheney,” said Pete Williams, who worked as Cheney’s press secretary for seven years and who also grew up in Casper. “He was comfortable in the saddle on horseback. He judged people by what they accomplished and what they stood for. He loved the state where he grew up and met Lynne. And Wyoming loved him back, electing him six times to the House of Representatives.”
While some politicians shed staffers in favor of bigger names as they rise in prominence, Williams said, Cheney never abandoned the Wyoming folks who were with him from the start.

(Bruce Nichols/Casper College Public Relations Department Photographs and Records. Casper College Archives and Special Collections. Western History Center).  

“When George W. Bush chose him to be the vice presidential candidate in 2000, their first campaign stop together was Casper, a demonstration of Dick’s loyalty to his home state,” Williams said. (Williams sits on WyoFile’s board of directors.)
Bush himself stepped up to the dais to recall fond memories of Cheney, a man who he noted is the only person from America’s Mountain West ever elected to national office. 
“Dick was funny and easygoing in a style that his public image never caught up with,” Bush said. 
“I wish more Americans got to know Dick Cheney in the way that folks in Casper and Cody and Laramie got to know him. Smart and polished, without airs. Courteous and approachable, seeing everyone as an equal. A gentleman by nature. And a true man of the West.”
Country above partisanship 
Cheney, who grew up largely in Casper, served as Wyoming’s sole U.S. representative in Congress from 1979-1989. It was among his many roles in Washington. At age 34, he became the youngest presidential chief of staff in history when President Gerald Ford appointed him to the post. He served as secretary of defense under George H.W. Bush, and years later joined the ticket of George W. Bush to become vice president, serving two terms.
Cheney was famously in D.C. as terrorists attacked America on Sept. 11, 2001, the defining event of his career. He later became the chief architect of the war on terror, and was criticized for the surveillance and interrogation tactics implemented under his leadership.
He and his wife of 61 years, Lynne, continued to live part-time in Jackson, and often hosted family there. They also resided in Virginia, and the family opted to hold Cheney’s funeral in the cavernous Washington Cathedral. The ceremony was not a state funeral, a highly formal, public event administered by the Military District of Washington for distinguished public figures such as former presidents.

The people who showed up — and those who did not — were closely observed by journalists who regarded attendance as a reflection of the country’s current political divisions. Four former presidents were in attendance, along with Kamala Harris and Karl Rove. Neither Trump nor Vice President JD Vance attended the service, which was reported to be invitation-only.
Cheney, in 2024, announced he would vote for Harris in the presidential election, turning against Trump and his party. This came after his daughter, Liz Cheney, publicly criticized Trump for his role in the Jan. 6 insurrection. That move was considered highly consequential; Trump then backed Harriet Hageman, who unseated the younger Cheney to become Wyoming’s lone U.S. representative.  
Cheney’s Harris announcement led some Trump loyalists to distance themselves and others, formerly critical of Cheney, to warm to him. 
‘Without airs’
Bush had a big choice to make 25 years ago while looking for a VP, he recalled. So he hired a distinguished Washington veteran to help him find one: Dick Cheney. 
The men discussed the virtues he sought, Bush said: “preparedness, mature judgment, rectitude and loyalty. Above all, I wanted someone with the ability to step into the presidency without getting distracted by the ambition to seek it.” 
After weeks of these meetings, he said, “I realized the best choice for the vice president was a man sitting right in front of me.” He offered Cheney the spot. Most candidates would jump immediately at the chance, he said. 
“Dick stayed detached and he analyzed it,” he said. “Before I made my decision, he insisted on giving me a complete rundown of all the reasons I should not choose him.”
The way it unfolded followed a pattern of Cheney’s life, Bush said. “His abilities were self-evident, without need of calculation or self-promotion … Even before the Cheney name reached the national stage, people always saw something in the man, solid, reliable and rare.”
The most instrumental person to recognize these qualities, Bush noted, was Lynne Cheney, who is widely credited with convincing her husband to abandon the hard-partying ways of his youth and straighten up. 
Lynne’s influence, he said, “may explain how in just over a decade, a guy can go from laying transmission lines outside Cheyenne to serving as chief of staff for the president of the United States.”
Cheney had many traits uncommon of Washington politicians, Bush said. He was undramatic and even-keeled. He did not feel the need to vocalize every thought; he was sparing and measured with words.

“In a profession of trash-talkers, he was a thinker and a listener,” he said. 
Cheney was a grateful man, Bush recalled, and above all for the three women who shared his journey: Lynne and daughters Mary and Liz. 
“As I quickly discovered in 2000, when you choose one Cheney, you get four,” he said. “His busy and purposeful life was an adventure they experienced together. In a family so close, you dread the day when the circle is broken.”
Cheney was also a devoted grandfather, and three of his grandchildren spoke of the way he cooked Christmas dinner every year for his clan, listened to their troubles, dispensed advice, took them fishing and anchored the family with unwavering love. 
Liz Cheney spoke last, recalling the long road trips she shared with her father; his fascination with the country’s founding and history; his generous support of his family and unswerving commitment to the nation. 
“He was a giant to the end, a lion of a man who loved and served this great republic,” she said.

(Photo by Kyle Martin/For the North Dakota Monitor)North Dakota utility regulators have set a series of hearings on a controversial high-voltage power line, using a recent change in state law to spread out the hearings. 
The Public Service Commission on Wednesday scheduled hearings on what is known as the JETx project, a transmission line between Jamestown and Ellendale.  
The PSC will hold public hearings in the three counties along the proposed route, Dickey, LaMoure and Stutsman. 
Before the public hearings there will be two days of technical hearings in Bismarck. Project developers will use that time to go over details of the 345 kilowatt line. Otter Tail Power Company and Montana-Dakota Utilities Co. are partnering to develop, build and co-own the 92-mile power line. 
PSC approves power line despite questions about need, cost

PSC Chair Randy Christmann said in some previous high-interest hearings, members of the public have waited for hours to comment on a project while listening to the technical details.
“Many times, we’ve gone well into the evening,” Christmann said. 
He said the new system should make it easier for the public to comment. 
“I’ve always felt it was so unfair to the landowners … to sit there hour after hour,” Christmann said.  
A bill passed in the 2025 legislative session allowed for the procedure change. Senate Bill 2116 faced little opposition in the Legislature. 
Commissioner Jill Kringstad on Wednesday noted that there have been times when people have shown up at PSC hearings but left before they could provide input. 
She testified in favor of the bill that gives the PSC the option to split up the hearings. The JETx case will be the first time the split hearings will be used.
“I really like this new approach,” Kringstad said Wednesday. 
Kringstad said most hearings will likely follow the traditional format, but split hearings can be used in cases with a large public interest.

Scott Skokos, executive director of the Dakota Resource Council, said a main reason the group supported the change was hearings on the proposed Summit Carbon Solutions pipeline. The PSC held several drawn out hearings in 2023 and 2024 before approving the carbon dioxide pipeline route. 
“The public would have to wait eight hours to testify after all of the technical experts were done,” Skokos said. 
Bismarck media law attorney Jack McDonald said it’s important to know that both the technical and public hearings are open for anyone to attend. 
“It’s actually a good thing for the public,” McDonald said. 
In the JETx case, the technical hearing will be Jan. 8-9 at the Capitol in Bismarck. Public hearings will be Jan. 12 in Ellendale, Jan. 14 in Edgeley and Jan. 16 in Jamestown. 
PSC hearings are typically livestreamed on the agency’s website. 
The Public Service Commission in November approved a certificate of need for the large power line. However, the project still needs a route permit from the agency. 
The JETx project received some pushback from landowners as the Legislature debated a power line zoning bill. The Legislature approved a bill that says electrical transmission line projects must follow state zoning rules, taking away local government authority.

Free.,"Trump accuses 6 Democratic lawmakers of 'seditious behavior, punishable by death'",Ashley Murray,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-accuses-6-democratic-lawmakers-seditious-behavior-punishable-death,,"WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump accused six Democratic lawmakers of sedition on social media Thursday and threatened them with punishment as severe as death, after they appeared in a video message encouraging U.S. armed forces to refuse “illegal orders.”Trump also shared another social media post that said the Democrats should be hanged.The video’s distribution online by Democrats comes as the Trump administration is mired in multiple legal cases objecting to the president’s deployment of National Guard troops to cities across the country, including a challenge to Guard troops in Chicago which is now before the U.S. Supreme Court.In several morning posts on his own social media platform Truth Social, Trump wrote, “This is really bad, and Dangerous to our Country. Their words cannot be allowed to stand. SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR FROM TRAITORS!!! LOCK THEM UP??? President DJT” “SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR, punishable by DEATH!,” he added a couple of hours later.Prior to writing and publishing his own, the president reposted several messages from users on Truth Social, including one by a user with the handle @P78 who wrote, “HANG THEM GEORGE WASHINGTON WOULD !!” Trump and his social media supporters were referring to the video, which featured Democratic U.S. lawmakers who served in the military telling current members of the military and the intelligence community to “refuse illegal orders.”Each line in the video is alternately delivered by Sens. Elissa Slotkin of Michigan and Mark Kelly of Arizona, and Reps. Chris Deluzio and Chrissy Houlahan of Pennsylvania, Maggie Goodlander of New Hampshire and Jason Crow of Colorado.“We know you are under enormous stress and pressure right now. Americans trust their military, but that trust is at risk. This administration is pitting our uniformed military and intelligence community professionals against American citizens. Like us, you all swore an oath to protect and defend this Constitution. Right now, the threats to our Constitution aren’t just coming from abroad but from right here at home. Our laws are clear: You can refuse illegal orders,” the lawmakers said.The video was titled “Don’t give up the ship.”Does Trump want to ‘execute’ Democrats?When asked by a CBS News reporter during the daily press briefing Thursday whether the president wants to “execute” members of Congress, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt answered, “No.”Leavitt said Trump was reacting to sitting members of Congress who “conspired” on the video message to encourage active duty service members and national security officials to “defy the president's lawful orders.”Leavitt singled out the participation of Slotkin and Kelly, who respectively served as a CIA intelligence officer and a Navy captain. Leavitt also highlighted  Goodlander’s marriage to former National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan, who served under President Joe Biden.“They were leaning into their credentials as former members of our military, as veterans, as former members of the national security apparatus, to signal to people serving under this commander-in-chief, Donald Trump, that you can defy him, and you can betray your oath of office. That is a very, very dangerous message, and it perhaps is punishable by law,” Leavitt said.During the ongoing exchange, CBS’s Nancy Cordes pressed back, saying the lawmakers specifically say “illegal order” in the video.“They're suggesting, Nancy, that the president has given illegal orders, which he has not. Every single order that is given to this United States military by this commander in chief and through this chain of command, through the secretary of War, is lawful,” Leavitt responded.Democrats decry political violence Democratic lawmakers sounded the alarm Thursday over Trump’s social media posts, accusing him of encouraging political violence.“Let’s be crystal clear: the president of the United States is calling for the execution of elected officials. This is an outright threat, and it’s deadly serious. We have already seen what happens when Donald Trump tells his followers that his political opponents are enemies of the state,” Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said on the Senate floor Thursday.“Every time Donald Trump posts things like this, he makes political violence more likely. None of us should tolerate this kind of behavior,” Schumer said, highlighting political violence in recent years, including the Jan. 6, 2021 attack on the U.S. Capitol, and political assassinations just this past year.House Committee on the Judiciary Chair Jamie Raskin, D-Md., called on Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., to “immediately denounce these reckless statements.”The six Democratic lawmakers featured in the video issued a joint statement, saying they “love this country and swore an oath to protect and defend the Constitution of the United States.”“That oath lasts a lifetime, and we intend to keep it. No threat, intimidation, or call for violence will deter us from that sacred obligation. What’s most telling is that the President considers it punishable by death for us to restate the law,” the lawmakers said.",,,,2025-11-20 15:57:34.007033

“District 12 deserves a senator who … isn’t afraid to stand up for them,” Riepe said. “I’ll continue working to control health care costs, expand access to care, maintain a balanced budget, deliver real tax relief, support public safety and grow economic opportunity for families across Nebraska.”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Riepe has several times referred to his district as one of the most “purple” in Nebraska, meaning it has a roughly even mix of registered Republican and Democratic voters. According to the Nebraska Secretary of State’s latest data, the district has 8,900 Republican voters and 7,800 Democrat voters, plus another 6,500 nonpartisan voters. Ralston is an inner-ring suburb in the Omaha area.
This mixture has placed Riepe as a key swing vote who has halted a collection of controversial measures debated by the Legislature in recent years, including shifting the state to winner-take-all in presidential elections, school gender policies and abortion restrictions. He attempted to propose compromises to several of those measures, but was met with mixed results.
During his time in office, Riepe has passed several bills that adjusted various health care regulations in hopes of stabilizing health care costs for Nebraskans. Riepe said these priorities reflect his commitment to “doing what is right, not what is politically convenient.”

The slowdown is the result of a software system issue, agency spokesperson Mark Jones told Mississippi Today. 
“Our software systems are old,” he said.
Mississippians who receive their Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits between the 14th and the 21st of each month will receive up to 65% of their November benefits on their regularly scheduled date. The remaining November benefits for all recipients will be issued separately “as soon as possible,” the agency’s website said Thursday.
Beneficiaries in Mississippi receive $183 on average in food assistance per month, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. Partial benefits for the average beneficiary would amount to a loss of at least $65 in aid as Thanksgiving approaches. 
The nation’s largest food assistance program was paused beginning in November after the federal government said it would not use emergency funds to pay for the program, even though benefits have continued to flow to states in past shutdowns. 
Confusion ensued after more than a dozen states sued the Trump administration for its refusal to issue benefits. Mississippi said it would begin issuing partial benefits Nov. 10 in accordance with guidance from the United States Department of Agriculture, the federal agency that administers the program.
The state Department of Human Services announced that food assistance benefits were set to resume as normal on Nov. 13 after the longest federal government shutdown in U.S. history came to an end. 
About 1 in 8 Mississippians — over 350,000 people — receive food assistance through SNAP. More than 67% of participants are in households with children, and about 41% are in households with older adults or adults with a disability. In four Mississippi counties, over a third of residents rely on the program to purchase food, according to a report from WLBT.
The state Department of Human Services awarded a contract to Deloitte Consulting LLP to improve the agency’s software system in May. Most MDHS eligibility systems were created over 35 years ago, according to the press release announcing the award. 
Jones said the software upgrades are set to be complete in 2027.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/04221933/AP25307719916985.jpg,,,2025-11-20 15:57:34.007033

Jennifer Copeland, executive director of the North Carolina Council of Churches (File photo)Faith leaders in North Carolina used a virtual press conference Wednesday to condemn recent federal immigration enforcement actions that have disrupted daily life for immigrants and their families across North Carolina.
More than 250 people have been arrested since the operations began, and the faith leaders said their congregants have said they’ve avoided going to work, school, and even church services out of concern they could encounter federal agents.
Clergy from the state’s mainline Protestant and interfaith communities called this week’s enforcement actions “harmful” and “devastating.”
“We are not a small minority,” said Jennifer Copeland, executive director of the North Carolina Council of Churches, which includes clergy from 19 denominations. “Millions of church members stand behind these speakers that you’ve heard today.”
Bishop Emily Hartner of the North Carolina Synod of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America framed the situation in religious terms. “We draw on Jesus’s greatest commandment to love God and love our neighbor. And then the parable of the Good Samaritan, where the question is, who is my neighbor?
“When we answer that question, our Lutheran answer is, everyone is our neighbor,” Hartner said.
Speakers said some congregants have been so afraid of the enforcement activity that they have skipped church services altogether amid reports of federal agents stationed near bus stops, parking lots, and residential neighborhoods.
“Wave after wave of the way our government is functioning is doing real harm to ordinary people,” said Bishop Ken Carter of the United Methodist Church.
Rev. Amanda Weatherspoon of the Unitarian Universalist Community of Charlotte said congregations were coordinating with local organizations. She cited efforts with immigrant advocacy groups Siembra N.C. and the Carolina Migrant Network to train volunteers, share information and accompany families who feel unsafe leaving home.
Still, the faith leaders said they recognize the limits of offering protection. On whether churches might revive sanctuary practices — temporarily sheltering immigrants inside houses of worship — several noted that the legal risks had changed in the years since such movements gained national attention.
The Trump administration has also rescinded a long-standing “sensitive locations” policy that had generally barred immigration agents from taking enforcement actions at places of worship, hospitals, and schools without prior approval.
“I know that many congregations are reviewing updated legal policies around harboring and protection,” said Weatherspoon. “They are assessing what is possible and most helpful to fully protect immigrants and safeguard our congregations from legal proceedings amid these changes.”
David Smith, clerk of the North Carolina Fellowship of Friends, representing the state’s Quaker community, framed the debate as a test of core values. “We believe there is that of God in everyone. Every person on this soil must be afforded dignity, respect and due process,” he said.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Rev.-Jennifer-Copeland-1024x1024.jpg,,,2025-11-20 15:57:34.007033

(Getty Images)More Arkansans will be subject to food assistance program work requirements starting Friday, after a panel of legislators approved emergency rules put forward by the Arkansas Department of Human Services Thursday.
The changes to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) implement work requirements on adult SNAP recipients younger than 64 and without dependents younger than 14 who are capable of working.
Previously, those with dependents 18 or younger and those older than 54 were not subject to SNAP work requirements. That changed as a result of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act passed by Congress over the summer. The work-requirement provisions went into effect when the law was signed, but states had until Nov. 1 to implement the changes.
But DHS didn’t receive guidance from the U.S. Department of Agriculture for implementing the changes until October and couldn’t promulgate the rules in time for the Nov. 1 deadline, Mary Franklin, director of DHS’ Division of County Operations, told the Advocate after the Arkansas Legislative Council’s Executive subcommittee meeting Thursday.
Arkansas will start implementing the changes to work requirement exemptions upon adjournment of the Arkansas Legislative Council on Friday using the emergency rule approved by the body’s Executive Subcommittee. A permanent rule will come next year.
The federal law also removed work requirement exemptions for homeless individuals, veterans and those 24 or younger who have aged out of foster care.
Those subject to work requirements must work at least 80 hours a month, or be participating in education, training or volunteer work to receive SNAP benefits for longer than three months within a three year period.

Advocates have worried the changes to work requirements and additional financial burdens on states to operate the program could result in large numbers of individuals and families losing their benefits nationwide. In fiscal year 2024, 240,000 people received SNAP benefits in Arkansas, and 12.6% of the households receiving benefits had children, according to USAFacts.
Despite consistently being one of the most food insecure states in the U.S., according to USDA data, the number of Arkansans receiving SNAP benefits has fallen steadily even as poverty rates remained relatively constant. In fiscal year 2024, the number of Arkansans receiving food benefits was the lowest since 1991 and less than half of the number participating in the program in fiscal year 2013.",https://arkansasadvocate.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/gettyimages-1287472642-2048x1365-1-1024x6831746533271-11761149882.jpg,,,2025-11-20 15:57:34.007033

(Photo: Galen Bacharier/NC Newsline)A group of nine attorneys general, including North Carolina’s AG Jeff Jackson, said Thursday they had reached a settlement with the rental company Greystar. The group sued the company and several other property management firms earlier this year, alleging illegal rent fixing through the use of AI tools.
Greystar will pay $7 million to the group of nine states, Jackson’s office announced Thursday, and will stop using non-public data from other rental companies and RealPage, an AI software company, to determine rents.
“This settlement means that more than 25,000 renters in North Carolina are going to be charged fairer prices for rent at a time when housing costs are overwhelming,” Jackson said in a statement.
Under the settlement, Greystar will only be allowed to use third-party software or algorithms to price apartments under the supervision of a court-appointed monitor. The company will not share sensitive data with competitors in order to set rent prices, and will not attend meetings hosted by RealPage.
Greystar, headquartered in Charleston, South Carolina, is North Carolina’s largest landlord. The company has properties in Asheville, the Charlotte metro, the Cape Fear and Wilmington region, the Piedmont Triad and the Research Triangle, according to its website.
The lawsuit against RealPage and four other rental companies remains in court. It was filed in January alongside California, Colorado, Connecticut, Illinois, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Oregon and Tennessee.
RealPage is alleged to have used sensitive data to create a pricing algorithm that inflates rent and violates antitrust laws. The group of rental companies are alleged to have shared private information with RealPage and amongst themselves about prices and occupancy.
North Carolina in 2024 joined a separate federal suit against RealPage and a group of rental companies alleging antitrust violations under former AG Josh Stein, who is now governor.
That case also remains in court; Greystar and the federal government agreed to an August resolution with similar terms to the one finalized Thursday, and on Tuesday filed a joint motion with states to be dismissed from the 2024 suit.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_4269-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-20 15:57:34.007033

President Donald Trump took to Truth Social, the social media platform that he owns, to post and re-post a number of statements calling for imprisonment and even death of a number of Democratic lawmakers, including U.S. Sen. Elissa Slotkin, calling a video they made “SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR FROM TRAITORS.”
“SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR, punishable by DEATH!” Trump continued in a second post.
Slotkin, a former CIA officer, is joined in the video by fellow Democrats including Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona and Reps. Jason Crow of Colorado, Chris Deluzio of Pennsylvania, Maggie Goodlander of New Hampshire, and Chrissy Houlahan of Pennsylvania, all military veterans and former intelligence officers, where they urge military members to “refuse illegal orders.” 
“This administration is pitting our uniformed military and intelligence community professionals against American citizens,” Slotkin, Kelly and Crow say.  
In response to the video, Trump wrote on Truth Social, “Each one of these traitors to our Country should be ARRESTED AND PUT ON TRIAL.” He followed this up with a series of “re-Truths” of posts calling the members of Congress “terrorists” and even one post calling to hang them. 
“This really isn’t about those of us who made the video,” Slotkin said in a video posted hours after Trump’s posts. “This is about who we are as Americans and how we’re going to engage with people who we disagree with.”

Earlier this morning, President Trump threatened me and a group of service and veteran Members of Congress with arrest, trial, and death by hanging.
Here’s my response: pic.twitter.com/jIZYrQTlP7
— Sen. Elissa Slotkin (@SenatorSlotkin) November 20, 2025

“We are veterans and national security professionals who love this country and swore an oath to protect and defend the Constitution of the United States,” Slotkin and the other lawmakers wrote a joint statement. “That oath lasts a lifetime, and we intend to keep it. No threat, intimidation, or call for violence will deter us from that sacred obligation.”
“What’s most telling is that the President considers it punishable by death for us to restate the law,” the statement continues. “In these moments, fear is contagious, but so is courage. We will continue to lead and will not be intimidated.”
Curtis Hertel, chair of the Michigan Democratic Party, also released a statement on Trump’s posts.
“Threatening death against people you disagree with is totally unacceptable and un-American—especially when it comes to lawmakers who have dedicated their lives to serving this great nation and the Constitution. Donald Trump’s abuse of power to persecute his political enemies has reached a new height, attempting to intimidate anyone who defends the promise of our country,” Hertel said. “We know Senator Slotkin will never be intimidated as she stands up for Michiganders, Americans, and the very cornerstone of our democracy. Trump’s threats today go against everything this country stands for, and every single leader, Republican and Democrat, should be wholeheartedly condemning this behavior.”

Chris Deluzio of Pennsylvania joins veterans protesting the Trump administration's proposed cuts to the Department of Veterans Affairs on Tuesday, May 6, 2025, outside the U.S. Capitol. (Photo by Ashley Murray/States Newsroom)This story was originally published by WESA. 
U.S. Rep. Chris Deluzio of Western Pennsylvania is among a half-dozen Democratic legislators accused of sedition Thursday morning by President Donald Trump, citing a video in which the legislators urged military and intelligence personnel not to obey unlawful orders.
In social media posts made Thursday morning, Trump said the Democrats had committed “SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR AT THE HIGHEST LEVEL,”a crime he said was “punishable by DEATH” and that each legislator “should be ARRESTED AND PUT ON TRIAL. … An example MUST BE SET.” Trump also reposted posts from other accounts, including one calling for the legislators to be hanged.
“ The fact that the president’s reaction to us stating a basic principle of the Constitution is to threaten us with death, tells me everything I need to know about the importance of restating our oath to the Constitution,” Deluzio told WESA on Thursday afternoon.
At issue is a minute-and-a-half-long video released Wednesday in which Deluzio, a U.S. Navy veteran, joins U.S. Rep. Chrissy Houlahan of eastern Pennsylvania and four other Democrats with military backgrounds. They speak in rotation as they directly address military servicemembers and intelligence personnel.
“We know you are under enormous stress and pressure right now,” said Elissa Slotkin, a U.S. Senator from Michigan.
The Trump administration, the Democrats say, is pitting the military and intelligence professionals against American citizens. And while Americans trust the military, “that trust is at risk,” Deluzio says in the video. Service members swear an oath to the U.S. Constitution, but Deluzio adds, “right now, the threats to our constitution aren’t just coming from abroad. … You must refuse illegal orders.”
“Don’t give up the ship,” the Democrats say together.
The video does not identify which actions they regard as “threats to our constitution,” although Democrats have been concerned about the administration’s willingness to deploy the military to cities such as Chicago and Los Angeles. There have also been concerns about a series of military strikes on boats in international waters that the War Department, formerly the Department of Defence, has said were engaged in drug trafficking.
Deluzio told WESA that “it’s  a basic constitutional principle of the oath that you have a duty to follow lawful orders and that no service member is ever forced to follow illegal ones.” He said that “there’s no specific past act we’re pointing to, but certainly there are concerns” about what Trump may demand in the future.
“The president himself has talked about using American cities … as training grounds with active duty troops being pitted against their fellow citizens,” he added. “And so it’s an important moment to reassert that basic constitutional idea of the oaths to the Constitution.”
The U.S. Military Code of Justice requires troops to follow only legal orders: They can be prosecuted for obeying orders that are unlawful. But conservatives expressed outrage at the video, arguing that it was an open call for troops to defy commands issued by Trump as Commander in Chief. Trump amplified that message Thursday, arguing that the video was “punishable by DEATH!”
“Their words cannot be allowed to stand,” he added. “We won’t have a Country anymore!!!”
Deluzio said he hoped that reaction to Trump’s statements would be “a turning point away from this dangerous drive into political violence and authoritarianism.
“ I wish I could say that preparing for the president of the United States of America to call for my death and hanging was not something that had crossed my mind. [But] now it’s happened because this is who he is, apparently.”
“I think this is a moment where everyone — Democrat, Republican, you name it — should be condemning the president’s calls for political violence against me and others, and I think every elected Republican in Pennsylvania should be asked whether they’re going to condemn that call for violence.”
The offices of U.S. Rep Guy Reschenthaler and U.S. Sen. Dave McCormick, both Republicans from Pennsylvania, did not immediately respond to a request for comment Thursday afternoon. The office of U.S. Rep. Mike Kelly said that he would not be available to comment on Trump’s remarks Thursday, but it noted that he spoke about the video itself on Fox the day before.
In those comments, Kelly professed bafflement at the video. “I get confused from time to time whether it’s Trump Derangement Syndrome or people that actually just want to pivot to something else,” he said. ” I have deep respect for those who’ve served. But … most people who’ve served don’t make an issue of things and bring it out in public like that to criticize the President of the United States.
“Why would you bring out something like that?” he added. “What purpose does that play to tell people that you don’t have to follow orders. Really? I’ve never heard that before.”
Nationally, however, some Republicans justified Trump’s remarks, arguing that he was merely stating the penalty for seditious behavior, and that the video crossed a line. Speaker of the House Mike Johnson said the message was “wildly inappropriate” and “beyond the pale.”
Democrats reacted more quickly and forcefully, including Gov. Josh Shapiro, who himself was targeted in an arson attempt earlier this year.
In a social media post of his own, he said, “Not only has the president failed in his responsibility to lead this country — he is actively encouraging political violence once again, ratcheting up the real risk of danger to our elected leaders and deepening the divides in our country. The sycophants and enablers the president surrounds himself with are quick to condemn language like this when it suits their political purposes — but in moments like this, they remain silent
Sen. John Fetterman of Pennsylvania, who has not often challenged Trump in public, issued a social media statement of his own, saying: “I strongly reject this dangerous rhetoric. Do not threaten Members of Congress. Republican or Democrat. It’s deeply wrong with no exceptions — ever.”
In a Thursday-afternoon statement, Deluzio and the other Democrats struck a defiant note in response: “No threat, intimidation or call for violence will deter us from [our] sacred obligation” to the constitution.”
“What’s most telling is that the President considers it punishable by death for us to restate the law,” the statement continues. “This isn’t about politics. This is about who we are as Americans. Every American must unite and condemn the President’s calls for our murder and political violence. … Fear is contagious, but so is courage.”",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/veteransprotest-1024x769.jpg,,,2025-11-20 15:57:34.007033
,Mississippi Today,2025-11-20 20:21:29+00:00,Mississippi Today,Their loved one died far from home in a private Delta prison. Who’s accountable?,Mina Corpuz,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/11/20/men-died-in-a-private-delta-prison-whos-accountable/,At least five people who were from out of state or outside the county have died in the past 1 1/2 years inside the Tallahatchie County Correctional Facility.,"Michelle Hodges-Feek hasn’t opened the box in her living room that arrived weeks ago from Mississippi. 
She can’t bring herself to because inside are the cremated remains of her 40-year-old son, Daniel Hollan, who died Sept. 10 at a privately-run prison in the Mississippi Delta, hundreds of miles away. 
She didn’t get an opportunity to say goodbye. Months later, she has an official cause of death and a certificate, but she’s still left with questions: What happened? How or why did this happen? Who is responsible?
“Nobody cares that my son died except me, and all I got is a big box that I don’t have the guts to open yet,” Hodges-Feek, who lives outside of Kansas City, Kansas, said as she began to cry. 
One day she hopes to take a trip to Colorado, where their family previously lived, to have a memorial service for Hollan and spread his ashes. 
He is among at least five people who were from out of state or from outside the county who died in the last 1 1/2 years inside the Tallahatchie County Correctional Facility, a private prison operated by CoreCivic. Deaths there have left family members, like Hodges-Feek, uncertain about whom to go to for answers and whom to hold accountable. 
Hollan was convicted in Montana in 2017 and spent time in state and privately run prisons there before arriving in Mississippi in January among the first group of Montana prisoners at Tallahatchie Correctional. 
His mother sought answers and details from Mississippi and Montana prison officials, a county coroner and CoreCivic. 
It took a month for her to learn he died from an accidental drug overdose. Hollan had struggled with addiction before, but his mother believes he may have used drugs in prison to self-medicate. He had lived with chronic arthritis that affected his skin and joints and a more recent heart condition. 
To date, CoreCivic has contracted with four states, three counties, one U.S. territory and the U.S. Marshals Service to house people at the 2,672-bed Tallahatchie prison.
CoreCivic also signed a deal in February with Immigration and Customs Enforcement to expand immigration detention, including the use of 252 beds at the Tallahatchie facility. 
The facility houses detainees awaiting trial and the convicted, some serving up to life. A CoreCivic confirmed that pretrial detainees are housed separately from prisoners from state or federal agencies, but did not provide numbers of pretrial detainees and state prisoners. 
In the industry of incarceration, CoreCivic is one of the two largest private prison companies in the United States, operating more than 70 facilities. The Tennessee-based company reported quarterly earnings this month of $580.4 million, up from 18.1% from the prior year quarter. Tallahatchie Correctional is located in the small town of Tutwiler with a population of 1,635 – a fraction of the prison’s capacity. 
‘Is nobody responsible for these guys’ care?’
Hollan had never been to Mississippi, and it was not his decision to come. Montana prison officials, grappling with its prison population and needing to make upgrades to its main state facility, made the decision for him and 239 other prisoners when it signed a contract with CoreCivic. The state retained custody of him from hundreds of miles away.
Three years earlier, the Montana Board of Pardons and Parole ruled Hollan was not eligible for early release and needed to take a class. As he learned about his out-of-state transfer in 2025, he heard that the Arizona CoreCivic facility where Montana had already sent people offered the class he hoped to take to become eligible for parole, his mother said. 
By June of this year, Hollan was up for administrative parole review, but the board informed him by letter he was ineligible for early release again because he didn’t fulfill the class requirement. The board holds hearings and reviews for incarcerated people housed in Montana for state-owned facilities, as well as for those held out of state in private facilities like Tallahatchie Correctional. 
Hodges-Feek and her daughter, Rebecca McQuarrie, kept in touch with Hollan through several 5-minute weekly calls provided to prisoners. He shared that he had been trying to access medical care from the prison’s in-house staff for at least four months before his death.
“Is it Montana people who are watching them? Is it Montana people who are the guards?  It’s CoreCivic’s people who are the guards,” Hodges-Feek said.  “How can they pass the buck, is that legal? Is nobody responsible for these guys’ care?” 
In response, a CoreCivic spokesperson Brian Todd said the company is deeply saddened by the death of any person in its care, and that the company is serious about following standards and policies that its government partners expect. 
When someone dies, CoreCivic notifies the deceased’s home state and local law enforcement to conduct an investigation, Todd said. Then someone from Tallahatchie Correctional contacts the emergency contact listed in the prisoner or detainee’s file. 
“Every death is investigated thoroughly and transparently, but it’s important to note that the circumstances of each incident will dictate how the investigation is handled,” he said in a Thursday statement. “Our focus remains on doing everything possible to prevent these events from happening in the first place through training, oversight and continuous improvement in our standard of care.” 
Montana prisons spokesperson Alexandria Klapmeier wrote in an email that the Tutwiler Police Department investigated Hollan’s death and the Tallahatchie County Coroner’s Office was responsible for the death investigation.
Anthony Hawkins, the Tallahatchie coroner, confirmed he handles death investigations from the private prison, including that of Hollan and others sent from out of state or other Mississippi counties. After initially agreeing to speak, he has been unavailable for comment. 
Tutwiler Police Chief Carlos Thompson was unavailable for comment about the status of the prison-death investigations.

Hodges-Feek was told Hollan was found in his cell, blue in the face in the morning, multiple hours after he was last seen or heard from the previous day. She wonders if his cellmate or others had seen anything. 
She also submitted a public records request with the Montana Department of Corrections seeking copies of Hollan’s medical requests and related grievances. As of November, she is still waiting to receive those records. 
The Montana prison official who informed Hodges-Feek and his sister about Hollan’s death said it didn’t appear to be suicide, the women said. McQuarrie wanted confirmation because the youngest of her three brothers died from suicide in 2017 and she didn’t think her mother could handle losing another child that way. 
The state where a suspicious death occurs in a correctional facility outside Montana handles the investigation following that state’s legal processes and laws, Klapmeier said. Once the coroner finishes a death investigation, that official shares the information with the contract prison department and medical and investigation staff, she said.
Mississippi’s State Medical Examiner’s Office conducts the autopsies, as required by law for people who die in public or privately run prisons, jails or correctional facilities. The examination is used to help complete a death certificate, which is issued by the state Department of Health. 
That office completed Hollan’s autopsy and those of the Vermont prisoners and Hinds County detainees, said Bailey Martin, spokesperson for the Department of Public Safety, which oversees the medical examiner’s office.
Mitzi Magleby is an advocate who has worked with incarcerated people and their families in Mississippi’s state- and privately run prisons. Whenever anyone dies in prison, she said the priority should be informing families and guiding them through processes. 
“To me it’s a communication breakdown,” she said. “There’s not enough communication with these families. They’re in the dark.”
For out-of-state families like Hodges-Feek, Magleby said having to seek information from two state prison agencies and a private company is even more red tape to navigate. 
Klapmeier, the Montana prison spokesperson, said the state pays to bring the body of the deceased to their family’s choice of funeral home in the state or transport their cremation remains to the family. 
This was not made clear to Hodges-Feek. She said as her family considered the cost of bringing Hollan’s body home, her daughter and son-in-law considered taking out a loan to pay for it, but Hodges-Feek said she didn’t want them to take on that financial burden. Instead, she approved Hollan’s cremation in Mississippi.
Cremation felt like the only option to get her son home because it wasn’t clear where he would have been buried – Montana or Mississippi – if she pursued that option. 
‘The safest and most dignified option’
Two men from Vermont, which also contracts with CoreCivic, also died in the Tallahatchie facility.
At the end of February 2024, 71-year-old Alfred Brochu, who was serving life for murder, was found unresponsive in his cell and taken to a hospital where he died. He had been at Tallahatchie Correctional since 2011, Vermont media reported. 
Two weeks later in March, 43-year-old Sean Osterhout died. He came to Mississippi in 2019 and was serving up to a 30-year sentence for two charges of lewd and lascivious conduct with a child.
The Vermont Department of Corrections handled the death investigations and found that the deaths were not suspicious, said Haley Sommer, a department spokesperson for the Vermont Department of Corrections.
When a death of one of its people occurs at Tallahatchie Correctional, Vermont prison staff travel to the facility to look at circumstances that lead to the death and to consult with the medical team in Vermont about medical records, she said. From there, Vermont’s Defender General’s office has discretion of whether to conduct an investigation into a prison death.
Vermont has faced a challenge with space in its correctional facilities, and the state’s preference has been to send people out of state to reduce overcrowding at home, Sommer said.  
The state has contracted with CoreCivic since 2018, and Vermont has found that contracts with private companies like CoreCivic to be useful because the state is able to maintain custody, which includes making decisions about inmates’ medical care. 
“It is the safest and most dignified option,” Sommer said about sending inmates out of state to Mississippi and other prison facilities.

Months before Hollan’s death, Hinds County detainees Ulysses Nelson III and Christian Dyre, both 24, died within days of each other in the Tallahatchie facility. 
Dyre had been at Tallahatchie Correctional since October 2023 and was facing a murder charge, and Nelson had been at the prison since January awaiting trial for aggravated assault, domestic violence and rape, Hinds County Sheriff Tyree Jones said. 
Jones said their deaths were believed to be drug-related because there were reports of contraband in the zone where they both were housed. He said at the time that Tutwiler police would investigate and the State Medical Examiner’s Office would conduct an autopsy and toxicology reports. 
Todd, the CoreCivic spokesman, said there is a zero-tolerance policy for anyone to introduce contraband into its facilities. The company seeks to prevent contraband from coming through such measures as searches, patrols, monitoring systems and mail checks, he said. 
Tallahatchie Correctional medical staff immediately respond to emergency calls and are equipped to provide lifesaving care such as the administration of naloxone, which is an opioid-overdose reversing drug, he said. 
Mississippi Today requested records about the men’s cause of death, but the information was not available by publication. 
In an October interview, Jones would not comment about the sheriff’s office’s working relationship with operators of the Tallahatchie facility, citing ongoing litigation around the Hinds County Detention Center. 
In 2023, the county signed a two-year contract with CoreCivic to send detainees to the private prison due to limited staff and conditions of a housing pod that has been closed down.
‘Nobody cares about these boys once they get locked up’
In the weeks after his death, Hodges-Feeks joined a Facebook group with other family members with loved ones in CoreCivic facilities in Mississippi and Arizona, including those who died there. She now knows she is not alone. 
With questions still unanswered about her son’s death, Hodges-Feek and Hollan’s sister try to remember him as a person who put others first and had a good work ethic. When tornado sirens went off, Hollan was often the first to react and tell his family to get to a safe place. As a child, he saved his own money to buy a video game console.

But Hollan also had a knack for being in the wrong place at the wrong time. This, his mother said, paired with the death of his younger brother led him to turn to drugs and alcohol, and actions stemming from their use led to prison time, his mother said. 
After completing an earlier sentence, Hollan tried to get a fresh start in Montana. Instead, he began to use drugs again, which Hodges-Feek said contributed to another prison charge. Hollan was convicted in 2017 of prostitution and received a 99-year sentence with 75 years suspended, according to court records. 
Hodges-Feek kept in contact with her son over the years as he was moved to state-owned and private prisons in Montana. 
In Mississippi, Hollan used his free weekly calls to tell his mother and sister what he was experiencing: How January rain caused flooding in the prison and the summer passed without air conditioning.
Hodges-Feek has seen how her older son, who also served time in prison, was able to turn his life around. She wonders what could have happened if Hollan had received a similar chance. 
“(Daniel) never got the opportunity,” she said. “Nobody cares about those boys once they get locked up.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/20131305/MT-TallahatchieCoCorrectionalFacility-FeatImage-02.jpg,,,2025-11-20 15:57:34.007033

(Photo by Leah Romero / Source NM)New Mexico Secretary of State Maggie Toulouse Oliver recently signed a letter to U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem expressing concern about the federal government’s request for states’ voter rolls.
The Nov. 18 letter, as Colorado Newsline originally reported, was signed by 10 Democratic secretaries of state, and raises concerns about inconsistent information from the federal agencies about how they are using and sharing voter data requested from states in recent months.
The election officials’ recent letter notes that everyone who signed it—which in addition to Toulouse Oliver includes the secretaries of state from Arizona, California, Colorado, Maine, Minnesota, Nevada, Oregon, Vermont and Washington—received letters requesting voter data lists—in some cases redacted lists that included “dates of birth, state driver’s license numbers, and last four digits of Social Security numbers.”
In the case of New Mexico, as Source NM previously reported, the United States Department of Justice initially reached out to Toulouse Oliver in July. She told Source NM this week the state provided the federal government with “the publicly available file that anyone has access to,” which does not include Social Security Numbers and only years of birth.
Following the requests for data, the letter says, officials heard inconsistent information about how the information would be used.

According to the letter, at the end of August in a phone call meeting arranged by the National Association of Secretaries of State, a U.S. Department of Justice representative said the lists would be used to assess compliance with the Help America Vote Act and the National Voter Registration Act.
Then a DHS official named Heather Honey, in a separate meeting, said that “that DHS had not received voter data or requested it. She then suggested that DHS had no intention of using voter data.”
That information was contradicted when the Trump administration acknowledged that the Department of Justice was sharing voter information with Homeland Security to search for non-citizens.
Honey, according to the DHS website, holds a position as Deputy Assistant Secretary for elections integrity. The letter from the secretaries of states notes that Honey “has a history of spreading false claims about elections.”
She pushed to overturn Trump’s loss in the 2020 election. Now she’ll help oversee election security.

“Federal law and the U.S. Constitution are clear: states are responsible for administering elections,” the letter reads. “Additionally, transmitting this information to another federal agency raises serious Privacy Act concerns and risks improper dissemination of and access to sensitive voter data. We are deeply concerned about the inconsistent and misleading information that Secretaries have received from the DOJ and DHS and with the potential lack of compliance with federal law.”
The letter asks for answers to a series of questions by Dec. 1 about how the voter information has or will be used or shared.
In response to a query from Source NM regarding the letter, a U.S. Department of Justice spokesperson referenced a previous statement on the topic provided by a spokesperson that says:
“Enforcing the Nation’s elections laws is a priority in this administration and in the Civil Rights Division.  Congress gave the Justice Department authority under the NVRA, HAVA, the Civil Rights Act, and other statutes to ensure that states have proper voter registration procedures and programs to maintain clean voter rolls containing only eligible voters in federal elections. The recent request by the Civil Rights Division for state voter rolls is pursuant to that statutory authority, and the responsive data is being screened for ineligible voter entries.”
Source has a pending query with Homeland Security regarding the letter and its content.
In a phone interview Wednesday, Toulouse Oliver told Source NM that she had two main concerns about the federal government’s request for voter data rolls. First: “What is the data being used for outside of verifying citizenship? That’s a big concern, because we’re not in the business of creating citizenship lists or providing information to [Immigration Customs Enforcement] that would potentially harm people who are legally here in the United States. We’ve seen from many, many news reports, there are a number of people that ICE have detained that are either US citizens or have legal status, so to me, that’s deeply concerning.”
Toulouse noted, as she has previously to Source, that she’s not worried “that there is some huge amount, if any, non-citizens on our voter registration list. What I am concerned about goes to the number two concern, which is they have insisted that we send them our data and that they do the matching. And that’s not how it works. We, the county clerks and my office, are experts in matching data for voter registration purposes, and we go out of our way to ensure that a match is an accurate match.”
Accurate matches, she said, “go beyond having the same name and birth date. Because you can have two Juan Sanchezes with the same birth date; it’s not hard to imagine in New Mexico. We have deep concerns about how they are doing their matches and what is the level of scrutiny that’s being applied to that process.”
If state officials were doing the checking, Toulouse Oliver noted, “I would trust that process a lot more than whatever mysterious process they’re doing because, again, I know that we are going to exhaust every possible resource at our disposal to ensure that when we say this person is a non-citizen and they’re on the voter registration list, that we are sure that they are and or that we have a high percentage of being sure.”
The bottom line, she said, “they’re actually using voter registration as a tool to try to find non-citizens to prosecute or persecute through their other agenda regarding non-citizens. And it’s not, in my mind, about making sure we don’t have non-citizens on the voting rolls, although that should be a goal that we all share. It’s more about using that data for other purposes.”
And while Toulouse Oliver said she doesn’t necessarily expect to receive a response to the questions posed by the letter, “If I don’t stand up and use my voice for what is right, then I’m complicit. If I don’t stand up and I don’t say, ‘Hey, this is wrong. Can you please provide us with some answers?’ then I’m not doing my job.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/elex3LR-2048x1356-1-1024x678.png,,,2025-11-20 15:57:34.007033

July 19, 2022. | Photo by Katherine Dailey/Michigan Advance.After a federal appeals court held that Michigan is not immune to legal action for its decision to revoke a Canadian energy company’s easement to operate a pipeline in the Great Lakes, the Whitmer Administration is seeking an appeal to the United States Supreme Court. 
In a petition filed on Nov. 13, attorneys for the state have asked the high court to weigh whether the state is entitled to legal immunity in cases where a private entity seeks relief that would diminish the state’s ownership and control of its own lands. 
Attorney General Dana Nessel argued the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals erred when it agreed that Enbridge Energy’s case against Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and Scott Bowen, the director of the Michigan Department of Natural Resources, fell within the exceptions to sovereign immunity, which prevents a state from being sued in state or federal courts without its consent. 
“This Court’s intervention is urgently needed because the Sixth Circuit’s rule strikes at not one, but two core attributes of statehood: a State’s immunity from suit and its dominion over sovereign lands,” attorneys for the state wrote in their petition. 
20251113124945367_Whitmer v Enbridge Petition A
Enbridge filed its lawsuit against the state in response to Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s decision to revoke and terminate its permit to operate the Line 5 pipeline on the bottomlands of the Straits of Mackinac, where Lake Michigan and Lake Huron meet. 
Whitmer and Nessel, alongside Native American Tribes and environmental activists have raised alarms about the potential for the pipeline to rupture, with one University of Michigan researcher concluding the Straits of Mackinac are the “worst possible place” for a Great Lakes oil spill. 
While the state argued Enbridge had repeatedly violated the easement’s terms, the company argued that the governor and the Department of Natural Resources have no authority over pipeline safety matters and that the termination of their permit ran afoul of the Federal Pipeline Safety Act and the 1977 transit pipelines treaty with Canada. 
Although Enbridge was given until Dec. 17 to respond to the state’s petition to the Supreme Court, the company filed a document noting it does not intend to respond.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_9924-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-11-20 15:57:34.007033

Toby Overdorf speaks to reporters after a property tax meeting on Nov. 20, 2025. (Via Liv  Caputo/Florida Phoenix)Florida House Democrats found common ground with Gov. Ron DeSantis Thursday in vehemently opposing Republicans’ eight property tax proposals, all of which have passed their first committee hurdles along party lines.
The measures aim to slash most property taxes while keeping law enforcement funding intact. Although seven of the eight are proposals to amend the state Constitution, House Republicans wouldn’t mind presenting voters with all seven options on the November ballot — over DeSantis’ objections and Democrats’ fears of harming local governments.
“None of these proposals directly conflicts with another,” said Rep. Toby Overdorf, R-Palm City, chair of the 37-member House Select Committee on Property Taxes. “There may be some overlap between some of the proposals, but there’s not conflict.”
DeSantis has bitterly feuded with House Republicans since Miami Rep. Danny Perez took the helm as Speaker last year. Perez, a Republican, urged his members to shift away from the dogged obedience to DeSantis demonstrated as the governor ran for president, and toward independence.
He systematically opposed DeSantis on most proposals, drawing the governor’s ire as he began to insult the GOP-supermajority House as “rotten” and recently called their property tax proposals “milquetoast.”
Overdorf told reporters following Thursday’s meeting that he’d “love to compare plans” with the governor “once we receive a plan from him.” None of the House’s proposals are, as of yet, mirrored in the Senate.
“None of the bills address that…”
Democrats joined not only DeSantis but a slew of local government officials in opposing each of the eight proposals Republicans presented. 
City commissioners, mayors, and pro-local groups spoke during Thursday’s four-hour meeting as nearly all derided the measures as potentially expensive, dangerous, and harmful to their communities.
They argued that, although each of the measures stays away from school property taxes and forbids de-funding law enforcement, the “drastic” cuts could make it difficult to fund firefighters, emergency management services, and other locally covered services largely drawn from property taxes,
Port St. Lucie Vice Mayor Jolien Caraballo said that 49% of her city’s $212.5 million general fund comes from property taxes. She claimed that if some of these proposals were enacted, it would leave her city with $108.3 million. Of that, $94.6 million goes to law enforcement.
“That [would leave] only $13.7 million to fund every other department to support our more than 263,000 citizens,” Caraballo said.
Similar sentiments were echoed by representatives from Apopka, Wauchula, and Bartow. Democrat Rep. Mike Gottlieb argued that none of the measures address spiraling housing costs.
“The real drivers of higher housing costs are limited supplies, zoning barriers, construction costs, and soaring insurance and HOA fees,” he said. “None of the bills address that.”
What are the proposals?
Here’s a list of the proposals filed by House Republicans, as the Phoenix has previously reported.

HJR 201 by Rep. Kevin Steele (R-Dade City): Would eliminate all non-school homestead property taxes. If approved by voters, the House staff analysis estimates it will have a negative cash impact of $14.1 billion and a negative recurring impact of $18.3 billion. Recurring means a continuing loss year after year.
HJR 203 by Monique Miller (R-Palm Bay): Would phase out non-school homestead property taxes annually over 10 years. The House staff analysis estimates it will have a negative cash impact of $4.4 billion and a negative recurring impact of $13.3 billion.
HJR 205 by Juan Porras (R-Miami): Would exempt Florida residents over the age of 65 from paying non-school homestead property taxes. The House staff analysis estimates it will have a negative cash impact of $5.1 billion and a negative recurring impact of $6.7 billion.
HJR 207 by Rep. Shane Abbott (R-DeFuniak Springs): Would create a new homestead exemption for non-school property taxes equal to 25% of the assessed value of the House. The House staff analysis estimates it will have a negative cash impact of $3.5 billion and a negative recurring impact of $4.6 billion.
HJR 209 by Rep. Demi Busatta (R-Miami): Would create a new property insurance relief homestead exemption of $100,000 — as long as the property is covered by a comprehensive “multiperil” property insurance policy. The House staff analysis estimates it will have a negative cash impact of $6.6 billion and a negative recurring impact of $8.6 billion.
HJR 211 by Rep. Toby Overdorf (R-Palm City): Eliminates the cap on a portability transfer under Florida’s Save Our Homes benefit, allowing a homeowner to transfer their entire accumulated Save Our Homes benefit to their new home, even if that home has a lesser value.  The House staff analysis estimates it will have a negative cash impact of $42.7 million, and a negative recurring impact of $336.8 million.
HJR 213 by Rep. Griff Griffitts (R-Panama City Beach): Would llimit the growth in assessed value of non-school homestead property to 3% over three years (it’s now 3% per year) and 15% over three years for non-homestead property (it’s 10% per year now). The House staff analysis estimates it will have a negative cash impact of $1.7 billion, and  negative recurring impact of $5.2 billion.

HB 215 by Rep. Jon Albert (R-Frostproof): The only bill, not proposed amendment, filed. The measure would make various statutory changes including requiring a 2/3 vote for any increase in the millage rate by a local government and allow newly married couples to combine their accumulated Save Our Homes benefits, not exceeding a total of $500,000.
The House staff analysis estimates it will have a negative cash impact of $44.5 million (-$16.4 million School and -$28.1 million Non-School), and a negative recurring impact of $112.6 million (-$41.5 million School and -$71.1 million Non-School) on local property tax revenues.

(Screenshot from TikTok)The first thing they asked Fernando Vazquez was “Where are you from?”
When two unmarked SUVs full of Border Patrol agents arrived Tuesday at the Cary construction site where Vazquez, 18, is employed, the only thing he could think of was to call his dad, another worker on the site. “I just told him, run, and to hide.”
The work at the site was virtually complete, with only around 10 workers present on an average day. Because of absences — with fears of Border Patrol and ICE chilling construction sites across the Triangle — Vazquez said there were only about four people on the site, part of why he didn’t believe they would be targeted.
“I didn’t believe it would happen to me,” Vazquez said. “I was born here.”

Vazquez had left the site to buy a drink at a nearby store. As he walked back, he saw a gray Chevy Tahoe and a black Ford Expedition roll up to the site. Vazquez retreated into a fenced-off HVAC area and took out his phone to get a better look at them.
But the agents had already spotted him.
The agents who approached him wore masks, gloves, and dark glasses. At first, Vazquez reserved his right to remain silent, but when one agent began questioning him in Spanish, he started swearing at them “to make time to stall them,” he said. “I’m thinking about the workers and my dad.”
As he tried to step out of the enclosure, he said, Border Patrol agents climbed over the fence to corner him. One yanked an AirPod out of Vazquez’s ear and set it on the AC unit beside him. When Vazquez tried to retrieve it and put it back in the case, he said, the agent shouted, “Don’t touch me.”
“I’m like, ‘I’m not touching you.’ And then he said, ‘If you touch me, there’s going to be a problem,’” Vazquez said.
That was when they handcuffed him and searched him, pulling his wallet out of his pocket.
“They saw my North Carolina Real ID,” he said. “They were looking for an ID or some sort of documentation, so at that moment, they could have let me free. But no, they decided to take me.”
Vazquez was placed in the SUV with one of his fellow workers on the construction site, a young man who was crying. As they drove away, the agents continued to question Vazquez, asking him again where he was from and where he was born as they went through his wallet.
When he told them he was born in Raleigh, the agent questioning him grew angry, Vazquez said. They abruptly pulled off the road into the parking lot of a carpet cleaning company, where they dumped him, a half mile away from where they picked him up, throwing his wallet and cards out of the SUV window as they drove off.
“I have no idea why they just dropped me off,” he added. “I kind of felt like I was being kidnapped.”
His video of Border Patrol uncuffing him and driving away has gone viral on TikTok, accumulating 3 million views and thousands of concerned comments. In the video, an agent with his face covering lowered appears to lunge at the phone with a raised hand, which Vazquez said he believed was an attempt by the agent to conceal his identity.
As Vazquez left the SUV, the other detainee asked him, “Tell my brother that they got me.”
“It devastated me,” Vazquez said. “It broke my heart to realize how two brothers were being separated in front of my eyes.”
As he ran back to the site, he called his mom to pick him up. His first reaction was fear that his dad may have been taken in the other SUV. When he told her what happened, she didn’t believe him. “Until she heard me running worried and worried, that’s when she believed me,” he said.
When he got back to the site, he told his dad and the detainee’s brother, another worker on the site, what happened. “His brother was just outside in shock,” he said.
The other worker told Vazquez that another Border Patrol vehicle was still patrolling the area, so he called his mom back, warning her not to pick him up. Instead, he got the keys from his dad and drove home himself.
Vazquez’s encounter with Border Patrol comes as immigration enforcement agencies conduct large-scale raids in Charlotte, Raleigh, and surrounding areas. He was far from the only U.S. citizen to be swept up in them.
A spokesman for Customs and Border Protection declined to comment on the incident, but said Thursday afternoon that Operation Charlotte’s Web in North Carolina has resulted in 370 arrests. “The operation is not over and it is not ending anytime soon,” Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement.
Earlier Thursday, Mecklenburg County Sheriff Garry McFadden said he had been told by federal agents that Border Patrol operations had ceased in Charlotte, though he noted that ICE will continue to operate in the area “as they always have.”
It is unclear whether Border Patrol operations in the Triangle area remain ongoing. A spokeswoman for Wake County Sheriff Willie Rowe said their office has had no communication from federal authorities.

North Carolina politicians from both parties have urged federal agents to focus their efforts on criminals instead of carrying out indiscriminate arrests.
Sen. Ted Budd (R-N.C.) wrote in a post on X that operations should target “those who not only violated our immigration law but also pose a threat to our communities.”
“Federal law enforcement has been tasked with removing criminal offenders who never should’ve been in the U.S.,” Budd wrote Wednesday. “They should carry out this mission responsibly to ensure that violent individuals are quickly identified, detained, and deported.”
Gov. Josh Stein issued a direct condemnation of ICE and Border Patrol for “operating in the shadows” in the state on Tuesday.
“If this were targeted to going after known people who are criminals or known people who are drug traffickers who are engaged in violent crime, that would be a good thing,” Stein said after an event in Benson. “But they’re just sweeping sidewalks. They’re sweeping parking lots. They’re going into stores and churches.”
“This is causing widespread fear, widespread uncertainty,” he added. “This is not about public safety, and I wish that it were.”
Vazquez said he would advise those concerned they could be picked up to carry their documentation with them at all times. If possible, he said, don’t leave the house at all.
“If you don’t have to come outside, don’t come outside,” he said. “If you need any help, ask somebody.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/CBP-Drives-Away-e1763667956759.png,,,2025-11-20 15:57:34.007033

The railroad is seen at left running through town and meeting up with the river near the top of the frame. (William Woody for Colorado Newsline)State leaders are applauding another major step finalized Wednesday toward permanently protecting upper Colorado River water flows on the Western Slope.
Members of the Colorado Water Conservation Board gave unanimous approval to an agreement between Xcel Energy and the Colorado River District, which manages water supplies for 15 Western Slope counties, to transfer two key water rights associated with the Shoshone Hydroelectric Generating Station to the district for $99 million.
The terms of that deal called for the CWCB, which manages water resources statewide, to approve the Shoshone water rights as “instream flow” rights under a state program created in the 1970s to secure water rights for “nonconsumptive,” environmental uses. The two water rights held by the small hydropower plant date to 1905 and 1940 and add up to over 1,400 cubic feet per second of Colorado River water flows — two factors that would make it the most substantial set of rights ever secured by the instream flow program.

“The importance of today’s vote cannot be overstated as a legacy decision for Colorado water and the Western Slope,” Andy Mueller, general manager of the Colorado River District, said in a statement. “It secures an essential foundation for the health of the Colorado River and the communities it sustains.”
Western Slope counties have worried for years about the consequences for Colorado River flows if the Shoshone plant, which is now nearly 120 years old, were to be bought and shut down. Located just east of Glenwood Springs, the plant has a maximum capacity of 15 megawatts, making it one of the smaller generation assets in Xcel’s portfolio.
But the “seniority” of the power station’s 1905 water right is a powerful tool in shaping regional water use — including how much of the Colorado River is siphoned off by Front Range water utilities through transbasin diversions. While the Colorado River District says its aim is to preserve the river’s historical status quo, utilities including Denver Water have voiced concerns about the effect the deal could have on their more junior water rights.
“Acquiring the Shoshone water rights for instream flow use is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to preserve and improve the natural environment of the Colorado River,” said Dan Gibbs, executive director of Colorado Department of Natural Resources. “But I also want to stress that the state is committed to ensuring that the historical use of the water rights is maintained at the status quo and we are committed to participating in any process to settle and resolve these issues for all water users.”
In addition to the go-ahead from the CWCB on Wednesday, the $99 million agreement between Xcel and the Colorado River District in 2023 is contingent on approval by a state water court and the Public Utilities Commission. The Shoshone Water Rights Coalition, made up of local governments supporting the deal, has secured $57 million in funding from its members and from the state, but it needs another $40 million from the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation, which was included in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act.
“Those funds remain under review by the current administration,” the Colorado River District said in a statement. U.S. Sen. Michael Bennet, in a press release applauding the deal, called on the Trump administration to “heed the bipartisan, statewide support” and release the funding promptly.
“Thousands of Coloradans, our fish, and our wildlife depend on this water every day,” Gov. Jared Polis said in a statement. “This is another step toward finalizing a powerful tool for supporting competing demands — hydropower, environment, agriculture and recreation — while giving west slope water users more certainty about our future water security.”

Maura Healey’s desk, and what’s still on hold until 2026 now that the Legislature is done with major business for the year?","IT’LL BE A FEW more weeks until the icicle lights go up, but the holiday season has already begun atop Beacon Hill. 
Lawmakers on Wednesday concluded their final formal sessions for the year, kicking off a break of six weeks or longer. The House and Senate will continue to meet twice per week in that span, though those gatherings will be lightly attended informal sessions where only minor, uncontroversial business can be considered. 
All of the big stuff that did not get addressed before the final gavel rang out Wednesday night is now, essentially, on hold until 2026. 
So what happened with the legislation that was on the move this week? 
On the governor’s desk 
Other than half a dozen local bills or land transfers, the only significant measure to get all the way to Gov. Maura Healey on Wednesday was a $2.3 billion spending bill needed to close the state’s financial books for the fiscal year that ended June 30. 
Lawmakers were, once again, late getting to the matter. State law technically requires the comptroller to file a financial report by October 31, which cannot happen until the Legislature and governor agree on a so-called closeout budget. 
For the sixth time in the past seven years, the final legislative action on the annual bill did not come until after the Halloween deadline. Comptroller William McNamara warned two weeks ago that the tardiness could prompt the federal government to “slow or withhold federal funds,” according to the State House News Service. 
Healey will get 10 days to review the measure, which injects more than $1.6 billion into MassHealth, all but $303 million of which is poised to be reimbursed by Washington, DC. 
Senate budget chief Michael Rodrigues said spending on the state’s Medicaid program — which could be upended in coming years by already-approved federal cuts — has been “growing exponentially.” 
“It’s growing much higher than predicted, much higher than the health care benchmarks that were established,” Rodrigues told reporters Monday. “That’s something that certainly has us concerned.” 
The bill also transfers $50 million toward rental housing support, provides another $12 million for free K-12 school meals, and makes $10 million in state funding available for the 2026 World Cup, as long as event organizers secure private matching dollars. 
Legislative negotiators settled on providing just $27 million for county sheriffs, withholding the majority of the funding law enforcement officials sought until after a proposed inspector general review of their spending habits. 
It’s not clear if Healey will agree with that approach or will instead push for the full appropriation she originally proposed. A Healey spokesperson said last month only that the governor would review whatever legislation she receives. 
The closeout budget has some notable policy riders, too, including language opening up access to some patient records at current and former state-run facilities and provisions decoupling vaccination schedules from the recommendations of a federal panel whose approach has created concerns among scientists. 
Approved in both chambers, but not yet to the governor 
After working through dozens of amendments, the Senate voted in favor of a major marijuana industry reform bill just after 9 p.m. Wednesday. 
The House already approved its own version of the bill back in June, and now Democrats in each chamber will need to reconcile differences between the measures before they can send a final version to Healey. 
Both bills would overhaul the Cannabis Control Commission, which has been marked by a series of controversies, and shrink its membership from five to three. They would also increase the number of cannabis licenses a single retailer could hold and boost the purchase and possession limit for recreational users. 
“This legislation is not about starting over,” Sen. Adam Gomez, who co-chairs the Legislature’s Cannabis Policy Committee, said Wednesday. “It’s about building on what we’ve learned. It’s about making sure that our laws keep pace with the current industry while protecting consumers, supporting small businesses, and advancing equity.” 
Lawmakers have not yet appointed a so-called conference committee of representatives and senators that would be tasked with ironing out a compromise version. They could do that next week, or legislative leaders could instead work more informally to come to an agreement on what to ship to the governor. 
Headed to DC 
Both branches were in alignment on action they say will protect the country from potential overreach by the Trump administration. 
Article V of the US Constitution allows constitutional amendments to be considered at a convention if two-thirds of state Legislatures request such a summit.  
Massachusetts previously transmitted requests for an Article V convention to Congress that technically remain pending, including one sent in 1977 seeking a constitutional ban on abortion, according to House Speaker Ron Mariano’s office. 
An Article V convention has never happened, but Democrats are concerned that leaving those resolutions in place could push the nation closer to the critical mass required for one, where President Donald Trump and Republicans could pursue sweeping changes to the Constitution. 
The House and Senate voted Wednesday to rescind all previous Article V resolutions adopted in Massachusetts, which legislative leaders say makes Massachusetts the 17th state to do so — putting the two-thirds majority out of reach for those who want a convention. 
“Without clear boundaries, an Article V convention could open the door to rewriting the very foundations of our democracy,” said House Assistant Majority Leader Alice Peisch. “It could jeopardize the principles that generations of Americans have fought and sacrificed to preserve.” 
The newly approved resolutions will now be transmitted to the clerk of the US House and the secretary of the US Senate.  
Through one branch, but not the other 
The Legislature operates on two-year cycles, and bills do not expire in between years one and two. So for legislative leaders in either chamber, the final flurry of activity was a chance to get a couple of priorities done and officially shift the onus to their counterparts across the hall. 
On Tuesday, the penultimate day for major business this year, the House approved a nearly $3.3 billion rewrite of Healey’s borrowing bill designed to fund campus infrastructure improvements at public colleges and universities. 
The House on Wednesday also advanced legislation aiming to rein in violence that health care professionals face at work by establishing new preventative standards and boosting reporting requirements. 
Neither measure has emerged yet in the Senate, which will almost certainly wait until the new year to act, if it does.  
Never came up  
For more than a week, it seemed like House Democrats would push for a vote on sweeping energy legislation that sought to rein in utility prices while also defanging the state’s 2030 decarbonization requirements. 
Rep. Mark Cusack, the architect of the dramatic rewrite to Healey’s energy affordability bill, said he hoped for a vote before the holiday break and that he had the backing of the speaker. 
But the proposal did not get to the House floor after all. Following immense blowback from environmental groups, House Ways and Means Committee Chair Aaron Michlewitz — a top Mariano deputy — said his panel still has “a lot of work to do” before any bill on the topic is ready for action. 
“We are probably going to have to have to have a conversation at some point related to whether we can meet our goals for 2030,” Michlewitz said Monday. “I think that’s a real challenge that we’re facing, particularly when you have a federal government that is trying to thwart us at every possible turn in relation to trying to get to those goals. Having that conversation is certainly coming to a head at some point, but I do not think it will be in this vehicle as we move forward.”  
The retreat delays any action on Healey’s energy affordability until 2026.",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_6282-edited-scaled.jpeg?fit=1024%2C767&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-11-20 14:57:45.761185

This is the fourth large data center planned for Mississippi, with a combined $29 billion in investments. There are already two Amazon data centers being built in Madison County.  
With the current artificial-intelligence boom, companies are building data centers across the country. Many are being built in the Deep South because of its abundant land and water resources, less environmental regulations and relatively cheap energy for the power-hungry centers.
The center planned for Warren County will create at least 200 full-time jobs according to a statement from Amazon and Gov. Tate Reeves’ office. Reeves said it would be the largest private investment in Warren County’s history. Construction is expected to start in 2026.
Amazon also announced it would commit $150,000 to a new Amazon Warren County Community Program that will provide grants to local organizations.
While data centers promise jobs and tax revenue, critics have pointed out that they create very few jobs relative to the size of the investment and footprint. They have raised concerns over environmental impact, energy consumption and prices for consumers and lack of public transparency about their development or operations.

Its first round of recommendations largely involves what happens after they commit offenses, both minor and violent.
The committee met Tuesday to discuss proposals to send House Speaker Murrell Smith, a Sumter Republican who appointed the six-member panel. Most involve amending bills filed earlier this year that deal with violence and overcrowding at state-run juvenile jails.
The proposed changes to state law would reduce or eliminate time youth spend in detention centers before their case goes to trial, as well as push older, more violent teens into the adult justice system.

The committee took no votes. But committee members and staff will work with leaders at the state Department of Juvenile Justice over the next month to draft the language, Rep. Brandon Cox, the panel’s chairman, told the SC Daily Gazette.
The Goose Creek Republican said he’ll then work Smith’s office to pre-file the bills for the 2026 legislative session that begins in mid-January.
What they’re working on
Proposals include partially walking back South Carolina’s so-called “Raise the Age” law for 16-year-olds accused of violent offenses that carry a possible 30-year sentence and 17-year-olds accused of gun crimes. Instead of starting in the juvenile court system, as required since 2019, those youth would automatically be charged as adults.
Between July 2018 and June 2024, 166 16-year-olds accused of attempted murder and first-degree burglary were referred to the juvenile justice system. Of those, family court judges chose to transfer 58 to the adult system, according to data provided by the state Department of Juvenile Justice.
Following the agency’s advice, the legislative committee also wants to give family and circuit court judges more options when it comes to sentencing teens.
“Right now, we’re kind of stuck in our juvenile system,” the agency’s director, Eden Hendrick, told the legislators.
Youth younger than 18 who are convicted of murder can be sentenced to a juvenile facility for no more than 4½ years. But if they’re tried in Circuit Court as an adult, the sentence is 30 years to life, she said.

“There’s nothing in between that,” Hendrick said. “It doesn’t make any sense.”
“We know that youth are different than adults,” she added. “We should have some other options.”
There are also efforts that do away with, or at least lessen, any jail time for what are known as status offenses, such as skipping school or running away from home.
“Usually, when law enforcement’s called in the middle of the night, they have two options: detention or placing the youth in foster care,” Hendrick said. “And neither one of those are really appropriate.”
On Hendrick’s advice, the to-be-drafted legislation would also remove the possibility of pre-trial detention for juveniles charged with misdemeanors that carry sentences of 30 days or less. Such crimes include minor theft, property damage, and simple assault for a schoolyard fight.
Those are among the most frequent crimes committed by juveniles in the state over the past five years, according to data presented by State Law Enforcement Division Chief Mark Keel. In 2024, they accounted for more than half — 16,264 of the 28,128 offenses — committed by youth younger than 18.
Ideally, Hendrick said, the state would have safe places in each county to hold children until they can get before a judge. But that’s not the case, so she suggested allowing juveniles to stay home, possibly with ankle monitors, as long as they’re not a danger to the community.
The panel also wants to address sentences for children who violate probation.
More than 25K SC teens committed crimes last year. Legislators are looking for solutions.

How teens get guns
Of all the ideas discussed, only one involved guns.
It’s illegal for a teenager younger than 18 to buy or carry a gun under state law. Last year, more than 1,600 teens 17 and under were charged with illegally owning or carrying them. Most of those guns are stolen from locked vehicles, Keel testified.
Gun owners often are unwilling to report theft, either out of embarrassment or not knowing the specifics of their gun, such as the serial number, he told legislators.
The idea of penalizing adult gun owners who leave their vehicle unlocked, resulting in a stolen firearm, came up.
But only freshman Rep. Harriet Holman, R-Ridgeville, appeared willing to go there.
Holman said someone stole her husband’s gun out of his vehicle about six years ago. Because he filed a report, police ultimately located and returned it to him.
“So, if there’s some way that, when people’s firearms are stolen out of their vehicles, that they’ll report it — some incentive to tell them to report these firearms — would be very important,” said the retired Army lieutenant colonel. “That way we could have accountability on how many firearms are even out there loose like that.”
Gun owners are supposed to report theft. The so-called requirement was added to last year’s so-called “constitutional carry” law, which allows adults to carry a handgun — openly or concealed — without a permit. But there’s no penalty for not reporting, making it more of an encouragement.
That law also forbids law enforcement from stopping someone just because they see a gun. That means officers can’t stop a juvenile toting a gun for that alone because there’s no way to tell for certain whether someone’s 18 years old or 16 just by looking at them.
SC juvenile justice changeups add capacity to reduce overcrowding, violence

According to Cox, a U.S. Air Force veteran, South Carolina has a long history of not requiring citizens to report information about the guns they own to the government.
“This seems like a straightforward, common sense issue, but as the committee takes it up … we have to be very careful because of the constitutional implications,” he said.
Holman countered, “I just don’t personally see the harm of reporting something stolen from you.”
“I just think it is being responsible to allow the authorities to know that your weapon is out there and it could be being carried by a youth,” she said.
This is just the first round of legislation the panel plans to champion.
In January, the group will reconvene and attempt to come up with solutions to more complex issues that lead teens down violent paths, Cox said. That would likely include adding or expanding existing grant programs to fund community nonprofits focused on mentoring youth.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/DSC_0905-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-20 14:57:45.761185

Hughes Justice Complex in Trenton. (Photo by Dana DiFilippo/New Jersey Monitor)In a split ruling that has far-reaching implications for child abuse cases, the New Jersey Supreme Court on Thursday barred prosecutors from blaming shaken baby syndrome for children’s unexplained head trauma in criminal and custody cases.
Justice Fabiana Pierre-Louis, in a lengthy majority decision that five other justices joined, said the syndrome has not been generally accepted in the biomechanical community, making expert testimony about it unreliable and inadmissible in court. While child abuse is unquestionably reprehensible, the courts must ensure proceedings are fair to both defendants and their accusers, she wrote.
“Regardless of the severity or viciousness of a crime … only evidence that is sufficiently reliable and has probative value not outweighed by the evidence’s prejudicial effect may be presented to the jurors to inform their consideration of the charges against the accused,” she wrote. “That requirement extends to expert testimony, which must be properly admitted like all evidence.”
Senators propose new limits on lawsuits under NJ data privacy law

Thursday’s decision affirms lower court rulings that had declared shaken baby syndrome “junk science.”
Justice Rachel Wainer Apter penned a fiery and solo 44-page dissent that is sure to fuel the ongoing global debate about shaken baby syndrome, which is also known as abusive head trauma. She warned that “every other state” allows such testimony and “every other court that has considered the question” has upheld it as admissible.
It has been generally accepted in the medical community, Wainer Apter noted, citing endorsements by more than 20 professional medical organizations and a 2018 consensus statement by physicians and pediatric radiologists that the American Academy of Pediatrics backed.
The majority opinion places a handful of biomechanical engineers “on equal footing with the consensus perspective of every major medical society in the world and grants the former a veto over the latter. What’s more, it does so in a case about the admissibility of a medical diagnosis,” she wrote.

She added: “Judicial humility requires us to accept that we are judges, not scientists. Nor are we experts in the scientific method … In this case, recognizing that we are not scientists requires acknowledging that what the majority calls Shaken Baby Syndrome/Abusive Head Trauma (SBS/AHT), and what scientists simply call Abusive Head Trauma (AHT), is generally accepted by those who are.”
Scientific unanimity is not required for testimony to be valid, she added, citing a 1994 California appellate ruling.

In other cases where the New Jersey Supreme Court has deemed evidence scientifically deficient — including voiceprint analysis, claims that rapists share psychological traits, and height deductions based on a person’s shoe size — no major scientific association endorsed those claims, she added.

The courts should allow testimony on shaken baby syndrome and let jurors decide for themselves whether it’s scientifically sound, she wrote.
“Acknowledging a debate and granting a new trial to allow experts to dispute the merits of a particular medical diagnosis is entirely different from prohibiting a trial from taking place at all. The majority has chosen the latter,” she wrote.
 Widespread impact
Defense attorneys celebrated the ruling, saying it gives new grounds for appeal for countless people convicted in cases with no signs of impact, visible injuries, or other evidence of abuse.
A person’s liberty cannot depend on expert evidence that lacks scientific grounding, cross-disciplinary support, or methodological reliability, the New Jersey Office of the Public Defender said.
“The Constitution demands more than speculation dressed in scientific language. It requires reliable, validated, scientific evidence. And that’s what the court said,” said Danica Rue, the office’s executive director of investigations and police accountability. “I would certainly hope that people are able to now seek justice where it was not meted out earlier.”
Attorneys for the state had warned that prohibiting testimony about shaken baby syndrome in criminal cases would represent “a significant setback to public safety” and interfere with state child welfare workers’ ability to remove children from parents and guardians suspected of abuse. About 1,300 cases of shaken baby syndrome are reported in the U.S. every year, according to the National Center on Shaken Baby Syndrome.
Spokespeople for the state Attorney General’s Office, whose attorneys argued the case, declined to comment.
In the two unrelated cases decided by the court Thursday, authorities accused two fathers, Darryl Nieves and Michael Cifelli, of assaulting their children.
Nieves was charged with aggravated assault and endangering the welfare of a child after three incidents over a two-week period in February 2017, when his 11-month-old son became limp and appeared to lose consciousness. Cifelli was similarly charged after his 10-week-old son had to be hospitalized twice in December 2016 and January 2017 for vomiting and seizure-like behavior.
The babies, both born premature, were found to have the “triad of symptoms” typically associated with shaken baby syndrome — subdural hematomas, retinal hemorrhages, and encephalopathy, according to the ruling. But prosecutors in both cases couldn’t otherwise show the fathers assaulted the infants. The same Middlesex County pediatrician, Dr. Gladibel Medina, attributed both infants’ injuries to shaken baby syndrome.
The public defender’s office represented Nieves, who was barred from seeing his child for years while his prosecution and the appeals unfolded, Rue said.
“The impact that this decision will have on families in the state of New Jersey really cannot be overstated,” she said. “There are hundreds of people, perhaps more, who have been separated from their children, who have been criminally prosecuted and received felony convictions for this. There are people sitting in prison right now who have been convicted under this now debunked theory. So this is a tremendously important decision.”
The court’s majority said prosecutors should continue working to hold child abusers accountable — but must do so by showing physical evidence of trauma or other evidence of abuse.
Shaken baby syndrome could be considered in child abuse cases again someday “if new, reliable, scientific evidence is developed,” Pierre-Louis wrote.
“Science is constantly evolving, so the door is not forever closed on making such a showing of reliability,” she wrote.

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)A Utah lawmaker wants to codify higher standards for mental health and substance abuse treatment in prison after two audits found the state failed to properly monitor, medicate and treat many with severe mental illness. 
“I think everyone’s in agreement that we can do better,” Rep. Steve Eliason said Wednesday. 
 

 Suicide prevention resources

If you or someone you know is experiencing suicidal thoughts or is in distress, call or text 988 to speak to crisis counselors 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year. 
More information and ways to connect are available at 988.utah.gov and 988lifeline.org. Counselors through the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline can help with mental health struggles, emotional distress, alcohol or drug use concerns, or if you just need someone to talk to.
There is no wrong reason to call.



Eliason, R-Sandy, said the prison already has to meet a general standard for medical care set by the National Commission on Correctional Health Care. Now he wants it to hit higher thresholds from the same group that are specific to treatment. 
The pair of wide-ranging legislative audits found inmates who were deemed “acutely suicidal” weren’t constantly monitored in 2024 and 2025. Some managed to harm themselves and one person died in a suicide, auditors said.  
With help from an outside expert, psychiatrist Daniel Inouye, they also found examples of inmates getting the wrong drugs for their conditions, waiting months for an appointment, or being told to submit a request for care even though they were “out of touch with reality.” 
In response, the state Department of Corrections and the Division of Correctional Health Services said they’re putting together new policies, training and ways to review care, with plans to have some changes in place by next July and others by January 2027.   
Eliason said a majority of states contract with outside agencies for behavioral health services in prison, “which intuitively makes a lot of sense, because a lot of can be provided virtually, and they can rotate through different settings so they don’t maybe experience this high rate of burnout.”
His proposal is part of a bigger measure that would also help the state tap into more federal funding for certain prison health care and allow it to order treatment as a condition of parole, among other changes.
The bill would help cut down on repeat offenses and the need for more prison beds by helping to treat patients’ underlying issues, Eliason told lawmakers on the Health and Human Services Committee. 
The panel voted unanimously Wednesday to advance the bill to the full House for consideration during the 2026 Legislature, which convenes in January. 
“We know that it’s not a silver bullet,” said Rep. Jennifer Dailey-Provost, D-Salt Lake City. “But we’re definitely, I think, moving in the right direction.”
Audit: ‘Inmates are often abandoned’ by mental health care system in the Utah State Prison

The auditors focused on the Utah State Correctional Facility in Salt Lake City, which has designated housing for inmates with significant mental health needs. They said problems stemmed from a staffing shortage and a period of more than a year without a full-time psychiatrist, a delay the Division of Correctional Health Services attributed to challenges offering a competitive salary.
The prison now has a psychiatrist working 32 hours per week and making $134 per hour, along with two psychiatry fellows from the University of Utah assisting eight hours per week, said Josh Loftin, a spokesperson for the division.
The division asked lawmakers for a boost in funding last year but didn’t get it, Loftin said. It’s now finding ways to stretch its budget and be more efficient instead of requesting more.
The Department of Corrections’ former Draper location and current Gunnison site were already accredited by the National Commission on Correctional Health Care when it comes to general health care, which includes mental health standards, Loftin said. But none of its sites have received stepped-up accreditations specific to mental health and substance abuse. 
The Salt Lake prison isn’t accredited right now because it had to reapply after moving from Draper in 2022. It is scheduled to be evaluated as part of the process next month, the soonest slot available because of pandemic delays, Loftin said.

Republican Sen. Thom Tillis had recently said he was blocking a committee vote on the four Mississippi nominations over negotiations with Sen. Roger Wicker of Mississippi on the Lumbee people being officially recognized as a Native American tribe. Wicker is chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, which has sway over legislation in which proponents wanted the Lumbee recognized.
The Judiciary Committee on Thursday approved Trump’s nominations of Robert Chamberlin and James Maxwell, both justices on the Mississippi Supreme Court, to vacant federal judgeships in northern Mississippi. The committee also voted to advance Scott Leary and Baxter Kruger, Trump’s choices for U.S. attorney for the Northern and Southern districts of Mississippi, respectively.

The nominations now advance to the full Senate.
The Lumbee is a group of indigenous people in North Carolina that has been seeking federal recognition as a tribe for over a century. But other federally recognized tribes have opposed this effort.
Language granting federal recognition of the tribe had been added to the House version of the Pentagon’s annual spending bill, but was not included in the Senate’s version, which Wicker oversees.
Earlier this month, the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs held a hearing on the Lumbee Fairness Act, legislation now being pushed by Tillis and other North Carolina lawmakers. President Trump has also endorsed recognition of the Lumbee as a tribe.
In a recent press release Tillis said: “This issue has come before Congress many times over the decades, but never with this level of unity and support. These days, it’s rare to see Republicans and Democrats come together on anything. But when it comes to Lumbee recognition, the support is overwhelming and it’s bipartisan. We’re talking about support from President Donald J. Trump, President Biden, Vice President J.D. Vance, former Vice President Kamala Harris, Governor Josh Stein, the North Carolina General Assembly and nearly every member of our state’s congressional delegation. Here in the Senate, nearly two dozen members from both parties have co-sponsored the Lumbee Fairness Act…”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/11144848/AP25197697979549.jpg,,,2025-11-20 14:57:45.761185

When a patient with dementia arrives at the hospital, the clinical priority is addressing the medical issue that brought them there. But for many, the experience of hospitalization can intensify confusion, anxiety, or agitation. At Beebe Healthcare, a new initiative is providing an unexpected source of comfort: baby dolls.
Beebe’s Doll Therapy Program, launched in January 2025, places realistic baby dolls into the arms of patients diagnosed with memory loss. Each patient receives a doll along with clothing, a blanket, and a bottle, all of which they are encouraged to keep after discharge. The dolls serve as a non-pharmacologic, person-centered intervention for dementia-related behaviors, and this has already shown strong and measurable results.
“The dolls provide patients with a sense of purpose and comfort. They feel like they need to take care of it, which shifts their thinking,” said Logan Jarrell, BSN, RN, NICHE (Nurses Improving Care for Healthsystems Elders) Coordinator at Beebe.
RELATED STORY: Senior Care: What Adult Caregivers Need to Know
For Jarrell, the program grows out of both research and personal experience. Before becoming NICHE coordinator, she worked as a bedside nurse and saw daily the gaps in diversional activities for older adults.
“I was working as a bedside nurse prior to this. My passion has always been the elderly. I saw first-hand how frustrating it was that we did not have diversional activities available on the unit,” Jarrell said. “So when a patient does start acting out or even just gets bored, we didn’t have anything to give them. We had volunteers going around with an activity card but they’re only there certain hours of day. This made things very difficult.”
Her inspiration for the idea goes back to her earliest experiences in care settings.
“I remembered back in nursery school, especially when we went to skilled nursing facilities that had memory care units, you would see a lot of older adults with baby dolls and stuffed animals and I thought it would be interesting if we could get that in a hospital,” she said.
Building the Program

The doll therapy initiative grew out of another project Jarrell launched six months earlier: Therapeutic Activity Kits. These kits, designed for dementia patients across Beebe, contain diversional activities and detailed instructions staff can use when patients show signs of distress or restlessness. While researching additional tools for the kits, Jarrell revisited doll therapy—an approach supported by evidence showing that dolls can reduce anxiety and provide a meaningful focus for people with dementia.
“In January 2025, I initiated the Doll Therapy Program at Beebe Healthcare as an extension of the Therapeutic Activity Kits initiative I began six months earlier,” she said. “The Therapeutic Activity Kits were developed to provide readily available diversional activities for dementia patients on the nursing units, ensuring staff had accessible tools and an accompanying instruction guide to identify appropriate activities for various situations.”
Jarrell said she recalled how dementia patients in care facilities responded positively to doll therapy during her nursing school clinical rotations, and wondered how it might work in an acute-care hospital setting.
Beebe partnered with Angie’s Purpose and received donor support through the Beebe Medical Foundation to launch the program. But getting it off the ground required navigating logistical hurdles.
“Implementing the program presented several challenges, including securing staff buy-in, identifying appropriate storage for the dolls, developing educational materials, and determining the best methods to adapt this intervention to an acute care hospital setting, where evidence and research are limited,” Jarrell said.
Still, she said, “the program has laid important groundwork for enhancing person-centered dementia care within the hospital environment.”
90 Patients, 89 Safety Successes
Since January 2025, the program has tracked 90 patients who received dolls. According to Jarrell, the impact has been striking.
“We’ve seen fantastic results since implementing this,” she said. “We started the program in January 2025 and to date we’ve had 85 patients throughout the whole hospital who have been given the dolls. Out of those patients, all but one did not have a physical workplace violent event, wasn’t placed in restraints, or didn’t have a fall for the rest of their hospitalization.”
A later update increased the number to 90 patients, with 89 remaining “incidence-free” after receiving a doll.
These numbers matter, Jarrell noted, because they speak directly to safety and patient well-being—two of the biggest challenges in caring for individuals with dementia in hospitals. She added that the program has also impacted internal culture.
“The program has also helped reshape the nurses’ way of thinking,” she said. “In the past, people felt it was easier to medicate the patient when you can actually just give them something to do.”
A Wider Educational Mission
Although Jarrell is the only NICHE coordinator, she has worked to ensure the program is accessible to all staff, regardless of department or shift.
She works very closely with case management team so they all have access to this resource guide that she’s created. “All Beebe employees have access to that: nurse managers, community health workers,” she said. “Although there is only one of me, I make these resources readily available so that when I’m not there, it can be utilized.”
Beebe’s intranet now houses more than 100 resources for senior care. Jarrell brings these materials to outpatient sites, health fairs, and community events, and said she is working toward a public version so families can access the information at home.
She said NICHE’s structure makes education a core component.
“NICHE is also an education program, so I have certified geriatric nurses throughout the hospital who are very well-aware of the resources so they know to advocate for these resources and diversional activities,” she said. “I also try to go to as many staff meetings as I can to educate. I try to get out there as much as I can and talk to as many people as possible to spread awareness.”
Challenges Seniors Face
Jarrell said one of the biggest barriers families encounter is acknowledging when a loved one needs help.
“A lot of people I work with struggle to admit they need help because they feel like it’s a sign of weakness when it’s really not,” she said.
She added that people don’t always know where to start or what resources exist. Patients entering the hospital are often dealing with an acute medical issue, not thinking about longer-term planning.
“That’s why I really try to harp on pre-planning,” she said, describing situations in which caregiving arrangements can change unexpectedly. Her goal is to make sure seniors and caregivers know what support is available before a crisis happens.
Family Response: “Overwhelmingly Positive”
For Jarrell, feedback is an essential part of the program. Staff record each use of doll therapy—what behaviors were present before, how the patient responded, and any additional observations. Jarrell also conducts rounds to witness the effects firsthand.
Families often witness the interventions and frequently share their perspectives.
“Families are often present and consistently share positive feedback,” she said. “Many express appreciation that the dolls are not solely for hospital use—the dolls are gifted to patients to keep after discharge, which helps maintain continuity of comfort and familiarity at home or in long-term care settings.”
All feedback is collected in a database, reviewed monthly, and shared with leadership teams.
“The ongoing feedback loop has been instrumental in refining the program and reinforcing staff engagement through visible, meaningful outcomes,” she said.
A Regional Ripple Effect
Beebe’s program is already inspiring others.
“Two of our post-acute facilities (Excelcare & Ocean Grove) have now signed on with the same doll therapy program,” Jarrell said. “One of them is even making a nursery for the baby dolls in their memory care unit.”
Christiana Hospital has expressed interest as well, and Bayhealth has reached out about learning from Beebe’s outcomes.
“It is incredibly rewarding to see this initiative extend its influence beyond our hospital walls,” she said. “Knowing that the program will soon bring comfort and meaningful engagement to residents across Sussex County reinforces the broader value of non-pharmacological, person-centered dementia care.”
Technology and Future Tools
While doll therapy may seem simple, Jarrell said technology could also play an expanding role in diversional activities.
“I do think AI and technology have the ability to help with this,” she said, noting that activity kits include a range of items families can purchase for loved ones—including tech-based tools.
“There are also projectors that project all kinds of different games on to the patient’s bedside table or wall or ceiling and they mimic the patient’s movements,” she said. “What’s great about this is you can use it over and over again.”
Beebe is also exploring dementia education simulations for nursing staff and interactive light-technology programs that promote cognitive stimulation and social interaction.
Looking Ahead
Jarrell hopes the next year brings continued growth—both in patient outcomes and community partnerships.
“Looking ahead, I hope to see Angie’s Purpose and the Doll Therapy Program implemented at Bayhealth and Christiana Care,” she said. She also wants more families to understand how meaningful diversional activities can be at home.
“Ultimately, my goal is to see our program numbers, patient outcomes, and staff and family feedback continue to grow positively, reflecting the sustained value and transformative impact of non-pharmacologic, person-centered dementia care.”",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/img_4202.jpg.webp,,,2025-11-20 14:57:45.761185

(Getty Images)DES MOINES — Two alleged whistleblowers are suing Farm Bureau Property & Casualty Insurance Co. and its affiliates for alleged racketeering, wrongful termination and concealment of information from state regulators.
The lawsuit alleges Farm Bureau officials repeatedly concealed from regulators in Iowa and other states instances of fraudulent activity committed by company agents or employees. The defendants’ conduct in the matter amounts to racketeering, obstruction of justice, and mail fraud or wire fraud, the lawsuit claims.
The lawsuit was filed by James Newton and Brent Meskimen, former police officers who later became special investigators for Farm Bureau. They are suing Farm Bureau Property & Casualty Insurance Co., FBL Financial Group, Farm Bureau Financial Services, and the West Des Moines law firm of Wickham & Geadelmann in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Iowa. Also named as defendants in the case are several Farm Bureau executives and attorneys.
The lawsuit claims Farm Bureau officials “engaged in a scheme to defraud insurance policyholders, insurance and other governmental regulatory authorities, and other participants in the insurance industry who are complying with their mandatory duty of reporting fraud and other fraudulent or other illegal acts.”
It also claims the defendants violated Iowa’s law on the wrongful discharge of employees in violation of public policy. That law prohibits the termination of employees for refusing to participate in illegal conduct or for acting as whistleblowers by reporting or objecting to illegal conduct.
The defendants in the case have yet to file a response to the lawsuit. Calls to Farm Bureau, Farm Bureau Financial Services and the law firm of Wickham & Geadelmann were not immediately returned Wednesday.
Break-in at policyholder’s residence
The lawsuit claims that as far back as 2011, Farm Bureau officials failed to report to state regulators evidence of fraudulent activity within the company, but the “straw that broke the camel’s back” was an insurance adjuster’s alleged break-in on a policyholder’s property.
According to the lawsuit, a residential fire occurred at the policyholder’s Nebraska residence on May 5, 2023, and the policyholder immediately filed a claim for losses.
In the course of investigating the claim, Farm Bureau’s Special Investigation Unit learned that an adjuster working for the company had used a credit card to pick the lock of the policyholder’s garage near the scene of the fire to determine whether it contained items the insured claimed as being lost in the fire, the lawsuit alleges.
Newton and Meskimen allegedly met with Farm Bureau’s general counsel, Wickham, and advised him Farm Bureau had an obligation to inform the policyholder of the illegal access to their garage.
According to the lawsuit, the company’s assistant general counsel, Karl Olson, “eventually agreed” to allow Meskimen and Newton to meet with the policyholder and inform them of the illegal garage entry by the adjuster, but barred Meskimen and Newton from disclosing that two third-party vendors hired to investigate the claim had also been inside the garage.
The lawsuit claims Olson and Property Casualty Claims Vice President Anthony Kimmi then agreed that all “poisonous” documentation pertaining to the illegal entry, including photographs, should be placed in a separate file using a canceled insurance policy associated with a Minnesota policyholder who had no association at all with Nebraska fire.
After the new file was created for information about the garage, efforts were made to “lock down” the file to ensure limited access to its contents, and Kimmi directed the staff to suppress all printout capabilities from the file, the lawsuit alleges.
On June 9, 2023, Newton and Meskimen allegedly met with Wickham, the general counsel, at the Farm Bureau home office in West Des Moines and reported that they “could no longer in good conscience be associated with this file,” the lawsuit claims, telling Wickham “it was wrong ethically and that it violated state statutes, claims best practices, Farm Bureau core values, doing what’s right, and that it could very well be criminal and could potentially violate privacy rights.”
According to the lawsuit, Wickham responded by saying he’d speak to Farm Bureau leadership “to make sure this never happens again,” to which Meskimen allegedly said the directive to create the file “came straight from General Counsel Wickham’s own assistant general counsel, Olson.”
After Newton, Meskimen and the Special Investigations Unit concluded fraud had been committed by the company, the findings were allegedly relayed to Paul Swinton, a vice president and assistant general counsel of property and casualty at FBL Financial Group, according to the lawsuit.
The lawsuit claims Swinton refused to forward “the significant majority of the findings” to regulators in Iowa and Nebraska for their review and investigation, despite mandatory-reporting requirements.
Lawsuit: State regulators kept in the dark
According to the lawsuit, the 2023 incident was not the first time Swinton and Newton clashed over information that wasn’t being shared with state regulators.
“Newton and Meskimen were often and continually directed not to make mandatory referrals to the appropriate Departments of Insurance for review and investigation by the appropriate insurance regulators in states where FBL Financial Group was operating and conducting business, including Kansas, Iowa, Nebraska, Utah, Arizona and New Mexico,” the lawsuit alleges.
Among the alleged examples cited in the lawsuit:

Forged signatures: In the spring of 2023, a Farm Bureau agent in Kansas admitted he had forged the signatures of approximately 50 of his policyholders, without their permission, over a period of three to four years, and that the forms contained false and misleading information to support of the clients’ insurance policy applications. Farm Bureau “refused to allow Newton and/or Meskimen to submit this admitted fraudulent conduct to the Kansas Department of Insurance,” the lawsuit alleges, despite a state law requiring such reporting.


Two fired agents: In 2022, Swinton refused to share information with regulators about two fired Farm Bureau agents. In one of the two cases, a Kansas agent admitted to having forged at least 900 various documents with clients’ signatures, allegedly with the clients’ consent, and another 100 documents without the clients’ consent. Swinton allegedly refused to share information with regulators about the two firings. The lawsuit claims that after Newton wrote in an annual report that he had concerns with such matters going unreported, Wickham “was furious” and instructed him to never put anything in writing like that again.


Fraudulent claim: In 2023, after a Farm Bureau agent was fired for filing a fraudulent claim on his own home in Utah, Swinton or others within the company refused to allow Newton and Meskimen to submit information on the agent’s conduct to the Utah Department of Insurance, despite a state law requiring such a referral.


Father’s altered policy: In 2018, the company’s Special Investigations Unit determined an Iowa agent had altered a customer’s policy after a fire so that the policy included a Ford Mustang that was consumed in the blaze. The customer was the agent’s father and a retired Farm Bureau agent. The lawsuit claims Swinton barred the unit from referring the incident to the Iowa Department of Insurance.

Newton and Meskimen are fired
The lawsuit alleges that while the unreported instances of fraudulent activity date back to 2011, it was the May 2023 garage break-in that “the tipping point for Newton and Meskimen.”
The lawsuit alleges that on Aug. 30, 2023, Newton had an in-person meeting with Wickham and insisted the information related to that case needed to be referred to the Nebraska Department of Insurance. “Wickham responded by telling Newton that if he made that referral his career would be over,” the lawsuit claims.
On Nov. 9, 2023, Newton and Meskimen allegedly met with Karen Rieck, the vice president of human resources for Farm Bureau Financial Services, and voiced their concerns about the lack of referrals to state regulators.
A week later, Newton received a phone call from Wickham and Rieck, in which Wickham said Newton had “essentially resigned” by refusing to report directly to Swinton. The lawsuit alleges Newton indicated he had no problem reporting to Swinton but that if Swinton was not going to make the mandatory referrals related to fraud, he would do so himself.
“As a result, Newton was fired,” the lawsuit claims. Meskimen was allegedly fired five days later after telling his superiors that he, too, would make such referrals if they were required by law.
The lawsuit claims that shortly before the two men were fired they each were given positive performance reviews, with Newton described by his superiors as “one of the most well-respected employees in the organization” and Meskimen described as a trusted leader whose “integrity is beyond reproach.”
In addition to Swinton, Olson, Kimmi and Wickham, the named defendants in the lawsuit include Daniel Pitcher, chief executive officer of FBL Financial Group and Farm Bureau Financial Services, and Ronald Mead Jr., the chief operating officer for property casualty of FBL Financial Group and Farm Bureau Financial Services.

(Photo courtesy of Central College)Central College is using a more than $700,000 donation from the Fred Maytag Family Foundation for facility renovations and new offerings aimed at supporting students and bringing campus and community closer together.
The Pella private university announced this week in a news release it received a $720,000 gift from the foundation this summer. Hilary Rowe, Central College director of marketing and communications, said in an email $50,000 has gone to the Journey Scholarship Fund, with the rest funding renovations to the building sharing the foundation’s namesake — the Maytag Student Center.
Rowe said in her email the foundation has supported Central for nearly a century, funding a full tuition scholarship and other financial aid, STEM initiatives and and other capital projects.

“Central has a very special relationship with the Maytag family,” Central College President Mark Putnam said in the release. “They still feel a strong sense of connection to Iowa and Central. Ken and Fritz Maytag have been committed to this building. Their values align closely with ours — with what Central wants to achieve in the world and who we are in the world.”
Much of the renovation work funded by the donation has already been completed, Rowe said in her email, with new amenities now available for students. The Maytag Student Center now houses the Maytag Marketplace, which includes a redesigned food and convenience store, the university’s Spirit Shoppe, temporary vendor spaces and areas for “public engagement.”
Putnam said in the release new technology will be added to certain rooms in the student center in the future through the donation, and lounge spaces will receive new finishes, seating and carpeting.
Iwan Williams, Central College executive director of retail management, said in the release the university used a student survey to learn what they would buy from a campus store if one was available, and from those responses, a “convenience store model” was developed. Now students can buy hot food, various beverages and more from the space in addition to grab-and-go food.
The marketplace’s new “pop-up vendor window” brings in local businesses to sell wares on campus, Williams said in the release, and has already seen success from Top Shelf Nutrition, which recently utilized the space.
As the marketplace is open to the public, Williams said in the release he expects groups like summer camps held on campus, as well as members of the community, to benefit from it. The space also fits into the college’s “Imagine More: It’s Central to Pella” initiative, which seeks to bring campus and community closer together through strategic partnerships and projects, both off and on campus.
“We’re drawing in local and specialty businesses that appeal to students and employees,” Williams said in the release. “It’s a manifestation of the Imagine More concept created here in the Maytag Marketplace. What we see right now is just the beginning.”

(Jordan Hansen / Daily Montanan)Montana’s 2025 fire season is expected to be pricey — between $50 and $70 million — driven largely by a complicated wildfire near Drummond earlier this year that’ll likely come out to be the most expensive suppression effort in state history.
A state Department of Natural Resources and Conservation official said during the Oct. 23 Environmental Quality Council meeting that 2,303 fires burned 75,000 acres in Montana this year. 
This was one of the lowest acreages burned in state history, which Gov. Greg Gianforte has repeatedly pointed to and praised DNRC for its work. 
DNRC’s fire management manual says that under state law, the department is required to perform aggressive initial attack on all fires and keep them “as small as possible.”
“Under Montana Code Annotated 76-13-104, the DNRC has the responsibility to protect land, property and natural resources within the state,” the agency said to the Daily Montanan. “The department places the utmost importance on the lives of firefighters and the public and will not intentionally jeopardize safety in pursuit of fire suppression responsibilities.”
The steep costs of the fire season coupled with the sparse acres that burned have raised questions about the state’s approach to wildfires. The Gianforte Administration has focused on suppression, calling their methods, “a model of proactive planning and decisive action.” Legislators are drilling down on wildfire as part of a state study on suppression, as new research shows forests might not actually be as dense as once thought, directly contradicting a large swath of American fire policy.
The huge cost and relatively low acreage was discussed during a meeting of the Environmental Quality Council last month, as the state is studying fire suppression costs.
Fire mitigation, the practice of reducing risk of catastrophic wildfires, is one way state and federal legislators are looking at trying to solve the problem.
But some mitigation practices — including logging, thinning and prescribed fires — are controversial to some environmentalists and there is vast disagreement within those circles about what, if anything, should be done to the nation’s forests.
Legislators heard testimony on suppression efforts and smoke impacts of prescribed burns during the meeting, which comes under the backdrop of massive federal changes surrounding wildfires.
The Fix Our Forest Act, recently proposed federal legislation from Montana U.S. Sen. Tim Sheehy, has been a touchpoint for some environmental groups, saying that so-called thinning operations, a tool fire managers use to reduce fuel loads in forests, is opening the door to major logging projects in national forests. Sheehy himself is connected to the wildfire fighting industry, having founded Bridger Aerospace, an aerial firefighting company.
Those same environmental groups, as well as a California author and research ecologist studying the issue, also say the way prescribed burns and thinning operations are being conducted does not follow historical wildfire patterns, saying specifically that the idea that huge swathes of the country’s forests are too dense is fundamentally incorrect.
The state and federal government work closely together on wildfires, as about 30% of Montana’s land is federally owned. This also complicates who pays for what, as Montana receives reimbursements for wildfire expenditures, but it does not cover the whole bill.
Legislators passed a slew of wildfire-related bills during the last session, including House Bill 70, a study into state fire suppression, which is driving conversations on the topic and is expected to be picked back up again in January.
“It’s really difficult to totally criticize,” Sen. Willis Curdy, D-Missoula, vice-chair of EQC told the Daily Montanan of the effort on Windy Rock. “But on the other hand I think some serious questions need to be asked.” 
Gov. Greg Gianforte receives a brief from fire officials at the Windy Rock fire near Drummond, Montana, on Monday, Aug. 25, 2025.
‘A policy of aggressive attack’
The most expensive wildfire this season, the Windy Rock Fire, located about 17 miles from Drummond, still had people assigned to it in October, after being initially reported in late August.
The total cost to suppress the fire was about $56 million, though a DNRC spokesperson told the Daily Montanan that number is subject to change. The fire started on August 14 and burned 6,175 acres.
“It’s really important to note that the figure we provide may change and does not include the (Fire Management Assistance Grants). Finalized numbers for fire costs and FMAGs can take months and sometimes even years,” DNRC spokesperson Moria Davin wrote in an email.
The grants come from the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which has been in chaos since President Donald Trump returned to the White House. 
Likely, though, it’ll be among the most expensive suppression efforts in state history. Montana’s 10-year annual average for firefighting costs is about $30 million, said Wyatt Frampton, a DNRC official addressing the committee. There are no solid numbers yet on actual expenses, which also makes this year an outlier, Frampton said.
“Given prolonged staffing that we had into October and some ongoing significant expenses associated with special activities, we don’t have a firm resolution for you yet on those final estimates for fire season cost,” Frampton told the committee.
The Windy Rock Fire originated on Bureau of Land Management land and the state responded with its county assist team. Montana and the BLM have an agreement over fire “offset” protection in that area, Frampton explained.
“There are exchanges of protection,” Frampton told the committee. “There’s areas where the Forest Service protects Forest Service or BLM protects private property, and likewise, the state will protect federal lands to try to have a net balance between the agencies.”
The fire also became complicated almost immediately and it burned in rocky and steep terrain, which complicated efforts. It threatened about 175 residences as well, Frampton said. And beyond that, there were other problems, too.
“Dead and down fuels from a past Mountain Pine Beetle outbreak pose additional challenges,” an Aug. 16 press release from the fire states. “The Windy Rock Fire is located near a Wilderness Study Area and a Backcountry Conservation Area, requiring fire operations to take special considerations for these landscapes.”
The fire became something of a spectacle, in part drawing massive air tankers to Helena Regional Airport that performed sorties on the fire for a week in late August. Firefighters on a Sanders County fire noted getting air resources as “challenging” due to “escalating demands” in the region on Aug. 22.
When incidents get larger or more complicated than local or state resources can handle, special teams are called — in this case, Northwest Team 2.
The day they took command from the state, Aug. 25, Gov. Greg Gianforte visited and toured the fire’s command post saying that day, “we’ve pursued a policy of aggressive attack on all fires.”
And the state did — per reporting by Substack and podcast, The Hotshot Wakeup on Aug. 25, the amount of fire retardant Montana used increased from 400,000 gallons to more than 1 million gallons in a week around the time those tankers were operating out of Helena.
Beyond the cost, many environmental groups have serious concerns with fire retardant, which contains high levels of toxic metals. The effectiveness of aerial attack on a fire is greatly debated and aircraft are not effective and often grounded in windy conditions.
Former legislator Jim Keane, a member of the Environmental Quality Council, asked questions to state staff regarding the cost of aerial attack versus ground efforts. 
“There has to be an astronomical amount of aviation assets that went into this fire year on a minimum amount of acres,” Keane said during the meeting.
The Trump Administration has pushed for more money and equipment for firefighters, with some focus on aerial firefighting. In fact, Sen. Sheehy was a cosponsor on bipartisan legislation earlier this year that made it easier for private contractors to acquire airplane parts for the nation’s firefighting fleet.
This fire season is expected to be the most expensive in U.S. history, though stats available through the National Interagency Fire Center, which tracks fire acreage and cost, are not adjusted for inflation, the agency has previously told the Daily Montanan.
But it’s a flawed assumption that fires can be put out, said Chad Hanson, a research ecologist, an author and the co-founder of the John Muir project, calling into question the amount state and federal governments spend on suppression.
He went on to say that studies by the U.S. Forest Service regarding forest density are flawed, saying money currently being spent on suppression and many fire mitigation practices would be better spent on hardening homes against fire.
“Pretty much everything that we’ve been told about fire in our forests is incorrect, scientifically,” Hanson said. “And it’s not just some loose theory.”

‘A wink and a nod’
Hanson and several fellow researchers have authored studies in response to research from the U.S. Forest Service regarding density in forests.
The density question is fundamentally a disagreement over forestry practices. The general idea among those in support of logging and thinning to reduce fire risk is that suppression practices on wildfires in the United States have led to forests that are too dense. They say there used to be many small intensity fires in the nation’s forests and that thinning and prescribed burns will replicate this natural process.
It’s a focus of a Sen. Sheehy bill — the Fix Our Forest Act — currently moving through Congress. The bill would also make it easier for land management agencies to conduct thinning and prescribed burn operations. In practice, prescribed burns often cut down small trees and brush, which is known as mechanical thinning, which are then put into small piles and burned. 
And Hanson says that the assumption all American forests had frequent, low-intensity fires is fundamentally incorrect and that federal research left out information contrary to that.
“They omitted and didn’t mention massive amounts of data that showed that historical forests were really variable,” Hanson said. “There were open forests, for sure, but there were also a lot of really, really dense forests, a lot of forests in between. This really simplistic notion that the forests were all open and park-like at low density, is not even remotely accurate based on the science and that’s not a contested notion.”
That’s not to say Hanson is against prescribed burns — there’s places where it could help, he said — but he does think the forests are closer to their natural density than some federal studies would suggest. Hanson and other researchers, including William L. Baker, a University of Wyoming professor, wrote a peer-reviewed review of a federal study called “Evidence for widespread changes in the structure, composition, and fire regimes of western North American forests.”
The Baker paper found most evidence was omitted in the federal study was information that, “does not support their low-severity model, including 10 published rebuttals of their papers.”
The federal study included logging interests, the Missoula Fire Science Laboratory and Environmental and Forestry Departments from major state schools across the west, including the University of Washington, UC Berkeley, Northern Arizona, Penn State, Utah State, Oregon State, and Arizona. It also included the Nature Conservancy, as well as various state and federal land management agencies.
Many of those researchers get money from the U.S. Forest Service, Hanson said, which has priorities of its own.
“Under Federal laws, the Forest Service can sell trees on public lands to private logging companies and keep most of the revenue generated from those timber sales for its own budget, using the money to pay staff and buy new equipment,” Hanson writes in his 2021 book, Smokescreen. “This creates a powerful perverse financial incentive for Forest Service staff to ignore wildlife and recreational impacts and emphasize industrial logging.”
It’s important to note, Hanson said, that the Forest Service is in charge of managing the nation’s forests, not necessarily protecting trees.
“We’ll do all these logging operations, we’ll call it thinning and fuel reduction, with a wink and a nod, and it will tell communities it’ll stop the fire from reaching the towns,” Hanson said. “And that is a dangerous lie, because that’s not what’s happening. The fires are blowing right through those thin areas.”
It’s the same logic the Fix Our Forest Act is based on, Hanson said, which is why it’s drawn criticism from some environmental groups like the Alliance for the Wild Rockies and EarthJustice.
“Prescribed fire doing preventing stand replacement fire is immediate massive loss of wildlife habitat,” said Sara Johnson, an environmental advocate who founded Native Ecosystems Council. “It prevents stand replacement fire, which is a huge benefit to wildlife.”
‘Active forest management’
In 2020, the Montana Forest Action Plan, a report commissioned under then-Governor Steve Bullock found 3.8 million acres of Montana’s forests “in greatest need of attention” 
U.S. Forest Service Chief Tom Schultz, who spent 14 years with the Montana Department of Natural Resources and Conservation, has said the nation’s forests are in trouble because they’re not being logged enough — and Gianforte, the state’s current Governor, is a noted supporter of the logging industry as well.
“Montana’s forest products industry has an important and necessary role in achieving landscape-scale forest restoration and management across the state,” the report states.
Less than 100,000 acres per year were being treated in Montana in 2020, according to the report. That number appears to have increased — earlier this year, the Forest Service said they conducted hazardous fuels reduction work on 200,000 acres of Montana forest in 2024. The BLM conducted approximately 38,000 acres of prescribed burns last year.
“Active forest management, such as mechanical thinning and prescribed fire, is one of the most important tools to reduce the risk and severity of wildfire alongside a robust community preparedness strategy,” the report reads. “This approach is especially important in the low-elevation fuel types where past fire suppression has had the greatest impact in terms of in- creased fuel loading.”
A separate 2020 report commissioned by the DNRC found that 85% of the state’s forests are at an increased risk of wildfire. According to the agency, historical Montana fires  were characterized by frequent, low-intensity fire that mostly burned surface fuels without killing mature trees. 
This also occasionally included moderate or higher severity fire, agency spokesperson Anna Lau wrote in an email. Lau went on to say that the state’s low- to mid-elevation forests, which are mostly ponderosa pine and Douglas fir, fires would typically occur every 5 to 30 years. That maintained open forest structures and created variability in the forest, Lau wrote.
“It’s important to recognize that high-intensity, stand-replacing fires play a natural and necessary role in certain ecosystems particularly at higher elevations, such as subalpine fir and lodgepole pine forests,” Lau wrote. “These forests have evolved with infrequent but severe fires that reset ecological succession.”
The DNRC does prescribed burns as well and the Montana Department of Environmental Quality has a call every day in the fall with the U.S. Forest Service to discuss the day’s burn requests.
Smoke from prescribed burns is a concern and EQC members heard from one woman who described significant smoke impacts. Logging has no smoke impacts, which EQC chair Rep. Paul Fielder, R-Thompson Falls, brought up.
“There’s different options for managing forests,” Fielder said. “You can do prescribed burns, or you can do thinning and other methods of reducing the fuel loads there. And as long as we just say prescribed burns are the best way to go without looking at other options. I think we’re not considering the health effects of this.”
A 2025 Stanford study showed prescribed burns “can meaningfully reduce smoke emissions,” from wildfires. And the DEQ has multiple factors it considers in those decisions.
“Burn decisions are determined based on how efficiently the smoke is going to exit the community,” DEQ meteorologist Aaron Ofseyer said in a statement. “A critical metric for determining this is the ventilation index. This index is calculated by multiplying the mixing height and the transport wind. The higher the index, the more likely the DEQ is to approve a burn.”
For those deeply involved with the work, like Tim Rochell, a prescribed fire expert with Missoula County, there’s been movement in public perception of the issue. 
“What we’re doing right now is we’re changing a culture like people have been taught to be afraid of fire, as opposed to something that’s a natural part of our landscape,” Rochell said. “And I think we’re slowly starting to change that.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/WindyRock2-1024x678.jpg,,,2025-11-20 13:57:30.106139

Emmer, a Minnesota Republican who serves as one of the top party leaders in the U.S. House, endorsed Siouxland Chamber of Commerce President Chris McGowan in Iowa’s 4th Congressional District and former state legislator Joe Mitchell in the 2nd District.
Both candidates are running in open primary fields for the congressional seats as the current GOP representatives are running for other offices. U.S. Rep. Randy Feenstra, in Iowa’s 4th District, is running for governor and U.S. Rep. Ashley Hinson in the 2nd District is running for U.S. Senate.

McGowan and Mitchell were the top fundraisers in their respective races during the most recent campaign finance reporting period.
While Washington, D.C., party leadership often issues early support for incumbent candidates and criticizes opponents from other parties, endorsements are less common during the primary campaign season. In the 4th District, McGowan is competing against several other well-known GOP candidates, including former House Majority Leader Matt Windschitl, Ryan Rhodes, the founder of the Iowa Tea Party, as well as Christian Schlaefer, a software consultant.
Emmer said in a statement, “Chris McGowan is exactly the kind of battle-tested conservative we need in Congress.”
“As a veteran, business leader, and devoted family man, he embodies the values of faith, family, and freedom that define Iowa’s 4th District,” Emmer said. “Chris will be a strong voice for the America First agenda, a reliable partner in the House Republican Conference, and a leader who will deliver real results for Iowa.”
McGowan thanked Emmer for his support, saying the congressman  “understands what it takes to win tough races and to govern with strength.” If elected, McGowan said he would focus on enacting President Donald Trump’s and Republicans’ policies by “bringing Iowa values of faith, family, freedom, and grit to Washington to fight for the America First agenda.”
Emmer also endorsed Mitchell in the 2nd District, as he runs for the Republican nomination against state Sen. Charlie McClintock, R-Alburnett, and Rep. Shannon Lundgren, R-Peosta. Mitchell, a former regional administrator for the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development in Trump’s administration and the founder of Run Gen Z, a young conservative organization, said Emmer’s endorsement is a “a strong sign of the momentum we’re building.”
Emmer said electing Mitchell in 2026 is a vital part of keeping Republicans in control of Congress.
“If House Republicans are going to stay in the majority and continue delivering for the American people, it is vital we send bold conservative candidates like Joe Mitchell in Congress,” Emmer wrote in a social media post. “Radical Democrats will stop at nothing to return to power and revive Biden’s reckless policies. Iowans can’t let this happen, which is why they’re going to send Joe Mitchell to Washington so we can continue to Make America GREAT again!”
Emmer also traveled to Iowa in October to support U.S. Rep. Mariannette Miller-Meeks at a fundraiser, as she runs for reelection in Iowa’s 1st Congressional District. At the event, he told the crowd Miller-Meeks’ winning in 2026 “means we’re winning everything that you’re fighting for in Iowa” and would be an important step in keeping the GOP majority in the House. Iowa’s 1st District is projected to be one of the most competitive races in the 2026 election, with political forecasters rating the district as a “toss-up.”

Spencer Deery and Dan Dernulc were the latest victims of attempted swattings as early redistricting supporters turn up the heat on opponents and undecided lawmakers. (Photos courtesy Indiana Senate Republicans)As redistricting rhetoric intensifies in Indiana, three Republican lawmakers who oppose the prospect — or are undecided —  have reported attempted swatting attacks on their homes.
“It is disturbing that anyone would attempt to harm or intimidate lawmakers, but sadly not all that surprising in the current environment,” Sen. Spencer Deery, said Thursday, after police “thwarted” an attempt at his West Lafayette residence.
“Swatting” involves hoax calls or reports to emergency services intended to trigger armed responses — and can have lethal consequences for unwitting victims at the swatted location.
Redistricting rift growing among Indiana Republicans

Deery, a vocal opponent of early congressional redistricting, was notified about 8 a.m. Thursday that police dispatch had received a report of domestic abuse at his address. It included a threat of violence to officers who responded.
“I am grateful to the West Lafayette Police Department for their professionalism and preparedness to recognize this as a swatting attempt,” Deery said, noting it was resolved without endangering his children or others in the neighborhood boarding buses to school.
He assured constituents, “We will continue to do our duty and to do what is in the best interest of our district, no matter the threats.”
Deery’s not the only one facing threats in the frenzy for early maps. Redistricting is traditionally done every 10 years, after the census.
Republican supermajorities drew the current congressional boundaries in 2021, maintaining a 7-2 GOP majority. Two blue districts cover northwest Indiana and Indianapolis. President Donald Trump and his supporters want Indiana to produce a 9-0 map ahead of the 2026 midterm elections as part of his push to keep GOP control over the U.S. House.
Trump has ratcheted up the pressure, telling Gov. Mike Braun on Tuesday that he “must produce” on redistricting. That day, Braun proclaimed he’d find ways to “compel” recalcitrant senators to obey his special session call after they voted to ignore it and adjourn.
Thursday’s attempt on Deery came a day after Sen. Dan Dernulc reported a foiled swatting attempt on his home in Highland.

“Local law enforcement officials were quick to analyze it, recognize the report was false and inform me of the attempt,” Dernulc said in a Wednesday statement.
He hasn’t yet made a decision on redistricting, telling the Capital Chronicle earlier this week it’s “because I haven’t even seen a map.”
“Until I see something, I don’t want it being like (Democratic former U.S. House Speaker) Nancy Pelosi, where they say you have to vote for something and then find out,” Dernulc said at the time.
Later, he called Wednesday’s attempt “scary and shocking.”
“I have always done my best to serve my community, be their voice, and work … to help make Indiana a great state,” Dernulc’s statement continued. “It is sad because of these efforts and work that I am villainized in some minds to the point of harmful retaliation. Threats to public officials cannot and should not be the norm. I hope to see justice for this illegal behavior.”
Another undecided Republican colleague, Sen. Greg Goode, reported a swatting attempt on his Terre Haute residence Sunday. It came hours after Trump called him out by name as a “RINO,” or “Republican in name only,” in a post to Truth Social.

Braun denounced the attempts as “absolutely terrible” on Thursday, telling reporters, “That’s way beyond the pale. Unacceptable. … All I’m saying as governor, leader of the state: stop it.”
Asked if he thought aggressive rhetoric had contributed, Braun responded that there’s “rhetoric on a lot of issues.” He said it “boils down to personal responsibility not to do something stupid.”
Deery also slammed an unpaid pizza delivery to his home this week, which he framed as a more subtle attempt at intimidation.
“This may seem like a harmless prank, and it certainly isn’t as serious as a swatting, but it still is an attempt to intimidate an elected official by conveying ‘we know where you live,'” Deery said. “Even this less serious tactic should be condemned and never normalized.”

It’s the game in which a tower’s blocks are removed until the absence of one causes the entire structure to collapse.
The Affordable Care Act (ACA) is that consequential piece in the health insurance game, and very shaky, unsteady Republicans are messing with it.
To insert another board game, it’s like the GOP is remaking “The Game of Life,” which simulates the journey through adulthood, college, career, marriage, children, retirement, all the things. Of course, bad journeys on board games are overcome by reshuffling a deck of cards and giving another twirl to the doohickie that spins to indicate how many spaces to advance on the board.
In real life, though, do-overs aren’t so clean.
Sure, federal employees have been unshackled, no longer forced to work without pay after Democrats caved and created a crooked path for Republicans to reopen the government. But plenty of those federal workers had to work side jobs in the interim. The 43-day federal shutdown forced folks living a paycheck-to-paycheck existence to exchange that for a more extreme checking account-to-reserve funds lifestyle.
Unlike board games, real people are the pawns in the game of life. The unpaid federal workers playing catch-up are real people. Folks getting over the trauma of facing hunger because they couldn’t buy groceries through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, are real people — all 42 million of them.
The 24 million individuals receiving health insurance through ACA marketplaces? They’re real people. Based on what they saw when open enrollment began Nov. 1, some are considering cancelling coverage and foregoing mental health care, colonoscopies, all of the necessary things to which the politicians who denied them remained privy.
“That scenario is wrong in so many ways,” said Advance Carolina policy director Jovita Lee, Ed.D. “Throughout the shutdown, members of Congress kept getting paid, never had to contemplate losing health insurance. It was a different story for their constituents. So what we have are politicians not only using gerrymandering to pick their voters but also making those voters do free work at airports so they could fly home after leaving work early and unfinished in D.C.”
Air traffic controllers were among the federal workers forced to work without pay during the shutdown.
Most Democrats in Congress voted against the continuing resolution that ultimately reopened the government. They refused to say yes without Republicans agreeing to extend the subsidies that have made ACA marketplace insurance more affordable. Without the subsidies, people are poised to pay hundreds of dollars more per month for health insurance premiums.
Even if you don’t get insurance through an ACA marketplace, you’re still prone to paying more for health care. You see, like Jenga, health care is a collective thing. As rumblings permeate about people pulling out of ACA marketplaces because they can’t afford coverage, leaders at insurance companies will hear that and raise costs to compensate for folks getting sicker because they stopped going to see their doctors. Somebody has to pay to offset the price differential in order to keep the health care system propped up. That would be you. Ask your provider.
Even better — ask your Congress member. And get them to explain how the resolution that reopened the government is temporary, so another impasse is likely, another shutdown, possibly in January.
Tell that Congress member to admit that the overarching issue with all of this is the health insurance system wholly needing an overhaul to make premiums realistic again.
It’s enough to make you wonder whether elected officials are taking away necessities just to get people worn down and so focused on survival that they disengage politically. The tiresome antics are wearying, for sure, their fanciful board games, as it were.
Bored games, really.

Campbell plant was expected to save Michigan ratepayers $600 million by 2040. (Photo/Sarah Leach)As the Department of Energy issues a third order prolonging operations for a coal plant in west Michigan slated to close in June, Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel has requested a stay on the extension. 
On Wednesday, Nessel filed a request with the department arguing its justification for another extension was based on outdated assessments of the Midwestern grid operator, Midcontinent Independent System Operator, of its energy reserves heading into the winter. 
The initial order, which extended operations at the J.H. Campbell coal plant from its planned closure on June 1 until August 21, initially argued the plant’s resources were needed to prevent blackouts at homes and businesses amid high demand over the summer, despite projections from the grid operator which determined it would have enough resources to meet demand from consumers. 
The department’s latest order, issued Tuesday, extends operations until February 17, 2026. Energy Secretary Chris Wright argued that while the North American Electric Reliability Corporation had yet to issue its reliability assessment for winter 2025-2026, assessments from the previous two years had presented concerns on whether Midcontinent Independent System Operator’s energy reserves would be sufficient in “above-normal conditions.”SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
However, the 2025-2026 assessment was released hours before the order was issued, with Nessel arguing its contents completely negate Wright’s arguments justifying an extension. 

While the assessment found multiple regions in the U.S. could have insufficient energy to support its customers amid extreme weather, MISO was listed at a “normal risk,” meaning that its resources will be sufficient to meet operating reserves under normal and extreme peak demand and outage scenarios.
The assessment also notes that this year’s risk scenario for the grid operator should not be compared to last year’s as there have been changes to the assessment methods
“[The Department of Energy] is using outdated information to fabricate an emergency, despite the fact that the truth is publicly available for everyone to see,” Nessel said in a statement. “[The department] must end its unlawful tactics to keep this coal plant running when it has already cost millions upon millions of dollars. My office will continue to fight back against these arbitrary orders and ensure residents aren’t forced to foot the bill for these unreasonable costs.”
According to the plant’s owner Consumers Energy, keeping the plant operating has cost the company $80 million, or more than $615,000 a day. The company was able to recoup $84 in separate costs by selling energy to Midcontinent Independent System Operator. 
Consumers Energy Media Relation Specialist Brian Wheeler said the company is prepared to continue operating the Campbell plant as required by the Department of Energy. He noted the costs for operating the plant are not solely borne by Consumers Energy customers, but by ratepayers across the grid.

The Ohio House voted 52-34 to pass Ohio Senate Bill 56, sending it to the Senate. 
Ohio Republicans Thaddeus Claggett, Levi Dean, Brian Lorenz, Jason Stephens, D.J. Swearingen, and Michelle Teska joined Ohio Democrats in voting against the bill around 1 a.m. Thursday morning.
The House vote took place after the bill was originally scheduled to go to conference committee Wednesday morning, but the meeting did not happen until just before midnight Wednesday.
Ohio state Sen. Bill DeMora, D-Columbus, offered about a dozen amendments during the conference committee, but none of them were adopted.
The Ohio Senate has an if-needed session scheduled for Dec. 10 and Ohio House Speaker Matt Huffman, R-Lima, said he is confident the Senate will pass the bill. 
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The Republican lawmakers on the conference committee said a lot of accommodations had to be made. 
“We were so close that things came together and we did not want to walk away being so close with where we’re at,” said Ohio state Sen. Steve Huffman, R-Tipp City. “I think we came to a good compromise.” 
Huffman introduced the bill in January and the Senate originally passed the bill in February, but the House made major changes, most notably by adding intoxicating hemp regulations. 
The Ohio House passed Ohio S.B. 56 in October with a bipartisan vote and the Ohio Senate voted unanimously one week later not to concur with changes made to the bill, sending it to conference committee. 
After the bill was sent to conference committee at the end of October, changes were made to hemp at the federal level.
Congress recently voted to ban products that contain 0.4 milligrams of total THC per container earlier this month when they voted to reopen the government. 
Previously, the 2018 Farm Bill said hemp can be grown legally if it contains less than 0.3% THC.
There is a one-year implementation delay for the federal hemp ban, but states can create their own regulatory framework before then. 
“On the hemp side, what the the federal government did certainly influenced what we needed to do,” Huffman said.

Ohio’s bill complies with recent federal changes by banning intoxicating hemp products from being sold outside of a licensed marijuana dispensary.  
“When it comes to intoxicating hemp products, we essentially cut to the chase,” said Ohio Rep. Brian Stewart, R-Ashville. 
“We had already whittled down most retailers where those could be sold. That is going to kick in. They’re going to have the 90 days of runway that’s in the bill. After that, all those products are either going to be sold in a marijuana dispensary or they won’t be allowed to be sold.”
If the Ohio Senate passes Ohio S.B. 56 in December and Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine signs the bill into law before the new year, Ohio’s intoxicating hemp could take effect as soon as March.
Ohio S.B. 56 allows five milligram THC beverages to be manufactured, distributed and sold until Dec. 31, 2026. 
“There’s aspirational language in here that the legislative leaders have agreed on that says, if the federal government takes action and makes (THC beverages) legal again, that it’s our intent that we would come back and have legislation to create a structure and have legal THC beverages again,” Stewart said. 
On Oct. 8, Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine announced a 90-day executive order that bans the sale of intoxicating hemp products that started on Oct.14, but a Franklin County Court of Common judge has placed a temporary restraining order on DeWine’s ban until Dec. 2.  
On the marijuana side, the bill would reduce the THC levels in adult-use marijuana extracts from a maximum of 90% down to a maximum of 70%, cap THC levels in adult-use flower to 35%, and prohibit smoking in most public places. 
Ohio S.B. 56 would give 36% of adult-use marijuana sale revenue to municipalities and townships that have recreational marijuana dispensaries. The bill also maintains the 10% tax rate on recreational marijuana and keeps home grow the same at six plants per adult and 12 per residence. 
Ohioans passed a citizen-initiated law to legalize recreational marijuana in 2023 with 57% of the vote, and sales started in August 2024. 
Ohio lawmakers can change the law since it passed as a citizen initiative not a constitutional amendment, something they have been trying to do since late 2023. 
“(Ohio S.B. 56) fundamentally undermines the will of the voter and what they said that they wanted,” said State Rep. Bride Rose Sweeney, D-Westlake. “They told us at the ballot box. They said we need to stop punishing adults for responsible use.” 
Ohio recreational marijuana sales topped $702.5 million in the first year. 
“People wanted the ability to smoke it where they wanted to smoke it, the ability to have their neighbors exchange marijuana and see whose brand was better,” DeMora said. “This bill does none of that stuff.” 
Ohio Republicans disagree.
“I don’t think it goes against the will of voters,” Ohio House Speaker Matt Huffman said. “You can say we got 57% of the vote, but is it the will of all the people that you’re allowed to smoke marijuana cigarettes while you’re walking into the Cincinnati Reds baseball game? I don’t think so.”

In September the FDA approved a new generic form of mifepristone, bringing the total approved manufacturers to three.
This federal approval, which drew the ire of anti-abortion groups, came after Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. promised U.S. Sen. Josh Hawley, a Republican from Missouri, that his agency would conduct a “complete review” of mifepristone. 
“If the FDA is reevaluating the brand-name drug’s safety, then it needs to stop rubber-stamping new mail-order generic versions before more women are hurt,” Hanaway said in a statement Thursday.
The new FDA approval will make medication abortions more accessible, Hanaway argues.
“The supply of mifepristone will increase, the cost will decrease and the number of chemical abortions will rise… across the nation,” the new court filing reads.
The lawsuit demands the federal government restore its previous restrictions on mifepristone by requiring three in-person doctor visits, reducing the gestational period during which the medication can be taken from 10 weeks to seven and rolling back recent federal policy that allowed for the mailing of mifepristone and allowed for prescriptions to be made online or through pharmacies.
Medication abortion — used in about two-thirds of abortions in the U.S. — requires two kinds of pills. The first, mifepristone, causes the embryo or fetus to stop growing and detach from the uterine wall, ending the pregnancy. The second, misoprostol, causes the uterus to expel the pregnancy tissue. Both medications are also used to treat miscarriages.
“For Missouri and other states with strong protections for unborn life and maternal health, the widespread mail-order distribution of mifepristone directly undermines state law and burdens state hospitals, emergency rooms, and taxpayers,” Hanaway said in her statement Thursday.
The FDA states that mifepristone is safe to use if taken as directed in the first trimester of pregnancy. 
Bleeding and cramping are expected side effects. More rarely, there can be hemorrhaging and infection. Those prescribed mifepristone are urged to call their doctor if they experience heavy bleeding, abdominal pain or a fever. This guidance also applies to those who recently underwent surgical abortions, experienced miscarriages or delivered a baby.
Since the medication was approved for use nearly three decades ago, the FDA has reported only 32 deaths associated with mifepristone. The report evaluates data from 5.9 million women who took mifepristone between 2000 and 2022. Of the three dozen deaths, 11 were the result of sepsis, 20 were homicides and two were suicides.
Missouri still among worst states for infant, maternal health as new Medicaid cuts loom

Hanaway stepped into the legal challenge to mifepristone first filed by her predecessor, Andrew Bailey. The federal lawsuit challenging the safety of mifepristone was taken up by the attorneys general of Missouri, Idaho and Kansas last year after the U.S. Supreme Court rejected the original lawsuit, saying the anti-abortion doctors and medical organizations in Texas who brought the original case didn’t have the standing to sue. 
The case was recently moved from a federal court in Texas to the eastern district of Missouri in St. Louis after a federal judge in Texas said he no longer had jurisdiction over the plaintiffs. A court date has not yet been set.
Despite voters enshrining the right to abortion in the Missouri Constitution last year, medication abortion is inaccessible through Planned Parenthood clinics in Missouri.

Murphy proposes rescue, reform of public worker health plan system",Nikita Biryukov,,,,,https://newjerseymonitor.com/2025/11/20/governor-murphy-state-health-benefits/,Gov. Phil Murphy's proposal to revamp the health benefits program for government workers would shift costs away from premiums and onto health care visits. The state's largest public-sector union is opposed.,"Gov. Phil Murphy's proposal to revamp the health benefits program for government workers would shift costs away from premiums and onto health care visits. The state's largest public-sector union is opposed. (Hal Brown for New Jersey Monitor)Gov. Phil Murphy proposed an overhaul of the state’s public worker health plans on Thursday that would flatten the number of plans offered to government workers, shift more costs for health care visits onto workers, and inject $260 million in a bid to attract local governments that have fled the public plan over years of steep premium hikes.
Murphy’s proposal comes as the local part of the State Health Benefits Program threatens to collapse amid a dwindling pool of subscribers driven ever smaller by rising rates that spur more departures and, in turn, more rate increases. And it comes as Murphy, a Democrat, is nearing the end of his two terms as governor. Gov.-elect Mikie Sherrill (D) succeeds him in January.
“Unless we take sweeping action now to shore up this program, there are tens of thousands of New Jerseyans whose access to health care will be in serious jeopardy, and next June’s rate increases will be astronomical,” Murphy said during a speech at the New Jersey League of Municipalities’ annual conference.
The State Health Benefits Program covers both state and some local government workers, and the local part is technically insolvent. Even after years of double-digit rate increases — including a 37% increase approved in September — the premiums it collects from local and county governments and their workers are not enough to cover its costs.
Its reserves, which actuaries say should hold enough to cover two months of claims, are depleted, and the local part has been taking loans from state workers’ better-funded plan to continue offering health benefits to nearly 146,000 workers across New Jersey.
That number is falling every year as surging rates push local governments with younger, healthier workforces to cheaper options in the private market, pushing rates up as the program’s insurance pool grows older, sicker, and riskier to insure.
“This program provides health care coverage to our state’s valiant, and often under-appreciated, public servants,” Murphy said, adding, “These New Jerseyans — along with our state’s taxpayers — are counting on us to prevent the SHBP for local government from collapsing.”
The governor acknowledged passing the reforms before he leaves office on Jan. 20 would be difficult.
In a bid to lower premiums, Murphy’s plan would increase workers’ share of health care visit costs, and the proposal has already drawn opposition from the Communications Workers of America, the state’s largest public-sector union.
“This proposal, as it is, is a nonstarter,” said CWA District 1 New Jersey Area Director Tonya Hodges. “The SHBP Stabilization Act of 2025 is nothing but an egregious attempt to dismantle local government health care, continue shifting costs onto the backs of public workers, and perpetuate a system that allows insurance carriers and [pharmacy benefit managers] to increase prices with impunity.”
Senate President Nicholas Scutari said he believes a compromise is possible to address the problems plaguing the State Health Benefits Program. (Hal Brown for New Jersey Monitor)
Senate President Nicholas Scutari (D-Union) in a statement said Murphy’s proposal underscores the key tenets needed for reform.
“The foundational principles that are needed to enable the plans to operate effectively and efficiently are the stabilization of local governments going in and out of the system, reducing the number of health plan options, and breaking the stalemate between management and labor. Although the proposals from the Governor and the Assembly address these principles differently, the Senate Workgroup that I charged with addressing this issue believes there is an opportunity for a compromise that preserves vital health care for workers while protecting municipal and county taxpayers,” Scutari said.
Assembly Speaker Craig Coughlin (D-Middlesex), meanwhile, said in a statement that he welcomes discussions on how to lower costs for taxpayers and municipalities “while providing quality, affordable health insurance to public workers.”
 A $260 million one-shot
Key to Murphy’s pitch is a one-time $260 million appropriation that would be used to pay down money loaned from the state worker side of the State Health Benefits Program. That balance is projected to reach $180 million by the end of 2025, and whatever remains of the appropriation would go into the plan’s reserve.
The appropriation is significant, accounting for about 11.5% of the nearly $2.3 billion that the local government workers’ health plan is expected to spend in 2025, and could allow the state to lower the rates approved in September in early 2026, long before a slew of other reforms take effect in 2027.
At present, the program’s premiums include added charges to repay loans to the state workers’ plan and rebuild the local part’s depleted reserves.
Murphy administration officials hope that rate reduction will encourage local units that have left the plan over rising costs to return, driving rates down as the insurance pool’s risk falls.
“Our administration is willing to provide a quarter-billion dollars, in the short-term, to keep the SHBP for local government solvent in exchange for smart, structural reforms that will stabilize the program in the long-term,” Murphy said.
The governor’s proposal would require local governments to stay inside the State Health Benefits Program for five years once they join and stay out for the same period if they leave. The provision is meant to keep the plan’s insurance pool stable.
 Less generous plans
Local government workers’ health plans would become less generous under Murphy’s proposed changes, and there would be far fewer plans presented to workers.
At present, the local part of the State Health Benefits Program offers 50 plans, though as many as 95% of local government workers are enrolled in plans that cover at least 97% of health care visit costs, meaning most workers are responsible for paying just 3% of their health care expenses through coinsurance, copays, or deductibles.
That figure, called an actuarial value, does not include premiums and would fall significantly under the three health plans the governor’s proposal would create beginning in 2027.
It would drop to a statutorily mandated 88% under a PPO plan, or 78% under a high-deductible plan. The actuarial value of a proposed tiered-network plan was unclear.
Administration officials hope shifting costs away from premiums will help keep healthier workers in the public plan, and they hope raising workers’ share of health care visit costs will discourage them from seeking unnecessary or excessive care.
That framework would necessarily raise costs for some of the plan’s members, especially those with chronic conditions who require frequent care. Morgan, the Communications Workers of America official, said the proposal would lock government workers “into inferior plans.”
“We should be moving toward more oversight and more affordable benefits,” Hodges said.

 A new commission
Murphy’s plan would also alter governance over local government workers’ health plans.
A new seven-member commission would oversee rate setting and plan design, though they would be bound to keep actuarial values at the levels set in statute.
It would include four cabinet heads from the Departments of Treasury, Banking and Insurance, Community Affairs, and the Civil Service Commission or their designees, giving the state government a majority on the commission.
The governor would appoint the three remaining members, with one each recommended by the New Jersey League of Municipalities, the AFL-CIO, and the state’s largest police and firefighter unions.
Local governments have long sought representation on the bodies that oversee New Jersey’s public worker health plans. They have none under current law.
Treasury officials have said the frequent deadlocks in the state’s plan design committees, whose membership is evenly split between state and labor representatives, have contributed to rising premiums.
Murphy’s proposal would allow the state treasurer to act as tiebreaker if plan design committees that set rules for the state part of State Health Benefits Program deadlock.

(Photo by Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)As some South Dakota dairy farmers struggle to find workers and as the state’s unemployment rate remains the lowest in the nation at 1.9%, South Dakota’s economic development office continues to approve incentives for the industry.
Two boards affiliated with the state Governor’s Office of Economic Development approved $17 million of aid for businesses this month, according to a press release from the department. Most of it was for dairy operations.
“When businesses grow in our small towns, it creates a ripple effect that strengthens the whole community,” said Commissioner Bill Even, who leads the office. “Each of these projects represents a partnership between the state, local leaders and business owners working together to move South Dakota forward.”
Drumgoon Dairy, near Lake Norden, lost 38 of its 50 employees this summer after a federal Department of Homeland Security audit flagged workers for inaccurate, outdated or incomplete proof of U.S. citizenship or permission to work in the country. Dairy audits in the state increased this year, farmers have said, and Drumgoon has struggled to hire local employees to replace the workers in the aftermath.
Noem’s South Dakota neighbors hit with an immigration audit that decimates their workforce

That hasn’t stopped state officials from continuing to direct aid to the dairy industry. Warner-based Silverstreak Dairies was awarded up to $12 million this month in Livestock Nutrient Management Bonds to build manure containment systems as part of the company’s recent $32 million expansion, which doubled its capacity to 5,400 head.
Annie Vannurden, a partner in the Warner operation, told South Dakota Searchlight it employs 30 people. With the recent expansion, Silverstreak pivoted toward more technology to address workforce shortages, including introducing a post-milking robot and using collars to monitor cows’ needs and reduce the amount of human interaction.
The Livestock Nutrient Management Bond program issues tax-exempt bonds to purchasers — typically local banks — who set the repayment terms and interest rates for the company borrowing the money. This is the first bond in the program approved so far this year.
Vannurden said the bond program helps dairy farms invest in their operations and technological upgrades rather than pay higher interest to other loan programs.
“It just shows that South Dakota cares about its dairy farms, people in agriculture and the environment,” Vannurden said, adding, “because they want us to be thoughtful and mindful and complete in our manure handling and compliance.”
Silverstreak Dairies is headquartered in Pierz, Minnesota, and operates eight dairies — the Warner dairy is the company’s sole South Dakota operation. The Warner operation was previously awarded $8.74 million in a Livestock Nutrient Management Bond in February 2024.

(Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)With most power customers likely to pay at least $150 more next year, Maine’s public advocate said the hike “underscores how challenging and volatile energy costs have become” for Maine households and small businesses.
One day after the commission that oversees the state’s utilities rejected Central Maine Power’s proposed 10-year rate increase, the Public Utilities Commission announced Wednesday it approved new electricity prices for 2026. 
Starting in January, residential and small commercial customers of CMP will see rates increase to 12.72 cents per kilowatt hour, up from 10.61 this year. Versant Maine Public District residential and small commercial customers will see rates increase from 11.65 cents per kilowatt hour to 14.87.
Public Advocate Heather Sanborn said in a statement Thursday that an analysis by her office estimates customers can expect their monthly bills to go up, on average, between $13 and $17. 
Utility regulators reject CMP’s proposed rate hike, for now

“When every dollar matters, this is a significant increase for families and small businesses that are already stretched thin,” Sanborn said.
A power bill has two primary components: the cost of the energy being supplied, and the cost of the infrastructure to deliver it. Private utilities are responsible for delivering power. They also serve as intermediaries with energy suppliers, which are selected through a competitive bidding process overseen by the commission. This chosen supplier is known as the “standard offer,” since households are also entitled to seek an alternative “competitive electricity supplier.” 
“We recognize that rising energy costs create real challenges for Maine households and businesses,” said commission Chair Philip L. Bartlett II. 
The new standard offer rate, he said, “reflects current market realities and the commission remains committed to securing the lowest reasonable prices for Maine electric utility customers in a challenging energy environment.”
Sanborn said the higher costs are likely the result of increased natural gas prices, as well as changes in the wholesale market that have introduced new pricing risks for power suppliers.
On Tuesday, the commission rejected CMP’s proposed 10-year delivery rate increase, which would have raised costs for the average customer by $35 per month or $420 per year by 2030. The three-member panel encouraged the utility to resubmit a plan that takes into greater consideration long-term resilience planning and the impact on ratepayers.",https://mainemorningstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/GettyImages-2153308881-scaled-1-2048x1152-1-2-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-11-20 11:58:09.848621

New micro-neighborhood provides longer mental health residential stays at a lower price point, customizable treatment plans, and job assistance.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  With expansion, Spring Lake Ranch hopes to be missing link in mental health care.","It’s a familiar story for Vermonters: A loved one experiencing a mental health crisis goes to the hospital. They spend a few days in a psychiatric unit, or two weeks at one of the few drug and alcohol rehabilitation facilities in the state, and then they’re sent home. All the stressors, patterns, people, and pathways that originally led them to crisis are still there, and they relapse.
Relationships are damaged and resources are strained. In some cases, hospital and rehab stays are replaced by prison sentences, which exacerbate the difficulties of reintegrating in a safe and healthy way. Relapse. Crisis. Each time the cycle repeats, it fuels a sense of hopelessness that makes long-term recovery from mental health challenges feel that much harder.
At Spring Lake Ranch Therapeutic Community (SLR) in Shrewsbury, VT, an expanded step-down program seeks to bolster residents’ long-term success. SLR hopes the program can become a model for others across the country. 

The Banks Transitional Living Program (TLP) at Spring Lake Ranch is a micro-neighborhood currently being constructed on the Ranch’s 700+ acre, mountain-top property where their primary mental health facilities have existed for nearly 100 years. Within three new apartment buildings and a community center, residents will receive customized support to bridge the gap between residential care and independent living. 
“This is something we’ve been wanting to do for a long time,” says Rachel Stark, Executive Director of the Ranch. “We hope this will be the missing link for people who are ready for new challenges, but not quite ready to be fully on their own.”   
Clients come to SLR from all over, often from intensive inpatient and rehab facilities. Common diagnoses include depression, anxiety, schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder. Some residents are simply having trouble making life transitions or experiencing “failure to launch” syndrome. About 80% have dual diagnosis, which means they are experiencing both mental health and substance use challenges. 
Residents participate in a farm-based therapeutic work program while receiving clinical care within a supportive community. The typical stay is 6-8 months, but timelines are individual. After that, residents currently have the option of transitioning to Elliot Program, a 6-bedroom pilot of the Banks TLP, where they can have a car, manage their own medication, go to school, or work off-site. Last year, roughly a quarter of SLR residents chose Elliot Program before discharge.
“We did a market study, we did a feasibility study,” says Stark. “But more than that, we talked to families. We talked to residents. This is what people were looking for.”

The 12-bed Banks TLP will offer apartments and suites, depending on resident preference. The rooms have been designed with care, full of light and each with its own balcony overlooking green pastures and lush forest. The community center will be a gathering place for residents, staff, and families, with a large kitchen and offices. 
Residents and their families will choose between a variety of service packages. All will receive continued clinical support and coaching with trusted providers, accountability in recovery, vocational counseling, and help in further developing their independent living skills. They can also choose add-on services like physical wellness, family wellness, and transportation assistance. 
Additionally, residents who’ve been in the Banks TLP for at least a year can participate in the Pathways to Activities, Socializing, & Support (PASS) program, providing continued assistance once they move off-site.  
The Ranch wants to help residents succeed by strengthening the full continuum of care. Mental wellness and recovery are lifelong goals, and by giving residents more time and specialized focus on skill-building and independent living, SLR believes they will be better equipped to escape the cycle of relapse and crisis. 
This level of care comes with a financial cost, which insurance does not currently cover. SLR designed the Banks TLP as a package model so that families could choose the most feasible plan with service add-ons. Residents are also encouraged to apply for financial aid.
Currently, 30-40% of residents receive financial aid for the primary therapeutic work program, covering up to 80% of costs. Earlier this year, the Ranch announced their goal of doubling the amount of aid distributed to residents by 2030. This aid is funded by donors, as well as by sales of Ranch-made products like maple syrup, woven goods, and granola.

“When somebody is right for this program, we do what we can to get them here,” says Kevin Molloy, Director of Operations and Admissions, himself a former resident. “It may feel out of reach, but the support is there to make it happen. This model of care works, I’m living proof of that. So, we want to make it accessible to as many people as possible.” 
In 2024, SLR launched a three-year, $18 million Capital Campaign to fund the Banks TLP as well as other updates necessary to support the expansion. With one year left in the campaign, they’re looking to raise the final three million. 
Development and Communications Director Rose McCracken is working hard to hit that goal. 
“The early support was really amazing. People who’ve been to the Ranch or who’ve had a loved one here know how powerful the program is and they want to see it grow. What we need now is help from folks who may not have heard of us but are passionate about mental health care.”
Investing in mental health benefits us all, McCracken says. “These are not just our family members and friends. They are our future neighbors, coworkers, and community leaders. When we give them the tools to thrive, it enriches life for all of us.”
The Banks Transitional Living Program at Spring Lake Ranch will begin accepting residents in 2026. For more information, visit springlakeranch.org/bankstlp.

Santiago/Getty Images)The Michigan Supreme Court proposed on Wednesday an order to prohibit any civil arrests from taking place in a courthouse “while attending a court proceeding or having legal business in the courthouse.”
While not explicit in the text of the proposal, it matches actions taken by other states to prevent federal immigration agents from arresting noncitizens with no criminal record on civil immigration warrants while they attend court hearings for unrelated, minor offenses. 
“We welcome this proposed order by the Michigan Supreme Court as it would strengthen public safety, transparency, and accountability for the benefit of all Michigan residents,” Christine Sauvé, the policy, engagement and communications manager at the Michigan Immigrant Rights Center. 
“We increasingly receive calls from individuals detained by ICE at or near courthouses in Michigan,” she added. “Often simply the presence of ICE or Border Patrol near these locations – or the possibility of their presence – is enough to deter a range of individuals from accessing the critical process they need to preserve individual rights, the wellbeing of vulnerable people, and public safety.”
Connecticut was the latest state to implement such guidance, last week passing a bill that would bar most civil immigration arrests on courthouse grounds. Meanwhile, in New York, on Monday a judge threw out a challenge by Trump to a 2020 law that limited civil arrests in local courts and state facilities.

Currently, ICE guidance — issued the day after President Donald Trump took office — instructs officers that they “may conduct civil immigration enforcement actions in or near courthouses when they have credible information that leads them to believe the targeted alien(s) is or will be present at a specific location, and where such action is not precluded by laws imposed by the jurisdiction in which the civil immigration enforcement action will take place.”
As of Sept. 21, over 70% of people detained by ICE had no criminal convictions, according to the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse, a data research organization, meaning that their arrests generally come under civil immigration warrants. 
The proposed order also “does not apply to arrests made pursuant to a valid warrant that a judge has authorized,” while ICE civil warrants are generally administrative warrants as opposed to judicial. 
“This is a commonsense safeguard that benefits all Michiganders because we need everyone to come to court,” Sauvé wrote. “Other states have taken similar measures to ensure there is not a chilling effect on resident access to justice, and these efforts have passed Constitutional muster.”
Justice Brian K. Zahra, the sole Republican on the court, noted in the order that he would have declined to publish the proposal for comment. The order is open for public comment through Dec. 22.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/court-arrests.jpg,,,2025-11-20 11:58:09.848621
,Connecticut Mirror,2025-11-20 16:25:13+00:00,CT Mirror,Hartford HealthCare could add 2 Prospect CT hospitals to its system by year’s end,Katy Golvala,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/11/20/hartford-healthcare-prospect-medical-ct-hospitals/,HHC pitched its case to buy Manchester and Rockville hospitals owned by Prospect Medical Holdings. CT must issue a decision by Dec. 30.,"After years of uncertainty regarding the future of the Connecticut hospitals owned by bankrupt operator Prospect Medical Holdings, two of the three facilities could have a new owner by the end of the year.
On Tuesday, Hartford HealthCare, one of Connecticut’s largest health systems, presented its case to the state’s Office of Health Strategy to purchase Manchester Memorial and Rockville General Hospitals. Under the new expedited approval timeline for hospitals in bankruptcy, state officials must issue a decision by Dec. 30.
During the public hearing, Hartford HealthCare CEO Jeffrey Flaks said the health system plans to bring all its expertise, resources and capabilities to Manchester, Rockville and the surrounding towns.
“The robust apparatus of Hartford HealthCare will be brought to these communities to make health care better. That’s why I’m so confident that we have this very unique opportunity to dramatically improve health care that will be here for generations going forward,” Flaks said.
Hartford HealthCare will spend $86.1 million to purchase the facilities and pledged to invest an additional $225.7 million towards capital improvements, like facility and IT upgrades, over the next three years. 
Hartford HealthCare also plans to recruit new physicians to the Manchester and Rockville communities, as well as expand access to specialty care, like oncology, inpatient rehabilitation and vascular and orthopedic surgical services, according to the application submitted to the state.
If approved, the deal would serve as the first step towards concluding a lengthy search to find new buyers for Prospect’s Connecticut hospitals — a process that often seemed on the brink of failure.
In 2022, Prospect signed a deal to sell its three Connecticut hospitals — Manchester Memorial, Rockville General and Waterbury — to Yale New Haven Health for $435 million. But the deal was mired in setbacks and litigation. 
In August 2023, a cyberattack crippled operations at Prospect’s facilities around the country. In 2024, Yale New Haven Health and Prospect Medical sued and countersued each other over the true value of the hospitals. In January 2025, Prospect filed for bankruptcy and, by the following month, Yale officials said a deal appeared “impossible.” 
In September, Yale agreed to pay $45 million to Prospect to end all disputes over the hospitals’ sale. 
Hartford HealthCare stepped in and its acquisitions of the Manchester and Rockville facilities could be finalized by the end of the year. Connecticut’s flagship academic medical institution, UConn Health, seems poised to acquire Waterbury Hospital. A judge for the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Northern Texas approved the UConn deal earlier this week, and now the transaction must obtain state approval.
It’s a speedy transition for the three hospitals, whose ownership had languished in uncertainty for years.
While the Yale deal was pending, Lamont and OHS received broad criticism for the lengthy approval process. That led state legislators to approve a measure earlier this year that allows for an expedited timeline for the acquisition of hospitals that have filed for bankruptcy. 
Under the emergency certificate of need timeline, OHS must issue a final decision within 60 days from when the application is deemed complete. 
In an emailed statement, Lamont’s spokesperson Rob Blanchard said OHS “met all statutory timelines in the Yale-Prospect [certificate of need review]” and that the legal disputes between the two companies illustrate the transaction’s complexity. 
“Yale’s decision to file suit against Prospect less than two months after the agreed settlement raised clear concerns about the parties’ readiness to close the deal. The disputes that prolonged the CON process are now evident in the lawsuit, countersuit, and resulting $45 million settlement,” Blanchard stated in emailed comments.
Erosion of services at Rockville
Despite the promise of new ownership for Prospect’s Connecticut hospitals, the formerly private equity-backed operator will leave a lasting imprint on the state’s hospital system — perhaps most notably in the erosion of services at Rockville General.
When Prospect acquired Eastern Connecticut Health Network, which includes Manchester Memorial and Rockville General Hospitals, both facilities were full-service acute care hospitals. Today, Rockville — which serves a geographic region that’s largely rural — functions as a satellite campus of Manchester, with only an emergency room and behavioral health unit. 
A spokesperson for Prospect did not respond to a request for comment in time for publication.
Rep. Tammy Nuccio, R-Tolland, lays the blame for the diminishment of the hospital directly with the state.
“That’s OHS’s failure,” Nuccio said. “They allowed this to happen.”
A 2023 investigation by The Connecticut Mirror found that Prospect began cutting services during the early days of the pandemic, eventually shuttering most of Rockville’s inpatient units without obtaining the required state approvals. Records and employee testimony submitted to the state show that officials were aware of the unauthorized cuts going back as far as 2021.
In February 2022, OHS fined Prospect for some of the service cuts at Rockville, but the operator appealed the penalty. The agency ultimately found it did not have substantial evidence to penalize Prospect, and waived the fine. 
In October 2024, OHS launched another investigation into the service cuts. In May of this year, Connecticut officials reached a settlement with Prospect Medical Holdings. OHS fined the operator $300,000, but the agreement also allowed Prospect to shutter all services at Rockville aside from the emergency room and behavioral health, officially making the facility a satellite campus of Manchester.
At the time, then-OHS commissioner Deidre Gifford issued a statement saying the agreement “protects critical resources” for patients and families in the area.
“The agreement also holds the Prospect applicants accountable to the community, requiring public notice of past terminations and development of a strategic plan for the consolidated hospital. The plan must be developed with community input and presented to the community in a public forum,” Gifford’s statement read. 
Hartford HealthCare has said as of now they don’t expect service cuts at either Manchester or Rockville. But Nuccio said she’s suspicious based on the company’s history with Windham Hospital, which HHC acquired in 2009. 
In 2015, Hartford HealthCare announced the conversion of Windham’s critical care unit to what’s known as a progressive care unit, which can’t handle the same complexity of care. Most recently, the company received strong pushback from the local community over the system’s decision to shutter Windham’s labor and delivery unit, which stopped performing births in 2020.
During the hearing on Tuesday, executives with HHC stated that the system improves the quality of care at all of the hospitals that join its system and that they are proud of the work done with former acquisitions. The company’s certificate of need application states that HHC invested hundreds of millions of dollars in facilities it acquired in the past, resulting in drastically improved quality of care for patients. 
Tina Varona, a spokesperson for Hartford HealthCare, declined to make Flaks available for an interview after he testified in Tuesday’s hearing, saying he had to leave immediately. 
“We are unable to comment outside of the testimony at this time due to the NDA and pending regulatory review,” Varona stated in an email follow-up after the hearing. 
Following Tuesday’s hearing, Attorney General William Tong issued a statement saying he expected Hartford HealthCare to maintain services, including labor and delivery, intensive care and behavioral health. But he called on OHS to hold Hartford HealthCare to its promises.
“Expectations must be matched by accountability: Absent other legal impediments, I would urge the Office of Health Strategy to seek firm commitments to continue these vital services,” Tong said. 
Vernon mayor Dan Champagne shared Nuccio’s sentiments in holding the state accountable for what happened to Rockville Hospital, particularly for how long officials took to approve the failed 2022 deal with Yale. But, he said, he’s grateful Rockville has not suffered the same fate as Prospect hospitals in Pennsylvania, which had to close because they couldn’t find a viable buyer.
Champagne said he understands skepticism of what an acquisition by a big hospital system could mean for Manchester and Rockville. But for him, Hartford HealthCare’s bid will guard against the most damaging result: closure of the hospitals and the flight of medical professionals from the communities.
“There are a lot of people who say, ‘big systems can sometimes lead to increased prices or closure of services,’” Champagne said. “We need to go back to what we’re facing here. I’m watching other hospital systems close from Prospect. We have an opportunity to keep this open. That’s the most important thing.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/2023_0927_SR_Hospitals_004-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-11-20 11:58:09.848621

Charlie Baker and followed a landmark court ruling that found the state needed to issue more specific and stringent regulations in order to meet the 2050 climate commitment.,"NO AGENCY SUBMITTED reports to comply with a 2017 rule requiring cuts to the emissions produced by state-owned vehicles — and environmental regulators didn’t aggressively enforce the rule, either, according to new court documents filed last week. 
Massachusetts agencies that own or lease at least 30 passenger vehicles, from the Executive Office of Energy and Environmental Affairs to the Department of Transportation, are compelled to reduce the pollution stemming from that vehicle fleet each year by specific amounts and submit reports to the Department of Environmental Protection in order to show compliance.  
But MassDEP has no records of these reports and didn’t follow up with the relevant agencies to receive that data for each year going back to 2019, when the reports were first due, according to the court documents that are in connection to a lawsuit the state brought against oil giant Exxon Mobil.  
The Executive Office of Energy and Environmental Affairs, which oversees MassDEP, declined to comment, citing the ongoing litigation. 
The rule was issued under Republican Gov. Charlie Baker and followed a landmark court ruling that found the state needed to issue more specific and stringent regulations in order to meet the 2050 climate commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 85 percent compared to 1990 levels. That 2016 ruling prompted an executive order from Baker directing DEP to issue additional regulations to help Massachusetts achieve those emissions reductions. 
A suite of six regulations emerged, one of which was the state passenger vehicle emissions reduction rule. But that regulation appears to have been ignored since it took effect in the wake of the 2016 litigation that was spurred by groups like the Conservation Law Foundation.  
DEP made the admission, ironically, in a court proceeding tied to a lawsuit the state filed against Exxon, accusing the company of deceiving the public and investors about the risks of climate change and its role in contributing to it. That litigation, initiated in 2019 by then-Attorney General Maura Healey, has now raised questions about the state’s own efforts to reduce emissions.  
After a judge denied Exxon’s attempt to obtain data and documents pertaining to Massachusetts’s vehicle fleet rule via discovery, the company pivoted to seek the information through a public records request in January. And when the state denied that record request, Exxon sued this past March — ultimately producing some relevant documents, including agency communications related to the rule and one request from EEA in 2019 for a modification of its vehicle’s emissions limit. 
But Exxon, believing that the state was withholding additional information, pressed the state for more. That’s when, in defense of the state’s motion to dismiss the records case, DEP admitted last week that “no agencies had submitted reports under the fleets regulation.” 
Conservation Law Foundation, whose lawsuit gave rise to this regulation requiring emissions reductions from state-owned vehicles, said the court documents are concerning. 
“CLF is still reviewing the record, but we fought for these [Global Warming Solutions Act] regulations to ensure real climate action,” said Seth Gadbois, staff attorney at the Conservation Law Foundation. “All levels of government are bound to follow them. When they’re ignored, it’s a step backward for the climate goals Massachusetts is legally required to meet.” 
The state passenger vehicle regulation is, of course, just one piece of Massachusetts’s broader efforts to cut greenhouse gas emissions from the transportation sector — which account for the largest share of pollution in the Bay State at 38 percent. 
Baker, in 2021, went significantly further in cracking down on the emissions tied to state vehicles by requiring through executive order that the state’s fleet be 100 percent zero-emission in 2050.  
Since then, the Healey administration has allocated tens of millions of dollars for electric vehicle charging infrastructure, including for public entities and the state fleet, along with school bus electrification — though Massachusetts would still need to triple its annual rate of new charging deployments through 2030 to achieve its climate commitment of cutting pollution in half compared to 1990 levels. 
Still, the lack of compliance with and enforcement of an emissions-reduction regulation that was the direct result of a major legal victory for environmental activists is likely to raise scrutiny of state climate efforts. The revelation from the Exxon Mobil lawsuit comes as the Trump administration’s push to squash clean energy further jeopardizes Massachusetts’s ability to meet those 2030 goals. 
The regulation states that when MassDEP believes an agency has exceeded its emissions limit “or violated any other condition” of the rule, DEP “may require” an agency to perform audits on its carbon dioxide emissions and deliver periodic reports “to assure continuous compliance.” The regulation also grants MassDEP the ability to “verify compliance” by conducting inspections and requesting additional information. 
None of the records made public through the lawsuit show DEP taking any such steps. Sharon Weber, deputy division director for air and climate programs at DEP, confirmed in a deposition last month that DEP has no documents showing any instances of “compliance verification” or other enforcement actions in spite of the fact that no agency appears to have filed reports detailing the emissions of its vehicle fleet.",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Healey-Baker.jpg?fit=1000%2C690&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-11-20 11:58:09.848621

TOPEKA, Kansas — The Republican secretaries of state for Kansas and Missouri have signed a memorandum of understanding to exchange voter registration information in a bid to identify people who failed to cancel registrations after moving from one state to the other.
Kansas Secretary of State Scott Schwab and Missouri Secretary of State Denny Hoskins said the partnership would enhance voter roll maintenance by “securely” sharing personal details on 1.87 million registered voters in Kansas and 4.13 million registered voters in Missouri.
Two organizations dedicated to advancing voter rights expressed skepticism the two-state agreement would do much to strengthen election security.
Neither secretary of state offered an estimate of the number of people in Kansas and Missouri who might have active registrations in a state where they used to reside.
“We can reduce duplicate registrations, created when residents move across the state line, by updating voter registration records timely and as allowed by law,” said Schwab, a candidate for the 2026 GOP nomination for governor in Kansas.
Hoskins said Missouri engaged in rigorous voter registration maintenance in accordance with state and federal law, but the deal “allows us to improve accuracy even further.”
He said the risk of duplicate registrations was real because thousands of Missourians and Kansans relocated each year across the state line in Kansas City metropolitan counties.
“This partnership is good government, plain and simple,” Hoskins said. “When voters move, their information should follow them and our local election officials deserve every available tool to keep the rolls clean, current and transparent.”

Esmie Tseng, spokesperson for the American Civil Liberties Union of Kansas, said the organization’s concerns with the Missouri-Kansas arrangement were comparable to those shared in September when Schwab announced a voter registration collaboration between Kansas and Texas. She said both states must carefully guard personal information, and the states ought to proceed with the understanding that databases could be flawed.
“It should not be used as a way of simply scaring people about election integrity,” Tseng said.
Some states — but not Kansas — striving to upgrade election security in the past decade turned to the Electronic Registration Information Center. ERIC an organization of member states worked to collate motor vehicle department data, Social Security Administration death reports, address information from the U.S. Postal Service and state voter registration records to search for possible illegal voting.
Schwab’s predecessors as Kansas secretary of state operated the now-defunct Crosscheck program that promised to improve accuracy of state voter registration rolls. A lawsuit was filed challenging Crosscheck’s security shortcomings and a high rate of false positives. Settlement of the lawsuit in 2019 led to shelving of Crosscheck.
“Given the history of voter data mismanagement and its negative impact on Kansans, our big question is: How is this better than ERIC and different from Crosscheck?” said Melissa Stiehler, advocacy director for Loud Light, a Kansas organization focused on civil and voting rights.
Whitney Tempel, director of communications for Schwab, said all data sharing relevant to maintaining accurate voter rolls would be conducted in accordance with mandates of state or federal law.
She said the Kansas agreements with Missouri and Texas were part of a trend in which states proactively sought to update voter rolls through direct cooperation with other states.
“This is part of a national surge in one-to-one state agreements as opposed to multistate groups,” Tempel said. “This is one more tool for voter roll maintenance.”
Hoskins, the Missouri secretary of state, said Kansas and Missouri were part of a growing trend among states that voluntarily partnered on data-sharing projects to streamline work on election security.
In early 2025, the U.S. Department of Justice requested states turn over voter registration lists as part of a national inquiry into potential voter fraud. The Justice Department said the goal was to guarantee compliance with federal laws. DOJ subsequently revealed information was shared with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security for inclusion in the Systemic Alien Verification for Entitlements, or SAVE, database.
On Tuesday, election officials in 10 states sent a letter to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and DOJ asking for clarification of statements about uses for voter registration data by the administration of President Donald Trump. DOJ filed lawsuits against eight states for declining to comply with demands for information, which included driver’s license numbers and partial Social Security numbers.
In response, the Kansas secretary of state praised the federal SAVE database. Schwab committed to providing DOJ with publicly available voter information.

More often than staff at the Mount Washington Observatory would like, that’s just how it goes for weather monitoring equipment high on the mountain’s slopes, according to Mount Washington Observatory Director of Weather Operations Jay Broccolo. 
Mounted on aluminum tripod frames, the equipment is designed to monitor conditions including wind speed, snowfall, and solar radiation on the mountain Broccolo and others proudly say is home to “the worst weather on Earth.” But even cutting-edge technology can’t always stand up to Mount Washington’s worst: As ice builds up on the equipment, the surface area exposed to the gales increases and increases. Sometimes, Broccolo says, the metal structures supporting the tech simply buckle.

The automated weather stations are part of a network the Mount Washington Observatory is in the process of expanding throughout the North Country and up and down the slopes of Mount Washington, Broccolo said. The dozens of stations provide real-time weather updates and contribute to a log of local climate data that helps scientists track change over time and understand more about the White Mountains’ unique environment. 
Data from high on the peaks is very valuable to the effort, particularly because it is so hard to come by, Broccolo said. But that’s for good reason. The observatory’s main structures and infrastructure on the peak itself are hardy, but maintaining smaller, standalone weather stations is very difficult — particularly above 4,000 feet on a mountain where, in winter, top wind speeds may approach (or exceed) 100 mph on a daily basis.
“We’ve tried three times, and they’ve lasted not even a month into the winter on every single one,” Broccolo said, speaking to reporters, North Country business owners, and scientists at the foot of Mount Washington Nov. 18. 
A new attempt at solving that takes the form of a collaboration between the Mount Washington Observatory and the Cog Railway. The Cog is aiding in the construction of a new, steel tripod station along its tracks that will — hopefully — prove more durable than the aluminum structures used by the observatory in the past, Broccolo said. 
“It’s very much a trial-as-you-go situation,” he said. “There’s very few places on the planet that experience the weather that this place does.”",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/mesonet-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-20 11:58:09.848621

The survey, conducted from August through October 2025, surveyed over 1,300 Connecticut adults to asses quality of life, health, employment and resources across the state. 
One takeaway: Connecticut residents making less than $30,000 per year are, predictably, more likely to struggle with food, housing and transportation costs — but these residents are also more prone to mental health issues.
Mark Abraham, the executive director of DataHaven, said the survey elicited some positive findings.
“Connecticut continues to show great resilience and a high quality of life, with more than 83% of adults saying they are satisfied with the place they live,” Abraham said in a Nov. 6 press release.
The survey found that the majority of those surveyed believe Connecticut is a “good” or “excellent” place to raise children — and most were satisfied with the city they lived in.
However, many questions included in the survey related to the numerous changes and cuts being made to social safety net programs at the federal level — and found that nearly 30% of families with children have struggled this past year.
“The data also reveal areas of concern that communities are working hard to address, including cuts to food assistance, health care and housing that over a million people in our state have been relying on,” Abraham said. “The results also show rising anxiety, worries about immigration enforcement, differences in access to economic and health opportunity, and financial stress, especially for renters and families with children.”
Anxiety, depression and mental health care access
While 200,000 more adults reported feelings of anxiety and depression now compared to 2018, the survey also found a strong correlation between mental health issues and income.
Thomas Burr, the public policy and affiliate relations manager at the Connecticut branch of the National Alliance on Mental Illness, wasn’t surprised by the survey’s findings.
“That’s what I’m hearing,” Burr said. “It seems like this last year especially, all the drama coming out of D.C., coupled with an economy that’s still not great for a lot of people, has really brought a lot of people down.”

“Demographically speaking, mental health affects everyone, whether you’re wealthy or poor,” Burr said. “But I think because being poor and having issues potentially putting food on your table or [keeping] stable housing is just more trauma on people. And the more traumatic stuff you’re dealing with, the more challenges you’re dealing with, the greater the impact on your overall mental health.” 
When broken down by race, Black, Latino and Puerto Rican residents had heightened feelings of anxiety.
One question added to the survey just a few years ago asked residents: “During the past 12 months, was there any time when you needed mental health treatment or counseling for yourself but didn’t get it?” Statewide, 13% of Connecticut residents answered yes. But 19% of those making under $30,000 reported not getting mental health treatment when they needed it.
“It’s higher for folks who have limited income because cost was a big reason,” Abraham said. “But also just not knowing where to go for support or to find those services was a big reason, especially for younger people.”
People ages 18 to 24 were more likely to have not found mental health treatment when they needed it compared to older residents.  
Compared to the 2018 survey, feelings of depression and hopelessness are more common than they were in 2018. While the number of residents experiencing depressed feelings every day stayed the same, 5% fewer residents experienced no feelings of depression.
DataHaven also included survey questions about immigration status and deportation fears following a steep increase in deportations under the Trump administration. 
Statewide, 31% of residents either worried “a lot” or “some” about themselves, family or a close friend getting their immigration status revoked or being detained or deported.
“Even before new policies take effect that will dramatically increase the federal budget for immigration enforcement and deportations, many residents are already feeling an impact on their health and well-being,” Abraham said in the DataHaven press release.
Tabitha Sookdeo is the executive director for Connecticut Students with a Dream. She said that her members, ranging in ages 14 to 25, are scared.
“I feel like this entire survey reaffirmed so much of what we have been seeing on the ground and what we’ve been feeling,” Sookdeo said. “You know, I have to literally create a mental health fund for our staff and for our members and for their families.”
Latino and Puerto Rican residents worried more than white or Black residents about possible deportations or detainments — and Sookdeo said two of the organization’s members were detained by ICE over the past few months. The organization was able to get them back through a bond process, but those members and their families are “not doing well.”
When President Donald Trump took office in January, Sookdeo said, she went to the different chapters of Connecticut Students for a Dream to discuss the possible risks to members and their families.
“You could see the light kind of start to dull in their eyes … trying to process what this means,” Sookdeo said. “And that was before inauguration, so fast forward to today, it truly is a traumatic experience. These are still young people, they’re still children, their brains are still developing. And that’s happening in extraordinarily traumatic circumstances.”
Many of the organization’s members have been struggling, Sookdeo said, and she has been having sleepless nights herself.
“So many people are suffering and in such a state of despair,” Sookdeo said.
Housing and food — can people afford the necessities?
Similar trends emerged when comparing responses among economic brackets on food and housing questions; Connecticut residents making less than $100,000 were much more likely to have struggled with food and housing money in the past 12 months.

However, for families with children, there was more struggle. DataHaven found that over a quarter of families with children did not have enough money for food at some point in the past 12 months, and nearly 15% struggled to pay for housing.
Jason Jakubowski is the president and CEO of Connecticut Foodshare. He said that it is “absolutely” the case that families with children are struggling especially. However, because of the recent government shutdown and the federal changes to SNAP regulations this November, Jakubowski said these issues are exacerbated, and new faces are showing up to the pantries.
“Since this SNAP crisis began, actually, I’ve seen more senior citizens come out in these last couple of weeks,” Jakubowski said. “There’s a lot of them that rely on SNAP benefits that probably weren’t included in that data that ended in October, and now, suddenly, they’re thrust into the system.”
From 2024 to 2025, food insecurity fell for everyone except families with children. But overall, food insecurity is a larger issue now than it was pre-pandemic — 100,000 more adults are experiencing food insecurity today.
Jakubowski said the CT Foodshare pantries have experienced between a 50% and 100% increase in clients in the past couple of weeks. And as for the last couple of years, Jakubowski said, CT Foodshare has seen similar trends to what was identified in the survey.
“We’ve definitely seen food insecurity increase over the last couple of years,” Jakubowski said. “We’ve definitely seen it spike over the last couple of months, and obviously, even more so over the last couple of weeks.”
Nearly a quarter of residents surveyed who make less than $30,000 struggled to afford housing within the last 12 months. Affordable housing in Connecticut has been a heated topic of discussion after Gov. Ned Lamont vetoed House Bill 5002 during session. The bill would have pushed towns to reform their zoning laws, among other initiatives. 
Housing growth is slow in the state, but the passage of House Bill 8002 during the special legislative session, among other initiatives, expands fair rent commissions and incentivizes towns to begin creating more housing.
Changes to Medicaid and SNAP programs in CT
Major eligibility changes to SNAP and Medicaid under the Trump administration will leave thousands in Connecticut uninsured or with less money for food. DataHaven found that residents in the state are worried.  

The survey asked residents how worried they were about current governmental policies that could lead to residents struggling to afford food, housing and health insurance. These questions specifically referenced changes to Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act, changes to SNAP coverage and changes to subsidized housing or Section 8 programs.
When it comes to Medicaid, those in urban areas and rural towns are the most worried that more residents could lose health insurance coverage. Over half of the residents from both urban and rural areas were “very concerned” about adults and children losing health insurance coverage.
Burr is worried that a federal change not yet implemented, requiring the redetermination of eligibility every six months through a lengthly paperwork process, could also kick some people off Medicaid — especially those with cognitive impairments or mental health conditions. 
“Having the wherewithal to be able to provide all the information they’re looking for to be redetermined as eligible, it’s not a trivial thing,” Burr said. “And there will definitely be people who fall off the rolls who would otherwise be eligible, but they just can’t do the paperwork.”
And in terms of food insecurity, Jakubowski said, there is “definitely” an indirect effect between Medicaid cuts and the amount of people utilizing food pantries.
“People come to one of our pantries and people go to one of our mobile trucks, because they have to make a choice … do they pay for shelter, electricity, heat, medication, health care or food?” Jakubowski said. “And they say, ‘Well, food is the thing I can go without.'”
Despite the possible correlation between Medicaid benefits and food, residents in rural towns were less worried about SNAP benefits and affordable housing. Residents in urban towns, however, were most worried about all the cuts. 
But overall, an overwhelming majority of Connecticut residents are anticipating the loss of housing, food and health care benefits for many people throughout the state.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/2025_1105_SR_SNAPFoodPantries_112-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-20 11:58:09.848621

On a quiet Sunday morning in September, I came across a legal notice referencing a rezoning request for several large rural parcels. The notice didn’t say much, but someone online mentioned it was for a massive data center campus. 
I froze. 
I’ve been following news about data centers across the country all year and even other parts of Michigan. 
I never imagined one would come here.
I posted the notice in a local Facebook group, hoping a few neighbors might know more. Within hours, hundreds of comments poured in. People were scared, confused, and unexpectedly united. Howell is a town where people rarely agree on anything, and yet most of us were uniting against this. The conversations were robust and civil. 
Then they were gone. Deleted from Facebook. 
Residents who live near the site told me they had no idea about the proposal until a letter arrived in the mail or a neighbor knocked on their door. I emailed the township asking for more information just two days after the notice appeared. I didn’t receive the documents until November 4 (seven weeks later) and only after submitting a FOIA request costing hundreds of dollars. What the emails revealed wasn’t necessarily illegal, but it was deeply troubling.
While the community was left in the dark, key conversations had already happened with a small handful of people. By the time the public learned about the project, the rezoning and site plan were already moving full speed ahead.

The landowner seeking the rezoning had helped township officials plan the logistics of the public meeting, including recommending that it be livestreamed, and strategized about keeping people outside under tents and letting them in the building one at a time. 
Safety and accessibility were barely mentioned and glow sticks were offered as the solution to safety concerns about people walking down a dark, curving, busy road in the dark. The emails also mentioned that the local utility company was pressuring him to make sure the hearing didn’t get postponed.
Public meetings are supposed to belong to the public. They are not supposed to be co-designed by the private party asking for a special deal.
No matter where someone stands on a project, that should bother all of us.










Good, solid, well thought-out projects don’t need secrecy, non disclosure agreements (NDAs), or fear of public pushback. Only bad ones do.

And this situation isn’t unique to Howell Township. It’s happening across the state. Township halls in Pavilion, Augusta, Kalkaska, Dundee, Saline, and other communities have been filled beyond capacity with residents saying the same thing:
Slow down. Tell the truth. Respect our community.
Residents have good reason to be worried.
A single hyperscale data center can use as much electricity as 750,000-1,000,000 homes. Michigan’s utilities admit they’re being flooded with interest. Consumers Energy has received inquiries totaling 15 gigawatts of potential data center load; DTE another 7 gigawatts.
That’s 22 gigawatts – the equivalent of powering 16 million homes.
Independent experts estimate that even one 100-megawatt data center can require nearly $500 million in new power plants, battery farms, and grid upgrades.
If the company scales back or closes (as many tech projects have nationwide) those “stranded” costs don’t disappear. They get pushed onto all of us through higher electric bills.
And the water impacts are just as serious.
Data centers can use between one and five million gallons of water per day for cooling.
In Michigan, we like to think our freshwater supply is endless. It isn’t. The Alliance for the Great Lakes warns that heavy withdrawals and evaporating millions of gallons in cooling towers can stress aquifers, lower private wells, and affect nearby rivers.
Groundwater is connected. It doesn’t recognize property lines or promises in a rezoning packet.

Yet despite all these concerns, Howell Township residents were given just 14 days’ notice for the largest land-use proposal in recent county history. Planning commissioners didn’t receive much more than the public. One commissioner said he barely slept for two weeks trying to understand what was happening.
At the same time, the tech industry driving this boom is openly admitting it’s risky and unstable. Jeff Bezos has called the AI investment wave an “industrial bubble.” Mark Zuckerberg said he’d rather risk “misspending a couple hundred billion dollars” than fall behind. Even Michael Burry, the investor who correctly predicted the 2008 crash, has bet against major AI companies.
These billionaires see data centers as a gamble worth taking.
But for communities like Howell Township, the risks aren’t theoretical. We’re the ones staring down decades of construction, new power plants, battery farms, diesel generators, transmission lines, water withdrawals, noise, traffic, heat, and light. All this built to serve companies who may not be here in five years.
And when the bubble pops, they walk away.
As regulators plan for Michigan’s energy future, environmentalists speak out on data centers

We stay with the costs.
The good news is that when regular people stand together, it works, even across political lines.
Just across Lake Michigan in Caledonia, Wisconsin, residents pushed back on a proposed Microsoft data center, and even after receiving local approval, Microsoft abruptly withdrew citing “community feedback.” 
And in Port Washington and Menomonie, two more nearby communities, residents demanded transparency, and those projects ultimately stalled or paused.
The movement has become large enough that Microsoft now warns investors about “community opposition, local moratoriums, and hyper-local dissent.”
One of the largest corporations on Earth is telling Wall Street that ordinary people in small towns can stop billion-dollar deals.
That shouldn’t scare us. It should empower us!
Here in Howell Township, thousands of residents are calling for a six-month moratorium on data center approvals.
This is not a ban. This is not “anti-technology.” It is simply a pause and the only ethical path forward.
A pause gives the township time to:

update zoning and ordinances
get independent environmental and infrastructure reviews
understand water, energy, noise, and emergency impacts
create rules that protect residents-not developers

If a project is truly good for us, it will still be good after careful study. Good, solid, well thought-out projects don’t need secrecy, non disclosure agreements (NDAs), or fear of public pushback. Only bad ones do.
I love this community. I love the people in it. And I believe in fairness, freedom, and local control. That means decisions made in the open, with honest information. It doesn’t mean rushed deals pushed by trillion-dollar corporations and utility companies who do not live here.
Something big is happening in Livingston County. But we are not powerless.
We are stronger when we stand together.  And the power is, and always has been, with the people. Now is the time to use it. Show up to the meetings. Give a public comment. This is our home. Our water. Our future. We will decide what happens here.

It’s the second highest cost burden for most American households, just below housing. (Photo: Ronda Churchill/Nevada Current)Despite the government reopening, Americans are still suffering from the chaos of an administration that is out of touch with the needs of the people.
Though federal workers are back on the job and agencies are resuming their work, countless essential programs are stalled or at risk, costing all of us by failing to invest in the services we need, like health care, housing, and transit.
Reopening the government is not the same as restarting the economy — and if Congress and the White House want to turn relief into momentum, they need to put real investment behind one of the strongest engines of growth we have: public transportation.
Public transportation is one of the best economic investments a government can make. Every $1 billion invested in public transit creates and supports more than 50,000 jobs, according to the American Public Transportation Association.
Strong transit networks attract businesses, get people to their jobs, and revitalize downtowns. Cities like Denver, Dallas, and Seattle have already seen how modern transit systems can spur billions in investment around new rail lines and stations.
Transportation also lies at the heart of our affordability crisis. It’s the second highest cost burden for most American households, just below housing.
But instead of addressing this head on, the administration is reneging on its funding obligations for projects of all types and threatening to further deplete investments that would give us more affordable options to get around. Across the country, bus lines are being cut, subway systems are aging, and commuter rail projects are stalled because federal funding remains uncertain or insufficient.
Which is why it is so troubling that the Trump administration is threatening to take the unprecedented step of gutting federal transit funding altogether in the next funding fight.
While this move may have the politically motivated goal of impacting larger transit systems in cities like New York and Los Angeles, what the administration does not realize is that the communities that would suffer the most are those with transit agencies who rely the most heavily on federal funding:.
These include small urban and rural agencies like the ones you’ll find in Coeur d’Alene, Idaho, Flagstaff, Arizona, or Rocky Mount, North Carolina, where students rely on transit to get to class, warehouse workers rely on transit to get to work, and older adults rely on transit to remain independent and stay connected to their communities.
Washington’s next move should be clear: reject Trump’s plan to gut transit funding and pass a long-term, fully funded transit package.
That means investing in operating funding, supporting maintenance and modernization, and putting resources towards expansion, so that local and state partners aren’t left to carry the burden alone. The return on that investment isn’t abstract — it’s faster commutes, stronger local economies, and cleaner air.
But this will require political will from our leaders. It means resisting the easy allure of short-term fixes like formula funding for highway expansion and narrow discretionary grants for transit, and instead delivering the long-term funding for the infrastructure that makes cities thrive.
Federal and state governments must prioritize sustained, predictable funding for local transit agencies. At the local level, cities should redesign streets for buses, bikes, and pedestrians — not just cars.
The government is open again. Good. Now let’s keep the country moving — literally.
A nation that invests in its people’s ability to move freely and affordably is a nation that’s investing in its own growth. And we need that more than ever.
